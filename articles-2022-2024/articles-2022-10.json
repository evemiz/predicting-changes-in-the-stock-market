            "content": "Despite an election pledge by Joe Biden to not \u201ccheck [America\u2019s] values at the door\u201d when it comes to arms sales, the US has increased, not decreased, its weapons sales around the world, including to countries with repressive regimes, a new report reveals. According to the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a Washington-based thinktank, most of the sales also involve just four companies: Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon and General Dynamics. The four were involved in 58% all the major offers made since the Biden administration took office. \u201cThe concentrated lobbying power of these companies \u2013 including a \u201crevolving door\u201d from the Pentagon\u2019s arms sales agency and the leveraging of weapons export-related jobs into political influence \u2013 has been brought to bear in efforts to expand US weapons exports to as many foreign clients as possible, often by helping to exaggerate threats,\u201d said the report, released on Thursday. US arms offers did drop sharply in the first year of the Biden administration, from $110.9bn in the last year of the Donald Trump administration to just $36bn. The report suggests the decrease could be partly due to a \u201cless aggressive approach\u201d to arms sales promotion but was more likely the result of market saturation, caused by a large volume of deals concluded during the presidencies of Barack Obama and Trump. As of October, annual arms offers have increased to $65bn, partly due to increased sales to Europe and Asia \u2013 \u201ctied to the Pentagon\u2019s focus on \u2018great power competition\u2019 with Russia and China\u201d. \u201cCurrent US arms policy and practice too often fuel war rather than deterring it. Roughly two-thirds of current conflicts \u2013 34 out of 46 \u2013 involve one or more parties armed by the United States,\u201d the report said. \u201cOf the US-supplied nations at war, 16 received $50m or more worth of US arms between 2017 and 2021. This contradicts the longstanding argument that US arms routinely promote stability and deter conflict,\u201d it added. Indonesia ranks first in the top recipient of US arms deals as of September, with $13.9bn in offers, according to the report. Greece and Germany come in next at $10.2bn and $10.1bn. Between Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates - the bottom three recipients \u2013 total offers between $3.4bn and $4.7bn have been made from January 2021 to September this year. Lockheed Martin had the largest share of involvement in major deals. The weapons it produces are the main component of deals worth $25.8bn since February 2021, the report said. Boeing came in second, with arms deals at $22.65bn, followed by General Dynamics at $7.7bn since February 2021, including a $6bn offer of M-1 tanks to Poland and a share of a $1.7bn worth of heavy armored vehicles to Australia. Raytheon ranked fourth, involved in deals worth $4.7bn. \u201cThe biggest payoffs for major contractors come from sales of combat aircraft, followed by missile defense systems,\u201d the report said. In 2021, the arms industry employed 766 lobbyists \u2013 \u201cfar more than one for every member of Congress\u201d, the report found. \u201cArms exporters and the US government routinely cite job creation as a reason to sell weapons to foreign clients. But the number of jobs associated with arms sales is greatly exaggerated \u2026 Spending on weapons produces 40 percent fewer jobs than spending on infrastructure or green energy, and 100 percent fewer jobs than spending on education,\u201d it said. The thinktank recommended a number of policy measures including restricting the revolving door between government and industry in attempts to weaken the control that weapons manufacturers have over arms-transfer decision-making. The report also called on Congress to revise the Arms Export Control Act to require an affirmative congressional vote on major deals, instead of the current system that simply requires a veto-proof majority to block any arms deal. And it urged the Biden administration to provide greater transparency on the delivery and use of US arms."

            "date": "2022-10-11T11:00:03Z",
            "content": "Almost a year to the day after thousands of insurrectionists stormed the US Capitol, Jim Womack braved a winter storm to travel to Virginia, bound for a conference on \u201celection integrity\u201d. The conference aimed to teach people how to legally challenge election administration \u2013 giving a veneer of legitimacy to a mission built on conspiratorial beliefs about the 2020 election. \u201cThe central message was that we have problems with our elections around the country,\u201d said Womack, the GOP chair for Lee county, a rural swath of central North Carolina. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not the same in every state, or even in every jurisdiction within the state.\u201d Womack and participants from seven other swing states were brought together by Cleta Mitchell, a conservative lawyer from Oklahoma and now registered voter in Southern Pines, North Carolina, who was part of Donald Trump\u2019s legal team as he tried to overturn the 2020 election. The event was meant to kick off a new nationwide strategy to monitor \u201celection integrity\u201d at the state and local level, said Womack, who now runs the North Carolina Election Integrity Team (NCEIT). So far, the group\u2019s efforts have included organizing opposition through public comments to recommendations from elections officials, lobbying legislators and the lieutenant governor to block those recommendations, filing record requests about the 2020 election, training poll observers, and creating a system to internally report perceived election problems that they will then use for election protests, voter challenges and referrals to prosecutors. \u201cWe\u2019re not conspiracy theorists, and we\u2019re not suggesting that the election was stolen or that there was any one particular lane of election integrity that is subjected to widespread voter fraud around the country,\u201d Womack said. But it\u2019s clear that North Carolina is only one piece of the national movement. Several public opinion polls from the first half of 2022 show roughly 70% of registered Republicans believe there is widespread voter fraud despite no evidence to support the claim. Swing states Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin, which each had representatives at the January event, now have statewide groups, Womack said. And organizations in several other states, including Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada and New Mexico, have joined the project. *** \u201cElection integrity\u201d efforts date back to the post-Reconstruction era, when segregationists aimed to take back racially integrated southern governments by casting doubt on the legitimacy of Black votes, said Francesca Tripodi, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina who studies how information is manipulated for political gain. While the tactics are old, the former federal election assistance commissioner and head of election security in the Department of Homeland Security Matt Masterson says the resources conservative groups are putting into the efforts are new. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a bit of energy and quite a bit of money behind organizing these types of efforts in order to accomplish the goal of having these observers challenge or interrupt the process,\u201d Masterson said. Mitchell leads the Conservative Partnership Institute\u2019s (CPI) Election Integrity Network, where the former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows is also a senior partner. As a legal adviser to Trump, she was on the infamous call when the president asked Georgia\u2019s lead elections official to find enough votes to flip the state. Mitchell repeated debunked theories about illegal votes, which Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, and his office\u2019s general counsel, Ryan Germany, rebuffed. In connection with her efforts to overturn the 2020 election, Fulton county\u2019s district attorney subpoenaed Mitchell to testify, and the US House January 6 committee has subpoenaed her phone and communication records. Even so, Mitchell is focused on orchestrating the election integrity mission through operators such as Womack. \u201cI point to North Carolina, and I say to everybody, \u2018Be like North Carolina. Be like Jim Womack,\u2019\u201d Mitchell said in her podcast. Womack presents NCEIT as a non-partisan effort, but the group\u2019s members are predominantly conservative, and several are in GOP county leadership. Womack said he consults with Hans von Spakovsky, a lawyer with the conservative Heritage Foundation thinktank, and J Christian Adams, the founder and lead lawyer for the Public Interest Legal Fund, on \u201ccleaning up\u201d voter rolls. Both men have a long history of rightwing activism and both served on Trump\u2019s \u201celection integrity\u201d commission. Josh Findlay, the RNC\u2019s national election integrity director, attended NCEIT\u2019s kick-off summit with the Conservative Partnership Institute on 11 June in Raleigh. A document on the NCEIT website lists the RNC attorney Kevin Cline as \u201clegal advisor\u201d on the list maintenance team. Dave Warren, who is the RNC\u2019s North Carolina election integrity director, has attended several NCEIT calls and gave updates about the RNC and state GOP\u2019s latest actions. \u201cThe RNC\u2019s efforts are independent from any outside organization,\u201d an RNC spokesperson, Emma Vaughn, wrote in response to questions. But Womack says RNC members attend summits and participate in weekly calls. \u201cThe RNC reps message me almost daily, and we will collaborate multiple times daily during the voting period,\u201d he wrote in an email. *** Womack said he was hesitant when Mitchell first asked him to lead the group\u2019s North Carolina effort. He told Mitchell he\u2019d commit to starting a statewide organization if he could generate excitement at a February meeting in Winston-Salem. Roughly 100 people showed up. Womack, who sees this work as a \u201cnoble purpose and cause\u201d, was a Republican commissioner for Lee county from 2010 to 2014, and has been the county GOP chairman since. He also leads the Conservative Coalition of North Carolina Pac, which supports Trump and far-right Republican candidates. When NCEIT held its first big event in June, a joint summit with the Conservative Partnership Institute in Raleigh, approximately 300 people showed up. They now have 25 \u201cactive county taskforces\u201d, Womack said, and about 750 members from 90 of the state\u2019s 100 counties. Womack said they had trained more than 1,200 poll observers through both in-person and online sessions and \u201cvetted\u201d more than 150 people who now have access to NCEIT\u2019s statewide incident reporting system. The reports can be used to protest against elections, push prosecutors to investigate allegations of illegal conduct, and to advocate for legislative changes, Womack said. The group has a lot of ground to cover. Across North Carolina, there are 2,500 polling places open on election day and roughly 500 early voting sites. While their actions are legal, there is still concern among election officials. \u201cSomething that is legal can become, you know, distracting or even harassing,\u201d Masterson said. The Lee county board of elections director, Jane Rae Fawcett, encountered such an incident in the May primary when a poll worker complained that Womack, acting as an election observer, was standing too close to the registration table, according to an incident report. Fawcett suggested more space between Womack and the worker, and asked the worker to speak louder. \u201cI don\u2019t think that he thought that that was something that maybe I should be suggesting, because it wasn\u2019t in the law,\u201d Fawcett said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s not in the law.\u201d *** NCEIT\u2019s members include people who have existed on the conspiratorial fringe of election integrity efforts in North Carolina for years. Jay DeLancy, a Lee county resident who retired from the air force and has been an election integrity advocate since 2011, is the group\u2019s chief operating officer. In 2016, volunteers for DeLancy\u2019s organization, Voter Integrity Project, sent hundreds of postcards to voters in Cumberland and Moore counties. When many were returned as undeliverable, the group pointed to that as evidence the voters were no longer at the address, and convinced county boards of elections to remove them from the rolls. A federal judge found the process violated federal law. In 2018, the judge blocked the part of North Carolina\u2019s law allowing the state to remove voters based on challenges without also following the federal waiting period or conducting individualized inquiry into the voter\u2019s status. That ruling, along with disclosure requirements if challengers are coordinating with an attorney, means NCEIT members will have a more difficult time removing voters from the rolls. One of DeLancy\u2019s other missions is ending same-day voter registration, hailed as a voting rights victory when adopted in 2007, which allowed more than 114,000 North Carolinians to cast ballots in 2020. Voters have to verify their identity and current address to vote same-day. DeLancy says the process opens the door for voter fraud, despite having no such evidence. \u201cIs there enough fraud to alter the outcome of the election? Yeah,\u201d DeLancy said in an interview. \u201cCan I prove it? Not unless you give me the resources. Not unless you give me some badges to go ask some hard questions to people and that kind of thing. So it\u2019s hard to prove without the government having the desire to prove it. And this is my problem.\u201d NCEIT is also raising baseless claims about the Electronic Registration Information Center (Eric), a bipartisan non-profit group that helps states manage their voter rolls. North Carolina\u2019s state board of elections has legislative approval to temporarily join the center, but the Harnett county GOP chair, Jesse Burger, claimed on the group\u2019s 2 August call that Eric is a tool for Democrats. \u201cThe level of sophistication that they have, from what I\u2019ve gathered, is that they go all the way to the point of identifying what you\u2019re into, what\u2019s your age range and all of this other stuff, and within 24 hours, there is a person of that exact same demographic showing up at your doorstep convincing you to vote Democrat,\u201d Burger told attendees. Womack and DeLancy supported this conspiracy theory on the same call. But Eric does not share its data with political parties for get-out-the-vote efforts. Rather, it provides an \u201celigible but unregistered report\u201d and requires states to contact at least 95% of such possible voters with information about how to register to vote. This is done by the state agency and not a political party and does not target voters of any socioeconomic, political or racial background. DeLancy described Eric\u2019s requirement to contact eligible but unregistered voters as \u201cputting your finger on the scale with low-information voters who use state resources\u201d. Womack said it targeted \u201clow-income, government-dependent people for the most part that are predisposed to vote to the left.\u201d Womack said via email that \u201cquestions and unvalidated comments are often expressed\u201d on their weekly calls. \u201cWhen they are expressed as \u2018facts\u2019 we will intercede,\u201d he said. *** Corinne Duncan juggles scores of logistical hurdles as Buncombe county\u2019s elections director. Since the 2020 election, her to-do list has only expanded. \u201cPublic records requests have increased drastically. I mean I get one at least every day,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we get a lot [of requests] that are these coordinated efforts. They\u2019re just cut and paste.\u201d Officials say they\u2019ve seen a pattern emerge in recent months. Participants send letters to local boards of elections, including demands to retain records for the 2020 election beyond the 22 months federal law requires, and for records state law doesn\u2019t allow boards to disclose, like old ballots or \u201ccast vote records\u201d, a digital representation of ballot selections that a voting machine counts. Womack and other NCEIT members sent some of those letters. Karen Brinson-Bell, director of North Carolina\u2019s state board of elections, equated the mass records requests to a \u201cdenial of service\u201d attack, when computer programs send an overwhelming amount of fake traffic to websites in order to shut them down for regular users. Pat Gannon, spokesperson for the North Carolina state board of elections, said the more time elections staff spend trying to respond to these requests, the less they are able to prepare for the upcoming election. Masterson, who has helped run state and federal elections since 2006, said he had never seen such an organized and well-backed intervention effort nationally. Flooding voting sites with observers can strain the system, a strategy pulled from the Virginia Fair Elections playbook, which Mitchell and the Conservative Partnership Institute developed in 2021 for the state\u2019s gubernatorial elections. Scott Konopasek, the former registrar of elections for Fairfax county, Virginia, said Virginia Fair Elections members pressured his office and his staff. He\u2019s been trying to raise alarms about the \u201cVirginia model\u201d ever since, including in testimony to the Senate judiciary committee. \u201cThey would push acceptable behavior right to the edge in terms of civility and asking questions, which started to make my staff really kind of nervous and uncomfortable and threatened,\u201d said Konopasek. Karen Hebb, elections director for Henderson county, said the county\u2019s 35 precincts had a \u201chuge uptick\u201d in poll observers in 2022. \u201cThey asked for access to our voting equipment. They asked to be present when we did things in the office that we had never had them request before,\u201d she said, referring to the May primary elections. \u201cWe were told that they were looking for fraud. We kept insisting there is nothing here to find.\u201d Brunswick county\u2019s board of elections director, Sara LaVere, also reported an increase in interest in poll observation. LaVere and her staff had to spend more time training precinct officials about what observers can and cannot do. The state board of elections unanimously passed temporary rules this August, updating guidance on acceptable behavior for poll workers and partisan election observers, to \u201censure that voting is conducted in an orderly fashion this fall, and that no voters experience intimidation\u201d, chairman Damon Circosta said in a statement. But Womack submitted comments to the board on behalf of NCEIT expressing its opposition. The rules then needed approval from the rules review commission, a 10-member panel that Republican legislative leaders nominated and lawmakers approved. Mitchell joined NCEIT members to state opposition during public comments at the commission meeting reviewing the rules. The RNC and state GOP also opposed the rule changes. The commission rejected the rule changes, and the state board declined to appeal the decision. Womack said he and his group were now gearing up ahead of the election by creating a \u201csuspicious voters list\u201d of anyone they believe to be double-registered or not a citizen, and asking members in every county to use it to challenge voters on sight. Challenges could force a number of voters to cast provisional ballots, and put the voter\u2019s eligibility to cast a ballot up to a decision by the county board of elections. State law prohibits anyone, including poll observers, from knowingly making a false affidavit or falsely affirming information in a voter challenge. Reporting possible discrepancies or problems is a common practice of political parties, but purportedly non-partisan groups doing so on the spot is new. These efforts, however, create further distrust in the process and give legislators talking points to help pass more restrictive election laws. After Trump generated fears of fraud through by-mail voting in 2020, North Carolina Republicans passed a law that Cooper vetoed cutting short the ballot return date. After rightwing groups protested about counties\u2019 use of funds from non-profits like the Center for Tech and Civic Life and the Center for Election Innovation and Research (but, oddly, not the Schwarzenegger Institute) to help run elections during the pandemic, the legislature passed a law preventing it. Cooper vetoed that one, too. And since 2013, North Carolina Republicans have claimed that photo voter ID is necessary to combat widespread voter fraud, only to have their attempts blocked in state and federal courts for being racially discriminatory. While courts have blocked some attempts to intervene in North Carolina elections, Womack\u2019s group is openly doubling down on its efforts just weeks before the midterm elections. On weekly calls, NCEIT has discussed using voter caging, a highly inaccurate method of using undeliverable mail bounce-backs as evidence that voters don\u2019t live at their listed addresses, and using door-to-door voter canvassing of \u201cvoters and addresses where apparent improper voting may have occurred\u201d to challenge rolls, according to its website. NCEIT\u2019s discussion pages make false assertions that some counties have more registered voters than eligible voters, or that the state registration system doesn\u2019t check for duplicates. Several allegations stem from the group identifying data entry errors in the voter registration lists \u2013 for example, when a person\u2019s birthdate is entered into the name field by accident. These errors occur in the dozens out of millions of voter records, according to Gannon, and are routinely audited and fixed. The state board of elections fact-checked more than a dozen of NCEIT\u2019s claims made on the members-only section of the website, deeming many of them partially or entirely untrue. In response to one claim that elections officials rig post-election audits, Gannon wrote that the claim is false and \u201cit is premised on a conspiracy theory that county election workers are dishonest people somehow trying to defraud the voters. This is offensive, and this claim is nonsense.\u201d Nearly half of North Carolina\u2019s county elections directors have resigned or retired since January 2019, something DeLancy says creates a moment of opportunity. \u201cThere\u2019s openings at the bottom for people like you to get in there and get a job,\u201d DeLancy told NCEIT members on an early August call. \u201cWe have to take this over. It\u2019s not something you do overnight.\u201d This story was published in partnership with the Assembly and the Guardian, with financial support from the Fund for Investigative Journalism.

            "title": "The Guardian view on Brazil\u2019s election: Bolsonaro\u2019s return would cost us all | Editorial",
            "date": "2022-10-27T17:41:49Z",
            "content": "On Sunday, Brazilian electors will cast their vote in a tight contest that will not only set the course for this extraordinarily polarised country but also have a powerful impact on the future of the world. Hopes that the far-right incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, would be decisively rejected in the first round were dashed when he fared far better than expected, with 43% of votes, and his challenger, the former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, fell just short of an outright majority with 48%. Eleventh-hour handouts to the poorest and lavish quantities of disinformation have aided Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s recovery. The hope is that his momentum is already fading. But the polls vary, and a second presidential term would be bad news not just for Brazilians but also the rest of us. The primary danger is climate catastrophe. As the UN\u2019s environment agency warns that there is no credible route to limit global warming to 1.5C, deforestation in the Amazon is at a high: a carbon sink could become a carbon emitter. Criminal syndicates of loggers and ranchers race to do their worst for fear that a new administration will rein them in. More than 2bn trees have been felled during Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s term in office. He has also fostered an increasingly dangerous culture for environmental defenders \u2013 as exposed by the murder of the activist Bruno Pereira and the Guardian contributor Dom Phillips this June. In contrast, analysts suggest a victory for Lula could see an 89% cut in rainforest loss. A secondary \u2013 but still deeply alarming \u2013 risk is of a further entrenchment of anti-democratic authoritarianism. If Mr Bolsonaro is re-elected, he will be emboldened, and will benefit from the strengthened rightwing presence in Congress. There are fears that he could undermine institutions and change the constitution to allow himself a third term. If he isn\u2019t re-elected, will he care? He has spent months preparing for such an outcome. His son already claims \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that his father is the victim of \u201cthe greatest electoral fraud ever seen\u201d, an eerily Trumpian phrase. His party claims \u2013 again without evidence \u2013 that officials could simply alter results. Because pro-Lula regions are likely to declare results later, he might attempt to claim victory prematurely. All this raises the spectre of Brazil\u2019s own January 6 \u2013 possibly with some support from elements of the army and security forces in a country that experienced military dictatorship relatively recently. Many of Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters have made it clear that they will not recognise a defeat at the polls. Gun ownership has doubled thanks to his relaxation of laws. Last Sunday, one of his political allies attacked police with hand grenades and a rifle as they tried to arrest him. To Lula\u2019s supporters, the former shoeshine boy and trade unionist is the champion of the poor, as well as a leader who raised the country\u2019s status internationally. Others note that it was easier for him to boost spending as the beneficiary of the commodities boom. His Workers\u2019 party was rife with corruption, which saw him jailed too; he was only able to stand when the charges against him were quashed last year. Yet Mr Bolsonaro is dishing out billions from a government fund with minimal oversight, and there are plenty of questions over his own family\u2019s finances. This looks, as one polling expert puts it, like a clash of two Brazils, in which the vote splits clearly on class, race, gender and religious lines. Even if Mr Bolsonaro is seen off this time, he may well be back. Yet his extremism has helped ensure that Lula has pulled together a convincing multi-party alliance, including figures from the right. They recognise what is at stake. The rest of us must hope that enough of their compatriots do."

            "date": "2022-10-27T10:00:27Z",
            "content": "Inside the office of the Shasta county clerk and registrar of voters, which runs elections for about 111,000 people in this part of far northern California, Cathy Darling Allen can see all the security improvements she would make if she had the budget. \u201cWe have plexi on the counter downstairs for Covid but that won\u2019t stop a person. It\u2019s literally just clamped to the counters,\u201d the county clerk and registrar said. For about $50,000, the office could secure the front, limiting access to upstairs offices, she estimated. Another county put bulletproof glass in their lobby years earlier, she knew, something officials there at one point considered removing, though not any more. Elections offices didn\u2019t used to think about security in this way, Allen said. Now they can\u2019t afford not to. Following Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to acknowledge his defeat in the 2020 presidential election, Allen says the once low-profile job of non-partisan local election official has transformed in counties like hers. A culture of misinformation has sown doubt in the US election system and subjected officials from Nevada to Michigan to harassment and threats. The FBI has received more than 1,000 reports of threats against election workers in the past year alone. In California, officials in small, rural and underresourced counties such as Shasta say they are encountering hostility and aggressive bullying from residents who believe there is widespread voter fraud \u2013 many are inundating local elections offices with public records requests as part of a relentless quest to try to prove their claims. Residents in Shasta county have tried to intimidate election workers while acting as observers, crowding around Allen during a tense election night confrontation in June, and visiting voters\u2019 homes while claiming to be a part of an \u201cofficial taskforce\u201d. In north-eastern California\u2019s Nevada county, the registrar-elect had to take out a restraining order against residents who harassed her and pushed their way into her office, assaulting a staffer, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really an unprecedented time,\u201d said Kim Alexander, the president of the non-partisan California Voter Foundation, a non-profit organization that works on improving election processes. \u201cA colleague recently referred to it as a sort of madness that\u2019s taken hold.\u201d \u2018This is our Tiananmen Square\u2019 On a Tuesday in September, speaker after speaker went before the Shasta county board of supervisors decrying the \u201celection fraud\u201d they believed \u2013 without evidence \u2013 is taking place. Dressed in red, white and blue, the residents described their effort as a David-and-Goliath-like battle. \u201cIt\u2019s called a citizen\u2019s audit and we\u2019ve been going out and collecting the evidence that shows there is fraud in our process,\u201d one speaker said. \u201cThis is our Tiananmen Square. We\u2019re going to stand in front of the tanks and say no more to the machines.\u201d The group of residents casting doubt over Shasta\u2019s elections is small but highly visible, and speaks regularly at county board meetings. They have filed dozens of public records requests to Allen\u2019s office, showed up in large numbers for election observation, and even visited the homes of certain voters while wearing gear labeled \u201cofficial voter taskforce\u201d \u2013 an act that Allen said may amount to voter intimidation. Their opposition comes amid broader political upheaval in this rural northern county, stemming from anger among some residents over Trump\u2019s loss and pandemic restrictions and vaccine mandates imposed by California\u2019s progressive government. The anger coalesced into an anti-establishment movement, backed with unprecedented outside funding from a Connecticut millionaire and supported by the area\u2019s militia groups, that led to the recall of a longtime county supervisor in February. Behavior seen during that election prompted Allen\u2019s office to make security changes, including tracking everyone who enters the facility. During the primaries in June, when the school superintendent, district attorney and sheriff were on the ballot, a crowd of observers tried to intimidate county staff, Allen said, and someone installed a trail camera outside the office, seemingly intending to monitor election workers. The sheriff stationed deputies outside the office. After four of the candidates backed by the anti-establishment group lost outright \u2013 Allen beat her opponent and was re-elected to her fifth-term \u2013 the candidates requested a hand recount. The county\u2019s use of Dominion voting machines, which Trump supporters have maligned as part of a false conspiracy theory that the company played a role in swinging the 2020 election for Biden, has drawn particular concern from residents who believe in widespread election fraud. Some of them have attempted to share content with Allen, such as 2000 Mules, a debunked documentary that has promoted false claims about voter fraud. One high-profile figure in the election denial movement recently held a $20 event at a church in the area. The grandstanding from people making money from spreading debunked narratives around elections is particularly frustrating for Allen. If there are problems around elections, she said, she would rely on the actual experts she knows who have worked in the field for decades and share information for free: \u201cI guarantee you, they\u2019re not gonna charge people 20 bucks a head at a church in Redding, California, to tell the story. That\u2019s making you a dollar, that\u2019s not trying to make anything better.\u201d Allen\u2019s office has seen aggressive behavior and bullying, she said, but no threats yet. Given the threats elections officials across the US are facing, she suspects it\u2019s only a matter of time. \u201cThis is not what anybody signed up for,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had people tell me I should have private security. It\u2019s not right. But it\u2019s the world we live in right now.\u201d \u2018Just another form of harassment\u2019 About 150 miles away in the Sierra Nevada foothills in eastern California, Natalie Adona said her office, too, was experiencing the same challenges: \u201cIf it\u2019s happening in Shasta, chances are it\u2019s also happening here. The loudest would-be disruptors of elections share information between our counties.\u201d Political tensions in Nevada county, which is home to about 100,000 people in historic towns and settlements that were at the center of California\u2019s Gold Rush, have been rising since after the 2020 election, said Adona, the assistant county clerk recorder. Earlier this year a group of residents attempted an aggressive and ultimately unsuccessful campaign to recall the entire board of supervisors, accusing them of enabling \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d for supporting Covid safety measures. While running for her position this spring, Adona said she and her office were subjected to a months-long public harassment campaign, as well as racist language in an election mailer that featured a darkened photo of her and efforts to disqualify her over false claims that she failed to pay filing fees. After Adona won by nearly 70%, opponents requested a recount. \u201cI considered it to be just another form of harassment and I think one of the other purposes was to try to get at other documents that aren\u2019t normally [obtainable] in the regular observation process,\u201d she said. At the same time, her office has received a flurry of public records requests in recent months that appear to be copy-and-pasted, Adona said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re today is either deliberate attempts to put a kink in elections process or just sort of an inundation of requests that really reflect how little the requestor knows about elections.\u201d Adona has also received one threat, she said, which was not actionable by law enforcement. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not at the level of Georgia or Wisconsin. I do feel fortunate but at the same time a lot of it is unnerving,\u201d she said. The Nevada county office has increased its budget for security at its headquarters and is working more closely with law enforcement. \u201cI have the best job in the world. I get to serve voters, I get to serve the public but over the last few years election administration has become harder,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s raised a lot of questions for my team about how we keep in-person election workers safe, how do we keep our staff safe and at the same time offer the same levels of transparency in elections the public deserves.\u201d \u2018We haven\u2019t had a break in about five years\u2019 Across the US the climate has grown so tense that one in five election workers has said they are unlikely to remain in their positions through the next presidential election, according to a survey conducted by the Brennan Center for Justice. About one in six say they have been personally threatened. Throughout California, small but vocal groups inspired by uninformed or malevolent actors, have been led to believe false narratives about how the state conducts elections, Alexander, of the California Voter Foundation, said, prompting the organization to make the safety of election workers increasingly a focus. The group, along with the Brennan Center, recently sponsored legislation signed into law by the California governor that allows workers to keep their home addresses confidential. \u201cI never imagined when I started working on elections security almost 30 years ago that it would include the physical security of people who run our elections,\u201d Alexander said. But things have changed rapidly, she said. Her organization is trying to support election officials by providing de-escalation training and other resources to their offices. More help is needed, and has been for a long time. \u201cThe chronic underfunding of election administration in the US is one of the conditions that led to the vulnerability of our election workers. If the offices weren\u2019t understaffed and underresourced in the first place they would have more security,\u201d she said. California election offices were already challenged by back-to-back elections for the last few years, including 2021\u2019s recall election of the governor. Months after that, Shasta county had its local recall election. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a break in about five years,\u201d said Allen, who is also on the board of directors for the California Voter Foundation. \u201cNone of my staff has been able to really disconnect \u2013 not for any length of time. I can\u2019t even go to the top of Mount Lassen, where I know no one can get a hold of me.\u201d In the past, demystifying the election process with guided tours of the office and a walk-through of their procedures helped allay people\u2019s fears, Allen said. This year, the office is attempting to fight against the tide of misinformation and disinformation with a steady trickle of good information publicized by her office through social media and webinars, she said, attempting to reach the voters they can. The county recently hired someone to work on voter education and outreach. But as misinformation proliferates, there\u2019s a growing contingency of people who won\u2019t believe any message coming out of the office, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to dissuade people from a belief that they have swallowed wholesale like it\u2019s a religion,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll still try.\u201d Still, Allen remains hopeful things will get better. On a table in her office is a stack of thank you cards from residents expressing gratitude for her office\u2019s work. She won re-election by a massive margin. \u201cIn June, all the folks who believe in some of this bad information about election fraud and elections being stolen \u2013 six of those folks ran for office in June\u2019s election \u2013 and none of them won. Not one of them,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s the story: the voters of Shasta county saw through that.\u201d As far as the national challenges for election workers, \u201cthis too shall pass,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI do think it\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better \u2013 but it will get better,\u201d she said."

            "title": "US prices rise in September as midterm elections loom",
            "date": "2022-10-13T15:24:00Z",
            "content": "The cost of goods and services in the US continued to go up in September, and though the rate of price increases is starting to temper, high inflation persists as the midterm elections in November approach. The consumer price index (CPI), released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed on Thursday that prices in September were 8.2% higher compared to prices in September 2021. The figure is another decline in the inflation rate seen during the three months since June, when the rate peaked at 9.1%, the highest in more than 40 years. Although the inflation rate has been coming down, its pace has slowed. July and August saw rates of 8.5% and 8.3%, meaning the rate has budged just 0.3% over the last two months. The core inflation rate, which excludes the volatile energy and food sectors, was 6.6% over 12 months, the highest increase since 1982. While the overall inflation rate looks at the increase in prices over a 12-month period, the cost of goods and services has been increasing on a month-by-month basis. Prices in September rose 0.4% compared with prices in August, which itself saw a 0.1% increase compared to July. Housing and food were the top contributors to this monthly outlook. In both August and September, the price of shelter rose 0.7% while the cost of food rose 0.8%. The stabilization of overall inflation can contribute to lowering gas prices. The national average per gallon of regular gas is $3.91, according to AAA, compared with over $5 a gallon in June. The price of gas saw a 4.9% drop in September compared with August. The price of used cars and trucks, once a driver of the increasing inflation rate, is also falling, decreasing 1.1% in September compared to August. The stubbornness of the inflation rate will probably bolster Federal Reserve officials to continue their hawkish increases of interest rates. Last month, the central bank increased rates by 0.75 of a percentage point, bringing the rate up to 3% to 3.25%, making mortgages, loans and credit card debt more expensive for Americans. The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has indicated further increases to interest rates are likely as inflation remains high. According to the minutes of their September meeting, released on Wednesday, Federal Reserve officials, including Powell, agreed that inflation \u201cremained unacceptably high\u201d and that prices were coming down more slowly than officials had expected. A further increase in the interest rate could come as soon as early November, when the Fed\u2019s board will have its next meeting. At their September meeting, officials discussed a list of factors that would probably keep inflation high, including \u201clabor tensions, a new round of global energy price increases, further disruptions in supply chains and a larger-than-expected pass-through of wage increases into price increases\u201d. \u201cWe have to get inflation behind us. I wish there was a painless way to do that,\u201d Powell said when the Fed increased interest rates in September. \u201cThere isn\u2019t.\u201d Thursday\u2019s report confirms that the Democrats\u2019 battle to keep their House and Senate majorities during next month\u2019s midterm elections will probably be a referendum on inflation. Multiple polls have shown that voters\u2019 top concern heading into the election is the economy. Democrats have spent the last few weeks trying to promote their efforts to improve the economy like their passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in August that included investments in climate initiatives and provisions to lower the cost of healthcare. Joe Biden has taken to pointing to low unemployment, which stood at 3.5% in September, as a sign of a strong labor market in the face of rising prices. On Thursday, in a statement that noted inflation was his \u201ctop priority\u201d, the president said: \u201cBecause of my economic plan, the United States is in a stronger position than any major economy to take on this challenge. My policies \u2013 that Democrats delivered \u2013 directly tackles price pressures we saw in today\u2019s report, like healthcare.\u201d Republicans have continued to use inflation as their main talking line to voters, claiming that irresponsible spending from the Democrats has led to higher prices. \u201cThanks to extremists in Washington and their reckless spending, inflation is at a 40-year high,\u201d Mehmet Oz, the celebrity doctor running for US Senate in Pennsylvania, tweeted on Thursday. \u201cPennsylvania families can\u2019t afford [the Democrat] John Fetterman in the Senate.\u201d Countries around the world have been seeing record inflation in the midst of the recovery from the Covid pandemic. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund told central banks to \u201cstay the course\u201d in the fight against inflation despite concerns over a global recession, saying the \u201cworst was yet to come\u201d as price pressures continue."

            "content": "A bank robber, a gunrunner and a weed smuggler sat down in a square, surrounded by rifle-toting bodyguards and locked in passionate debate over their country\u2019s political future. \u201cLife\u2019s been easier under Bolsonaro. It\u2019s easier to get guns. It\u2019s easier to get ammunition,\u201d admitted the gun trafficker as he and his clique pondered the battle for power between Brazil\u2019s far-right president and his challenger, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. \u201cBut the one who governed for the poor was Lula,\u201d he said of the leftist former president whose social programs helped millions escape poverty. \u201cFor me and my family, Bolsonaro\u2019s better. But what about my roots? What about the kids around here?\u201d he asked, pointing to the deprived favela around him. \u201cBolsonaro\u2019s the rich man\u2019s president, blud,\u201d the gunrunner summarised. \u201cHe\u2019s the madman\u2019s president,\u201d said another participant. Yet not all the debating gangsters agreed. \u201cThese guys are barmy,\u201d vented a dreadlocked bagman who voted for Bolsonaro in the election\u2019s recent first round, which Lula won with 48% of the vote against 43% for Bolsonaro. \u201cLula\u2019s a scumbag \u2013 a SCUMBAG,\u201d the 37-year-old crook proclaimed, denouncing the huge corruption scandals that scarred the 14 years during which Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 party (PT) governed. All criminal charges against the former presidents have been quashed. \u201cWhy does he want to return to power? Because he wants to carry on sucking on the country\u2019s teats.\u201d The criminals\u2019 conflicting opinions were a microcosm of a far broader fissure within Brazilian society as the South American country approaches its most discordant election in decades. The stark choice between Lula and Bolsonaro has fractured families, friendship circles, workplaces and church congregations, with Lulistas convinced Bolsonaro is a hate-filled authoritarian extremist and Bolsonaristas calling Lula a corrupt communist thief. \u201cWe are experiencing a state of utter division,\u201d said Felipe Nunes, the head of the polling group Quaest, whose research suggests 50% of voters think Bolsonaro deserves a second chance and about the same number think Lula does. The number of voters afraid of a third Lula term was only slighter less than the number afraid of Bolsonaro returning to power. Nunes said the 2022 election is \u201cfar more than simply a contest between two people\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a battle between two worldviews \u2026 and this is unique in Brazilian history \u2013 we\u2019ve never had an election like it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe country is divided.\u201d Even Rio\u2019s gangsters are split over the best result for their country \u2013 not to mention their illegal trade. The gunrunner said that when it came to the latter, Bolsonaro was the better choice. The president\u2019s relaxing of gun controls for hunters, marksmen and collectors \u2013 known in Brazil as \u201cCACs\u201d \u2013 had made acquiring high-calibre firearms a cinch. \u201cMore than 60% of the weapons traffickers now have are from CAC,\u201d he said, adding that he had one such gun in his car. The weed smuggler remembered how authorities began using unmanned drones to monitor Brazil\u2019s western frontier during Lula\u2019s two-term government \u2013 a blow to cross-border traffickers. But on a personal level, the gunrunner considered Bolsonaro\u2019s four-year presidency \u2013 during which Covid killed nearly 700,000 people \u2013 a disaster. \u201cThis president\u2019s no good. He took the piss during the pandemic. People died,\u201d he said of Bolsonaro\u2019s sabotage of containment measures and vaccination. At a gang safe house in a nearby favela, one drug boss lambasted Bolsonaro\u2019s assault on the Amazon, which has seen deforestation surge. \u201cThe environment\u2019s screwed,\u201d the capo said as a capuchin monkey scurried along the wall above the swimming pool behind him and a huddle of colleagues sorted rocks of crack into plastic baggies. \u201cLula might steal \u2013 but at least he puts food on people\u2019s plates,\u201d the trafficker lamented of the social crisis that has exposed millions to extreme poverty and hunger. The gunrunner voiced exasperation at the deluge of misinformation his employees were consuming on their mobile phones. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking fake news,\u201d he snapped after one accomplice falsely claimed Lula had recently sold off a chunk of the Amazon to foreigners. But the bagman was unmoved and insisted he would again vote for Bolsonaro when Brazil holds its make-or-break election on 30 October. \u201cHe\u2019s an authentic guy,\u201d enthused the criminal, who gets his news from Jovem Pan, a rightwing network similar to Fox News in the US. \u201cWhoever imagined having a president who says what he actually thinks and feels?\u201d The gangster defended the president\u2019s handling of Covid: \u201cIt was something out of the ordinary that nobody knew how to handle.\u201d He also rejected claims Bolsonaro was a racist or a bigot. \u201cWhat\u2019s he ever done that was racist?\u201d demanded the criminal, himself black. \u201cWhat\u2019s he ever said that was homophobic?\u201d As night fell on the red-brick ghetto, the debate raged on in a haze of marijuana smoke, although underworld etiquette ensured the discussion remained gentlemanly. No fists or guns were raised, despite the powerful arsenal on show. Yet there was no hint of the men overcoming their seemingly irreconcilable differences over Lula and Bolsonaro \u2013 let alone agreeing on which man would prevail. \u201cI think Bolsonaro will win,\u201d said the Bolsonarista bagman, who identifies as an evangelical Christian. \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t \u2013 God knows something out of the ordinary is ordained to happen.\u201d Despite his violent line of work, the gunrunner said he feared bloodshed as the ill-tempered political struggle entered its final days. \u201cThey\u2019re all radicals,\u201d he said of Bolsonaristas. \u201cBlud, if you say something bad about Bolsonaro to his supporters, you\u2019ll get shot.\u201d Nunes, the pollster, called the bickering outlaws \u201cthe most faithful portrait\u201d of an election which has pitted Brazilians against Brazilians like never before. \u201cThe word that captures the moment in Brazil is \u2018division\u2019,\u201d he said, pointing to the profound social, religious, economic and cultural cleavages the vote has exposed. \u201cYou have the poor voting for Lula and the rich for Bolsonaro. You have black people voting Lula and whites for Bolsonaro. You have women voting for Lula and men for Bolsonaro. You have evangelicals voting Bolsonaro and Catholics for Lula.\u201d \u201cThis\u201d, he concluded, \u201cis a clash of two Brazils.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-10-13T00:24:08Z",
            "content": "Thousands of favela residents and activists have hit the streets of Rio to voice their support for Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the leftist frontrunner to become Brazil\u2019s next president. Addressing a sea of supporters in one of Rio\u2019s largest favelas, the Complexo do Alem\u00e3o, Lula vowed to give his far-right rival Jair Bolsonaro \u201ca thrashing\u201d when South America\u2019s biggest democracy holds the second round of its presidential election at the end of October. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win these elections,\u201d proclaimed the 76-year-old ex-president who fell just short of an outright victory over Bolsonaro in the first round 10 days ago. Lula, who rose from rural poverty to become Brazil\u2019s first working-class president in 2002, said he was determined to return to power \u201cto prove to the elites who have governed since 1500 that once again a metalworker will fix this country\u201d. \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m running for president once again is my belief that we can change things,\u201d Lula told activists during an assembly at the headquarters of Voz das Comunidades, the favela news group that organised his rare visit. \u201cI promise you that this country is going to change \u2013 and it\u2019s going to change for the better.\u201d Residents from more than 30 favelas had flocked to the Complexo do Alem\u00e3o on Wednesday morning to champion a politician they hope can end Bolsonaro\u2019s tumultuous four-year reign, during which Covid killed nearly 700,000 people and millions were plunged into poverty. \u201cLula setting foot in the favela is an act of resistance. It shows that we\u2019re not alone \u2013 that there\u2019s hope,\u201d said Douglas Viana, a 30-year-old activist from another sprawling working-class community, the Complexo da Mar\u00e9. \u201cThis is a historic moment for the country. We\u2019ve never seen anything on this scale,\u201d Viana added. Rene Silva, the founder of the Voz das Comunidades, voiced optimism that social change was around the corner under Lula, who used his two-term presidency to help millions escape poverty and enter higher education with the proceeds of a regional commodities boom. \u201cLula represents hope \u2013 hope of less hunger and less inequality. We\u2019ve taken so many steps backwards during Bolsonaro\u2019s four years in power \u2013 and it will take a long time to rebuild all of this,\u201d said Silva, 27. Anielle Franco, a campaigner whose politician sister Marielle Franco was assassinated in 2018, said she hoped a Lula victory might help secure justice for her murdered sibling. \u201cLula symbolises the return of the humble, the poor, the black and the north-easterners from the favela to the presidency \u2013 everything that we don\u2019t have under this government,\u201d Franco said. Fighting a \u2018government of hatred\u2019 Lula won the election\u2019s first round in the region around Alem\u00e3o, a vast sweep of redbrick housing in north Rio with tens of thousands of residents, as well as in other major favelas such as Rocinha and Mar\u00e9. But the leftist lost in Rio state as a whole, with Bolsonaro winning 51% of the vote to Lula\u2019s 40.7%, and Lula has stepped up his campaigning here ahead of the 30 October showdown with the far-right incumbent. Carlos Lupi, a Labour party leader who is helping run Lula\u2019s second-round campaign, said Wednesday\u2019s event was designed to raise awareness in the favelas about the urgent need for political change. \u201cThis is the government of hatred, of anger \u2013 and we must defeat it,\u201d Lupi said as the crowds streamed down one of Alem\u00e3o\u2019s main arteries with banners denouncing the hunger crisis blighting Brazil\u2019s poor. \u201cWe need to wake this community up to the harm this government is causing it.\u201d Not all locals were convinced, with many evangelical favela residents remaining loyal to Bolsonaro, whose allies have falsely accused Lula of plotting to close churches. Valmir da Silva, a 51-year-old driver, came to the Alem\u00e3o rally carrying a towel featuring Bolsonaro\u2019s image and his nationalist slogan: \u201cBrazil above everything, God above all.\u201d \u201cHe has done more in two years than Lula did in eight,\u201d Silva said of the right-wing radical. \u201cLula isn\u2019t interested in the poor. All he thinks about is staying in power.\u201d Silva insisted the throng of Lula supporters around him didn\u2019t represent the working-class area where he was born and raised. \u201cThe favela\u2019s divided,\u201d he said. But as the young favela leaders addressed Lula, they were united in their plea for better healthcare and education \u2013 and an end to the government neglect and police violence that claims hundreds of mostly black lives each year. \u201cWe are tired of dying,\u201d local activist Alan Brum told Lula. Buba Aguiar, an activist from a community called Acari, told the former president the only way of overcoming Bolsonaro and his far-right movement was to join forces with the voices of the favela, where about 20% of Rio\u2019s citizens live. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that we can stop authoritarianism or stop Bolsonarismo, without the leaders who are here today,\u201d Aguiar said. \u201cIt\u2019s only with our help that we\u2019ll be able to get Brazil back on track.\u201d Additional reporting by Alan Lima"

            "date": "2022-10-24T06:00:59Z",
            "content": "As Pennsylvanians prepare to vote for their next governor, it is no exaggeration to say the future of American democracy is at stake. Doug Mastriano, a retired army colonel who has enthusiastically indulged Donald Trump\u2019s fantasy that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, is the Republican candidate. If he wins, he plans to deregister every single one of Pennsylvania\u2019s 8.7 million voters. In future elections, Mastriano would choose who certifies \u2013 or doesn\u2019t \u2013 the state\u2019s election results. With Pennsylvania one of the few swing states in presidential elections, Mastriano could effectively have the power to decide the next president. But in a midterm election season defined by Republicans who seem to oppose democracy, there is some evidence that Mastriano, a retired army colonel, could be too fringe even for the Republican party. Mastriano is, by most measures, an extremist. As a state senator in Pennsylvania, he said women who violated a proposed six-week abortion ban should be charged with murder. Mastriano frequently attacks trans people, and has said gay marriage should be illegal, and that same-sex couples should not be allowed to adopt children. At an event this summer, organized by a pair of self-described prophets, Mastriano told his supporters: \u201cWe have the power of God with us.\u201d He added that Jesus Christ was \u201cguiding and directing our steps\u201d. While working at the Army War College, an academy for military members, Mastriano posed for a faculty photo wearing a Confederate uniform. And as a key schemer in Trump\u2019s bid to overturn the presidential election, Mastriano spent thousands of dollars chartering buses to Washington DC on January 6, where images showed him close to the violence as Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol. None of this stopped Mastriano, who was endorsed by Trump, from winning the Republican nomination for governor in May. He won by appealing to the kind of far-right Trump Republicans who have come to define the modern Republican party \u2013 voters who believe children are being exposed to pornography in schools, that trans people have too many rights, that being asked to wear a face mask is at odds with the US constitution, and that the election was stolen. Mastriano was also helped by Democrats, who ran ads boosting the Republican, hoping he would be easier to defeat in November. While that remains to be seen, one thing is certain: if anyone thought Mastriano would soften his various stances once he won the nomination, they were wrong. At rallies in west Pennsylvania in mid-October, Mastriano rallied against a spurious list of things Democrats allegedly stand for, promising that under him, things would be different. \u201cOn day one, all masking and jab for job requirements are over forever. On day one, woke is broke. It\u2019s over,\u201d he told a crowd of about 150 people in Butler county. \u201cOn day one, critical race theory is banned from our schools. On day one, no more secularization of our kids and no more pronoun games in elementary education. On day one, no more graphic porn \u2013 and I\u2019ve seen it \u2013 in our elementary schools. \u201cOn day one, no more boys on the girls\u2019 team.\u201d There was no detail on how Mastriano would tackle income inequality, or crime \u2013 something he claims has \u201cnearly doubled\u201d in the five and a half years Josh Shapiro, his Democratic opponent, has been Pennsylvania attorney general. Instead, there were the soundbites, and the ones about his plan to strip trans people of their rights got the biggest cheer. LGBTQ rights, and the rights of trans people in particular, were something Mastriano would return to repeatedly. His obsession with these identity issues, beyond their appeal to Trump Republicans, is perhaps unsurprising for a man who has embraced Christian nationalism \u2013 the idea that America was founded as, and should remain, a Christian nation. Mastriano, whose campaign did not respond to requests for comment, has also claimed Islam is \u201cnot compatible\u201d with the US constitution, and his faith has a lot of appeal at his rallies. \u201cHe\u2019s a good honest man \u2013 he\u2019s the ideal family man,\u201d said a woman wearing a straw hat with the name \u201cTrump\u201d wrapped around it. She would only give her name as Mary. \u201cI also admire the fact that you can see how he\u2019s such a strong Christian man. When he speaks you can just tell he\u2019s a good man. [Christians are] good examples for everyone. They\u2019re leaders, they believe in what\u2019s best for the people. They have their whole heart in everything and they get things done,\u201d Mary said. The Guardian pointed out that Joe Biden is a noted Christian. \u201cWell,\u201d Mary said. \u201cThere\u2019s weak Christians and strong Christians. I believe [Biden] is a weak Christian and I believe he is a perpetual liar.\u201d But while his religion may appeal to some, others have been turned off by Mastriano\u2019s positions on elections and democracy which, like his stance on minority rights, are deeply problematic. In the weeks following the November election, Mastriano used his position as a state senator to promote conspiracy theories about election fraud and introduced a bill which would have rejected certification of Pennsylvania\u2019s vote. Based on his own baseless claims that Democrats conspired to steal the election, Mastriano called for Kathy Boockvar, who as Pennsylvania\u2019s secretary of state was responsible for overseeing the state\u2019s election processes, to resign, and spent $3,000 of his campaign money to bus protesters to what became an insurrection in DC. As a result of his actions, earlier this year Mastriano was subpoenaed by the committee investigating the insurrection. As governor, Mastriano would appoint Pennsylvania\u2019s next secretary of state. Given his track record, that appointment would seem unlikely to be committed to protecting the vote. But election denial has plenty of appeal. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure they stole it,\u201d Alan Book, a Mastriano supporter, told the Guardian in Butler county. \u201cWhen [Trump is] up pretty near a million votes, then at 3 or 4 in the morning, loses the advantage, I don\u2019t believe that. When you get 100,000 votes and not one for Trump.\u201d Trump had been ahead in the vote in Pennsylvania before mail-in ballots were counted. A majority of mail-in ballots were in favor of Biden, who eventually carried the state by more than 80,000 votes, but numerous conspiracy theories have spread \u2013 and been debunked \u2013 relating to the count. If Mastriano\u2019s determination to undermine the results of both the last presidential election and any future ones is a clue to his opposition to democracy, so too is his approach to a free press. At the Butler county event, held in a medium-sized aircraft hangar, journalists were restricted to a tiny press area, marked out by white chain fence, located on the back wall. Reporters were not allowed to approach attendees before the event, and there was no opportunity to interview Mastriano. The next night, at a rally in Springdale, 15 miles north-east of Pittsburgh, things were even more restrictive. The Guardian was assigned a minder \u2013 a Mastriano campaign volunteer. The minder took their role very seriously, even following this journalist outside when he went to make a phone call. Inside, the Guardian was forbidden from leaving a \u201cpress area\u201d that amounted to a collapsable table. When Mastriano supporters lined up in front of the table, waiting to have their picture taken with the candidate, a bizarre silencing event took place where a Mastriano campaign volunteer went down the line, speaking to every individual. It is impossible to know what the volunteer was saying, but as she talked to the supporters they looked over at the Guardian, and when they filed past the press area every individual huffily refused to speak. The hostility to the media is something Mastriano seems to have copied from Trump, and like the former president, Mastriano also has a tenuous relationship with the truth. At both events Mastriano claimed that Shapiro had refused to debate him, which would have come as a surprise to anyone who had followed events as they actually happened: it was actually Mastriano who declined to participate in a debate hosted by the Pennsylvania Chamber of Commerce \u2013 which has hosted the debates for decades \u2013 because he was unhappy with the proposed moderators. Mastriano also refused to participate in a \u201cfireside chat\u201d, arranged by the Chamber of Commerce instead of the debate. Shapiro did. None of that mattered in Springdale, though, where Mastriano criticized Democrats for \u201ccalling us names\u201d and appealed for civility between campaigns before describing Shapiro as a \u201cweakling\u201d, a \u201cbigot\u201d, and a \u201cfailure\u201d. In a theoretical debate, Mastriano said of Shapiro: \u201cI\u2019ll mock him. I\u2019ll smoke him like a bad cigar.\u201d At his campaign events Mastriano seemed to have adopted Trump\u2019s tactic of outright lying \u2013 he has also borrowed hyperbolic language like calling things \u201chuge\u201d and talking of \u201cfantastic movements\u201d \u2013 and frequently he seemed to be living in an alternate universe. In Springdale, he touted good news from a Trafalgar poll that had dropped that day. The poll, Mastriano said, had him \u201cdead heat\u201d with Shapiro. But in reality the poll showed Shapiro winning 52.8% of the vote, with Mastriano at 43.5%. Indeed, all recent polling has Shapiro in the lead, the Democrat seems likely to prevail on 8 November. If that would come as a relief for Americans who believe in the value of their vote, there is a warning too. Mastriano, extremist, conspiracy theorist, would-be thwarter of democracy, has managed to claw his way to within reach of one of the most important positions in the country. Even if he loses, his ideas will not go away."

            "content": "He is one of Latin America\u2019s most influential and enduring politicians \u2013 a silver-tongued statesman Barack Obama once hailed as \u201cthe most popular president on Earth\u201d. But had it not been for a chiding from Fidel Castro nearly four decades ago, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva might well have abandoned what would prove one of the most storied political careers the region has ever known. \u201cHe gave him a bollocking,\u201d Lula\u2019s biographer and friend, Fernando Morais, said of the moment the Cuban revolutionary took the Brazilian unionist to task for considering throwing in the towel after failing in his bid to become S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s governor in 1982. \u201cListen, Lula \u2026 you don\u2019t have the right to abandon politics. You don\u2019t have the right to do this to the working class,\u201d Castro told the Brazilian during a trip to Havana, according to Morais\u2019s bestselling biography. \u201cGet back into politics!\u201d Lula\u2019s chronicler believes it was a pivotal moment in the life of his 77-year-old subject, who took his Cuban host\u2019s advice to heart. Four years later, in 1989, the former shoe-shine boy and factory worker, launched his first, ultimately unsuccessful bid to become Brazil\u2019s first working-class president. He lost two more presidential elections, in 1994 and 1998, before finally achieving his goal in 2002 \u2013 a historic triumph that sparked a nationwide outpouring of emotion and of hope. \u201cI cried so much,\u201d Morais remembered of the moment he saw Lula address crowds on S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s main avenue, Paulista, after his victory. \u201cThey were tears of joy and of fulfilment,\u201d said the writer. \u201cIt moved me profoundly.\u201d The story of Lula \u2013 who has reclaimed the presidency following a close-run victory over Jair Bolsonaro on Sunday \u2013 begins in the north-eastern state of Pernambuco where he was born into rural poverty in 1945. Age seven, Lula migrated south with his mother, Dona Lindu, and six siblings in search of a better life, ending up near the port city of Santos on the S\u00e3o Paulo coast. Three years later Lula\u2019s family moved to the state capital and, strapped for cash, rented the backroom of a bar which Lula remembers as a \u201cpigsty\u201d. \u201cIn the middle of the night [drunks] \u2026 would come in to piss or to puke. When it rained \u2026 rats and frogs would be swept in from the street and the next day they\u2019d have to clear it all up,\u201d Morais said. Lula\u2019s biographer believes those hard-knock experiences were \u2013 and continue to be \u2013 what made millions of Brazilians place their trust in a leader whose own life story reflected their own. \u201c[People think], this guy\u2019s just like me. He\u2019s faced all the same tragedies I\u2019ve faced. He\u2019s shared a two-room house with 27 other people,\u201d Morais said. In S\u00e3o Paulo, a teenage Lula worked as an office boy before training as a lathe operator during the early 1960s as Brazil was plunged into two decades of military dictatorship. According to Morais, who met Lula in the late 1970s in S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s manufacturing heartlands, in those days Brazil\u2019s future president was more interested in football than politics. When an agent from the then underground Communist party tried to recruit him on a bench outside a church, \u201cLula was livid\u201d. But the grind of factory work and the repression of Brazil\u2019s 1964-85 military regime served as a wake-up call. \u201cIt was only through witnessing the daily suffering of being a Brazilian worker \u2013 the low salaries, the worst imaginable working conditions \u2013 that his mind began to change,\u201d Morais said. When Lula\u2019s brother was kidnapped and tortured by security forces in 1975, that was the final straw. \u201cIt was a watershed moment,\u201d Morais said. Lula immersed himself in the labour movement and in 1979 led a series of historic strikes, cementing his position as Brazil\u2019s most famous union leader and paving the way for the creation of the Workers\u2019 party (PT) Lula leads to this day. After claiming power in 2002, Lula used the windfall from a commodities boom to help millions of citizens escape poverty and became a respected international statesman, helping Brazil secure the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics. \u201cHe made Brazil a significant player on the world scene \u2026 Brazil was a serious country \u2013 it helped create the G20, it established relations \u2026 with the Brics [Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa]. Brazilians were nominated to run the WTO and the FAO,\u201d said Richard Bourne, Lula\u2019s British biographer. Lula left power in 2010 with approval ratings nearing 90%. But the following decade was a brutal one for the leftist and his party. The PT became embroiled in a series of sprawling corruption scandals and was blamed for plunging Brazil into a savage recession. Lula\u2019s successor, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached in 2016 in what many supporters called a political \u201ccoup\u201d. Two years later Lula was jailed after being convicted on corruption charges that were last year quashed, paving the way for his sensational bid to reclaim the presidency. Lula would spend 580 days behind bars, during which time the far-right former soldier Bolsonaro was elected, ushering in an era of Amazon destruction and international isolation. But the veteran leftist used his jail time wisely, plotting what just a few years ago seemed an unthinkable return to the presidential palace in Bras\u00edlia. On Sunday night, his stunning comeback confirmed, he vowed to reunify his country, telling journalists at a hotel in S\u00e3o Paulo: \u201cWe are going to live new times of peace, love and hope.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-10-20T19:57:01Z",
            "content": "A voter in Maricopa county, Arizona, claims a group of people watching a ballot drop box photographed and followed the voter and their wife after they deposited their ballots at the box, accusing them of being \u201cmules\u201d. The voter filed a complaint with the Arizona secretary of state, who forwarded it to the US Department of Justice and the Arizona attorney general\u2019s office for investigation, according to Sophia Solis, a spokesperson with the secretary of state\u2019s office. The incident allegedly occurred at a Mesa, Arizona, outdoor drop box on the evening of 17 October. Early voting, both in person and via mailed ballots, began on 12 October ahead of the midterm elections. \u201cThere\u2019s a group of people hanging out near the ballot drop box filming and photographing my wife and I as we approached the drop box and accusing us of being a mule. They took a photographs [sic] of our license plate and of us and then followed us out the parking lot in one of their cars continuing to film,\u201d the voter wrote in the complaint. In Arizona, voters can only drop off ballots for themselves, people in their households or families, or people they\u2019re providing care for. Other states don\u2019t ban so-called ballot harvesting. The practice became illegal in Arizona in 2016. The incident comes as people in Maricopa and Yavapai counties have started to monitor drop boxes, spurred by the movie 2000 Mules, which makes unsubstantiated claims that \u201cmules\u201d are stuffing ballot boxes with votes. In other states, similar efforts to monitor drop boxes are under way, organized by people who remain convinced the 2020 presidential election was stolen. The Maricopa drop boxes are already under video surveillance by the county and broadcast on a live feed on the county\u2019s website, and the Yavapai drop boxes have cameras mounted on them. Election officials and voter advocacy groups have warned that the practice could lead to voter intimidation. At a press conference in Phoenix on Wednesday, Maricopa county supervisor Bill Gates said people outside the Maricopa county tabulation and election center were approaching and photographing election workers as they went into the site to work. \u201cThey\u2019re harassing people. They\u2019re not helping further the interests of democracy. If these people really wanna be involved in the process, learn more about it, come be a poll worker or a poll observer,\u201d Gates said. On Wednesday, a few people with cameras gathered outside a fence around the tabulation center\u2019s parking lot and identified themselves to reporters as part of a group called Clean Elections USA. On its website, the group says it\u2019s looking for \u201ctrue Patriots to take a stand and watch the drop boxes\u201d by gathering video and witnessing any potential \u201cballot tampering\u201d. In Yavapai county, groups that planned to organize drop box watches received legal warnings that they could be intimidating voters, halting their plans for coordinated watches, but some people are still watching the boxes from their cars, one of the groups, Lions of Liberty, told local TV station AZFamily. Yavapai county sheriff David Rhodes issued a statement about drop box watching and voter intimidation this week, saying that the number of ballots a person drops off does not indicate a crime or suspicion of a crime. Arizona\u2019s ballot collection law doesn\u2019t specify how many ballots a person can drop off, just the people they can carry ballots for. \u201cIt is difficult to know each voter\u2019s circumstance so your behavior towards others attempting to cast ballots must not interfere with that person\u2019s right to vote. Should your actions construe harassment or intimidation you may be breaking Arizona\u2019s voter intimidation laws,\u201d Rhodes wrote. Election officials ask voters to report instances of harassment and intimidation to their local election offices or other authorities, so that those claims can be investigated."

The leading candidates in 2022 are the incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, a rightwing populist, and the former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, a leftwinger who introduced radical anti-poverty measures during his two terms in office. There are 11 candidates in all but only two others are likely to draw more than 2% of the vote: Ciro Gomes, a rival leftwinger who served as a minister under Lula, and Simone Tebet, a centrist senator. In 2018, Bolsonaro won a second-round run-off against Fernando Haddad, the candidate of Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 party. In that election Haddad had strong support in the north-east, while Bolsonaro\u2019s vote was stronger in the south.

            "date": "2022-10-03T09:19:54Z",
            "content": "Brazil\u2019s left went into Sunday\u2019s election hoping for an outright majority for their candidate Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva over Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right figure who has been Brazil\u2019s president for the last four years. At the very least, they hoped for a commanding margin and a sense of momentum going into a runoff between the two. And progressives around the world were watching for an emphatic repudiation of Bolsonaro\u2019s presidency that would signal that the forces of extremism were in retreat. But it hasn\u2019t worked out that way. Instead, Lula won 48% of votes, roughly in line with polls \u2013 but Bolsonaro did much better than expected, taking 43%, and his supporters also outperformed polls in state and senate races. Lula is expected to take most votes from the minor candidates who now drop out, and should be favourite to win in the second round on 30 October \u2013 but the road to victory looks rockier than it did on Sunday. The stakes could hardly be higher. So what just happened? And why does the result matter so much, for Brazil and for the world? We look at six key questions after the first round of voting with our Latin America correspondent Tom Phillips. Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2013 widely known as Lula \u2013 is the charismatic leader of the PT (Workers\u2019 party), the dominant left-of-centre force in Brazilian politics. His presidency from 2003-2010 is remembered by many in the country as an era of economic growth and declining inequality. In 2018, when he was unable to run because of a corruption conviction that has since been overturned, the far-right populist Jair Bolsonaro came to power. Backed by Donald Trump and Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Bolsonaro has arguably been as cartoonishly incompetent and malevolent a figure as either \u2013 presiding over the devastation of the Amazon, massive increases in poverty, and the deaths of more than 685,000 Brazilians from coronavirus. \u201cThe mood among his opponents had been one of cautious optimism,\u201d said Tom Phillips. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite emotional for them \u2013 the idea that Bolsonaro\u2019s presidency could be over, or nearly over. It\u2019s been a long slog. They feel that so much damage has been done.\u201d What happened on Sunday? The catharsis that Lula\u2019s supporters had hoped for failed to materialise. \u201cIt\u2019s massively dispiriting for the left,\u201d said Tom. \u201cAnd really surprising \u2013 not in terms of Lula\u2019s vote, which is in line with what everyone thought, but in terms of Bolsonaro\u2019s, which is significantly higher. The pollsters got that badly wrong. I went to Lula\u2019s rally, and people were crying, or in a state of shock.\u201d That mood of disappointment for the left was heightened by victory for Bolsonaro\u2019s allies in 19 of the 27 available Senate seats, as well as a strong showing in the lower house. Bolsonaro\u2019s former environment minister, who presided over huge increases in deforestation, won his congressional election; so did Eduardo Pazuello, the health minister who oversaw Brazil\u2019s catastrophic handling of coronavirus at the height of the pandemic. \u201cNearly 700,000 people died here, and his management of Covid was demonstrably incompetent,\u201d Tom said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t seem to have impacted his support.\u201d What kind of a campaign has it been? \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty toxic,\u201d Tom said. \u201cI first covered an election here in 2006, and I\u2019ve never seen this level of bitterness before. Bolsonaro treats elections as wars. A lot of people on the left have been frightened \u2013 one Lula supporter said to me on Saturday that it\u2019s the first time in my life I\u2019ve been scared to put a sticker on my car.\u201d Those fears are not idle: a Lula supporter was brutally murdered by a Bolsonaro supporter last month, one of a string of violent attacks by supporters of a candidate who has demanded leftists \u201cbe eradicated from public life\u201d. And the murders in June of Guardian contributor Dom Phillips and indigenous expert Bruno Pereira have also come at a time when Bolsonaro has made relentless verbal attacks on advocates for the rainforest. Lula has sought to frame his campaign as the strongest possible contrast with that of Bolsonaro, and his message of unity is just one of the ways the race has echoed the Trump-Biden contest in the US of 2020. On Sunday, he told reporters: \u201cWe want no more hatred, no more quarrelling, we want a country that lives in peace.\u201d How important is this election for Brazil? The vote comes against a backdrop of terrible damage during Bolsonaro\u2019s presidency, as this piece from Tom yesterday made clear. Bolsonaro\u2019s authoritarian tendencies and contempt for any obligation to protect the worst-off have left Brazil facing a cost of living crisis and a lurch to the right on social issues. While Bolsonaro authorised a welfare package worth billions of dollars during the campaign, he has also promised to privatise the state-owned oil company, pass pro-gun legislation, cut corporation taxes, and toughen restrictions on abortion. One voter told Tom: \u201cSo many of the advances that took decades to achieve have been destroyed over the last four years.\u201d What does it mean for the Amazon? Under Bolsonaro\u2019s presidency, the destruction of Brazil\u2019s rainforest reached a record high in the first half of this year; Lula has promised to put a stop to the deforestation. That is of global importance given the Amazon\u2019s role as a store for carbon dioxide. Damian Carrington, the Guardian\u2019s environment editor, wrote on Friday that almost a million hectares of the Amazon have been burned in the last year, with fires at their highest level in a decade. \u201cBolsonaro has dragged Brazil back to the wild west days we thought we\u2019d left behind,\u201d one expert told him. \u201cIt\u2019s no exaggeration, then, to say that the Amazon\u2019s fate rests on the outcome of our election.\u201d While the identity of the next president remains crucial, last night\u2019s results appear to be bad news for advocates for the rainforest whatever happens. Jonathan Watts, the Guardian\u2019s global environment editor and former Latin America correspondent, noted on Twitter that congressional success for Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters will make it hard for Lula to pass Amazon protection legislation even if he wins. Was this result a repudiation of Bolsonaro? Lula has drawn support from a broad coalition of voters. \u201cA lot of the people who\u2019ve voted for him are not leftists,\u201d said Tom. \u201cPeople in the centre and on the centre right viewed this as an emergency election. They want a hard stop to this period, and hopefully next time a normal election with normal candidates.\u201d That looks further away now. Cas Mudde, a leading expert on populism and the radical right, wrote in a sobering thread on Twitter last night that the result was the \u201cworst possible Lula victory\u201d, and that while he still expects Lula to prevail, the margin is likely to be small \u2013 or could be reversed if anything unexpected happens that favours Bolsonaro in the next few weeks. Comparing the prospect of a Bolsonaro defeat to Trump\u2019s in the US, he said that both men would have lost \u201cvery narrowly, and mostly because of a freak cause (the pandemic) \u2026 moreover, based on US experience, expect the right to further radicalise rather than moderate. And to be very competitive again in four years.\u201d What happens next? Bolsonaro has long been planting the seeds of election denialism: \u201cHe\u2019s been paving the way for the \u2018big lie\u2019 for years,\u201d Tom said. In July, as one example, he made baseless claims that Brazil\u2019s electronic voting system was vulnerable to subversion. The fact that the result now looks likely to be narrower than expected even if Lula wins \u201csignificantly increases the credibility of [the] \u201cstolen elections\u201d narrative among Bolsonaro supporters and thus the possibility of post-electoral violence,\u201d Mudde wrote. Many in Brazil are fearful that Bolsonaro may stoke an anti-democratic mood among his supporters \u2013 though, perhaps scenting the possibility of a revival, he was noticeably quieter on his baseless fraud claims last night than he has recently been. \u201cI don\u2019t think we quite know what happens now,\u201d Tom said. \u201cIf he does lose, there are people who fear a January 6 style assault on government institutions. And the most radical of his supporters are in many cases armed.\u201d It\u2019s worth emphasising that Lula remains the favourite \u2013 and that while Bolsonaro did better than expected, he is still the first sitting Brazilian president to go into a second round running behind since the 1980s. But after a deflating night for progressives, predictions about what might happen after a Lula victory risk being premature. \u201cIf people thought Bolsonaro and Bolsonarism were down and out they were wrong,\u201d Tom said. \u201cThe far right is absolutely here to stay.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 4 October 2022 to correctly refer to Jair Bolsonaro as a far-right figure rather than \u201ca figurehead\u201d as an earlier version said."

            "content": "Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has fallen silent after his chastening election defeat to his leftist rival Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. A stream of world leaders have stepped forward to recognize Lula\u2019s stunning political comeback, including the US president, Joe Biden, the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, and China\u2019s Communist party chief, Xi Jinping. But Bolsonaro \u2013 a pro-dictatorship radical who has repeatedly hinted he might not accept defeat \u2013 has yet to concede. His last message on Twitter \u2013 an excerpt from the biblical book of Ephesians \u2013 was posted at two minutes before midnight on the eve of an election he went on to lose by a margin of more than 2m votes. With 100% of votes counted, Lula secured 50.9% to Bolsonaro\u2019s 49.10%. Lula received 60.3m votes while the rightwing incumbent had 58.2m. The defeat makes Bolsonaro the first serving president in Brazilian history to be voted out of office. Lula will take over on 1 January 2023. While Bolsonaro remained mute, key allies did accept the result in a sign that the populist\u2019s power was rapidly ebbing away after four tumultuous years in office. Silas Malafaia, a prominent televangelist who was one of Bolsonaro\u2019s most vocal cheerleaders, tweeted: \u201cThe sovereign will of the people has established itself.\u201d Malafaia tweeted a quote from the British writer CS Lewis as his candidate\u2019s defeat sank in: \u201cIt is not your business to succeed, but to do right. When you have done so the rest lies with God.\u201d The newly elected pro-Bolsonaro governor of S\u00e3o Paulo, Tarc\u00edsio de Freitas, also recognized Lula\u2019s win, telling journalists: \u201cThe election result is sovereign.\u201d Another key ally, the lower house leader, Arthur Lira, said: \u201cThe will of the majority, expressed at the polls, should never be challenged.\u201d Even Sergio Moro, the pro-Bolsonaro judge who controversially jailed Lula in the lead-up to the 2018 election before taking a job in Bolsonaro\u2019s cabinet, recognized the leftist\u2019s victory. \u201cThus is democracy,\u201d Moro tweeted. Ricardo Salles, Bolsonaro\u2019s former environment minister, tweeted: \u201cThe result of the most polarized election in Brazil\u2019s history prompts many reflections and the need to seek ways to pacify a country that is literally split in half. Now is the time for serenity.\u201d But Bolsonaro and his three politician sons remained tight-lipped on Monday morning. The news website UOL said he was \u201choled up\u201d in the presidential residence in Bras\u00edlia. By Monday lunchtime the only hint that Bolsonaro might be prepared to accept defeat was a tweet from one of his closest allies, the evangelical preacher Damares Alves, in which she wrote: \u201cWe lost an election but we haven\u2019t lost our love for our country ... Bolsonaro will leave the presidency in January with his head held high\u201d. The first Bolsonaro to break the silence was the first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro, who posted a quote from Psalm 117 on Instagram. \u201cO praise the Lord, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people. For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever,\u201d it said. Later that afternoon Bolsonaro\u2019s senator son, Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, tweeted: \u201cThank you to each one of you who helped us rescue patriotism \u2026 We will hold our heads high and we will not give up on our Brazil.\u201d Reginaldo Lopes, a Worker\u2019s party congressman who ran Lula\u2019s campaign in the key swing state of Minas Gerais, said Bolsonaro\u2019s silence spoke volumes about his dislike of democracy. \u201cIt underlines how he has never had any affection for democracy. Any serious democratic candidate would immediately call the president-elect to congratulate them and recognize their defeat and their adversary\u2019s victory.\u201d Some observers have voiced concern that Bolsonaro may follow in the footsteps of his US ally Donald Trump and refuse to accept defeat in an attempt to keep his political movement alive. Jos\u00e9 Roberto de Toledo, a political columnist for the news website UOL, thought it mattered little whether Bolsonaro conceded defeat or not. \u201cThe senate has accepted [the result]. The lower house has accepted it. The electoral court has accepted it. All of the institutions have accepted it \u2013 and the military is quiet,\u201d Toledo said, adding that he was rather enjoying a rare break from the president\u2019s blathering. \u201cBolsonaro\u2019s a poet when he shuts up,\u201d Toledo said. Rather than plotting a coup or insurrection, Toledo joked that Bolsonaro was probably kicking a wall in the presidential palace, swearing at the first lady or practising yoga breathing techniques to remain calm. \u201cI think he genuinely believed he would win. He believed his own lie. So he\u2019s probably brooding, coming to grips with defeat.\u201d The political commentator Bernardo Mello Franco tweeted: \u201cOne by one, Bolsonaristas recognize Lula\u2019s victory. This leaves the president without the political support to attempt any kind of coup-style adventure.\u201d Lopes also dismissed the risk of Bolsonaro attempting to defy the result, pointing to the widespread acceptance of Lula\u2019s triumph from across the political spectrum and within the political establishment. \u201cBrazil and its institutions all immediately recognized President Lula\u2019s victory. This was crucial,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2022-10-20T00:00:51Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump signed a legal statement alleging voter fraud in the 2020 election despite being told the numbers underpinning the case were false, a federal judge said on Wednesday. The disclosure was made by the US district judge David Carter, who ordered John Eastman, a former Trump lawyer, to provide more emails to the congressional committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Eastman was one of Trump\u2019s attorneys when the former president and his allies challenged his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden. The legal document was part of a lawsuit by Trump\u2019s team challenging the results in Georgia, a state Trump narrowly lost to Biden, in which they claimed a Georgia county had improperly counted more than 10,000 votes of dead people, felons and unregistered voters. In an 18-page opinion, Carter said that the former president had \u201csigned a verification swearing under oath\u201d that the inaccurate fraud numbers were \u201ctrue and correct\u201d or \u201cbelieved to be true and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge. \u201cThe emails show that President Trump knew that the specific numbers of voter fraud were wrong but continued to tout those numbers, both in court and to the public,\u201d the judge wrote, adding: \u201cThe Court finds that these emails are sufficiently related to and in furtherance of a conspiracy to defraud the United States.\u201d Carter previously ruled that Eastman and Trump had probably committed a felony by trying to pressure his then vice-president, Mike Pence, to obstruct Congress. The ruling was made in a lawsuit filed by Eastman to block disclosure of the emails to the January 6 select committee, following a congressional subpoena. Carter previously ordered Eastman to provide more than 200 emails to the committee, after the lawyer resisted the subpoena and claimed that the communications were privileged. The judge said on Wednesday that the vast majority of emails still being sought by congressional investigators should not be handed over, as legal protections given to attorneys and their clients apply to the records. He said eight emails that would normally be shielded under those protections must be given to the committee, after he found that the communications were in furtherance of a crime \u2013 one of the few times those legal safeguards can be lifted. Carter found that four emails show that Eastman and other lawyers suggested that the \u201cprimary goal\u201d of filing lawsuits was to delay Congress\u2019s certification of the 2020 election results. The judge said four other emails \u201cdemonstrate an effort by President Trump and his attorneys to press false claims in federal court for the purpose of delaying the January 6 vote\u201d. At one point, Eastman wrote that although the former president had signed documents related to a lawsuit in Georgia on 1 December, \u201che has since been made aware that some of the allegations (and evidence proffered by the experts) has been inaccurate. For him to sign a new verification with that knowledge (and incorporation by reference) would not be accurate.\u201d Carter wrote: \u201cPresident Trump and his attorneys ultimately filed the complaint with the same inaccurate numbers without rectifying, clarifying, or otherwise changing them.\u201d Trump and his allies filed more than 60 lawsuits challenging the 2020 election, with some complaints alleging voter fraud without evidence to support those claims. Those cases were overwhelmingly rejected by judges, some of which Trump appointed to the federal courts. The January 6 select committee last week voted to subpoena Trump in its investigation. It is expected to issue a report in the coming weeks on its findings."

            "content": "She never got to vote for him because she was too young. But when Barack Obama came to rally this week, Emma Berlage wouldn\u2019t have missed him for the world. \u201cIt\u2019s a Friday night, Halloween weekend no less, and everybody\u2019s here,\u201d the 24-year-old said. \u201cAfter he was president he\u2019s continued to stay cool and very popular with Democrats.\u201d More popular than the current president, Joe Biden? \u201cYes. I mean, in terms of coolness, yes!\u201d Obama has played many parts in America\u2019s political life \u2013 new hope, history maker, elder statesman. Now he had arrived as would-be saviour. The first Black president was in Atlanta, Georgia, to fire up voters ahead of midterm elections that will decide control of Congress and perhaps the fate of American democracy. Opinion polls suggest that the contest is slipping away from Biden\u2019s Democrats in favour of a Republican party still in thrall to Donald Trump. Among the worries is low enthusiasm in the Democratic base. A recent poll by Politico-Morning Consult found that just 25% of Black registered voters describe themselves as \u201cextremely enthusiastic\u201d about voting in the midterm elections, compared with about 37% of white voters and 35% of Hispanic voters. If anyone can turn the situation around it is Obama, who was greeted by a largely Black crowd of more than 5,000 people with nostalgic cheers and chants of his presidential election slogan, \u201cYes, we can!\u201d Biden, by contrast, with job approval ratings in the low 40s, has been keeping a low profile on the campaign trail. Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: \u201cObama is the Democratic party rock star. There\u2019s no one close to Obama in terms of his ability to turn out voters. The key issue is going to be the effectiveness of the ground operations to capitalise on the turnout and the ability to link his visit to the strategy they have of using social media to augment and amplify the personal visits.\u201d Obama\u2019s post-presidency has included a 768-page memoir (with another volume to come), a deal with the streaming giant Netflix \u2013 he won the best narrator Emmy award for his documentary series, Our Great National Parks \u2013 and plans for a $500m presidential centre in Jackson Park on the South Side of Chicago. On Friday, wearing a white shirt with open collar and rolled-up sleeves, the 61-year-old spoke with the ease and humour of one no longer burdened by office. \u201cI have to admit, sometimes going out on the campaign trail feels a little harder than it used to,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not just because I\u2019m older and greyer, a little stiffer \u2013 Michelle says I\u2019m still cute, though.\u201d But the message to supporters holding signs that said \u201cOne Georgia\u201d, \u201cGeorgia votes early\u201d and \u201cDefend choice\u201d \u2013 a reference to abortion rights \u2013 in a sports and entertainment arena near Atlanta airport was urgent enough as Democrats strive to preserve narrow majorities in the House and Senate and claim key state governorships. \u201cI get why people are anxious,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI get why you might be worried. I understand why it might be tempting sometimes just to tune out, to watch football or Dancing with the Stars, but I\u2019m here to tell you that tuning out is not an option. Despair is not an option. \u201cThe only way to make this economy fairer is if we, all of us, fight for it. The only way to save democracy is if we, together, nurture it and fight for it. And that starts with electing people who know you and see you and care about you. People who will struggle alongside you.\u201d That he had brought this clarion call to Georgia was no accident. The deep south state was a fulcrum of the Confederacy during the civil war and carries the scars of slavery and segregation. It was also the birthplace of Martin Luther King and a crucible of the civil rights struggle. After decades in Republican hands, it has supplanted Florida as arguably the most crucial electoral battleground in the country. Biden narrowly won here in 2020, a result that Trump, in a prolonged fit of pique, has never accepted. Soon after, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock won two Senate seats, giving Democrats control of the chamber and Biden scope to pass a more ambitious agenda than had seemed imaginable. Warnock, pastor of the church where King preached and the first Black senator in Georgia\u2019s history, is now up for re-election against Trump-backed Herschel Walker, a former American football star with no political experience and plenty of personal scandals. For months Warnock had held a steady polling edge over Walker but the gap has narrowed. On Thursday the Senate\u2019s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, was caught by a TV camera microphone at an event telling Biden that the race in Georgia was going \u201cdownhill\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that they will go for Herschel Walker.\u201d Obama acknowledged that Walker had been \u201ca heck of a football player\u201d but questioned whether that made him the best person to represent Georgians in the Senate or make critical decisions about the economy and foreign policy. \u201cLet\u2019s do a thought experiment,\u201d the ex-president said. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re at the airport, and you see Mr Walker. And you say, hey, there\u2019s Herschel Walker, Heisman winner. Let\u2019s have him fly the plane.\u201d The crowd erupted in laughter. \u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t say that. You\u2019d want to know: does he know how to fly an airplane? \u201cOr let\u2019s say you go to the hospital, and you say, \u2018that Walker guy, he sure could turn up at Sanford Stadium [the University of Georgia football arena]. Give him a scalpel.\u2019 No, you wouldn\u2019t say that. You\u2019d ask \u2013 at least, I would \u2013 \u2018has he done surgery before?\u2019\u201d There is little evidence that Walker has taken any interest or displayed any kind of inclination towards public service or volunteer work, Obama added. \u201cSeems to me, he\u2019s a celebrity who wants to be a politician. And we\u2019ve seen how that goes. We\u2019ve seen that before.\u201d Walker has faced allegations of domestic violence from his ex-wife. More recently, two women have said that Walker pressured them to have abortions during their relationships, allegations he has denied. Walker opposes abortion but has been inconsistent regarding whether it should be allowed in cases of rape or incest or to safeguard the health of the woman. Obama noted such hypocrisy and said the supreme court\u2019s decision this summer to end the constitutional right to abortion had been a wake-up call to many people. He warned: \u201cIf Republicans take back the House and the Senate, we could be one presidential election away from a nationwide ban on access to abortion.\u201d Democracy, too, is on the ballot, Obama said, as most Republicans are not even pretending that the rules apply to them any more. \u201cThey are just making stuff up \u2026 We have seen throughout history, we see now around the world what happens if we give up on democracy \u2026 When true democracy goes away, people get hurt.\u201d The ex-president had also come to stump for Stacey Abrams, a voting rights activist and former Democratic leader in the statehouse, who is bidding to become the first female African American governor in the nation\u2019s history. Her Republican opponent, Brian Kemp, is the 83rd white man in a row to occupy the the Georgia governor\u2019s mansion. With the advantages of incumbency and a strong state economy, Kemp \u2013 who has signed a bill that would ban abortions six weeks after conception and imposed new voter restrictions \u2013 is leading in the polls. Syd Janney, 70, said after Friday\u2019s rally: \u201cI would swim through alligator-infested waters to get to vote for Stacey Abrams. It is that important, as it is that Raphael Warnock stays in our Senate seat in Washington. It is essential to our way of life, to our belief in representative government.\u201d Obama\u2019s appearance was the start of a five-state tour that will take him to the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania. That last event, on the Saturday before the 8 November elections, will be alongside 79-year-old Biden, who \u2013 unlike Trump \u2013 has held back from holding rallies in some swing states lest he drag candidates down. Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta, told the Reuters news agency: \u201cAfrican American voters are going to be crucial to Democrats\u2019 chances. Bringing in President Obama helps to underscore the importance of African American vote, while also exciting other voters.\u201d At the rally, Vonita Porch, 67, a retired management analyst, felt that Obama could make a difference. She said: \u201cHe\u2019s the one to carry the party and he\u2019s still the leader of the party. Democracy itself is definitely on the ballot, not just in Georgia but we\u2019ve got to think about how everything is working in the world.\u201d Nathan and Allison Belzer had driven four hours from Savannah to be here. Allison, 51, a history professor, said: \u201cI am the American who loves Joe Biden also but obviously not the same way that I love Obama.\u201d Nathan, a 50-year-old lawyer, suggested that Obama had a luxury that Biden does not. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for an ex-president who\u2019s been out of office to have a little bit of distance. He\u2019s lost the baggage whereas Biden\u2019s in the middle of it and still is carrying his baggage.\u201d But not everyone is convinced that Obama\u2019s cavalry charge for the Democrats will succeed. In his first midterm election in 2010, the party lost control of the House in what he called a \u201cshellacking\u201d. In his second midterm election four years later, Republicans regained control of the Senate. Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said: \u201cHe was good at getting out the vote for himself. He never really was able to pull Democrats across the finish line when he was president. Look at the disasters of his midterm elections in 2010 and 2014. \u201cAll of this is so overplayed. Rallies don\u2019t mean a damn thing. They may if you\u2019re Donald Trump but they don\u2019t produce votes that you would not get otherwise.\u201d Republicans appear confident that their focus on fears of crime, illegal immigration and an economic recession will overwhelm Democrats\u2019 emphasis on defending abortion rights. Beyond Georgia, Republicans have focused their efforts on flipping a Democratic Senate seat in Arizona or Nevada. Republicans are also expected to win enough seats to take over the House. Controlling both chambers would enable them to stonewall Biden\u2019s agenda, block his executive branch nominees and launch investigations of his administration. Such a scenario, and a potential Trump run for the White House in 2024, would leave Obama with little choice but to remain in the political arena in an effort to protect democracy. David Litt, an author and former Obama speechwriter, said: \u201cThe American story is much more uncertain than most of us thought it would be while we were working for him in the White House. \u201cUnlike other recent ex-presidents, he is a recent ex-president at a moment when the stakes for the country are extraordinarily high and when those stakes are imposed not from an external threat but from an internal one: authoritarianism that has been bubbling up. He has a set of pressures and an understanding of the stakes that his predecessors didn\u2019t need to have in nearly the same way.\u201d At the Friday event, Obama also decried an erosion of basic civility and democratic norms in politics in America and around the world, adding: \u201cI want to take a moment just to say a prayer for a friend of mine, Mr Paul Pelosi, who was attacked.\u201d Pelosi, the husband of House speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted with a hammer at their home in San Francisco early on Friday morning. The incident was described by the authorities as \u201cnot random\u201d. It stunned Washington and stoked rising fears about political violence ahead of the midterms."

            "content": "A standoff over the debt ceiling. Aid to Ukraine on the chopping block. And impeachment proceedings against homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas \u2013 or perhaps even president Joe Biden himself. With polls indicating they have a good shot of winning a majority in the House of Representatives in the 8 November midterms, top Republican lawmakers have in recent weeks offered a preview what they might do with their resurgent power, and made clear they have their sights set on key aspects of the Biden administration\u2019s policies at home and abroad. Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the chamber, this week signaled in an interview with Punchbowl News that if Congress is going to approve an increase in the amount the federal government can borrow \u2013 as it\u2019s expected to need to by sometime next year \u2013 Republicans are going to want an agreement to cut spending in return. \u201cYou can\u2019t just continue down the path to keep spending and adding to the debt,\u201d said McCarthy, who is likely to be elevated to speaker of the house in a Republican led-chamber. \u201cAnd if people want to make a debt ceiling [for a longer period of time], just like anything else, there comes a point in time where, okay, we\u2019ll provide you more money, but you got to change your current behavior.\u201d Asked if he might demand that Social Security and Medicare, the two massive federal retirement and healthcare benefit programs that are nearing insolvency, be reformed as part of debt ceiling negotiations, McCarthy replied that he would not \u201cpredetermine\u201d anything. But the California lawmaker warned that members of his caucus were starting to question the money Washington was sending to Ukraine to help it fend off Russia\u2019s invasion. \u201cUkraine is important, but at the same time it can\u2019t be the only thing they do and it can\u2019t be a blank check,\u201d he told Punchbowl. Then there\u2019s the question of whether Republicans will choose to exercise the House\u2019s powers of impeachment \u2013 as they did against Bill Clinton in 1998, and as Democrats did to Donald Trump in 2019 and 2021. The prime target appears to be Mayorkas, whom Republicans have pilloried amid an uptick in arrivals of migrants at the United States\u2019s border with Mexico. Yet another target could be Biden himself \u2013 as Jim Banks, chair of the conservative Republican Study Committee, which crafts policy for the party, suggested on Thursday. Political realities may pose an obstacle to McCarthy and his allies\u2019 ability to see their plans through. High inflation and Biden\u2019s low approval ratings have given them momentum to retake the House, but their chances of winning a majority in the Senate are seen as a toss-up. Even if they did win that chamber, they\u2019re unlikely to have the two-thirds majority necessary to convict Biden, Mayorkas, or whomever else they intend to impeach \u2013 or even the numbers to overcome Democratic filibusters of any legislation they try to pass. Matt Grossman, director of Michigan State University\u2019s Institute for Public Policy and Social Research, questioned the GOP\u2019s willingness to legislate. The party\u2019s plans, as outlined in the Commitment to America McCarthy unveiled last month, appear thin in comparison to similar platforms rolled out in 1994 and 2010, when Republicans again took back Congress\u2019 lower chamber from Democratic majorities. \u201cThere\u2019s a longstanding asymmetry between the parties. Republicans legitimately want government to do less,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing pretty well electorally without necessarily needing a policy agenda, and they\u2019re tied to, kind of, defending the Trump administration or attacking the Biden administration. There\u2019s not much of a felt need for a lot of policy.\u201d There are also signs of division within the party over how the GOP should use its new majority. In his interview with Punchbowl, McCarthy said he was against \u201cimpeachment for political purposes\u201d and focused instead on addressing crime, border security and economic issues, all familiar themes for Republicans running this year. The split was even more pronounced when it came to Ukraine. On Wednesday, Trump\u2019s former vice-president Mike Pence called in a speech at influential conservative group the Heritage Foundation for Republicans to continue to support the country, saying \u201cthere can be no room in the conservative movement for apologists to\u201d Russian president Vladimir Putin. The day after, the foundation\u2019s president Kevin Roberts put out a statement saying: \u201cHeritage will vigorously oppose Washington\u2019s big spenders who attempt to pass another Ukrainian aid package lacking debate, a clear strategy, targeted funding and spending offsets.\u201d Democrats are assured control of Congress until the end of the year, and have taken note of the apparent erosion of will to support Kyiv. NBC News reports they may push for another big military aid infusion in a year-end spending bill, intended to keep the Ukrainians armed for months to come. It seems clear that Republicans will eventually coalesce behind a strategy to strong-arm the Biden administration for some purpose, but Grossman predicted the likely result would be similar to the 2013 government shutdown, when then president Barack Obama and the Democrats refused the GOP\u2019s demands to dismantle his signature healthcare law. \u201cWith McCarthy it just seems like he is a go along,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a go-along speaker and that\u2019s going to be the case with a pretty fractious caucus.\u201d"

L\u00edsias was far from the only person harbouring such feelings as 156 million Brazilians took part in a momentous election that will have profound implications for the future of one of the world\u2019s biggest democracies, the Amazon rainforest and the climate emergency. \u201cI\u2019ve never voted for Lula before. I never agreed with his ideas. But Bolsonaro is someone with whom I have absolutely nothing in common, not even as a human being,\u201d said Marcelo Pessuto, a 37-year-old actuary who had also come to vote for Lula. Pessuto called himself a centrist and said economically his ideas were closer to those of the pro-business Bolsonaro. However, the president\u2019s homophobic, hate-filled rhetoric had convinced him that Bolsonaro had to go. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in this kind of country \u2026 Sometimes we even think about leaving,\u201d he said. Gabriele Tissot Zappal\u00e1, a 23-year-old nursing technician, said Bolsonaro\u2019s negligent and denialist handling of the Covid pandemic, which has killed nearly 700,000 Brazilians, had persuaded her to back Lula, the leftist Worker\u2019s party (PT) candidate, who governed from 2003-11. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a PT member, but I have chosen my side because I\u2019m against Bolsonaro,\u201d said Zappal\u00e1, who came to vote in a red T-shirt bearing the slogan \u201cAnti-fascist Social Club\u201d. \u201cAnyone is better than Bolsonaro,\u201d agreed her father, Attilio, who had also voted for the 77-year-old former union leader. Election eve polls suggested Lula has an advantage of between four and eight percentage points over his rival and is likely, but not certain, to prevail when the results are announced on Sunday evening. Paulo Celso Pereira, an executive editor at the newspaper O Globo, predicted that Lula would clinch a narrow victory as a result of Bolsonaro\u2019s high rejection rates, with about half of all voters spurning the far-right incumbent. \u201cThe country is completely divided \u2013 almost straight down the middle. Half is against Bolsonaro and almost half is against Lula,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s this \u2018almost\u2019 that will make the difference and that Lula will win.\u201d As he waited to vote, however, L\u00edsias voiced unease over what might happen if \u201cthe worst president in Brazilian history\u201d won a second four-year term. \u201cI hope things work out and there\u2019s change, but I feel a little apprehensive too. I\u2019m not 100% certain what will happen,\u201d he said. Re-electing the pro-gun radical \u201cwould formalise this terror \u2013 this wild west-style life\u201d. \u201cBrazil would be sending a message: this is what we are and this is what we want,\u201d said the author, whose Bolsonaro-era political journals refer to the president simply as \u201cDeath\u201d. L\u00edsias had felt firsthand the impact of Bolsonaro\u2019s internationally condemned coronavirus response, which saw him sabotage containment measures and promote quack cures such as hydroxychloroquine, with devastating consequences. \u201cI spent 20 days in hospital \u2013 15 of them in ICU,\u201d said the writer, whose latest book, A Perfect Pain, is a chronicle of his fight for survival. He expressed perplexity that more than 51 million fellow citizens had backed Bolsonaro in the election\u2019s recent first round, which Lula won by 6 million votes. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s astonishing \u2026 It\u2019s a kind of blindness,\u201d he said. Many Brazilians disagree. As conservative voters turned out to back the incumbent in Barra da Tijuca, a pro-Bolsonaro stronghold in west Rio de Janeiro, they voiced enduring support and affection for the man supporters hail as the \u201cmito\u201d (legend). \u201cBolsonaro is honest. He\u2019s hard-working; he\u2019s a man with values; he\u2019s a man that I trust,\u201d said Iolanda Dias, a 63-year-old psychologist. Santiago Santos, a 37-year-old driver, had voted for Lula 20 years ago when he made history after being elected Brazil\u2019s first working-class leader. But the rampant corruption that tarnished the PT\u2019s 14 years in power \u2013 and saw Lula jailed for nearly two years, before his conviction was quashed \u2013 meant he would never again support the leftist. \u201cLula\u2019s been convicted. He\u2019s an ex-con. Full stop,\u201d Santos said as he prepared to vote for Bolsonaro on the east side of S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cThese are facts.\u201d Santos denied Bolsonaro bore responsibility for hundreds of thousands of unnecessary Covid deaths, as Lula has claimed. \u201cI lost my mum during the pandemic \u2026 and I don\u2019t blame him,\u201d he said. L\u00edsias begged to differ, comparing Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201cgenocidal\u201d handling of the pandemic to the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s slaughter of thousands of innocent civilians. \u201cIn my opinion, he needs to be taken to the international criminal court.\u201d As voters streamed into the polling station, L\u00edsias said South America\u2019s most populous democracy faced a stark choice: embracing fascism or kickstarting a long and arduous process of reconstruction. \u201cWe have seen so much suffering,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cSo much death.\u201d"

            "content": "More than half of Democratic-leaning voters say abortion has become a crucial motivation for them to vote in next month\u2019s US midterm elections, according to a recent poll. A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) conducted in September reveals that June\u2019s supreme court decision to overturn Roe v Wade has put a fire under Democratic voters, with more than half claiming they are more motivated to vote than in previous elections, and 50% of those citing as their prime reason the ruling on abortion. This is a steep increase since May, when the ruling on Roe v Wade was the primary motivating factor to vote among 30% of the voters, and 43% in July. In May, a leaked draft exposed that the supreme court was preparing to overturn Roe v Wade, sparking protests across the country. The next month the court followed through in the case of Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. Among Republicans, the primary motivating factor to vote was the economy. In its September survey of slightly more than 1,500 American adults, KFF collected strong opinions among both parties about why they were most motivated to vote. \u201cBecause women\u2019s rights are being threatened now more than ever and I\u2019ll be damned if I stand by and let it happen,\u201d said a 29-year-old woman voting Democratic from Alabama, while a 48-year-old Republican man in New York mentioned a wider range of issues: \u201cPersonal investments have plummeted, my grocery bill is astronomical, fuel cost is out of control, bail reform in NYS and criminals across the country are not being punished!\u201d Voters also told the poll they wanted candidates to talk more about abortion. Abortion remains an important and growing issue among women: while a little less than 50% of women said they were more motivated to vote this year than previously, almost 60% of those said it was because of the overturning of Roe v Wade. The poll found the racial group most motivated to vote was white voters, making up a little more than half of that pool; Latino voters were the least motivated. Between parties, Republicans were more motivated to vote in these midterms than Democrats in general, although those numbers are quite close."

            "content": "Brazilians head to the polls on Sunday in their most important election for years, with leftist challenger Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva the slight favourite to put an end to four years of destructive government by the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro. Opinion polls on the eve of the ballot gave Lula, as the Workers\u2019 party candidate is known, a lead of between four and eight percentage points. However, polls before the first round underestimated the incumbent\u2019s numbers and there is no guarantee he will not spring a surprise and win another four years in power. The two candidates slugged it out in a desperate final debate on Friday night that started off with 30 minutes of name calling and improved little over the subsequent two hours. \u201cBolsonaro has not made one proposal for the future of Brazil,\u201d Simone Tebet, who placed third in the first round and is now a Lula backer, said about the president\u2019s persistent attacks. \u201cHe prefers to use the debate to provoke and accuse. It\u2019s the narrative of the defeated.\u201d Lula has all the momentum after a week dominated by setbacks, both prosaic and dramatic, for the populist incumbent. Last Sunday, one of Bolsonaro\u2019s most rabid backers threw grenades at police officers and shot at their cars when they went to arrest him for breaking the rules of his parole. Bolsonaro denied any links to the man, former congressman Roberto Jefferson, but his claims were quickly scotched as photos of the two men were shared widely online. Bolsonaro\u2019s persistent lying \u2013 he is accused of spreading fake news and misinformation \u2013 brought him another setback later in the week, when the supreme electoral court, the body that oversees elections in Brazil, gave Lula time to respond to the falsehoods. The decision meant Lula had significantly more TV and radio spots during the last week of the campaign. A Lula victory would cap one of the most remarkable comebacks in political history. A former union leader who lost three presidential elections before finally winning in 2002, the now 77-year-old led the country for eight years before leaving office with approval ratings above 80%. But his hand-picked successor was impeached and a wide-ranging corruption scandal led to the trial and jailing of several senior Workers\u2019 party officials. Lula himself spent almost two years in prison before his conviction was annulled. Since then he has fought tirelessly against an opponent who will go down in history as much for the way he has tarnished Brazil\u2019s highest office than for any major policy achievements. Bolsonaro frequently belittled opponents and his botched handling of the pandemic ended with almost 700,000 deaths in Brazil. Deforestation in the Amazon rose to a 15-year high and a scandal is brewing over his creation of a \u201csecret budget\u201d that gives money to political allies with little transparency or oversight. In the debate he pointed out that Brazil\u2019s homicide rate fell under his watch and promised to increase the minimum salary \u2013 an important measure in Brazil \u2013 by 15%. Lula, however, reminded voters that his first two terms between 2003-2011 were a success and promised voters more of the same. \u201cTurn out to vote on the 30th,\u201d he said. \u201cVote and we are going to fix the country. And you are going to be happy again.\u201d"

            "content": "Millions displaced. Brutal attacks on civilians. A soaring death toll. Deliberate attacks on infrastructure. And little hope of a negotiated exit. Ethiopia\u2019s northern Tigray region is enduring probably the most brutal and deadly war being waged in the world today. Tens of thousands of combat fatalities have reportedly followed the failure of a ceasefire in August. Yet the world is paying little heed. Assessing the true toll is impossible given that most communications have been cut off. Researchers at the University of Ghent have estimated that between 380,000 and 600,000 civilian lives alone have been lost, with 30,000-90,000 killed in direct attacks, but most dying for lack of food or healthcare. In a region already beset by hunger, but which had made some significant strides, food has become a weapon of war. Nearly half the population is in severe need of food aid. There is clear evidence of war crimes by all parties, including widespread sexual violence, although civilian casualties are believed to be overwhelmingly Tigrayan. The conflict broke out in November 2020, following a political dispute in which the federal and regional Tigray governments declared each other illegitimate. The Ethiopian prime minister and Nobel peace prize winner Abiy Ahmed said he was launching a strike on the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) because it had attacked an army base. Eritrea joined his cause. Many fear that the TPLF could regain the political dominance it enjoyed for decades, while others accuse the prime minister of a power grab. The conflict has become messier, more fractured and more entrenched as it has gone on, with the neighbouring Amhara region also drawn in. While some food aid finally arrived in Tigray this spring, Addis Ababa and its allies continued to block commercial traffic to the region, fuel shipments remained extremely limited, and electricity, telecommunications and banking services remained cut off. Now even the humanitarian operations are once again suspended. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has warned that the situation is spiralling out of control and there is no military solution. Yet Mr Abiy and his allies still appear bent on one. Their current offensive is infantry-heavy, with poorly trained and equipped troops flung towards enemy lines, in addition to airstrikes. Eritrea has intensified mobilisation, reportedly detaining parents whose adult children try to avoid conscription. Despite significant setbacks, many Tigrayans have come to see this as a fight for their very survival; giving up may look as dangerous as persisting. The International Crisis Group has warned of a serious risk of accelerating atrocities, especially given the surge in hate speech against Tigrayans. There are also concerns that the war could spill over given the poor relations and long-running border dispute between the federal government and Sudan. The African Union, the obvious forum for pursuing a solution, has failed to make progress. While the US has invested effort in diplomacy, it has not always been consistent in following through. The European Union has seemed largely uninterested, especially since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Though there is a good case for UN action, including an arms embargo, the path is strewn with obstacles. Donors must make clear to Addis Ababa that anything more than humanitarian assistance cannot resume until it lifts the blockade and shows it is serious about pursuing peace. Tigray\u2019s leaders must similarly demonstrate commitment to African Union talks scheduled for Monday. The collapse of the truce is deeply alarming. But another halt to the disastrous conflict is possible. It will not happen without significant and sustained external pressure: that must be applied, and it must be done now."

            "content": "A great treat for the kids with the gift of species conservation thrown in \u2013 or a wildlife prison? Trips to the zoo have become a far less simple day out than they used to be. Animal rights activists have no doubt where the truth lies: \u201cNo one should ever support zoos,\u201d said Peta, the animal rights organisation. Captivity is a stultifying, daily torment for animals meant to freely wander vast distances, activists argue. Animals are meant to make their own choices about what to eat, where to sleep and who mate with \u2013 decisions taken from them in zoos. Deprived of stimulation, research has found that many animals are trapped in spaces that are all-too-often \u201cliving hells\u201d: three-quarters of British zoos, aquariums and petting farms have been found to regularly break minimum animal welfare standards. Activists also point out that zoos abduct animals from their natural habitats under the guise of \u201cspecies protection\u201d and get rid of \u201csurplus\u201d animals either by killing them or by selling them to unethical exotic-animal dealers. Zoos argue they do vital conservation work: they hold, research shows, nearly 15% of the global International Union for Conservation of Nature threatened species \u2013 although most zoos are concentrated in temperate regions, whereas most threatened species are tropical. Activists argue that the vast majority of species kept in zoos are not endangered and nor do most zoos have any involvement with reintroduction programmes. \u201cConservation is a con,\u201d said Peta. Zoos argue that their role in educating the public is one their most important roles. A study of children between the ages of seven and 15 who visited London Zoo, however, found that for the majority of them \u2013 including those who took an educator-guided tour of the zoo \u2013 there were no positive educational outcomes. In many cases, the trip even had a negative impact on their understanding of animals and their habitats. \u201cAnd that makes sense,\u201d said Peta. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t go to a prison to learn about typical human society, so why would we try to learn about animals by observing them in captivity?\u201d"

            "content": "The seven members of BTS \u2013 one of the world\u2019s biggest bands \u2013 will perform military service in their native South Korea, their agency has said, ending a long national debate over whether they should receive an exemption. While many fans of the K-pop sensations were hoping the band members would be given special consideration due to their contribution to the South Korean economy and international prestige, the artists will each serve almost two years in the military. Jin, the oldest member of the group, will be the first to swap his stage outfit for a uniform soon after he turns 30 in December, media reports said. The six other members, born between 1993 and 1997, will follow suit, with the band expected to reform in about 2025, according to their management company, Big Hit Music. Big Hit, part of BTS\u2019s agency Hybe, said on Monday the band\u2019s members were \u201cmoving forward with plans to fulfil their military service\u201d, adding that \u201cas each individual embarks on solo endeavours, it\u2019s the perfect time and the members of BTS are honoured to serve\u201d. \u201cGroup member Jin will initiate the process as soon as his schedule for his solo release is concluded at the end of October,\u201d it added in a statement. \u201cOther members of the group plan to carry out their military service based on their own individual plans.\u201d All able-bodied South Korean men under the age of 30 must serve in the military for between 18 and 21 months \u2013 a duty intended to maintain the country\u2019s ability to defend against a possible attack by North Korea, with which it is technically still at war. Some prominent South Koreans have received exemptions or have been allowed to perform alternative public service, including Olympic and Asian Games medal winners and prize-winning classical musicians and dancers. They include Seong-jin Cho, the first Korean pianist to win the International Chopin Piano Competition, and the Tottenham footballer Son Heung-min, a gold medalist at the 2018 Asian Games. Some South Korean MPs had voiced support for an exemption, despite concerns that it would invite accusations of favouritism, not least among other young men who have no choice but to serve. Refusing to complete military service is a crime in South Korea, and can lead to imprisonment and social stigma, as the actor and singer Steve Yoo discovered when he was deported and banned from entering the country after he avoided conscription by becoming a naturalised US citizen in 2002, months before he was due to be drafted. Earlier this month, Lee Ki-sik, commissioner of the military manpower administration, told MPs it would be \u201cdesirable\u201d for members of the band to carry out their military duties to ensure fairness in the country\u2019s military service. The decision comes months after BTS announced they were taking a break as a group to concentrate on solo careers. The band reunited to perform a free concert on Saturday in Busan in support of the port city\u2019s campaign to host the 2030 World Exposition. The award-winning group have sold more than 30m albums worldwide and picked up two Grammy nominations on their way to reaching the top of the US and UK charts."

            "date": "2022-10-04T13:59:33Z",
            "content": "The declining birthrate in Taiwan could cause \u201cmajor challenges\u201d to the island\u2019s military recruitment capabilities, at a time when Taiwan is building its defences to ward off potential Chinese invasion, its government has been told. Like much of east Asia, Taiwan is facing a demographic crisis, with fewer people having children each year as the population ages. The issue has social and economic effects on countries but in Taiwan there is also concern over its impact on military personnel levels. In a report to Taiwan\u2019s legislative yuan this week, the interior ministry said the number of new conscripts in 2022 would be the lowest level in a decade. Taiwan\u2019s military comprises a volunteer force combined with male conscripts who must serve at least four months of compulsory basic training. But in March, the number of volunteers recruited reached only 85.3% of its target. Taiwan began phasing out its conscription model force in 2013, moving towards becoming entirely volunteer-based for its active-duty cohort in 2018. Recruitment and retention has declined in recent years, at the same time that the military is trying to expand and modernise as it prepares for a potential Chinese invasion. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a Chinese province, which it will take by force if necessary. Taiwan\u2019s government disputes the claim and has vowed to resist any aggressive act. In the report, the ministry pointed to the plummeting birthrates, saying the number of people estimated to be over the age of 18 fell from 138,000 in 2017 to 118,000 in 2022. \u201cIf the number of young people who will be 18 years old in the next few years is estimated, based on the year of birth and the number of babies, there will be a sharp drop, which shows that the recruitment of various volunteer recruitment units will face huge challenges in the future,\u201d it said. Taiwan has one of the world\u2019s lowest birthrates, and it continues to decline. Last year, there was a record low of 153,820 registered births. In 2011, there were 196,627. As well as a shrinking pool of fighting-age adults, military personnel levels have also been hit by low pay discouraging new recruits and a policy that ages people out of active duty at 45. In 2021, the military also reported problems with retention of volunteer soldiers and recruitment among the more elite forces. It said while general forces usually reached recruitment targets, about 20% of new volunteer soldiers turned out to be unfit for duty and leave training early. Among special combat units there was \u201ca gap between the actual number of volunteers and the target set in the recruitment system plan\u201d, it said, leaving some units at below 80% capacity. Dr Dean Karalekas, an expert on civil-military relations in Taiwan at the University of Central Lancashire, said low military participation had problems beyond a declining population, including the poor administration and perception of conscription. He said Taiwan\u2019s government did not have the resources to make the army a competitive career option for people, but could capitalise on shifting social attitudes, with the war in Ukraine making people far more motivated to join efforts to defend Taiwan. \u201cEnding conscription only shifts the military experience away from the majority of society, making the military a much less vital institution in Taiwan \u2013 it places the armed forces on the fringes of society, and outside of the everyday experience of Taiwan\u2019s people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s fine \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s desirable \u2013 for a country that doesn\u2019t face a clear and present threat of annexation, but unfortunately Taiwan is not yet in that position.\u201d Additional reporting by Chi Hui Lin"

            "date": "2022-10-04T16:30:46Z",
            "content": "The federal Coalition has warned against curbing the Australian government\u2019s power to deploy troops to overseas conflicts, with an inquiry considering if such action should require a parliamentary vote. Reform advocates will use the parliamentary inquiry to argue Australia should follow other democracies in requiring parliamentarians to authorise wars so elected representatives are accountable for the consequences. \u201cIt\u2019ll be too late when suddenly we\u2019re told we\u2019re going to war with China,\u201d said Dr Alison Broinowski, a former Australian diplomat and author who is president of Australians for War Powers Reform. At present the prime minister and senior ministers can commit Australia to war without parliamentary approval, although parliament may have non-binding debates. The Howard government sent troops to Iraq in 2003 despite opposition from the Labor party. The joint standing committee on foreign affairs, defence and trade will conduct the inquiry looking at how Australia compares with similar democracies around the world. The defence minister, Richard Marles, has asked the defence subcommittee to consider reforming parliamentary processes and practices to include \u201copportunities for debate to provide greater transparency and accountability\u201d on the deployment of the Australian defence force. But in a sign the eventual changes may be limited, the terms of reference set by Marles also include \u201csecurity implications of pre-notification of ADF deployment that may compromise the safety of ADF personnel, operational security, intelligence and/or have unintended consequences\u201d. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Andrew Wallace, the Liberal MP who is deputy chair of the defence subcommittee, said he was \u201csurprised that the Labor party is even contemplating\u201d a change to a system that had \u201cstood us in good stead for many many years\u201d. \u201cIf we had a situation where the Greens are holding the balance of power in the Senate, or maybe even independents are holding the balance of power in the House of Representatives, someone who could be ideologically opposed to any conflict could act in a way which is significantly contrary to our national interests,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cThe executive has got to be given the power to govern the country and particularly in relation to national security issues. I don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s Labor or Liberal \u2013 they can\u2019t be hamstrung by the parliament.\u201d Asked about the view of reform advocates that there would be exceptions for emergency situations, Wallace said: \u201cBut what war isn\u2019t an emergency? I mean, it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Wallace, who served as speaker of the House of Representatives before the last election, said he would be comfortable with a greater degree of reporting to parliament and further debates about \u201cthe wisdom, or lack thereof, of the decision and how the operation might be going at any one point in time\u201d. \u201cBut that\u2019s very, very different to taking away, usurping the executive\u2019s power to commit,\u201d Wallace said. Julian Hill, a Labor MP and the chair of the defence subcommittee, said his party was honouring an election commitment to hold such an inquiry. Hill said it was \u201can entirely reasonable thing to periodically examine how these exceptionally grave powers and responsibilities are exercised\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most significant decisions vested in executive government under the constitution and it\u2019s appropriate that we examine whether the current processes are sufficient, while making sure that there are no inadvertent security implications of any possible policy changes,\u201d he said. Government agencies are among those likely to give evidence. \u201cThe minister has asked the Department of Defence to cooperate with the inquiry, and that\u2019s what I expect will occur,\u201d Hill said. The Greens have long pushed for reform to the war powers. Senator Jordon Steele-John said the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan showed \u201cthe dire consequences of what happens when that decision is made too quickly with too little scrutiny\u201d. Steele-John, the party\u2019s spokesperson for foreign affairs and peace, said the inquiry was \u201ca great chance for the major parties to be on record about their position\u201d. \u201cSadly, I think we have already seen some disingenuous arguments from both the Coalition and Labor either trying to protect executive power or delegitimise the parliament on this matter even after Australia has elected its largest crossbench ever,\u201d he said. Steele-John has previously proposed a bill to the Senate that would require a majority of both Houses of Parliament to vote in favour of the deployment of ADF personnel overseas except in very exceptional circumstances. Broinowski said: \u201cAll we\u2019re saying is that the democratic process should be used and, if it results in a war that some of us might not want, that\u2019s not for us to say. These are our elected representatives and we want them to be responsible to us, the people.\u201d The inquiry\u2019s deadline for public submissions is 18 November."

            "date": "2022-10-17T07:00:58Z",
            "content": "A senior Democratic lawmaker has raised alarms about the possibility that sensitive US defense technology could be shared with Russia by Saudi Arabia in the wake of the kingdom\u2019s recent decision to side with Moscow over the interests of the US. Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate armed services committee who has proposed a one-year freeze on weapons sales to Saudi following Opec+\u2019s decision to cut oil production, said he would \u201cdig deeper into the risk\u201d in discussions with the Pentagon. \u201cI want some reassurances that they are on top of it and if there are risks, I want to determine what can be done to mitigate those risks immediately,\u201d Blumenthal said in an interview with the Guardian. The comments show the depth of the rift that has emerged between the Saudi monarchy and Democrats in Washington, who have reacted with fury against a recent decision by the Opec oil cartel to begin cutting oil production next month by 2m barrels a day. The decision was seen in the US capital as a sign of Riyadh siding with Russia in its war with Ukraine, and as a possible attempt to hurt Joe Biden and Democrats ahead of next month\u2019s critical midterm election by raising the price of petrol at the pump. Both Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress have expressed frustration with the move and called for a realignment in the Saudi relationship, with the US president warning that Saudi would face \u201cconsequences\u201d for the move. On Sunday, the White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said President Biden will act \u201cmethodically\u201d in re-evaluating the relationship, but options include changes to security assistance to the major oil producer. While Republicans on Capitol Hill have been far less vocal about the Opec+ move, Blumenthal said his discussions with colleagues indicated there would be bipartisan support for measures to curb weapons sales, which is an issue likely to be taken up formally next month. Blumenthal has also suggested that one of his primary areas of concern was making sure that Russia would not benefit from the sensitive technology that has been shared with US partners in Riyadh. \u201cWe are going to be consulting with the Pentagon, speaking to them very frankly about their assessment of the risk in the transfer of technology in advanced weapons systems made already,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not leaping to any conclusions but it needs to be a consideration that is heightened.\u201d The senator also said he supported proposals to shift weapons that are currently in Saudi Arabia, and those en route, to allies in Ukraine. Some analysts have noted that the transfer of weapons to Ukraine would be complicated by the fact that they require US personnel to operate the systems, which would represent an untenable escalation. Blumenthal emphasised that he was not suggesting that any US personnel would train Ukraine forces in Ukraine, but that it was possible to do so outside the country. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at Yale School of Management who has studied arms sales to Saudi and is sharing his research with Senate Democrats, said he has found that the last five years have seen an \u201cunparalleled outsourcing\u201d of the most sensitive US weapons to the kingdom. \u201cWe have no allies including Canada, UK, Israel and Australia with such a unique security partnership as the Saudis, providing them with ownership and local manufacturing capability of our most sensitive strategic weapons,\u201d he said, adding that the arrangements began in 2017, under the Trump administration. \u201cThere has been no public discussion of the impact of this alarming weaponry handoff to the Saudis for self-sufficiency with no US control in the near future,\u201d he said. Jeff Abramson, a senior fellow at the Arms Control Association, said Saudi Arabia had been a major purchaser of US military equipment, including some of its most sophisticated weapons systems, for decades. \u201cIt is plausible that the Saudis have information about those weapons that the United States would not want shared with Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is that the United States supplies weapons to many undemocractic regimes around the globe, with potential sharing of defense information just one of many concerns about how those relationships may harm, rather than help, national and global peace and security.\u201d It is not clear whether Democrats\u2019 rhetoric will lead to action. Biden entered the White House after having promised to treat Saudi crown prince like a \u201cpariah\u201d, but later traveled to Jeddah and gave the Saudi heir a fist bump. Asked about Democrats\u2019 intentions, Blumenthal said: \u201cYou know the old saying \u2018the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u2019?\u201d \u201cFeelings have reached a different point. Saudis brought the president to Saudi Arabia to talk about the whole relationship and we need to rebalance the entire diplomatic and military relationship because it has been so one-sided. This action \u2013 siding with the Russians in this manner \u2013 is so dramatic. I think it calls for a response,\u201d he said. \u201cThe human rights violations inside Saudi Arabia, the fostering of civil war in Yemen, the disrespect for 9/11 families seeking justice, there\u2019s a parade of insults and injuries here [and] now in some ways Saudi Arabia has crossed a line,\u201d he added. On Sunday, Saudi Arabia\u2019s defense minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman, said on Twitter that the decision by OPEC+ to cut oil output was made unanimously for \u201cpurely\u201d economic reasons. The statement echoed a position from last week in which the Saudi foreign ministry rejected criticism of its Opec+ decision and insisted the cartel had acted with unanimity and in its own economic interest. It also rejected any assumption that it could be forced into a policy U-turn. The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment."

            "date": "2022-10-27T02:10:53Z",
            "content": "An attorney for Harvey Weinstein hammered a woman with questions on Wednesday about the lack of forensic evidence that the movie magnate raped her in 2013. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any physical evidence to present to this jury that any of this happened, do you?\u201d lawyer Alan Jackson asked pointedly during cross-examination. \u201cAny photos?\u201d Jackson asked. \u201cNo,\u201d the woman answered. \u201cAny video?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she replied, then added, \u201cDo you think somebody after rape makes a video?\u201d She cried while answering \u201cno\u201d to a series of similar questions about whether she had any documentation of bruises, scrapes, cuts or handprints on her face from Weinstein holding her down, or had been given a sexual assault examination. \u201cDo you have any physical evidence that you were even with Mr Weinstein?\u201d Jackson asked. Her crying grew louder as she answered, \u201cI had his jacket, but I gave it away.\u201d She maintains that Weinstein left her jacket in the room and she gave it to hotel staff, but no lost-and-found records have been discovered to demonstrate it. The woman, a model and actor who was working in Rome, is the first of Weinstein\u2019s accusers to testify at the trial and spent portions of three days on the witness stand. She described the alleged rape in emotional testimony on Tuesday, saying that it left her wanting to \u201cdestroy\u201d herself. She said Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on her hotel bed. \u201cI was kind of hysterical through tears,\u201d she said. \u201cI kept saying \u2018no, no no.\u2019\u201d Prosecutors have presented photographs and other evidence that both Weinstein and the woman were at the Los Angeles Italia Film Festival, which she had come to California to attend in February 2013. But they have not yet produced anything that puts Weinstein at her hotel on the night she says he forced her to perform oral sex on her bed then raped her in her bathroom. The woman did not go to police until October 2017, when an outpouring of rape and sexual assault accusations against Weinstein made him the central figure in the #MeToo movement. She has denied that she was influenced by those stories to go to the police and that she had decided to file a report earlier that year at the urging of her teenage daughter. The woman is going only by \u201cJane Doe 1\u201d in court. Her age and birthplace have also been kept out of court proceedings, though she has said her first language was Russian and she was living at the time with her three children in Italy. Weinstein\u2019s defense tried to poke holes in her testimony and press on inconsistencies in previous accounts she gave to police, to prosecutors, to a grand jury, and in the first two days of her trial testimony. They highlighted the positive Instagram posts she made in the days after the alleged rape, including one selfie apparently taken in the bathroom where she says Weinstein raped her. At one point, Jackson, the defense attorney, read aloud the hashtags on one of her Instagram posts, which were about looking good and summer. The woman repeatedly responded that she was trying to keep up appearances for her career. \u201cI was trying to act like nothing happened,\u201d she said. The woman told prosecutor Paul Thompson that she had been having panic attacks and had hardly slept or eaten since her testimony began on Monday afternoon. It finally ended late on Wednesday. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of rape and sexual assault involving five women. Multiple women are set to testify about Weinstein\u2019s alleged crimes, including Jennifer Siebel Newsom, a documentary film-maker and actor who is now married to the governor of California, Gavin Newsom. The disgraced film producer is already serving a 23-year sentence after being convicted of sex crimes in New York in February 2020. The Associated Press contributed reporting"

            "date": "2022-10-19T02:34:31Z",
            "content": "Stephen Curry opened the season with 33 points, seven assists and six rebounds, and the Golden State Warriors beat LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers 123-109 on Tuesday night after receiving their championship rings in a pregame ceremony. Jordan Poole made a pretty bounce pass to a driving Draymond Green for a layup and all seemed perfectly well with the defending champions almost two weeks after Green punched Poole at practice on 5 October, then took a brief leave of absence from the team to work on his emotions. Poole wound up with 12 points and seven assists. James had 31 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists, while Russell Westbrook scored 19 points and grabbed 11 rebounds after nursing a sore left hamstring. Anthony Davis added 27 points, but the Lakers couldn\u2019t keep up in another signature, runaway third quarter by reigning NBA finals MVP Curry and co. Klay Thompson contributed 18 points in 20 minutes for the Warriors, who celebrated the franchise\u2019s fourth title in eight years. Golden State coach Steve Kerr limited the minutes of both Thompson and Green, who was away from the team until last Thursday. Kerr said he will increase Thompson\u2019s minutes each game as a precaution following his return in January from an absence of more than two and a half years for surgeries to his left knee and right achilles tendon. Warriors center James Wiseman made his first appearance since his rookie season of 2019-20 after sitting out all of last season recovering from right knee surgery. He had eight points and seven rebounds. Curry took the microphone in the middle of Golden State\u2019s championship ring ceremony to make an impassioned plea in support of Brittney Griner as the WNBA star spent her 32nd birthday in a Russian prison. \u201cWe want to continue to use our platform and the opportunity to shout out a very special member of the basketball community. Brittney Griner\u2019s birthday is today, she\u2019s 32,\u201d Curry told the crowd. \u201cWe want to continue to let her name be known and we pray ... it\u2019s been 243 days since she was wrongfully incarcerated in Russia. We hope that she comes home soon, that everybody\u2019s doing their part to get her home.\u201d Philadelphia 76ers 117-126 Boston Celtics Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown each scored 35 points and the Boston Celtics beat the Philadelphia 76ers 126-117 on Tuesday night in the opening game of the NBA regular season. Malcolm Brogdon added 16 points and Grant Williams finished with 15 as the defending Eastern Conference champions gave interim coach Joe Mazzulla a victory in his debut. Mazzulla has been tasked with leading the team after Ime Udoka was suspended for the season following an investigation by a law firm that found he committed multiple violations of team policies. Mazzulla successfully led a Celtics team that very much resembled the one that made a surprise run to the NBA finals a season ago. Boston opened up a 110-97 lead with eight minutes to play and never trailed again. James Harden scored 35 points his most since joining the 76ers last season including 12 of 12 from the free throw line. He also had five three-pointers. Joel Embiid added 26 points and 15 rebounds. Tyrese Maxey finished with 21 points. Mazzulla has vowed to keep the focus on building upon the culture Udoka established on the court as a rookie head coach last season. He insists that it will be done primarily on the defensive end of the floor, but the offense was the story for the Celtics on Tuesday with 56% shooting from the field. With big man Robert Williams sidelined as he recovers from offseason surgery on his knee, the Celtics stuck with the same starting lineup they employed during the preseason, playing defensive stalwart Derrick White alongside Marcus Smart, Tatum, Brown and Al Horford. The smaller group sped Philadelphia up at times, forcing the 76ers into 14 turnovers for the game, leading to 22 Boston points. The 76ers are looking to contend with the top teams in the Eastern Conference with Harden embarking on his first full season in Philadelphia after being swapped for Ben Simmons late last season in a trade with Brooklyn. Harden looked rejuvenated coming off a season defined by hamstring injuries that hampered his effectiveness in a truncated 21 regular-season games with the Sixers last season. The 10-time All-Star frustrated the Celtics, displaying the mobility he was missing a year ago. He was able to get to the free throw line often. He also was effective from the three-point line, connecting on four in the first half, including a rainbow heave from the top of the key to beat the shot clock late in the second quarter."

            "date": "2022-10-25T08:41:19Z",
            "content": "Jim Chalmers says spending restraint in the face of skyrocketing inflation has defined the Albanese government\u2019s first budget, as the country faces a \u201ccomplex combination\u201d of economic pressures that pose further risks to households. Delivering the first Labor budget in almost a decade on Tuesday, the treasurer also flagged the need for tax reform in this term of government to be able to put the budget on a more sustainable footing as spending pressures mount and government debt and deficits worsen across the forward estimates. Chalmers also signalled more government intervention in the energy sector, saying he is \u201cworried\u201d about gas and electricity price rises of up to 30% next year. The budget contains few new commitments beyond those promised before the election, with a housing policy that aims to boost supply by a million homes by 2030 the headline announcement, backed by $350m in new funding. It also delivers on Labor\u2019s key election promises, allocating $7.5bn for childcare reforms, aged care, cheaper medicines and expanding paid parental leave. Chalmers said with inflation tipped to be higher and more persistent than previously forecast, the government had put a premium on spending restraint to ensure it did not add to pressures already faced by households. \u201cRestraint is the name of the game in this budget, restraint is what defines this budget, and what differentiates it from March and from recent budgets under our predecessors,\u201d he said. Amid a \u201chighly uncertain\u201d global economic outlook that poses the risk of a further downturn in Australia, the treasurer said he had resisted calls for cash handouts to help people deal with cost-of-living concerns, saying he did not want to make the problem worse. Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup \u201cThe message I have for Australians all around the country is that the worst thing that we could do is to contribute to even higher inflation. We don\u2019t want cost of living relief to be counterproductive.\u201d While confining its cost-of-living measures mostly to those promised before the election \u2013 with the most expensive being the government\u2019s childcare reforms \u2013 Chalmers said the government was looking to do more to combat rising energy prices, with the budget forecasting retail electricity price rises of 20% this year and 30% in 2023-24. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend that we\u2019re not worried about these electricity price forecasts,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cI think any responsible government facing these kinds of price hikes for electricity and for gas needs to consider a broader suite of regulatory interventions than they might have considered in years gone by.\u201d In an attempt to limit the budget\u2019s impact on inflation, the government has returned 99% of the increase in tax revenues to the budget over the next two years and offset most of its policy decisions in that timeframe. In contrast, Chalmers said, the seven budgets between the mid-year budget update in 2013-14 and the March budget had returned an average of 40%. The budget\u2019s key new measure is an affordable housing accord signed with industry and the states, with an \u201caspirational target\u201d to build 1m new homes in five years from 2024 that would target areas of low vacancy and high rents. Details are yet to be fleshed out with institutional investors, with work to be pursued by a newly formed \u201cround table\u201d of representatives from the superannuation and banking sector. Savings of $22bn have been found across the forward estimates, with the largest of these \u2013 $6.5bn \u2013 coming from \u201creprofiling\u201d of infrastructure spending promised by the former government. The government\u2019s budget repair task has also been boosted by a revenue boom coming from soaring commodity prices and a strong labour market, which has delivered a $41.1bn improvement to the budget bottom line in 2022-23, and a $12.5bn improvement next year. Cumulative deficits over the forward estimates now total $181bn, compared with the $224.7bn forecast before the election. But from 2024-25 as commodity prices decline, the deficits are worse than previously forecast, peaking at 2% of GDP in 2024-25 to be $51.3bn, and at $49.6bn in 2025-26. This is $11bn worse than forecast in March. Chalmers said the government had demonstrated it was prepared to take \u201cdifficult decisions in difficult times\u201d but there remained a bigger job ahead to put the budget on a more sustainable footing given the worsening outlook. He said the task could not wait until after the next election: \u201cI don\u2019t think that that work can wait for another three or four budgets, it has been neglected for too long, and so we do hope to lead a conversation this term about how we get this budget on a more sustainable footing.\u201d The spending pressures include interest payments on government debt which are growing at 14.4% annually, followed by a 13.8% annual increase on national disability insurance scheme spending, and 6.5% for hospital spending. Despite the government ruling out tweaks to the stage-three tax cuts in this budget, Chalmers said he believed the \u201cnational conversation\u201d about how to fund the services that Australians expected needed to canvass the possibility of changes to the tax system. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done in this budget is we\u2019ve built the foundation of a more sustainable budget but there\u2019s more work to do, and that will involve ongoing spending restraint, it will involve trimming spending where we can, targeting investments, and also tax reform,\u201d he said. The government\u2019s post-election budget paints a grim picture of the economic outlook, with warnings there could be a sharper slowdown in domestic activity that could place further pressures on households. Growth has already been downgraded by one percentage point to 1.5% next year, and down 0.25% this year to 3.25%. Globally, key risks include recession across major advanced economies, a sharper-than-expected downturn in China, a sudden tightening in financial markets and further energy price shocks stemming from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These risks could drive inflation even higher than the 5.75% forecast for 2022-23, with inflation set to peak at 7.75% in the December quarter this year. The budget papers also point to the uncertainty linked to the floods, future interest rate rises and household responses to inflation as key risks to economic activity. \u201cHigher-than-expected inflation may further constrain consumer spending by lowering real incomes, while a potentially weaker economic outlook could see households exhibit precautionary savings behaviour that further weighs on consumption,\u201d they say. They also say low-income households are expected to be more heavily affected by the high-inflation environment, as essentials such as housing costs and energy make up a larger share of their household expenses. Wages are not expected to outpace inflation until 2023-24, when they are forecast to grow 3.75% compared with the consumer price index of 3.5%, at the same time as unemployment jumps from 3.75% to 4.5%. The opposition\u2019s treasury spokesman, Angus Taylor, accused the government of breaking an election promise to reduce power bills by $275, and said the budget would not help ease cost of living concerns. \u201cThe real test \u2026 was whether Labor was going to deal with the cost of living pressures Australians are facing,\u201d Taylor told the ABC. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that if you are a typical Australian household, you are not going to see any improvement between now and Christmas.\u201d"

            "content": "Libraries and children\u2019s centres are closing and home pick-ups for young disabled people being cancelled as councils try to meet a \u00a33.2bn budget shortfall next year. With inflation and energy prices eating into budgets, local authorities across the UK are facing a record black hole that is unlikely to be plugged by central governmentas the Treasury is seeking to squeeze spending to make up for a \u00a330-50bn shortfall in the public finances. The trade union Unison collected data from 391 councils, compiled through freedom of information requests and financial statements, and found that almost nine in 10 have a predicted budget gap in the 2023/24 financial year. Unison said its data shows the biggest budget shortfall of \u00a380m next year is being faced by Birmingham city council, which lists Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget as one of the contributing factors in its worsening finances. In the last few days, the numbers have worsened in several major council areas. Edinburgh council reported this week it is also facing a \u00a380m black hole, up from \u00a370m last month, with the Labour local leader warning of \u201cprobably the worst cuts I\u2019ve seen in my time in this council\u201d. Kent county council said it was increasing its projected overspend to \u00a370m, up from \u00a350m just three months ago, with its Conservative council leader telling colleagues: \u201cWe\u2019ve never been looking at a projected set of pressures on this scale; no one should doubt the gravity of the situation.\u201d It said not a single department would be immune from cuts. In Lancashire, the council said this week that its project shortfall has almost trebled, from \u00a330.5m to \u00a387m \u2013 even bigger than Birmingham. It is looking at cost-cutting measures on everything from cutting the grass less often to spending less on children\u2019s home placements. Unison\u2019s investigation found that waste collections, leisure centres, nurseries and other vital services are already being cut in some local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales as they prepare for a tough year ahead. The data suggested the cumulative funding gap is to worsen to more than \u00a35.28bn in 2024/25. Some of the current and impending cuts include: - Wirral Council shutting nine libraries by the end of this month, with two being handed to community and church groups - Gateshead Council looking at closing two leisures centres deemed \u201cunaffordable\u201d as it grapples with a \u00a36.5m shortfall - Leeds city council cancelling Bonfire Night events in six locations next month to save \u00a3200,000 of non-essential spending at a time of budget pressures - Hillingdon council, covering Boris Johnson\u2019s constituency, planning to close all three of its nurseries, which provide more than 100 childcare places across the borough - Hampshire County Council planning to scrap a transport scheme that take thousands of disabled children to school to save \u00a31m. Home pick-ups would be replaced with drop-off points - Norfolk county council planning to reduce access to recycling centres by closing them on Wednesdays, with its Tory council leader warning he had never dealt with funding reductions on this scale, to plug a \u00a360m gap The Local Government Association has warned Jeremy Hunt in a letter that the \u00a33bn-plus shortfall facing councils will lead to cuts, particularly as inflation has worsened since the last local government finance settlement was announced. \u201cWithout immediate additional funding, councils will face increasingly stark decisions about which services to stop providing as rising costs hit budgets. This means not just isolated closures of individual facilities but significant cuts to services people rely on, including those to the most vulnerable in our society,\u201d it said. On Thursday, the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) also said its councils were facing pressures \u201con a scale never seen\u201d, with \u201cpainful cuts\u201d to come. Christina McAnea, the general secretary of Unison, which represents 600,000 local government workers, said: \u201cCash-strapped councils are having to resort to ever more desperate measures after years of austerity just to keep services going. Now the government looks set to make their predicament infinitely worse with emergency cuts to spending after the mini-budget fiasco. \u201cLocal communities cannot be the ones to pay the price for the government\u2019s grotesque mismanagement of the economy. The new prime minister and chancellor must sort the crisis in local government funding, and give councils the cash they need to save services.\u201d Asked about the \u00a380m shortfall at Birmingham, which is the biggest local authority, council leader Ian Ward said: \u201cLike councils across the country, we are currently working up budget proposals for 2023/24 and everything possible will be done to safeguard the vital services that people across Birmingham rely on. \u201cAs the Local Government Association has made clear, soaring inflation, energy prices and \u2018National Living Wage\u2019 pressures are putting council services at risk, while the cost of living crisis, made worse by the Tories crashing our economy, means increased demand for support and services. \u201cThis is a perfect storm for local government and without government action, councils will have no choice but to significantly cut local services. So, if the government is truly committed to levelling up, then the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement on 17 November must not signal a return to austerity.\u201d A government spokesperson said further details of spending will be set out in the autumn statement in November. \u201cWe recognise councils may be concerned about their budgets in the face of the difficult economic times we are in and we continue to work very closely with them to understand the impact inflation may have,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThis year alone we have made an additional \u00a33.7bn available to ensure councils have the resources they need to deliver vital public services.\u201d"

            "content": "The 0.50-caliber gun used by the Mexican Jalisco cartel to shoot down a Mexican military helicopter in 2015 came from a gun supplier in Portland, Oregon, a joint Mexico-US investigation has found. On Wednesday, the Louisville Courier Journal reported confirmation of the connection between the incident and Portland, Oregon by federal firearm officials. The investigation found that Erik Flores Elortegui, a 40-year-old Mexican native and US citizen, was responsible for providing the Jalisco cartel, also known as C\u00e1rtel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n, or CJNG, with the belt-fed semiautomatic weapon. The gun was used to blast down the Mexican military helicopter on 1 May 2015 during which several Mexican national defense soldiers were on a covert mission to arrest Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes or El Mencho, the world\u2019s top cartel boss. The failed mission resulted in the deaths of nine Mexican law enforcement officers and numerous others injured when cartel members fired the gun into the helicopter\u2019s rotor, causing it to combust into flames and spin several times in the air before it hit the ground. As a result of the incident, the Mexican attorney general asked the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to trace the origins of the machine gun. \u201cAfter it was recovered, we obtained information, and we were able to trace it back to Erik Flores,\u201d Jason Chudy, a spokesperson for the ATF\u2019s Seattle field division, which also covers Oregon, told the Courier Journal. Elortegui is currently on the ATF\u2019s Most Wanted list. On the ATF website, Elortegui is listed as being indicted in the US district court of Oregon in 2015 for false statements in connection with the acquisition of firearms and smuggling goods from the US. According to the indictment reviewed by the Courier Journal, ATF found that Elortegui purchased the $15,350 (\u00a313,264) gun at a gun shop in Rainier, a city in Washington state. The indictment alleges that Elortegui lied on the ATF form and indicated that he wanted the weapon for himself. On the form, he also listed his home as Beaverton, Oregon, a city located 7 miles (11km) west of Portland. According to the ATF, Elortegui was born in Durango, Mexico, and became an American citizen in 2009. Court records reviewed by the Courier Journal reveal that the ATF was already investigating him and another individual for making various straw purchases of weapons and accessories in 2013 and 2014, as well as illegally exporting the weapons. Elortegui remains at large."

            "date": "2022-10-17T10:03:57Z",
            "content": "The seven members of BTS \u2013 one of the world\u2019s biggest bands \u2013 will perform military service in their native South Korea, their agency has said, ending a long national debate over whether they should receive an exemption. While many fans of the K-pop sensations were hoping the band members would be given special consideration due to their contribution to the South Korean economy and international prestige, the artists will each serve almost two years in the military. Jin, the oldest member of the group, will be the first to swap his stage outfit for a uniform soon after he turns 30 in December, media reports said. The six other members, born between 1993 and 1997, will follow suit, with the band expected to reform in about 2025, according to their management company, Big Hit Music. Big Hit, part of BTS\u2019s agency Hybe, said on Monday the band\u2019s members were \u201cmoving forward with plans to fulfil their military service\u201d, adding that \u201cas each individual embarks on solo endeavours, it\u2019s the perfect time and the members of BTS are honoured to serve\u201d. \u201cGroup member Jin will initiate the process as soon as his schedule for his solo release is concluded at the end of October,\u201d it added in a statement. \u201cOther members of the group plan to carry out their military service based on their own individual plans.\u201d All able-bodied South Korean men under the age of 30 must serve in the military for between 18 and 21 months \u2013 a duty intended to maintain the country\u2019s ability to defend against a possible attack by North Korea, with which it is technically still at war. Some prominent South Koreans have received exemptions or have been allowed to perform alternative public service, including Olympic and Asian Games medal winners and prize-winning classical musicians and dancers. They include Seong-jin Cho, the first Korean pianist to win the International Chopin Piano Competition, and the Tottenham footballer Son Heung-min, a gold medalist at the 2018 Asian Games. Some South Korean MPs had voiced support for an exemption, despite concerns that it would invite accusations of favouritism, not least among other young men who have no choice but to serve. Refusing to complete military service is a crime in South Korea, and can lead to imprisonment and social stigma, as the actor and singer Steve Yoo discovered when he was deported and banned from entering the country after he avoided conscription by becoming a naturalised US citizen in 2002, months before he was due to be drafted. Earlier this month, Lee Ki-sik, commissioner of the military manpower administration, told MPs it would be \u201cdesirable\u201d for members of the band to carry out their military duties to ensure fairness in the country\u2019s military service. The decision comes months after BTS announced they were taking a break as a group to concentrate on solo careers. The band reunited to perform a free concert on Saturday in Busan in support of the port city\u2019s campaign to host the 2030 World Exposition. The award-winning group have sold more than 30m albums worldwide and picked up two Grammy nominations on their way to reaching the top of the US and UK charts."

            "title": "Taiwan\u2019s military recruitment pool shrinking due to low birthrate",
            "date": "2022-10-04T13:59:33Z",
            "content": "The declining birthrate in Taiwan could cause \u201cmajor challenges\u201d to the island\u2019s military recruitment capabilities, at a time when Taiwan is building its defences to ward off potential Chinese invasion, its government has been told. Like much of east Asia, Taiwan is facing a demographic crisis, with fewer people having children each year as the population ages. The issue has social and economic effects on countries but in Taiwan there is also concern over its impact on military personnel levels. In a report to Taiwan\u2019s legislative yuan this week, the interior ministry said the number of new conscripts in 2022 would be the lowest level in a decade. Taiwan\u2019s military comprises a volunteer force combined with male conscripts who must serve at least four months of compulsory basic training. But in March, the number of volunteers recruited reached only 85.3% of its target. Taiwan began phasing out its conscription model force in 2013, moving towards becoming entirely volunteer-based for its active-duty cohort in 2018. Recruitment and retention has declined in recent years, at the same time that the military is trying to expand and modernise as it prepares for a potential Chinese invasion. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a Chinese province, which it will take by force if necessary. Taiwan\u2019s government disputes the claim and has vowed to resist any aggressive act. In the report, the ministry pointed to the plummeting birthrates, saying the number of people estimated to be over the age of 18 fell from 138,000 in 2017 to 118,000 in 2022. \u201cIf the number of young people who will be 18 years old in the next few years is estimated, based on the year of birth and the number of babies, there will be a sharp drop, which shows that the recruitment of various volunteer recruitment units will face huge challenges in the future,\u201d it said. Taiwan has one of the world\u2019s lowest birthrates, and it continues to decline. Last year, there was a record low of 153,820 registered births. In 2011, there were 196,627. As well as a shrinking pool of fighting-age adults, military personnel levels have also been hit by low pay discouraging new recruits and a policy that ages people out of active duty at 45. In 2021, the military also reported problems with retention of volunteer soldiers and recruitment among the more elite forces. It said while general forces usually reached recruitment targets, about 20% of new volunteer soldiers turned out to be unfit for duty and leave training early. Among special combat units there was \u201ca gap between the actual number of volunteers and the target set in the recruitment system plan\u201d, it said, leaving some units at below 80% capacity. Dr Dean Karalekas, an expert on civil-military relations in Taiwan at the University of Central Lancashire, said low military participation had problems beyond a declining population, including the poor administration and perception of conscription. He said Taiwan\u2019s government did not have the resources to make the army a competitive career option for people, but could capitalise on shifting social attitudes, with the war in Ukraine making people far more motivated to join efforts to defend Taiwan. \u201cEnding conscription only shifts the military experience away from the majority of society, making the military a much less vital institution in Taiwan \u2013 it places the armed forces on the fringes of society, and outside of the everyday experience of Taiwan\u2019s people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s fine \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s desirable \u2013 for a country that doesn\u2019t face a clear and present threat of annexation, but unfortunately Taiwan is not yet in that position.\u201d Additional reporting by Chi Hui Lin"

            "date": "2022-10-28T04:00:18Z",
            "content": "The Syrian intelligence officer at the centre of one of the most shocking acts of the civil war \u2013 the Tadamon massacre \u2013 is still working on a military base outside Damascus and has since been accused by colleagues of directing up to a dozen more mass killings. Amjad Yousef, a major in one of Syria\u2019s most feared intelligence units, is operating from the Kafr Sousa base, where he has been for most of the past six months since the Guardian revealed his role in shooting dead dozens of people across a death pit in Tadamon, a suburb of the Syrian capital in 2013. A former colleague of Yousef\u2019s said he had admitted to the killings in a phone call with a mutual friend. \u201cHe said \u2018Yes I did it. That is what I had to do at the time.\u2019 No one was shocked we knew him. And we know the regime,\u201d the former colleague told the Guardian. The images shocked the Syrian diaspora and drew condemnation across Europe and in Washington. France, Germany and the Netherlands have all opened war crimes investigations using laws of universal jurisdiction and are hunting any perpetrators who may have escaped to European soil. German investigators believe they may have identified an associate of Yousef\u2019s now living in Germany and are preparing a case against the former intelligence officer. The Tadamon revelations also caused uproar in Syria, rattling the country\u2019s leadership, which usually keeps a vice-like grip on state secrets, and causing widespread anger even among supporters of the president, Bashar al-Assad. After the revelations, close to 100 long-term prisoners were released from government dungeons. Some had been locked up for more than a decade. The former colleague of Yousef\u2019s told the Guardian that the major had been a feared presence in Tadamon for the past decade, and had regularly snatched women from the streets of the suburb, many of whom were never seen again. \u201cI saw him take women from a bread queue one morning. They were innocent. They had done nothing. They were either raped, or killed. Nothing less.\u201d Yousef was identified through research conducted by Prof U\u011fur \u00dcng\u00f6r and the researcher Annsar Shahoud from the University of Amsterdam\u2019s Institute of Holocaust and Genocide Studies. The academics were leaked 27 videos, which were downloaded from the laptop used by Branch 227 of the Syrian intelligence, \u2013 of which Yousef was deputy leader. The sources who leaked the videos fled Syria earlier this year and their identities are being sought by the country\u2019s military intelligence, which has opened an inquiry into how the material was leaked. In an unpublished video, seen by the Guardian, Yousef shoots up to six women across a pit as his death quad looks on, and sometimes joins the slaughter. The pit is then set alight and a bulldozer brings ash and debris to fill it in, in what appears to be an attempt to eliminate evidence of the war crime. The former colleague said up to a dozen more massacres were carried out in Tadamon and that local people were well aware of the locations. \u201cAll of the people were Sunnis,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was sectarian cleansing. Nothing else. It was Alawites eliminating Sunnis.\u201d A sectarian dimension to the killings had been suspected, but two more of Yousef\u2019s former colleagues had suggested they were also intended as a warning to communities in or near Tadamon not to collaborate with opposition groups. The source said all massacre sites in Tadamon were no-go zones for local residentsand that the final death toll of killings by Branch 227 could be as high as 350. The videos marked one of the only examples in the Syrian war where senior regime officials were shown committing atrocities. The unit recorded the videos to demonstrate to senior leaders \u2013 and even Syria\u2019s political regime \u2013 what had taken place. Assad reacted angrily when France announced in August that it would open a war crimes inquiry, telling Paris it was using the allegations as a pretext to try to re-colonise Syria. France said its counterterrorism prosecutor\u2019s office had been handed the videos. \u201cThe alleged actions are likely to constitute the most serious international crimes, specifically crimes against humanity and war crimes. The fight against impunity is a matter of justice for the victims. It is also an essential prerequisite for building a lasting peace in Syria. After a decade of crimes against the Syrian people, France remains committed to ensuring that those responsible are brought to justice,\u201d a government spokesperson said.

            "date": "2022-10-19T11:31:07Z",
            "content": "The EU plans to impose sanctions on three senior Iranian military commanders and the company that develops drones believed to have been used in Russia\u2019s attacks on Ukraine. The draft sanctions list, seen by the Guardian, is expected to be agreed within days, indicating EU ministers do not believe Iran\u2019s denials that it has supplied Russia with the low-flying lethal weapons. The proposals came as Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, condemned Russia\u2019s strikes on critical energy infrastructure as \u201cacts of pure terror\u201d that amounted to war crimes. Ukrainian officials have said \u201ckamikaze\u201d drones targeted Kyiv on Monday, in attacks that killed four people, including a pregnant woman and her partner. Videos taken in the Ukrainian capital showed Iran\u2019s Shahed drones, with their distinctive triangle shape, flying low over the city and then crashing into the ground, as terrified people fled. GPS-guided Shahed 136 drones can fly up to 1,500 miles from trucks launched outside Ukraine and are believed to have been deployed across the country since August. Although they fly slowly, making them vulnerable to being shot down, their sheer numbers are proving a test for Ukraine\u2019s air defences. The EU sanctions are targeted at Shahed Aviation Industries, which EU officials say has links to Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 aerospace force and is responsible for the design and development of the unmanned aerial vehicles. The EU plans to target three senior military figures, including the chief of staff of Iran\u2019s armed forces, Maj Gen Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, said by officials to play a fundamental role in Iran\u2019s defence cooperation with Russia. Also listed is Gen Sayed Hojatollah Qureishi, who is in charge of supply and research at Iran\u2019s defence ministry, and Brig Gen Saeed Aghajani, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps aerospace force UAV command. Qureishi is said to have been responsible for negotiating the supply agreement with Russia, while Aghajani is described by the EU listing as \u201cthe backbone of Iran\u2019s unmanned aerial vehicles programme\u201d. The final list has still to be approved by senior EU diplomats from the 27 member states before it comes into force. Largely symbolic, the sanctions ban the individuals from entering the EU and freeze any assets held in the bloc. Adding Iranian names to the EU\u2019s existing Russia sanctions is a relatively straightforward step in comparison with measures targeting Iran\u2019s economy, which is already subject to western trade embargos over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. Iran has repeatedly denied supplying Russia with drones, putting Tehran at odds with Ukraine, western officials and many independent experts who say that Shahed 136 drones have been widely used in Russia\u2019s attacks. An anonymous Iranian official told Reuters that Russia had asked for more Iranian drones and ballistic missiles with \u201cimproved accuracy\u201d when senior officials from Tehran visited Moscow recently. Lithuania\u2019s foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, one of the EU\u2019s most hawkish voices on sanctions, tweeted: \u201cIf Iran walks like a duck, talks like a duck and admits to supplying drones to the biggest duck in the world then I think we have enough evidence to say that Iran is a duck. Let\u2019s sanction the duck out of them.\u201d The latest response to Iran comes after the EU slapped sanctions on 11 Iranian officials and four entities believed to be responsible for the violent crackdown on peaceful protesters demonstrating against the regime, after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in custody. In further condemnation of Russia, meanwhile, Von der Leyen said: \u201cYesterday we saw again Russia\u2019s targeted attacks against civilian infrastructure. This is marking another chapter in an already very cruel war. The international order is very clear. These are war crimes. \u201cTargeted attacks on civilian infrastructure with the clear aim to cut off men, women, children of water, electricity and heating with the winter coming, these are acts of pure terror and we have to call it as such.\u201d"

            "title": "Are Putin\u2019s nuclear threats really likely to lead to Armageddon?",
            "date": "2022-10-07T19:20:24Z",
            "content": "The past week has seen a rapid escalation in nuclear rhetoric, beginning with Vladimir Putin\u2019s threat to use \u201call forces and means\u201d to defend newly seized territory in Ukraine and ending with Joe Biden\u2019s warning of \u201cArmageddon\u201d if Russia crosses the nuclear Rubicon. However, the realities underlying the menacing vocabulary are a far greyer area than the bluster suggests. It is far from certain that Putin would be prepared to be the first leader to use nuclear weapons in wartime since 1945, over his territorial ambitions in Ukraine. If his primary goal is to stay in power, that could be exactly the wrong way of going about it. Even if he did issue the launch order, he has no guarantee it would be carried out. Nor can he be absolutely sure that the weapons and their delivery systems would work. On the US side, despite the US president\u2019s apocalyptic language at a private fundraiser on Thursday night, it is not at all inevitable that Washington would respond to Putin\u2019s nuclear use with nuclear retaliation. Past wargaming suggests there would be vigorous debate within the administration to say the least. Like US presidents, Putin is normally accompanied by an aide carrying a briefcase with codes used to authorise a nuclear launch. In the US it is called the football, in Russia it is the cheget. In the Russian system, the defence minister and the chief of the general staff have their own chegets but it is believed that Putin can order a launch without them. However, the cheget is relevant for the strategic nuclear forces, the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) launched from land or sea, or long-range bombers. Because they need to be launched within minutes in case of enemy attack, the warheads need to be deployed, mounted on the delivery systems. Any nuclear use in Ukraine would be likely to involve non-strategic, or tactical, weapons with shorter-range delivery systems, and which are usually (but not necessarily) less powerful than strategic arms, though on average they are many times more powerful that the Hiroshima or Nagasaki bombs. The US only has one kind of tactical weapon, the B61 gravity bomb, of which there are about a hundred in Europe and a similar number in the US, according to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS). FAS estimates Russia has 2,000 tactical weapons, in very many shapes and sizes for use on land, sea and air. The weapons are not deployed on missiles or aircraft, but kept in bunkers in storage sites dotted around Russia. There are 12 national storage sites, known in Russian military parlance as \u201cObject S\u201d, one of which is in Belgorod, right on the Ukrainian border. There are also 34 \u201cbase-level\u201d sites, closer to the delivery systems. In a time of crisis, warheads would be moved from national to base-level sites \u2013 and up to now western intelligence agencies say no such movement has been observed. Any such movement would be carried out by the 12th main directorate of the Russian armed forces, which has the job of storing and maintaining the warheads and then delivering them in specialised trains or trucks to base-level sites, or directly to the unit designated to launch them. Pavel Baev, a military researcher who worked for the Soviet defence ministry, said that Putin cannot count on these weapons actually working. \u201cMost of these warheads stored there are very old,\u201d Baev, now a professor at the Peace Research Institute Oslo, said. \u201cWithout testing it\u2019s really hard to say how suitable they are because many of them are past their expiration date.\u201d Baev added that it was also far from clear that the Russian can successfully pair old warheads with the much newer delivery systems that would have to be used, possibly 9K720 Iskander or Kinzhal hypersonic missiles. Not all analysts have such a dim view of the state of the tactical arsenal. Pavel Podvig, who runs a research project called Russian Nuclear Forces and is a senior research fellow at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a maintenance protocol. There are ways of checking whether a weapon is in good health.\u201d What may be more likely to break down, however, is the chain of command if Putin gave such an alarming and extreme order. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to follow the order to start a \u2018special military operation\u2019 that you understand will be over in three days,\u201d Podvig said. \u201cIt\u2019s another thing to accept the order to drop a nuclear bomb. There\u2019s a sense that this kind of order would be universally considered as criminal. I think the calculation would change.\u201d The Russian leader is already reported to be facing dissent from his inner circle. Taking the leap to nuclear use could stretch his authority to breaking point. \u201cI think it would be prohibitively risky for any commander-in-chief to give this order because if you give the order and it\u2019s not executed, it backfires,\u201d Baev said. If Putin decided to gamble everything and if his military officers went along with him and managed to detonate a weapon in or around Ukraine, then Biden and his team would be faced with choices that all modern US presidents have hoped they would never have to make. US warnings to Russia in recent days have been vague on what the response would be, saying only that it would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. The White House needs to keep its room for manoeuvre, depending on what Russia does, whether it is a \u201cdemonstration\u201d blast over the Black Sea or the Arctic, or the bombing of a Ukrainian military target or \u2013 the worst-case scenario \u2013 a city. In 2016, the Obama administration carried out war gaming exercises to test its communications channels and decision-making process in the event of a Russian use of a tactical nuclear weapon. There were deep disagreements that led on some occasions to heated arguments. \u201cThe debate broke down along two pretty important lines,\u201d said Jon Wolfsthal, who was Barack Obama\u2019s special assistant and senior director at the national security council for arms control and non-proliferation. The first question was whether \u201cthe US or Nato needed to respond militarily\u201d. \u201cIn the game, the answer was no. The US was winning the conventional war,\u201d Wolfsthal, who writes a Substack column titled BoomBoomBoom, said. The counter-argument was that the US could not afford not to respond with nuclear weapons. \u201cThere were those who said if you don\u2019t use nuclear weapons, two terrible things will happen. One is: all of our allies will doubt our commitment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second is: if you don\u2019t use a nuclear weapon in response, how do you deter Putin from going nuclear again? You needed nukes to re-establish deterrence. \u201cWe never answered that. We never settled that debate,\u201d Wolfsthal said. The 2016 war game \u2013 first reported in The Bomb, a book by Fred Kaplan \u2013 was played twice, at the level of cabinet secretary, the \u201cprincipals\u201d and by their deputies. The principals voted to respond with a nuclear strike, but not on Russia, in the hope of avoiding an all-out planet-ending nuclear exchange. Instead they struck Belarus, arguing it was a \u201cbelligerent non-combatant\u201d. The deputies voted not to respond with nuclear weapons, arguing that the US could win with conventional weapons and that nuclear use would make it much harder to isolate Putin internationally. Two of the officials who pushed that option are now in senior positions in the Biden administration: Colin Kahl is the Pentagon\u2019s policy chief, and Avril Haines is the director of national intelligence. After the war games were over, Haines suggested having T-shirts printed with the slogan \u201cDeputies Should Run the World\u201d. The 2016 war game was set in a Baltic nation, so inside Nato and under its protective nuclear umbrella. Ukraine stands outside that umbrella. Ernest Moniz, Obama\u2019s energy secretary is reported to have voted for a nuclear response in 2016. He would not comment or even confirm the war game took place, but he said Ukraine was a very different case. \u201cI would say that if the line is crossed to nuclear use, there has to be a very, very strong response,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cBut that response doesn\u2019t have to be nuclear.\u201d The key question is more likely to be whether the US and its allies should respond with devastating conventional firepower, as Poland\u2019s foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, and the former CIA director David Petraeus have suggested. But that would transform the war into one between Russia and Nato, in which escalation to a nuclear exchange could become hard to stop. According to Eric Schlosser, the author of a book about the nuclear establishment, Command and Control, the Pentagon\u2019s Defence Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) conducted another war game in 2019 focused on Russian nuclear use in Ukraine. That wargame appears to have been updated, suggesting it is in constant use. The results in 2019 are top secret, but as Schlosser wrote in the Atlantic, one of the participants told him: \u201cThere were no happy outcomes.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-10-05T21:46:49Z",
            "content": "Poland says it has asked to have US nuclear weapons based on its territory, amid growing fears that Vladimir Putin could resort to using nuclear arms in Ukraine to stave off a rout of his invading army. The request from the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, is widely seen as symbolic, as moving nuclear warheads closer to Russia would make them more vulnerable and less militarily useful, according to experts. Furthermore, the White House has said it had not received such a request. \u201cWe\u2019re not aware of this issue being raised and would refer you to the government of Poland,\u201d a US official said. Duda\u2019s announcement appears to be the latest example of nuclear signalling as the US and its allies seek to deter Putin from the first nuclear use in battle since 1945, while preparing potential responses if deterrence fails that would have maximum punitive impact while containing the risk of escalation to all-out nuclear war. Previous war games conducted by US administrations have shown that is a fine, and fuzzy, line to tread, given the uncertainty over Putin\u2019s state of mind, and his record of giant miscalculations over Ukraine. Duda\u2019s remarks on basing nuclear weapons followed changes in the constitution of neighbouring Belarus that would allow Russian nuclear weapons to be based on its territory. The Polish president said there was \u201ca potential opportunity\u201d for Poland to take part in \u201cnuclear sharing\u201d, by which pilots from the host country are trained to fly missions carrying US nuclear bombs, which are stored on their territory. \u201cWe have spoken with American leaders about whether the United States is considering such a possibility. The issue is open,\u201d Duda told Gazeta Polska. Moving US nuclear weapons into Poland could be a violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the Nato-Russia Founding Act in 1997, after the end of the cold war in which Nato stated it had no plan to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of new members. Russia has meanwhile violated its own commitments under the act. Nuclear experts also added it made little strategic sense for Poland or Nato. The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) estimates the US has 100 nuclear weapons left over in Europe in the aftermath of the cold war, spread among the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Turkey. They are all B61 bombs which had been seen as militarily obsolete with no mission in the event of a war with Russia. Arms control experts have long called for them to be removed from Europe. However, they have been modernised as the B61-12, with fins that allow its fall to be guided, which is expected to enter service this year. The bombs have also been designed to be carried by new F-35A Lightning II stealth fighter jets, which would potentially make it part of the active US nuclear arsenal. Hans Kristensen, director of FAS\u2019s nuclear information project, said the B61-12 storage sites in Europe are being upgraded and strengthened. \u201cThe reason they\u2019re doing that is to protect that force against what they consider the growing threat from Russia\u2019s conventional missiles, so it would be an extraordinarily strange development if Nato therefore decided to move nuclear weapons closer to the Russian borders,\u201d Kristensen said. Poland has raised the issue at a time when the prospect of nuclear weapons use is higher than at any time since the cold war, and arguably since the Cuban missile crisis 60 years ago this month. Putin has threatened to use all means at his disposal to defend Russian territory at the same time as declaring the annexation of four more Ukrainian regions. He made the declaration as Russian troops were in retreat in the face of a Ukrainian counter-offensive. The White House has warned of \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d if Putin did resort to using nuclear weapons, but did not specify what those would be. It has said it has warned Russian officials privately, but it is not clear how much more specific those warnings have been. Zbigniew Rau, the Polish foreign minister, said last week the consequences should be non-nuclear but \u201cdevastating\u201d. David Petraeus, who was formerly the head of US Central Command and CIA director, said on Sunday that one possible response would be US-led Nato conventional strikes on Russian forces inside Ukraine and even the sinking of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet. In reality, Nato is unlikely to be part of any response, as it would require agreement by its 30 members. More likely it would involve Washington and its closest allies like the UK. \u201cThere are ongoing discussions and have been for a while about various scenarios and how we might react,\u201d an official in Washington said. US European Command is also doing scenario planning, the official said, adding that \u201cthere is no concrete set of actions\u201d planned. The dilemma facing the military planners is how to act in such a way that Putin does not benefit militarily from using a nuclear weapon, but not so forcefully that escalation spins out of control and leads inexorably to nuclear war between Nato and Russia. Much would depend on what Putin did. The Russians could stage a \u201cdemonstration\u201d nuclear detonation over the Black Sea, or a high-altitude airburst that generates an electromagnetic pulse that fries the electricity infrastructure of any city below. Those actions, however, would cause international outrage with little if any effect on the course of the war. The use of a nuclear weapon against Ukrainian military targets or a city, with the aim of shocking Kyiv into surrender or acceptance of partial Russian occupation would represent a far greater transgression. The range of responses in that case would include further sanctions, including secondary sanctions targeting anyone or any country buying Russian oil. Stepping up arms supplies to Kyiv, including longer-range missiles and jets the Ukrainians have been demanding, is another option. Actual Nato strikes against Russian military targets in Ukraine, would represent a huge leap, turning the conflict into a war between Russia and Nato, something policymakers have spent nearly 80 years trying to prevent. \u201cThe reaction to nuclear use would be just as important as the nuclear use itself,\u201d Mariana Budjeryn, senior research associate at the project on managing the atom at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Belfer Centre. \u201cIf it does force Ukraine into some kind of settlement and the allies think we\u2019re throwing in the towel on this, then it does show that, hey, nuclear arms really get you what you want,\u201d Budjeryn said. \u201cIf nuclear weapons are used, and that only makes everyone a lot more upset and hardens the resolve and somehow stops Russia in its tracks, then it\u2019s a different story.\u201d"

            "content": "The White House has said that Joe Biden\u2019s warning of \u201cArmageddon\u201d if Russia uses a nuclear weapon in Ukraine was not based on any new intelligence suggesting such nuclear use is imminent. The US president issued his warning at a private fundraising event in New York on Thursday evening, in his most outspoken remarks yet on the threat of wartime nuclear weapons being used for the first time since 1945. Biden described the current standoff over Ukraine, with Vladimir Putin threatening to use all means at his disposal to defend Russia and the territory it has seized in Ukraine, as the most dangerous nuclear moment since the Cuban missile crisis 60 years ago this month. \u201cHe is not joking when he talks about the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons,\u201d Biden told donors. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any such thing as an ability to easily use a tactical nuclear weapon and not end up with Armageddon.\u201d The remarks marked a departure from Biden\u2019s normally cautious tone in response to Putin\u2019s threats, but the White House spokeswoman, Karine Jean-Pierre, said on Friday they did not reflect any new intelligence from the Ukraine conflict, adding that there was no information of Russia preparing to \u201cimminently\u201d use nuclear weapons. \u201cThe president was speaking about concerns about Putin\u2019s threats to use nuclear weapons,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cWe have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture, nor do we have indications that Russia is preparing to imminently use nuclear weapons.\u201d European leaders reacted cautiously to Biden\u2019s use of stark vocabulary. Emmanuel Macron was critical when asked about the issue, saying he would not enter into political fiction \u201cWe must speak with prudence when commenting on such matters,\u201d Macron said. Asked if she shared Biden\u2019s view, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cWe are taking the threats of President Putin very seriously.\u201d She added that at the same time, \u201cwe are not being blackmailed by what he says. We have a clear stance on how to proceed.\u201d She was speaking the day after leaders from 44 European countries met in Prague to discuss the war in Ukraine. Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, said that gathering had shown strong determination to support Ukraine and \u201cfirmness in our condemnation of Russia\u201d. He said: \u201cWe take the threat and all threats of any escalation very seriously \u2026 [but] we don\u2019t intend to be intimidated.\u201d Speaking to the BBC, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said that he did not think that the Kremlin was ready to use nuclear weapons but had begun to prepare the Russian population for such an eventuality. \u201cThat\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s dangerous to even speak about it.\u201d It is unclear whether Biden was speaking loosely because of the relatively private setting of Thursday\u2019s Democratic senatorial fundraiser, although some journalists were present, or whether he intended to send a deterrent message to Putin. \u201cI think Biden\u2019s comments were NOT just running his mouth off,\u201d James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote on Twitter. \u201cHe\u2019s responsible for the safety of hundreds of millions of people during an actual nuclear crisis. His comments tell us about his focus right now.\u201d Acton said it was misguided to assume that the threat of annihilation was a relic of the cold war and that the probability that Russia would use a tactical weapon in Ukraine, if Putin did resort to nuclear use, meant that escalation would be contained. \u201cI\u2019m not someone who thinks escalation within a nuclear war is inevitable, but neither am I terribly sanguine about the prospects for managing it,\u201d Acton said. \u201cAfter all, we have exactly zero experience of managing nuclear escalation against a nuclear-armed power and so we have little reason for confidence.\u201d"

Speaking at a Democratic fundraiser this week, Biden talked bluntly about the threat of a nuclear attack from Russia. \u201cWe have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis,\u201d the president said. He added that the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, was \u201cnot joking when he talks about potential use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons because his military is, you might say, significantly underperforming\u201d after invading Ukraine earlier this year. Echoing comments from the White House earlier this week, the top Pentagon spokesperson, John Kirby, said Biden\u2019s comments were not based on specific new information. \u201cHis comments were not based on new or fresh intelligence or new indications that Mr Putin has made a decision to use nuclear weapons,\u201d Kirby told Martha Raddatz in an interview on ABC News\u2019 This Week. \u201cQuite frankly, we don\u2019t have any information that he has made that kind of decision. Nor have we seen anything that would give us pause to reconsider our own strategic nuclear posture.\u201d Biden\u2019s remarks invoking Armageddon drew a sharp rebuke from the former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, a member of the Donald Trump White House\u2019s cabinet who is mulling a 2024 presidential run. \u201cThose comments were reckless\u201d and \u201ca terrible risk to the American people\u201d, Pompeo said on the Republican-friendly Fox News network. Kirby on Sunday also declined to weigh on a recent explosion on the Kerch Bridge linking Russia and Crimea, the Ukrainian territory under Russian control. The explosion dealt a blow to Russian military logistics and embarrassed Putin, for whom the bridge had symbolic personal importance. Ukraine has not yet claimed responsibility for the attack, but it has been celebrated by senior leaders in the country. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have anything more to add to the reports about the explosion on the bridge,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cI just don\u2019t have anything more to contribute to that this morning.\u201d Kirby also addressed Biden\u2019s comments last week that the US was trying to find where Putin could get an \u201coff ramp\u201d to the war on Ukraine. \u201cMr Putin started this war and Mr Putin could end it today, simply by moving his troops out of the country,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who chose to start this conflict again and he can choose to end it.\u201d Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February. But Ukraine\u2019s defenders in recent weeks have taken back some of the territories it had lost control of during the invasion. With its hold on Ukraine weakening, Putin recently ordered the mobilization of reservists to reinforce the invasion, which ignited protests in dozens of cities across Russia and has led to long lines at its land borders with other countries."

            "content": "I live in the US, and everything Arwa Mahdawi says about its unpredictable and cruelly expensive healthcare industry is familiar (My wife almost died because I delayed a visit to ER \u2013 but there\u2019s a reason I avoid US hospitals, 25 October). An unanticipated event during a recent vacation gave me a close look at Britain\u2019s healthcare. I had a heart attack and was admitted at Royal United hospitals in Bath. From intake to discharge, I witnessed the impressive skill and unwavering kindness of NHS staff. In what seemed like no time at all, they identified and stented a blocked artery, and settled me into a coronary unit where I was closely monitored \u2013 and given a cup of tea. How wonderful that the patients around me weren\u2019t thinking about whether they would be discharged as soon as they were stabilised because they couldn\u2019t pay for the full course of treatment, or whether they could afford the drugs they\u2019d need after discharge, or whether the hospital would turn them over to a collections agency for non-payment. Ask Americans about medical bankruptcy and they\u2019ll know exactly what you mean. As the new UK government sets priorities and allocates resources, it should seize this opportunity to care for the NHS as well as it cares for everyone. Carol Newhouse Ballston Spa, New York, US \u2022 Arwa Mahdawi\u2019s account underscores a maddening truth about America: our health system is dangerously ill, and the prognosis worsens. A tale of two appendectomies highlights the decline. On holiday in 1996, I left my appendix in San Francisco. Other than having to wait until 5am so we could get the insurance green light to go to the emergency room, my appendectomy experience was straightforward. We paid a small co-payment and made Tony Bennett jokes, and moved on. Seventeen years later, my wife had her appendix erroneously removed in a North Carolina hospital because the surgeon failed to read the results of her scan. Five surgeries, many hospital stays, tens of thousands of dollars and seven months later, my wife was (mostly) restored physically. At no step did anyone acknowledge mistakes made. At every step we paid good money for suboptimal care. We\u2019ve learned to advocate for ourselves and champion our own outcomes. And we pay an inordinate amount of money in monthly premiums and in shared care costs for this privilege. It is inaccurate to declare that the US healthcare system is broken. It operates exactly as designed and maintained. Kevin Reeve Winston-Salem, North Carolina, US \u2022 I lived in the US for 50 years, and now in England for five. In the US, around 10% of people lack health insurance so have precarious access to care \u2013 an outrage. The promise of universal care in the NHS is part of a civilised society. But is the promise fulfilled? Arwa Mahdawi speaks of a friend in the US denied payment by her insurance who had to argue on the phone for hours to get it remedied. In the UK making an appointment to see a GP can take many hours, sometimes days. My wife and I recently had a medical emergency in Philadelphia, when she broke her humerus. An ambulance arrived within 15 minutes. At the hospital, she was seen by an ER doctor within 45 minutes and then had X-rays and a consultation with a specialist. It all took about four hours. Is this an NHS experience? This had nothing to do with being paying customers. The ambulance service didn\u2019t know our status and the hospital provided service upfront with no immediate demand for payment. The cost of health insurance in the US is high, but medical care is not free in the UK. We pay a much higher rate of tax here. I\u2019m happy to pay for everyone to have access, but the NHS hardly lives up to its promise of universal care. How many people give up trying to access their GP and live with a treatable condition? How many don\u2019t make it waiting for an ambulance for an inhumane length of time? Both societies need to provide universal access to good quality healthcare. Neither is achieving that.

Because that\u2019s what ministers want, 13 October). He describes hard-up people borrowing money for private treatment, having waited in pain and in vain to reach the top of an NHS waiting list. And he points out what eludes too many policymakers: that the private sector is not some wonderful additional source of medical expertise but draws heavily on NHS-trained doctors and consultants. The more patients are driven into the arms of private providers, the weaker the NHS will become. The political right is good at portraying taxation as greedy government taking your money and using it for its own nefarious purposes. The left is bad at explaining that government spends money on those things that people cannot do or cannot do so well for themselves, like providing universal healthcare, freely available when you need it. Taxation is good for your health. Janet Dobson Dunnington, North Yorkshire \u2022 Well done, Aditya Chakrabortty for being brave enough to mention, as most do not, that using private healthcare involves jumping the queue. The impression tends to be given that there is a whole alternative hospital system out there \u2013 shiny, new, resource-rich and fully staffed by happy, smiling nurses and doctors. Instead, as Chakrabortty implies, private healthcare is parasitic on the NHS. As private healthcare employs NHS doctors, they are essentially involved in a conflict of interest, because they are in a position to influence both queues and patients. This dubious arrangement was a necessary compromise dating from the origins of the NHS, agreed upon by the Attlee government because so many doctors were hostile to NHS principles. Margaret Pelling Oxford \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty says that during the pandemic private hospitals treated \u201ca grand total of eight coronavirus cases a day\u201d, and that they \u201ctrain no doctors\u201d. In fact, as the National Audit Office has reported, under the historic partnership with the NHS, private hospitals delivered more than 3.3m NHS procedures during the pandemic, all on an \u201cat cost\u201d basis with no profit being made. This contribution was described by NHS England\u2019s Amanda Pritchard as \u201ccritical\u201d in maintaining NHS cancer services during Covid, and the Royal College of Surgeons called it a \u201clifeline\u201d to the health service. Also, following an agreement with the NHS and Health Education England, more than 4,000 NHS junior doctors have been trained in the sector since 2020. Independent providers play a key role in delivering both NHS and privately funded care, ensuring that the public can access the treatment they need and giving real choice to patients. David Furness Independent Healthcare Providers Network \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty overlooks the fact that a sizable proportion of Spire Healthcare\u2019s business is providing much-needed diagnosis and treatment for NHS patients, including some of those who have been waiting the longest, helping to relieve pressure on waiting lists. This builds on the support we provided during the pandemic, when we put our services and facilities at the disposal of the NHS, caring for 360,000 NHS patients during the peaks. We are also passionate about learning and development, running one of the country\u2019s largest nurse apprenticeship programmes in the country, with the intention that many who graduate will go on to a career in the NHS.

            "date": "2022-10-14T15:31:50Z",
            "content": "The disgraced former Conservative MP Owen Paterson faces being fined after a Whitehall watchdog provisionally concluded that he broke transparency rules by failing to register as a lobbyist for a healthcare firm. On Friday, Harry Rich, the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists, said he proposed to conclude that Paterson had acted unlawfully when he lobbied ministers on behalf of Randox. The watchdog intends to fine Paterson up to \u00a37,500 but gave the former MP an opportunity to overturn the decision. The announcement comes a year after the former cabinet minister resigned as an MP after a parliamentary watchdog ruled that he broke House of Commons rules by repeatedly lobbying for Randox and another firm that paid him. Attempts by then prime minister Boris Johnson last year to block Paterson\u2019s suspension from parliament provoked fury within the Conservative party and among voters, contributing to criticism that his government was mired in cronyism. Evidence of Paterson\u2019s lobbying had originally been uncovered by the Guardian. Randox paid the former Northern Ireland secretary \u00a3100,000 a year to be its consultant. On Friday, Rich said he had provisionally determined that Paterson had failed to declare that he was paid by Randox in an official register that is intended to shed light on the activities of lobbyists. A 2014 act states that a person must not carry on the business of consultant lobbying unless they have registered. Rich said Paterson \u201cundertook consultant lobbying activities\u201d when he communicated with ministers on three occasions in 2016 and 2017. Rich said that in his provisional decision, Paterson should have declared that he had written and met ministers on behalf of Randox. According to Rich, Paterson \u201cdid not appear on the Register of Consultant Lobbyists but made what the registrar provisionally considers to be three registerable communications\u201d. He added that his final ruling could be changed in response to any written representations by Paterson. Rich started his investigation in November last year. His ruling outlines how he had to use his legal powers to request information from Paterson about his lobbying, prompting the former MP\u2019s lawyers to seek at one stage to take the watchdog to court to challenge these requests. Paterson\u2019s lawyers delayed answering the watchdog\u2019s questions. They disputed that Paterson \u201cis or ever was a consultant lobbyist\u201d and said that it was not necessary to register the communications, according to the watchdog\u2019s announcement. In 2019, the Guardian published documents showing how Paterson, a former Conservative environment secretary and prominent Brexit supporter, took part in lobbying campaigns for Randox and another firm to promote their products. The disclosure led the parliamentary standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, to start her own investigation. In November last year, the cross-party Commons committee on standards concluded that Paterson\u2019s 14 approaches to ministers and public officials were an \u201cegregious\u201d case and that he had brought parliament in to disrepute. In his resignation statement last year, Paterson said that he was innocent of any wrongdoing. \u201cMy integrity, which I hold very dear, has been repeatedly and publicly questioned. I maintain that I am totally innocent of what I have been accused of and I acted at all times in the interests of public health and safety.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 November 2022 to record at the top of the article the outcome of the Registrar\u2019s investigation. The decision not to fine Owen Paterson replaced the one provisionally proposed after it emerged his payments were not received by a VAT-registered entity and therefore he was not undertaking consultant lobbying activity as defined in law."

She has heart failure, renal impairment and chronic back pain. Two weeks ago they waited eight hours to be seen then left. Two weeks before that, at a different hospital, she got so tired of lying in a trolley that she begged to go home. This time, after 10 days in hospital, her breathing improved but at the cost of a mild delirium. The cause of the delirium? Morphine prescribed for back pain. The cause of the back pain? Lying in bed all day, hesitant to walk in unfamiliar surroundings without help. And where is the help? It\u2019s the same everywhere.

But the heart service steers clear of the kidneys, the kidney team want nothing to do with her back pain and the pain doctors are so overstretched that one missed appointment sends her back in the queue for six months. She is fed up and has given up. Realising that hospital is the least useful destination, I say, \u201cYou know our doors are always open, just bring her in.\u201d His face falls. It feels bad to give bad advice. Once people were reassured by hospitalisation. With changing demographics and diseases, and a greater awareness of the risks, they are more cautious. In the face of a national healthcare crisis, framed by upcoming elections in Victoria and New South Wales, comes an astonishing competition between the two major political parties to dot the states with new and redeveloped hospitals at a cost of billions. But the reaction to such an abundance of gifts has been muted from the people who should be celebrating the news. Professional bodies and health experts point to the lack of skilled workers at every level to staff these facilities. Training a doctor takes 10 years. Training a judicious doctor takes 10 more. Even if the \u201cpipeline\u201d were healthy, hospitals flooded with young doctors, nurses and allied health providers would inject fresh ideas \u2013 but holistic medicine requires the wisdom of experience. If tired, overused and burnt-out providers give up on public hospitals, there is a good chance of beds lying empty \u2013as already happens in many hospitals. But the biggest problem with the race to erect more hospitals is that this is a time to move care into the community. More than 800,000 patients are admitted to hospital for potentially avoidable reasons. I meet many of them on my medical rounds. The elderly man with an infected toenail who could have been saved by a regular podiatrist. The asthmatic woman who needed a trusted GP to prescribe inhalers and coax her to stop smoking. The diabetic patient who \u201cdecompensated\u201d due to inadequate community care. Add to this all the confused patients who could have been treated more appropriately in their own facility and the dying patients who yearn to be at home but whose families lack the support to honour their wish. And the patients who are not sick enough for a psychiatric unit yet not well enough to go home. When mental illness intersects with disability, incarceration and homelessness, keeping troubled patients in hospital seems like knowingly writing a wrong prescription. Just recounting these people makes me anxious for the future of healthcare, so picture the worries of those charged with managing the whole system. With the healthcare crisis firmly in the public eye, politicians have two choices. They can understand healthcare as both vocation and business by talking to actual providers \u2013 from cleaners and clerks to doctors and nurses, who will tell them that honest healthcare trumps shiny buildings. All too often the quiet heartbeat of providers is overpowered by the drumbeat of managers who have different (not necessarily wrong) incentives. Understanding the intricacies of healthcare is painstaking work likely to reveal alarming deficits and some obvious solutions. Healthcare is no more or less important than a host of other public goods including education, disability support and affordable housing. Taxpayer dollars must be committed with care and transparency, which calls for an honest portrayal of priorities. The second choice is easier and, in an era of distraction, more tempting. It involves sweeping aside the nitty gritty of the healthcare crisis and hoping new hospitals will fix old problems. But they won\u2019t. What\u2019s more, the \u201cbuild and they will come\u201d sentiment will deliver worse outcomes if it detracts from general practice and other community-based services delivering comprehensive, coordinated care for chronic diseases and at the end of life. A time-honoured lament in healthcare is to point the finger at the federal or state authorities, depending on who owns the finger. But I have never met a patient who found this dichotomy to be a sensible explanation for why it\u2019s impossible to see a GP for preventive care but so easy to spend a month in hospital solving the same problem, exacerbated and incurable.

            "date": "2022-10-12T10:14:30Z",
            "content": "Maybe the pharmacist at the Tucson, Arizona, Walgreens was acting out of religious conviction. Maybe they were afraid that they could get arrested. We may never know. What we do know is that on 26 September, two days after Arizona\u2019s abortion ban went into effect, Emma Thompson, a 14-year-old girl with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis, was denied her prescription for methotrexate. Thompson had been on methotrexate for some time; this was a longstanding prescription that she was getting refilled. The drug, a potent anti-inflammatory drug, is used to treat a wide array of issues, from autoimmune disorders, like Thompson\u2019s, to arthritis and cancer. It\u2019s estimated that 60% of all rheumatoid arthritis patients are prescribed the drug, and for Thompson, it was working well. After a childhood spent in and out of hospitals, enduring years of debilitating pain, her doctors had finally found a medication and a dosage that seemed to be working for her. Her symptoms abated enough that she was able to attend school. \u201cIt\u2019s her first year and she\u2019s in high school and it feels like a dream,\u201d said Thompson\u2019s mother, Kaitlin Preble. \u201cShe\u2019s not in a wheelchair, she has a social life and friends for the first time, and a life all young people should have.\u201d But in high doses, methotrexate can also terminate a pregnancy. The drug is not used in most abortions \u2013 when methotrexate is used as an abortion drug, it is often administered as an injection to treat an ectopic pregnancy, the kind of nonviable pregnancy that occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, which can never result in a baby and frequently has fatal implications for pregnant women. It\u2019s for this reason that several state abortion bans mention methotrexate by name. When the pharmacy wouldn\u2019t fill Thompson\u2019s prescription, this was why: they refused to give the drug to any female patient of \u201cchildbearing age\u201d. Thompson is not alone. Facing politically motivated refusals from rightwing or religious healthcare providers \u2013 and caution and confusion from others, who may refuse to prescribe or dispense necessary drugs for fear of being prosecuted or sued under abortion bans \u2013 American women living in anti-choice states have suddenly found themselves unable to access a wide array of medications. Drugs which can be used in abortions, or which can possibly cause fetal abnormalities, are used to treat everything from chronic pain to lupus to ulcers to acne. These were medications that these patients were prescribed, and medications that they could get with relative ease before Dobbs. They are medications that they could still get, if they were men. In response, these women have had to change the course of their medical treatment, or gone through onerous procedures to find new prescribers, pharmacists or medicines. Many women and trans people have long had to take pregnancy tests before they are allowed to access certain medications, proving that there is no fetus to be harmed or risked before they are allowed the medicine that they need to get well. Others are now finding that scared or anti-choice doctors are demanding that they have themselves sterilized before they can continue the treatments that allow them to live normal, productive and relatively pain-free lives. This is the new state of healthcare in America, where misogynist laws banning abortion have ushered in an era of sex-segregated medical care for all sorts of ailments and conditions. In states where abortion is banned, there are now de facto two standards of medical care: the one that men are entitled to, and the lesser one that women have to make do with. Thompson was relatively lucky. She had a doctor and a mother who both advocated for her, and were alert to the injustice of her plight. Deborah Power, Thompson\u2019s rheumatologist who prescribed the methotrexate, was so outraged when she heard that the prescription had been refused that she expressed her frustration on Twitter at what was being done to her patient. \u201cWelcome to AZ,\u201d Dr Power wrote. \u201cToday a pharmacist denied the MTX refill for my adolescent patient \u2026 MTX denied purely because she\u2019s female, barely a teenager.\u201d The post went viral. Meanwhile, Thompson\u2019s mother, Preble, drove to the pharmacy \u201cand made a big deal inside\u201d. She eventually learned that the pharmacists who denied her daughter\u2019s prescription had looked up the patient\u2019s age and sex, but not her medical history. \u201cMy entire life, I was in and out of the hospital,\u201d Thompson told a local news station. \u201cI was never able to stay in school until this past year, I was never able to ride a bike or get on the monkey bars like other kids could.\u201d She continued: \u201cIt\u2019s not right. They\u2019re trying to make any girl who\u2019s on this medication drop a pregnancy test when they get their medicine and I feel like it\u2019s really unfair.\u201d Eventually, Thompson was able to get her medication, and hopefully, she will be able to keep getting it \u2013 to keep her pain manageable, to stay in school, and to live the full life that she deserves. Other patients haven\u2019t been so lucky, and other doctors have not been such good advocates for their patients. In Tennessee, Becky Hubbard, a 46-year-old whose rheumatoid arthritis became so debilitating that she had to quit her job as a nurse, was told by her own longtime rheumatologist that she would either have to go on birth control or get sterilized if she wanted to continue taking her medication. If she refused, she wouldn\u2019t get the prescription. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating as hell,\u201d Hubbard told the Washington Post. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get the medicine that gets you out of the flares, you just have to live with the pain.\u201d The logic of misogyny often dictates that women sacrifice their own needs and wellbeing for the comfort of others. Be it as doting wives, as ever-available mothers, as self-effacing workhorses or as ornamental sex objects, sexist culture frequently demands that women\u2019s own ambitions, comforts, desires and, yes, health, be put aside to make them better suited to serve and support those around them. The anti-choice movement has always relied on this logic, extending women\u2019s obligation to sacrifice themselves for other people into an obligation to sacrifice themselves for potential other people, or future other people, the embryo or the fetus whose interests seem to supplant any claims the pregnant person may have over her own future, ambitions or body. To deny women medication that could damage a pregnancy, even when there is no pregnancy, just takes this same logic even further. The nominal benefit to others is erased; there is not even a pretext of another person whose interests can justify the mandate to make women suffer. The only principle that remains is make women suffer. If Thompson\u2019s case is any indication, that mandate also extends to girls."

Apart from wondering why the chair, Lady Hallett, didn\u2019t start the public phase with some of these testimonies as a mark of respect and intent, her response to Pete Weatherby KC, representing the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, is deeply worrying: \u201cThere is absolutely no question that the bereaved will be marginalised and I really don\u2019t want to hear that expression again.\u201d When families feel they are being marginalised, telling their representative that you don\u2019t want to hear that word is not the right way to resolve their concerns. John Beer Vice-president, Hourglass \u2022 My family of four endured all of the losses mentioned by Lady Hallett, the worst being the unnecessary slow, traumatic and lonely death of my beloved mother in March 2020. The nature of her demise still haunts me today. My son suffered the loss of educational opportunities. His dream place at Cambridge University was taken away from him due to the fiasco of the 2020 A-level results. My daughter\u2019s graduation ceremony at St Andrews University was reduced to a five-second mention of her name and degree in a video. Her subsequent master\u2019s degree at the Courtauld Institute of Art was all online, with no visits to galleries or museums. The business that my husband and I ran could not operate throughout the restrictions, and the financial loss was crippling. It goes without saying that all four of us in my family suffered extreme mental anguish due to all these factors. Like many others, we are still trying to rebuild our lives.

            "date": "2022-10-31T16:14:05Z",
            "content": "The Covid-19 public inquiry plans to scour some of Boris Johnson\u2019s WhatsApp messages as it seeks to identify any \u201cplainly wrongful decision-making and significant errors of judgment\u201d by central government in the early stage of the pandemic, the lead counsel to the inquiry has said. Opening the second stage of the statutory inquiry, examining \u201chow central government responded to the pandemic and made the key decisions that it did\u201d, Hugo Keith KC said it would ask whether late lockdowns cost lives and whether rule-breaking undermined public confidence. Speaking in a preliminary hearing before witnesses are cross-examined over eight weeks next summer, with the UK death toll from confirmed Covid exceeding 180,000, Keith said there would be \u201cparticular scrutiny\u201d of decisions taken by the prime minister, the cabinet, senior political advisers and scientific and medical advisers from early January 2020 to the first national lockdown in late March. WhatsApp messages between Johnson and Downing Street and other senior officials have been requested alongside cabinet minutes and notes of written and oral advice to ministers. Lawyers for disability campaign groups called for departments to admit to any deletion of documents and explain how they have preserved WhatsApp, Signal or Cabinet Office instant chat messages. Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s former chief adviser, has already published some messages from a Downing Street WhatsApp group used by him and Johnson. Ministers will be called to give evidence over eight weeks next summer. Keith said the inquiry would also ask: \u201cWas the declared policy of following the science a fair reflection of the actual decision-making?\u201d More than 200 scientists, including all those involved in the Sage group and others in the Independent Sage group, the latter of which was highly critical of the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic, have been asked to give evidence about the effectiveness of the response. The inquiry will ask: \u201cHow effectively was Sage utilised by central government?\u201d Keith said it would also ask if there was \u201can over-reliance on epidemiological modelling or mathematical modelling\u201d. Imperial College London, which employs Prof Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose predictions were prominent early in the pandemic, is among the core participants in this phase of the investigation. Keith said the inquiry\u2019s job would be to ask whether anything could have been done to reduce loss and suffering caused by \u201cdeath and illness on an unprecedented scale\u201d. He described widespread \u201csocietal damage \u2026 with unmet health needs, damaged educational prospects [and] financial insecurity\u201d and \u201cimmense\u201d costs in human and financial terms. Lawyers for groups representing disabled people, ethnic minority groups, woman, children and frontline workers urged the inquiry to investigate how far the government accounted for their needs. Liz Davies KC, representing organisations that help victims of domestic abuse, said the inquiry must investigate whether government decisions were backed by equalities impact assessments. Philip Dayle, representing the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations, called for \u201cinstitutional and structural racism\u201d to be considered. The inquiry is pressing ahead with a \u201clistening exercise\u201d to gather and summarise testimonies from people affected by the pandemic, despite opposition from bereaved groups who want their testimonies to be taken as evidence. The inquiry has issued a \u00a3970,000 contract to the polling firm Ipsos to carry out the exercise and a \u00a3800,000 contract to the communications company M&amp;C Saatchi to inform the public how to take part. The inquiry chair, Lady Hallett, stressed that some personal testimonies would also be heard in evidence where they relate to \u201csystemic failings\u201d. The inquiry is wrestling with how to prevent the sprawl of an already huge exercise that will take several years. The Cabinet Office has said it has so many potentially relevant documents that its material alone would take three years to review. 39 groups of core participants were represented at the preliminary module 2 hearing, including three long Covid support groups, disability rights groups, children\u2019s rights groups and bereaved families\u2019 groups representing the UK, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The health system was represented by NHS England, the British Medical Association and social care operators. Government bodies ranged from the Department of Health and Social Care to the office of England\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments."

            "content": "The bereaved will be \u201cat the heart\u201d of the Covid-19 public inquiry, its chair, Lady Hallett, has pledged at the first public hearing in the investigation into the UK\u2019s handling of the pandemic, which the inquiry\u2019s counsel described as an \u201cunprecedented and vastly difficult undertaking\u201d. Opening the first module to a sprawling inquiry expected to run for several years, Hallett addressed anger from some of the bereaved that their testimonies may not be heard as direct evidence, by saying: \u201cWe shall ensure that those most affected, particularly the bereaved, will be properly consulted.\u201d But she said if they were consulted on every stage of the inquiry it \u201cwould go on forever\u201d. She insisted her priority was to reach conclusions \u201cbefore another disaster strikes the four nations of the United Kingdom\u201d and would not allow the inquiry to \u201cdrag on for decades\u201d. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group is upset Hallett is planning only a \u201clistening exercise\u201d to capture a cross-section of views among the hundreds of thousands of bereaved people in the UK. They want their evidence to be heard directly. \u201cThere is a balance to be struck between making timely recommendations and the extent to which we explore every issue,\u201d Hallett said. Hugo Keith KC, counsel to the inquiry, also said it would need to be \u201cruthless\u201d in its focus. It is already set to consider the performance of the public health system, care homes, lockdowns, schooling, children, minorities, mental health, the economy and border controls among other issues. A communications company is being sought to handle the listening exercise, which some of the bereaved have described as an attempt to \u201coutsource the grief of bereaved families\u201d. In previous public inquiries, such as those into the Grenfell Tower fire and Manchester Arena bombing, family and friends provided \u201cpen portraits\u201d of victims at the start of the formal hearings. However, the UK pandemic toll of 204,776 people with Covid on their death certificate, is far higher. \u201cWe feel very strongly that this inquiry should be focusing on the impact on the bereaved families and to do that our voices need to be heard inside the inquiry and taken as evidence,\u201d said Fran Hall, who lost her husband, Steve Mead, 65, to Covid in October 2020. Matt Fowler, a co-founder of the group, whose father, Ian, died in hospital in April 2020, said: \u201cAnything less [than hearing the bereaved\u2019s stories directly] would be devastating for families like mine who have worked so tirelessly to get here and could cost lives in the future.\u201d Hallett used her opening remarks to argue the listening exercise would \u201censure everyone across the UK who wishes to contribute to the inquiry can do so in a less formal setting \u2026 their contributions will inform the inquiry about the impact of the pandemic\u201d. She denied anyone had been barred from giving evidence. Keith said the listening exercise would take accounts from tens or hundreds of thousands of people, which would be \u201canalysed and summarised before being provided to the inquiry teams and the core participants\u201d as written evidence. Pete Weatherby KC, representing the Covid-19 bereaved group, said the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference were \u201cto listen to and consider carefully the experiences of bereaved families\u201d. But, he said the listening exercise, \u201cas cast up to now, does not do this\u201d. He said that it marginalises \u201cthe bereaved and their voices\u201d. Hallett responded: \u201cThere is absolutely no question that the bereaved will be marginalised and I really don\u2019t want to hear that expression again.\u201d Before starting proceedings with a minute\u2019s silence, Hallett said: \u201cThere is one word that sums up the pandemic for so many and that is the word loss \u2026 millions of people suffered loss, including the loss of friends and family members, the loss of good health both mental and physical, economic loss, the loss of educational opportunities and the loss of social interaction. Those who were bereaved lost the most.\u201d The inquiry is divided into numerous modules to run in sequence. The first module, which opened on Tuesday, will examine the UK\u2019s resilience and preparedness for the coronavirus pandemic. Evidence hearings will not start until next year."

            "title": "Japan opens borders to tourists as last pandemic travel restrictions eased",
            "date": "2022-10-11T03:22:26Z",
            "content": "Japan has fully opened its doors to visitors after more than two years of pandemic isolation. On Tuesday, the country reinstated visa-free travel to dozens of countries, ending some of world\u2019s strictest Covid-19 border controls. Japan has also lifted the 50,000-person entry cap and ended the requirement for tourists to travel as part of tour groups, Kyodo news agency reported. Prime minister Fumio Kishida is counting on tourism to help invigorate the economy and reap some benefits from the yen\u2019s slide to a 24-year low \u2013 but hopes for a tourism boom face tough headwinds: a shortage of hospitality workers, lingering pandemic concerns, and predictions from economists that tourist returns would be gradual. Kishida said last week the government is aiming to attract 5tn yen ($34.5bn) in annual tourist spending. That goal may be too ambitious for a sector that has withered during the pandemic. Spending from overseas visitors will reach only 2.1tn yen by 2023 and won\u2019t exceed pre-Covid levels until 2025, economist Takahide Kiuchi wrote in a Nomura Research Institute report. Since June, Japan has allowed tourists to visit in groups accompanied by guides, a requirement that was further relaxed to include self-guided package tours. Just over half a million visitors have come to Japan so far in 2022, compared with a record 31.8 million in 2019. Arata Sawa is among those eager for the return of foreign visitors, who previously comprised up to 90% of the guests at his traditional inn. \u201cI\u2019m hoping and anticipating that a lot of foreigners will come to Japan, just like before Covid,\u201d said Sawa, the third-generation owner of the Sawanoya ryokan in Tokyo. Flag carrier Japan Airlines Co has seen inbound bookings triple since the border easing announcement, president Yuji Akasaka told Nikkei newspaper last week \u2013 but international travel demand won\u2019t fully recover until around 2025. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a sudden return to the pre-pandemic situation,\u201d said Sawato Shindo, president of Amina Collection Co, a 120-shop gift and souvenir chain. Hopes for tourism\u2019s roaring return are also tempered by a shortage of workers. Almost 73% of hotels nationwide said they were short of regular workers in August, up from about 27% a year earlier, according to market research firm Teikoku Databank. Akihisa Inaba, general manager at the hot-spring resort Yokikan in Shizuoka, central Japan, who said short staffing during the summer meant workers had to forego time off. \u201cNaturally, the labour shortage will become more pronounced when inbound travel returns,\u201d said Inaba. \u201cSo, I\u2019m not so sure we can be overjoyed.\u201d Whether overseas visitors will wear face masks and abide by other common infection controls in Japan is another concern. The strict border controls were broadly popular during most of the pandemic, and fears remain about the appearance of new viral variants. On Friday the government approved changing hotel regulations so that operators can refuse guests who do not obey infection controls during an outbreak. \u201cFrom the start of the pandemic until now, we\u2019ve had just a few foreign guests,\u201d said Tokyo innkeeper Sawa. \u201cPretty much all of them wore masks, but I\u2019m really not sure whether the people who visit from here on will do the same.\u201d One force that may buoy the return of visitors is the drop of the yen: the yen has weakened sharply against the dollar, giving some visitors much heftier buying power and making Japan attractive to bargain hunters targeting Japan\u2019s electronics, luxury goods and retail districts. In Tokyo\u2019s Akihabara electronics district, Hideyuki Abe\u2019s shelves filled with watches and souvenirs like samurai swords and toy cats with bobbing heads. Abe employs about 50 people and had resorted to layoffs after the pandemic struck in 2020. Some Akihabara shops have closed down since then, but he bided his time. \u201cHanging on is where power lies,\u201d Abe said. \u201cNow, I am a bit worried about a shortage of workers.\u201d With pandemic restrictions waning and the dollar at a three-decade high of about 145 yen, he believes the tourists will be back. \u201cThis time,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s a perfect opportunity.\u201d Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this report"

Greater Manchester police said Luke O\u2019Connor, 19, was stabbed on Wilmslow Road in Fallowfield at about 2am on Wednesday. He was given CPR at the scene but later died of his injuries in hospital. In a statement released through police, his family said they were \u201ctruly devastated\u201d by the loss of the teenager, a second-year business management student at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU). \u201cLuke was loved by so many people, and he knew how much he was loved in return,\u201d the family said. \u201cHe loved the freedom of student living and studying and was loving life in Manchester. \u201cLuke loved music, football and was a big supporter of Liverpool football club, who he followed religiously from a young age. He had a profound impact on so many people throughout his life. He was truly one of a kind, whose presence would light up any room. \u201cOur lively, bubbly, beautiful boy has been taken from us and our family are now left with a hole in our hearts that will never be filled. \u201cJustice needs to be served as we have lost our beautiful young Luke, who was robbed of life. We will continue to honour his name for as long as we are all here, and his legacy will go on for ever.\u201d The family asked for privacy while they grieve. MMU said its thoughts were with O\u2019Connor\u2019s family and friends. \u201cWe will be contacting them to offer our help and support,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThis will be a terrible shock to our whole community, and we will be arranging for professionally trained counselling staff to support any students and staff who are affected by the incident.\u201d Police patrols around Fallowfield and other student areas would be increased, the university said, with additional patrols between 7pm and 3am each night until the end of the month. Letitia Jones, the president of MMU students\u2019 union, said: \u201cThe university are supporting everyone affected \u2013 if this has affected you deeply, please contact the counselling, mental health and wellbeing service.\u201d The attack took place on a busy main road in the centre of a suburb that is home to thousands of students from the city\u2019s two main universities. The Manchester Evening News reported the student was on his way home from a party when police believe he came across his alleged attacker. The two are not believed to have known each other. Police said they were \u201cactively pursuing leads\u201d and would \u201crelentlessly pursue the offender to ensure they are brought to justice\u201d."

The findings imply that as global temperatures rise owing to climate change, it becomes more likely that viruses and bacteria locked up in glaciers and permafrost could reawaken and infect local wildlife, particularly as their range also shifts closer to the poles. For instance, in 2016 an outbreak of anthrax in northern Siberia that killed a child and infected at least seven other people was attributed to a heatwave that melted permafrost and exposed an infected reindeer carcass. Before this, the last outbreak in the region had been in 1941. To better understand the risk posed by frozen viruses, Dr St\u00e9phane Aris-Brosou and his colleagues at the University of Ottawa in Canada collected soil and sediment samples from Lake Hazen, close to where small, medium and large amounts of meltwater from local glaciers flowed in. Next, they sequenced RNA and DNA in these samples to identify signatures closely matching those of known viruses, as well as potential animal, plant or fungal hosts, and ran an algorithm that assessed the chance of these viruses infecting unrelated groups of organisms. The research, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, suggested that the risk of viruses spilling over to new hosts was higher at locations close to where large amounts of glacial meltwater flowed in \u2013 a situation that becomes more likely as the climate warms. The team did not quantify how many of the viruses they identified were previously unknown \u2013 something they plan to do in the coming months \u2013 nor did they assess whether these viruses were capable of triggering an infection. However, other recent research has suggested that unknown viruses can, and do, loiter in glacier ice. For instance, last year, researchers at Ohio State University in the US announced they had found genetic material from 33 viruses \u2013 28 of them novel \u2013 in ice samples taken from the Tibetan plateau in China. Based on their location, the viruses were estimated to be approximately 15,000 years old. In 2014, scientists at France\u2019s National Centre for Scientific Research in Aix-Marseille managed to revive a giant virus they isolated from Siberian permafrost, making it infectious again for the first time in 30,000 years. The study\u2019s author, Jean-Michel Claverie, told the BBC at the time that exposing such ice layers could be \u201ca recipe for disaster\u201d. Even so, Aris-Brosou\u2019s team cautioned that predicting a high risk of spillover was not the same as predicting actual spillovers or pandemics. \u201cAs long as viruses and their \u2018bridge vectors\u2019 are not simultaneously present in the environment, the likelihood of dramatic events probably remains low,\u201d they wrote. On the other hand, climate change is predicted to alter the range of existing species, potentially bringing new hosts into contact with ancient viruses or bacteria. \u201cThe only take-home that we can confidently put forward is that as temperatures are rising, the risk of spillover in this particular environment is increasing,\u201d said Aris-Brosou. \u201cWill this lead to pandemics? We absolutely don\u2019t know.\u201d Also unclear is whether the potential for host switching identified in Lake Hazen is unique within lake sediments. \u201cFor all we know, it could be the same as the likelihood of host switching posed by viruses from the mud in your local pond,\u201d said Arwyn Edwards, the director of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Environmental Microbiology at Aberystwyth University. However, \u201cwe do urgently need to explore the microbial worlds all over our planet to understand these risks in context,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo things are very clear now. Firstly, that the Arctic is warming rapidly and the major risks to humanity are from its influence on our climate. Secondly, that diseases from elsewhere are finding their way into the vulnerable communities and ecosystems of the Arctic.\u201d"

            "title": "Japan opens borders to tourists as last pandemic travel restrictions eased",
            "date": "2022-10-11T03:22:26Z",
            "content": "Japan has fully opened its doors to visitors after more than two years of pandemic isolation. On Tuesday, the country reinstated visa-free travel to dozens of countries, ending some of world\u2019s strictest Covid-19 border controls. Japan has also lifted the 50,000-person entry cap and ended the requirement for tourists to travel as part of tour groups, Kyodo news agency reported. Prime minister Fumio Kishida is counting on tourism to help invigorate the economy and reap some benefits from the yen\u2019s slide to a 24-year low \u2013 but hopes for a tourism boom face tough headwinds: a shortage of hospitality workers, lingering pandemic concerns, and predictions from economists that tourist returns would be gradual. Kishida said last week the government is aiming to attract 5tn yen ($34.5bn) in annual tourist spending. That goal may be too ambitious for a sector that has withered during the pandemic. Spending from overseas visitors will reach only 2.1tn yen by 2023 and won\u2019t exceed pre-Covid levels until 2025, economist Takahide Kiuchi wrote in a Nomura Research Institute report. Since June, Japan has allowed tourists to visit in groups accompanied by guides, a requirement that was further relaxed to include self-guided package tours. Just over half a million visitors have come to Japan so far in 2022, compared with a record 31.8 million in 2019. Arata Sawa is among those eager for the return of foreign visitors, who previously comprised up to 90% of the guests at his traditional inn. \u201cI\u2019m hoping and anticipating that a lot of foreigners will come to Japan, just like before Covid,\u201d said Sawa, the third-generation owner of the Sawanoya ryokan in Tokyo. Flag carrier Japan Airlines Co has seen inbound bookings triple since the border easing announcement, president Yuji Akasaka told Nikkei newspaper last week \u2013 but international travel demand won\u2019t fully recover until around 2025. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a sudden return to the pre-pandemic situation,\u201d said Sawato Shindo, president of Amina Collection Co, a 120-shop gift and souvenir chain. Hopes for tourism\u2019s roaring return are also tempered by a shortage of workers. Almost 73% of hotels nationwide said they were short of regular workers in August, up from about 27% a year earlier, according to market research firm Teikoku Databank. Akihisa Inaba, general manager at the hot-spring resort Yokikan in Shizuoka, central Japan, who said short staffing during the summer meant workers had to forego time off. \u201cNaturally, the labour shortage will become more pronounced when inbound travel returns,\u201d said Inaba. \u201cSo, I\u2019m not so sure we can be overjoyed.\u201d Whether overseas visitors will wear face masks and abide by other common infection controls in Japan is another concern. The strict border controls were broadly popular during most of the pandemic, and fears remain about the appearance of new viral variants. On Friday the government approved changing hotel regulations so that operators can refuse guests who do not obey infection controls during an outbreak. \u201cFrom the start of the pandemic until now, we\u2019ve had just a few foreign guests,\u201d said Tokyo innkeeper Sawa. \u201cPretty much all of them wore masks, but I\u2019m really not sure whether the people who visit from here on will do the same.\u201d One force that may buoy the return of visitors is the drop of the yen: the yen has weakened sharply against the dollar, giving some visitors much heftier buying power and making Japan attractive to bargain hunters targeting Japan\u2019s electronics, luxury goods and retail districts. In Tokyo\u2019s Akihabara electronics district, Hideyuki Abe\u2019s shelves filled with watches and souvenirs like samurai swords and toy cats with bobbing heads. Abe employs about 50 people and had resorted to layoffs after the pandemic struck in 2020. Some Akihabara shops have closed down since then, but he bided his time. \u201cHanging on is where power lies,\u201d Abe said. \u201cNow, I am a bit worried about a shortage of workers.\u201d With pandemic restrictions waning and the dollar at a three-decade high of about 145 yen, he believes the tourists will be back. \u201cThis time,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s a perfect opportunity.\u201d Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this report"

            "title": "Post-pandemic test results fall sharply for youngest pupils in England",
            "date": "2022-10-06T16:48:40Z",
            "content": "Attainment among seven-year-olds in England has fallen sharply across all subjects in the first set of tests since before the pandemic, with disadvantaged children\u2019s results dropping even further behind, according to government data. Results for this year\u2019s key stage 1 (KS1) tests show a significant decline in attainment in reading, maths and, most dramatically, writing, in which the proportion of year 2 pupils reaching the expected standard declined by 11 percentage points. In the year 1 phonics screening check, a key government measure of progress among five- and six-year-olds, 75% of pupils met the expected standard this year, down from 82% in 2019. The same check on year 2 pupils showed 87% achieved the required standard, down from 91%. It is the first drop in attainment since the phonics check was introduced in 2012 and will ring alarm bells in the Department for Eduction (DfE), which has set itself an ambitious target of having 90% of children leaving primary school with the expected standard in reading, writing and maths by 2030. The results, published on Thursday, reveal the impact of Covid disruption on the youngest schoolchildren, whose entire education has been overshadowed by the pandemic. They will add to concerns about the growing attainment gap between pupils from more affluent backgrounds and their more disadvantaged peers since the pandemic hit, and the effectiveness of the government\u2019s education recovery programme. The DfE data shows half of disadvantaged students (51%) reached the expected level for reading this year, down from 62% in 2019, while the drop in attainment among non-disadvantaged pupils was smaller, down from 78% to 72%. In writing, just two out of five children (41%) from disadvantaged backgrounds reached the required standard, down from 55% in 2019, while for other pupils the proportion fell from 73% to 63%. Similarly, maths attainment among disadvantaged pupils fell the furthest, from 62% to 52%, compared with a drop from 79% to 73% for other pupils. Jon Andrews, the head of analysis at the Education Policy Institute (EPI), said: \u201cNot only has overall attainment declined but some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable children are falling further behind their peers. We know that the disadvantage gap for 11-year-olds is now around the same level as it was in 2012, taking us back a decade.\u201d He added: \u201cToday\u2019s data for younger pupils highlight again the level of challenge in addressing that disparity. Only half of pupils from low-income backgrounds starting key stage 2 this year achieved the expected standard in each of reading and mathematics at the end of key stage 1, and just four in 10 pupils did so in writing.\u201d Earlier this year, results for the first KS2 Sats assessments since 2019 also showed a decline in attainment. Just 59% of 10- and 11-year-olds reached the DfE\u2019s expected standards in literacy, writing and maths, the lowest rate since 2017 and below the 65% recorded in 2019. There was, however, a surprise improvement in reading, with 74% at or above the national standard, up from 73% in 2019. There was no similar ray of sunshine in the KS1 results, with attainment down from 2019 across the board. In reading, 67% of pupils met the expected standard, down from 75% in 2019. In maths it decreased from 76% in 2019 to 68%, and similarly in science just 77% of pupils met the national standard, down from 82% in 2019. Andrews said tackling the increasing inequality in the education system should be an urgent priority for the government. \u201cGiven the challenges that loom ahead, ministers must focus on adequately resourcing schools and implementing a cross-government child poverty strategy.\u201d Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \u201cThe government has let down this cohort by not investing in their recovery. But it can still act now. Schools are currently under unprecedented financial pressure due to the cost of living [crisis], which is forcing cuts to teaching and support staff that directly impacts the most disadvantaged and high needs pupils. \u201cThe government cannot sit back and let this second massive blow to disadvantaged pupils hit.\u201d The shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s own education recovery tsar\u2019s warnings are coming true: that the pandemic risks doing permanent damage to children\u2019s education because of the Conservatives\u2019 failure to support properly pupils\u2019 recovery.\u201d Meanwhile, on Thursday, a coalition of parents, unions and school and college leaders wrote to the prime minister, Liz Truss, and the education secretary, Kit Malthouse, about the crisis in school funding and reports of further \u201cefficiencies\u201d in public spending. Twelve organisations signed the open letter, including the main teaching unions, as well as Unison, the National Governance Association for school governors, and Parentkind, which represents PTAs. They warn that current funding levels do not cover rising costs and there is \u201ca very real risk\u201d of decline in educational standards. \u201cThe reality is that school and college spending has been cut to the bone over the past decade, there is no room for efficiencies, and a real-terms cut in funding will be catastrophic,\u201d the letter says. \u201cIf schools and colleges have to make further savings, this will inevitably mean reductions in teaching and support staff. This will result in larger class sizes, cuts to the curriculum and student support services, and cuts in extra-curricular provision, such as school trips and clubs.\u201d The letter went on: \u201cYour government claims to be pursuing an agenda of economic growth but we fail to see how growth can be sustainable, and how our country can look forward to a secure and prosperous future, without sufficient investment in education.\u201d A DfE spokesperson said: \u201cWe know the pandemic impacted children\u2019s learning and we are investing nearly \u00a35bn, with over 2m high quality tutoring courses already started, to make sure children can catch up fast, and schools should continue to work with parents to make them aware of the additional support on offer.\u201d"

            "content": "The Australian Reserve Bank has reported a record loss of almost $37bn for the 2021-22 year after accounting for the changed valuation of the huge bond purchases amassed during the Covid pandemic. The losses, which won\u2019t be realised unless the central bank sells the bonds before they mature, won\u2019t affect its operations. But the consequence for the federal budget is the likelihood the RBA won\u2019t pay the government dividends for years until its current negative equity of about $12.4bn is restored and built up further. The Reserve Bank joined the Morrison government in its efforts to pump money into the economy to keep it afloat during the depths of the pandemic. During that period, the RBA\u2019s balance sheet more than tripled in size to about $650bn in February 2022 when its special bond-buying program stopped. Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup With interest rates rising, the value of the debt holdings fell, resulting in unrealised losses for domestic bonds alone of $40.3bn. The overall loss for the year was $36.7bn. \u201cThis negative equity position does not affect the bank\u2019s operations or its ability to operate effectively or perform its policy functions,\u201d the RBA said. \u201cThe board expects that the bank\u2019s capital will be restored over time due to positive underlying earnings and capital gains when bonds mature.\u201d The RBA\u2019s actions during the crisis helped lower the cost of borrowing by raising demand for the bonds. It has since said it will only resort to such purchases under \u201cextreme circumstances\u201d, such as when interest rates can\u2019t be cut any further. At the height, the RBA was buying $5bn in mostly federal debt every week, with the rest mostly state bonds. The RBA governor, Phil Lowe\u2019s total compensation dropped about 3.6% from 2020-21, to just under $1.037m, or about $20,000 a week."

            "date": "2022-10-25T07:08:15Z",
            "content": "Health-threatening fungi are spreading in geographic range due to climate change, while some fungal diseases spiked during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to authors of a newly released World Health Organization report. On Tuesday the WHO published its first ever list of fungal priority pathogens, cataloguing 19 organisms that experts identified as being of the greatest threat to public health. \u201cCurrently, fungal infections receive less than 1.5% of all infectious disease research funding,\u201d the report found, suggesting the true health burden of fungi is unknown, while \u201cmost treatment guidelines are informed by limited evidence and expert opinion\u201d. The WHO\u2019s assistant director general of antimicrobial resistance, Dr Hanan Balkhy, said in a statement: \u201cEmerging from the shadows of the bacterial antimicrobial resistance pandemic, invasive fungal diseases are growing ever more resistant to treatments, becoming an ever more pressing public health concern worldwide.\u201d Dr Justin Beardsley, of the University of Sydney Infectious Diseases Institute, who led a group commissioned by the WHO, said historical research underspending was out of step with the \u201chuge burden of disease\u201d of fungal infections. \u201cThey\u2019re causing as many deaths as tuberculosis, and more than malaria,\u201d he said. The report, which involved more than 400 mycology experts and a review of more than 6,000 research papers, ranked fungal pathogens based on public health impact and risk of resistance to antifungal drugs. Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup Of the 19 fungi included, four were identified as being of \u201ccritical\u201d priority. These included Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans \u2013 the two most common fungal pathogens globally \u2013 as well as Cryptococcus neoformans, which is a leading cause of death in people with HIV. Aspergillus fumigatus mainly affects the lungs, while Candida albicans is the most common cause of thrush \u2013 and invasive infections in vulnerable patients have high mortality rates. Infection rates of both pathogens rose in many countries during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWe suddenly had a bunch of patients who were getting really sick, coming in with lung damage, being in intensive care and having immune-suppressing medications, and so we saw a spike in the rates of these infections,\u201d Beardsley said. \u201cAspergillus fumigatus has got its own disease state called Covid-associated pulmonary aspergillosis.\u201d The fourth critical priority pathogen, Candida auris, grows as a yeast and was first discovered in humans in 2009. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t exist before then,\u201d Beardsley said. \u201cIt literally appeared all over the world at the same time, and we\u2019re still trying to work out why and how.\u201d The pathogen is \u201cintrinsically resistant to most available antifungal medicines\u201d and has \u201chigh outbreak potential\u201d, the report found. Researchers have also noted the geographic spread of fungal pathogens that were previously limited to certain regions. Cryptococcus gatii, for example, has spread from the subtropics into temperate regions. Talaromyces marneffei was thought to be limited to south-east Asia, but has been found farther north in China. \u201cThat can partly be because it\u2019s being looked for, but I think it\u2019s more that it is genuinely expanding its range \u2013 and that probably is linked to climate change,\u201d Beardsley said. Tackling invasive fungal diseases will require increased funding for new antifungals and improved diagnostics, the report found. There are only four classes of antifungals currently available, and developing new drugs was difficult because of the similarities between fungal and mammalian cells, Beardsley said. \u201cSomething that will kill a fungus will often kill a human cell too,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2022-10-14T05:00:29Z",
            "content": "The manufacturer of one of only two cholera vaccines for use in humanitarian emergencies is to halt production at the end of this year, just as the world faces an \u201cunprecedented\u201d series of deadly outbreaks, the Guardian has learned. Shantha Biotechnics, a wholly owned Indian subsidiary of the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi, will stop production of its Shanchol vaccine within months and cease supply by the end of 2023, causing alarm among health officials. Philippe Barboza, the World Health Organization\u2019s team lead for cholera, said Shantha\u2019s move to halt production had come despite repeated appeals from the WHO\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cTo say the least, it\u2019s a very disappointing strategy,\u201d Barboza said. Shanchol is one of only two oral cholera vaccines suitable for use in a global emergency stockpile used to supply countries battling outbreaks as well as for preventive vaccination campaigns. This year it made up about 15% of the stockpile\u2019s doses. Although easily treatable, cholera is estimated by the WHO to kill up to 143,000 people annually in the world\u2019s poorest countries, where access to clean water and basic sanitation remains patchy. Countries including Haiti, Syria, Lebanon, Nigeria, Malawi and Ethiopia are fighting outbreaks now. A spokesperson for Sanofi said the decision to stop producing the vaccine had been taken in October 2020 and that, as \u201ca responsible partner\u201d, it had \u201cinformed global health organisations and cholera stakeholders three years before supply discontinuation\u201d. The spokesperson said: \u201cWe took this decision in a context where we were already producing very small volumes versus the total demand for cholera vaccines and in the knowledge that other cholera vaccine manufacturers (current and new entrants) had already announced an increased supply capacity in the years to come. \u201cThe production of Shanchol will stop at the end of this year. Supply will be discontinued next year. Additionally, in the interests of the global cholera programme we entered into an agreement with our public health partners to complete a transfer of knowledge related to the manufacture of Shanchol.\u201d Last week Tedros warned that the climate crisis had \u201cturbocharged\u201d the spread of cholera, with extreme weather events such as floods, cyclones and droughts further reducing people\u2019s access to clean water. Of particular concern, he said, was the average fatality rate from the disease, which this year, according to the WHO\u2019s data, was almost three times the rate of the past five years. \u201cWith an increasing number of outbreaks, supply [of vaccine] cannot keep up with demand,\u201d Tedros warned. \u201cWe urge the world\u2019s leading vaccine manufacturers to talk to us about how we can increase production.\u201d For a disease driven both by an excess and a scarcity of water, climate change had this year exacerbated all the usual causes of cholera, Barboza added. \u201cWhat is, I would say, unprecedented is the concurrence and succession of massive outbreaks in different parts of the world,\u201d he said. The increased fatality rate was also \u201cextremely concerning\u201d, he added, particularly as cholera was relatively simple to treat with oral or intravenous hydration and antibiotics. \u201cIn 2022, people should not die of cholera,\u201d Barboza said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a respirator or anything very complicated, but people are dying just because they don\u2019t have access to healthcare. And this is not acceptable.\u201d While two doses of the oral cholera vaccine only give immunity for around three years in adults, they have come to be seen by health officials as an important tool. Although the long-term solution to cholera remains ensuring access to clean water and good sanitation, \u201cthe vaccine is the gamechanger because it allows countries to buy time to implement the rest,\u201d Barboza said. He is urging other manufacturers to step forward to help boost supply. EuBiologics, the South Korean makers of the other oral cholera vaccine, Euvichol, were \u201cdoing their best\u201d to increase capacity, he said, adding: \u201cBut, as you can understand, relying only on one manufacturer is extremely dangerous.\u201d In Malawi, the disease has killed 110 people and infected nearly 4,000 since March when the first case was reported, according to Khumbize Chiponda, Malawi\u2019s health minister. In Syria, where cholera was detected in late August, it has torn through the country, with more than 13,000 suspected cases reported, including 60 deaths. Probably as a result of that outbreak, neighbouring Lebanon has also recorded its first cases since 1993. Earlier this month, authorities in Haiti reported the first new cases in three years: by 8 October there were more than 220 suspected cases in the Port-au-Prince area, including 16 deaths. Barboza said that if swift and concerted action were not taken, a repeat of the 2010 disaster, when nearly 10,000 people died, would be on the cards. A spokesperson for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which funds the international stockpile, said the organisation was committed to supporting countries\u2019 efforts to control cholera. \u201cThe global stockpile of cholera vaccine, which Gavi has supported since 2014, is designed to be responsive to countries\u2019 immediate needs in controlling outbreaks,\u201d they added. \u201cThe stockpile maintains a level of 5m doses, and for most of this year the available volume has exceeded this target. This is the case currently and should doses be called upon for current outbreaks, stocks can be replenished rapidly, with manufacturers responding to increased demand by maximising production when necessary.\u201d"

The latest investigation relates to an interview with the author Naomi Wolf in which she claimed women were being harmed by Covid-19 vaccines as part of an effort to \u201cto destroy British civil society\u201d. Ofcom said it would investigate whether the programme broke \u201crules designed to protect viewers from harmful material\u201d after receiving more than 400 complaints from members of the public. In the interview, which was originally broadcast on 4 October, Wolf also compared doctors\u2019 support for the vaccine rollout to the behaviour of the medical profession in Nazi Germany and described herself as the \u201clast remaining independent journalist\u201d willing to question this. She was being interviewed on the Mark Steyn Show, which has repeatedly raised doubts over the safety of vaccines. Steyn\u2019s claims that the jabs cause \u201cevery conceivable kind of damage\u201d have been disputed by factchecking websites. He is already the subject of a separate Ofcom investigation over previous comments about vaccination. Wolf began as a prominent feminist writer but in recent years her career has taken a hit after she wrote a book partly based on a misunderstanding of English court records. Since then she has veered into the world of conspiracy theories about the impact of 5G telephone masts and the coronavirus vaccine. Presenter Matthew Sweet, whose BBC interview exposed the flaw in Wolf\u2019s book, has since kept tabs on her work and GB News\u2019s coverage of the pandemic and accused the channel of repeatedly \u201cbroadcasting misinformation about vaccines and presenting conspiracy theorists as legitimate experts on medical matters\u201d. In a letter to Sweet tweeted last month, GB News insisted that at no point had Steyn\u2019s programme adopted an \u201canti-vax\u201d approach. Instead it said he was conducting probing journalism in the face of people who want GB News to be \u201cmore supportive of government policy\u201d."

The organisation conceded the move would inevitably lead to a \u201creduction and shortening of immunity\u201d, adding: \u201cThe one-dose strategy has proven to be effective to respond to outbreaks, even though evidence on the exact duration of protection is limited, and protection appears to be much lower in children.\u201d Mike Ryan, the executive director for the WHO\u2019s health emergencies programme, said the decision marked \u201ca sad day\u201d. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to do it,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cAnd it is purely based on the availability globally of vaccines.\u201d Twenty-nine countries have reported cholera cases this year \u2013 including Haiti, Malawi and Syria, which are facing large-scale outbreaks. Health officials believe the true number to be higher given some countries\u2019 reluctance to be associated with the heavily stigmatised \u201cdisease of the poor\u201d. The tally shows a clear uptick on the previous five years, when fewer than 20 countries on average reported outbreaks. The WHO has said it is particularly concerned about the fatality rate, which this year was almost three times the rate of the past five years. Cholera is a waterborne disease and is easily treatable if responded to in a timely fashion, but can kill within hours if not. The International Coordinating Group (ICG), the body that manages emergency stocks of vaccines, had taken the decision because of the \u201cextremely limited\u201d supply, the WHO said in a statement, reiterating previous calls for \u201curgent action\u201d to boost global vaccine production. Of the total 36m doses forecast to be produced this year, 24m have already been shipped and 8m more have been earmarked for emergency vaccination campaigns, leaving just 4m doses in the global stockpile. Speaking in Geneva the director general of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the move was \u201cclearly less than ideal\u201d. \u201cRationing must only be a temporary solution,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cIn the long term, we need a plan to scale up vaccine production as part of a holistic strategy to prevent and stop cholera outbreaks.\u201d This scarcity will only be exacerbated by a key manufacturer\u2019s decision, revealed by the Guardian last week, to discontinue production of one of the two oral cholera vaccines used in humanitarian emergencies. \u201cAs vaccine manufacturers are producing at their maximum current capacity, there is no short-term solution to increase production,\u201d the WHO said. \u201cThe temporary suspension of the two-dose strategy will allow the remaining doses to be redirected for any needs for the rest of the year.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-10-12T18:28:43Z",
            "content": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Wednesday authorized Covid-19 vaccine boosters for children who are five years old and above. The Moderna vaccine has been approved for children six years and older, while children as young as five can get the Pfizer vaccine. The update comes nearly a year after the Center for Disease Control recommended the first round of vaccines for children five to 11 years old. Both vaccines have been approved in their bivalent form, and following today\u2019s announcement, the monovalent version of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is no longer qualified for a booster dose. A monovalent vaccine has a small portion of the original mRNA strain of the virus, which is often referred to as the \u201cancestral strain\u201d; the bivalent vaccine contains portions of the newer version of the virus, such as the BA.4 and BA.5, in addition to the ancestral strain. The vaccine for children under five years old was approved a little over a year after they were approved for adults in 2021. Since its rollout, there has been lukewarm response about vaccines for children under the age of five. Many parents expressed concerns regarding the safety of the vaccines and its effectiveness when the vaccine initially came out. In a statement, Dr Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA, highlighted the importance of the booster at this time given that children are returning to school and many are returning to pre-pandemic lifestyle, and there remains an \u201cpotential for increased risk\u201d in exposure. \u201cWhile it has largely been the case that Covid-19 tends to be less severe in children than adults, as the various waves of Covid-19 have occurred, more children have gotten sick with the disease and have been hospitalized,\u201d he said, according to ABC News. \u201cChildren may also experience long-term effects, even following initially mild disease.\u201d"

            "content": "Tucked between motorways in the west of the city, the drab brick building belonging to Madrid\u2019s Complutense University stretches the length of a football pitch. Inside, a series of sterile laboratories \u2013 capable of handling the world\u2019s most dangerous pathogens \u2013 can be found along a brightly lit hallway. This is the frontline of the EU\u2019s battle against another, albeit lesser-known, global pandemic: the highly infectious African swine fever (ASF), which has swept through dozens of countries, forcing farms to cull millions of animals. Long endemic to Africa, ASF is harmless to humans but often fatal to pigs. The current outbreak, believed to threaten around three-quarters of the world\u2019s herds, can be traced to the 2007 appearance of the virus in Georgia. Aided by the ability to survive up to 1,000 days in frozen meat and persist for long periods on clothing and vehicles, it soon began to spread beyond the Caucasus. In 2018, ASF turned up in China, home to around half of the world\u2019s pigs. By 2019, there were concerns that as many as 100 million pigs had been lost. Two years later the virus was confirmed to be in Germany, home to one of the EU\u2019s largest swine herds. From Papua New Guinea to the Dominican Republic, reports of the virus rolled in from 45 countries across five continents, forcing the protective culling of pigs, leaving family farms devastated and markets reeling from export bans. \u201cThis is the biggest animal disease outbreak we\u2019ve ever had on the planet,\u201d says Dirk Pfeiffer, a veterinary epidemiologist at City University of Hong Kong. The only tool currently available to battle the virus, he adds, \u201cis to emphasise to farmers the importance of enhanced biosecurity\u201d. Against this background, pressure has grown to create an ASF vaccine. \u201cWhile it is possible to eradicate ASF without vaccination, it takes a long time to do it,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Manuel S\u00e1nchez-Vizca\u00edno, a professor of animal health at Complutense University in Madrid. \u201cYou have to know the virus really well and understand where it hides and its tricks.\u201d The Iberian peninsula stands out as a singular example; after a strain of ASF was discovered in Portugal in 1957 \u2013 and again in 1960 \u2013 the Spanish and Portuguese governments waged a decades-long battle, using preventive culling and protecting domestic pigs from vectors such as soft ticks and wild boars, before declaring the virus eradicated in 1995. The experience \u2013 along with the meteoric rise in Europe\u2019s wild boar population \u2013 has cemented S\u00e1nchez-Vizca\u00edno\u2019s view that a vaccine is the best hope for halting ASF. The scientist is coordinating an EU-funded global consortium that, since its launch in 2019, has homed in on three vaccine candidates with the potential for use on domestic pigs and wild boars. The focus is now on carrying out large-scale tests to see how the candidates interact with other illnesses or pregnant sows. Broad questions continue to hover over the investigation, such as whether the vaccine developed in Spain would be equally effective in other regions and how often it would need to be administered. The aim is to have the vaccine ready to roll out by late 2024, according to S\u00e1nchez-Vizca\u00edno. Similar efforts are playing out around the world. Researchers at Harbin Veterinary Research Institute in China say they have made advances on a live attenuated vaccine, while the Catalan research institute CReSA-IRTA has found multiple potential vaccine candidates. At the Pirbright Institute in the UK, a team focused on ASF has been refining its own potential vaccine candidate for the past two years. \u201cPeople often ask why it is taking so long,\u201d says Linda Dixon, a virologist who leads ASF research at the institute. \u201cPeople are quite nervous about it because the thing with a live attenuated vaccine \u2013 which all of these are \u2013 is basically you\u2019re releasing a live virus into the field. And there\u2019s not enough of a history to know exactly what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d With several promising vaccines now identified and rigorously tested for safety, the focus has shifted to large-scale trials. \u201cWhenever you start to vaccinate hundreds of thousands of pigs, you might find out some things that weren\u2019t apparent from the smaller scale,\u201d Dixon says. The risks were laid bare this year after Vietnam announced in June it would become the first country in the world to administer an ASF vaccine. After an outbreak of the virus in 2019 led to the culling of more than 2 million pigs, the Vietnamese government planned to administer the vaccine to 600,000 animals in 20 provinces. However, less than three months later, state media reported that vaccinations had been temporarily suspended following the deaths of around 750 inoculated pigs. According to VietNamNet, which is affiliated with the Ministry of Information and Communications, 23,344 doses of the vaccine were supplied from July to August this year. It is not known how many of the deaths were caused by the vaccine, which had been produced in Vietnam after being developed at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and licensed to companies around the world. An investigation is currently under way to assess what exactly happened. A report released by the company that produced the vaccine suggested that some of the farms in three provinces had failed to heed instructions that it must be used only on healthy pigs between eight and 10 weeks old, according to Douglas Gladue, a senior scientist at the USDA\u2019s Plum Island Animal Disease Center. \u201cThe vaccine was used off-label and on farms where the pigs were not healthy,\u201d Gladue says. \u201cThe other 17 provinces that are giving the vaccine under supervision don\u2019t have any problems. Vaccination is continuing in those provinces.\u201d News of the Vietnam trials rippled across the global community of scientists tackling ASF, reinforcing the immensity of the challenge that lay ahead. \u201cIt was a cold shower,\u201d says S\u00e1nchez-Vizca\u00edno in Madrid. \u201cNobody was expecting that.\u201d Researchers have received a sharp reminder of the potent virus they are facing off against in this pandemic: more resilient, more complex and less understood than the coronavirus, he adds. \u201cCovid is a really simple virus. Not like ASF.\u201d You can send us your stories and thoughts at animalsfarmed@theguardian.com"

            "content": "One swallow may not make a summer but seeing or hearing birds does improve mental wellbeing, researchers have found. The study, led by academics from King\u2019s College London, also found that everyday encounters with birds boosted the mood of people with depression, as well as the wider population. The researchers said the findings suggested that visits to places with a wealth of birdlife, such as parks and canals, could be prescribed by doctors to treat mental health conditions. They added that their findings also highlighted the need to better protect the environment and improve biodiversity in urban, suburban and rural areas in order to preserve bird habitats. The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, tracked 1,292 participants\u2019 everyday encounters with birds last year via a smartphone app called Urban Mind. Over the course of two weeks, the participants, from the UK, Europe, the US, China and Australia, were prompted at random intervals to record how they were feeling, including whether they were happy or stressed, whether they could see trees, and whether they could see or hear birds. The researchers found that participants\u2019 average mental wellbeing scores increased when they saw or heard birds, including among those who disclosed they had been diagnosed with depression. This beneficial effect also lasted beyond the moment of encountering birds, with higher levels of mental wellbeing noted by participants who did not see or hear birds the next time they recorded their mood. However, this positive effect did not persist if the participants did not encounter birds during the subsequent assessment of their mood, which the researchers said indicated \u201ca possible causal link effect of birdlife on mental wellbeing\u201d. Andrea Mechelli, professor of early intervention in mental health at King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cWe need to create and support environments, particularly urban environments, where bird life is a constant feature. To have a healthy population of birds, you also need plants, you also need trees. We need to nurture the whole ecosystem within our cities.\u201d He added that the positive effect of bird encounters on people with depression was significant because many \u201cinterventions that help so-called \u2018healthy people\u2019 don\u2019t work for individuals with mental health issues\u201d. Mechelli said: \u201cWe know exercise makes everyone feel better. But it\u2019s incredibly challenging to motivate someone with depression to exercise. Whereas contact with bird life is something that, perhaps, is feasible.\u201d The artist Michael Smythe, of Nomad Projects, which helped King\u2019s College London develop the smartphone app for the study, said the research also posed questions about the link between health inequalities and access to nature, with other research showing deprived areas often had less green spaces than affluent areas. Nomad Projects co-founded Bethnal Green Nature Reserve Trust, which built a pond last summer that Smythe said had attracted an \u201cenormous diversity of birds\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a very therapeutic complex, biodiverse, abundant space within a massive housing estate between four artery roads,\u201d said Smythe. \u201cIt\u2019s now a place where people go en masse every day just to relax.\u201d Adrian Thomas, the author of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds\u2019 Guide to Birdsong, said the report\u2019s findings came as no surprise as most people described their reaction to birdsong as joy. He added: \u201cBirdsong would have once been the natural soundtrack to all human lives, and I do think that it is embedded somewhere deep within our psyches. It is associated with spring and renewal and good times coming, which is just one of the reasons why we need to address this nature crisis and ensure that nature doesn\u2019t fall silent.\u201d"

            "content": "Young people\u2019s mental health, self-confidence and employability were boosted by participation in nature projects across the UK, according to a report on a \u00a333m programme. More than 128,000 people aged 11 to 24 took part in the Our Bright Future scheme. The 31 projects improved 3,000 community spaces and created 350 nature-rich areas, from a vandalised churchyard in Hull to a rewilded quarry in County Down. The programme was led by the Wildlife Trusts and funded by the National Lottery Community Fund. Almost all participants (95%) felt their confidence had improved by taking part, while 86% said it had improved their mental health. Two-thirds said their appreciation of the natural world and belief that they could make a difference to their local environment had significantly increased. The community garden at St Hilda\u2019s church in Hull had long been covered in litter and was a focus for antisocial behaviour. Now it is a wildlife zone with flowers to attract butterflies and a pond for amphibians. Seeds of wildflowers and native grasses from a nearby nature reserve were used to restore Aughrim quarry in County Down. Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cOur natural world is the bedrock of our society but it is under serious pressure. \u201cThis report proves just how important it is to give young people practical experience to learn about nature and climate. We need to foster a new generation of green leaders to find solutions to the biggest environmental challenges of our time.\u201d James Stubbs took part in the One Planet Pioneers project in Middlesbrough when he was 19, which developed the skills of young people through environmental projects. He said of the scheme: \u201cIt gave me a chance to start a career in a sector that I had always been passionate about. \u201cHaving spent 19 of 24 months unemployed since leaving college, this is something that I never thought would have happened.\u201d Stubbs now works as a project officer for Sustrans, promoting cycling. The Our Bright Future programme led to almost 9,000 young people gaining qualifications and 1,600 getting work experience. The report, produced by evaluators from Economic Research Service and Collingwood Environmental Planning, also found more than 200 young entrepreneurs had started businesses or social enterprises, including one selling jewellery made from items found during beach litter cleanups. Spending time in woodlands, wetlands and other natural spaces has been shown to improve mental health and reduce loneliness in cities. Another recent study found that a two-hour \u201cdose\u201d of nature a week significantly significantly boosted health and wellbeing. Liz Truss\u2019s government has been sharply criticised by the country\u2019s leading nature and countryside organisations over plans to slash regulations that protect the environment. Mya-Rose Craig, the founder of Black2Nature and a Wildlife Trusts ambassador, said: \u201cAccess to nature has a profound effect not only on young people\u2019s environmental awareness but also on their physical and mental wellbeing. I hope others recognise that there is a huge appetite among young people to work towards a better future for us all.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-10-26T04:18:49Z",
            "content": "Queensland will introduce legislation that would allow United Nations officials to visit its mental health wards in a move that could leave New South Wales as the only Australian jurisdiction to refuse entry to inspectors. A UN anti-torture subcommittee suspended its tour of Australian detention facilities after Guardian Australia revealed Queensland refused access to some mental health facilities that hold people charged with crimes, while NSW blocked inspectors from entering all of its detention facilities. The delegation\u2019s head, Aisha Shujune Muhammad, condemned both states for restricting access to UN officials. \u201cIt is deeply regrettable that the limited understanding of the [subcommittee on prevention of torture\u2019s] mandate and the lack of cooperation stemming from internal disagreements, especially with respect to the states of Queensland and NSW, has compelled us to take this drastic measure,\u201d he said. States have known for five years that the inspections would occur and some had changed laws to provide for access. Questioned about the visits by Greens MP Michael Berkman in parliament on Wednesday, the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said she had been advised that UN officials faced some legislative \u201cbarriers\u201d that \u201crestricted access\u201d to some mental health, forensic and disability wards. Palaszczuk said a bill would be progressed to amend those restrictions by the end of the year, allowing the state to fulfil its obligations under the optional protocol to the convention against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Opcat). Berkman has questioned why the government would only move these amendments five years after Australia ratified Opcat and after the inspectors had suspended their visit. Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup \u201cThis looks like either gross incompetence or deliberate obstruction,\u201d Berkman told Guardian Australia. \u201cBased on what we\u2019ve heard from advocacy groups, I dread to think what the government might be hiding as they duck and weave these inspections.\u201d The chief executive of the Queensland Advocacy for Inclusion (QAI), Matilda Alexander, said a human rights compliant framework for the inspection of the state\u2019s forensic, disability and mental health wards was \u201clong overdue\u201d. \u201cFor over a decade, QAI has called for laws to fully implement Opcat in Queensland, ensuring protections against torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment,\u201d she said. \u201cLast week\u2019s disastrous UN visit shows the importance of realising this protection. It is past time for human rights to be fully protected, including in all closed settings in Queensland.\u201d A spokesperson for Queensland\u2019s attorney general, Shannon Fentiman, said the bill will address \u201ccurrent legislative barriers that restrict physical access to facilities in Queensland\u201d. The government had passed the inspector of detention services bill in August, which was \u201cthe first stage in implementing Queensland\u2019s commitments under Opcat\u201d, the spokesperson said. \u201cThis legislation establishes an independent inspector of detention \u2026 designed to encompass key features as outlined in Opcat including unrestricted access to places of detention, persons and information and the ability to make public reports and recommendations.\u201d The spokesperson said while the department is currently unable to permit the UNSPT to physically enter inpatient units, it offered the UNSPT to communicate with patients remotely \u201cwith the patient\u2019s consent.\u201d Guardian Australia has seen a letter, sent to the UN ahead of the visit, from the health minister, Yvette D\u2019Ath, which says the department will provide the subcommittee with \u201caccess to documents about the operation and conditions of [authorised mental health services]\u201d. The letter said departmental staff \u201cmay work with the UNSPT to identify patients who may wish to be interviewed\u201d but this communication may be limited if it\u2019s \u201clikely to be detrimental to the health or wellbeing of the person or others\u201d. \u201cThe department is committed to supporting the UNSPT visit \u2026 however in addition to the legislative constraints outlined above, certain practical considerations may also limit the ability of authorised mental health services to fully engage with the UNSPT,\u201d the letter says."

            "date": "2022-10-30T05:00:17Z",
            "content": "In the few years since its launch, TikTok has already altered the face of the social media landscape, attracting more than 1 billion users and leading competitors to replicate some of its most unique features. The impact of that explosive growth and the \u2018TikTok-ification\u2019 of the internet at large on social media users remains little understood, experts warn, exacerbating concerns about the impact of social media on our habits and mental health. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing that we know so little about TikTok and its effects,\u201d said Philipp Lorenz-Spreen, a research scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. \u201cResearch often lags behind industry, and this is an example of an instance where that could become a big problem.\u201d The lack of understanding in how TikTok affects its users is particularly concerning given the app\u2019s massive popularity among young people, experts say. Increasingly called \u201cthe TikTok generation\u201d, Gen Z prefers the platform to other social media, with nearly six in 10 teenagers counting themselves as daily users. The majority of US teens have accounts on TikTok, with 67% saying they have ever used the app and 16% saying they use it \u201calmost constantly\u201d. \u201cWe owe it to ourselves and to the users of these platforms to understand how we are changed by the screens we use and how we use them,\u201d said Michael Rich, a pediatrician who studies the impact of technology on children at Boston Children\u2019s hospital. \u201cWe need more information to make informed decisions on how we\u2019re going to help younger people understand how to use them thoughtfully and mindfully \u2013 or not use them at all.\u201d What makes TikTok different Concerns about the mental health impacts of social media activity are longstanding, and have only intensified in recent years. In 2021, for example, internal research at Instagram made public by Frances Haugen showed the drastic mental health impacts of the photo app on teen users \u2013 including increased rates of eating disorders among teen girls \u2013 and sparked widespread calls for stronger regulation. But TikTok hosts similar harmful content, and experts warn a host of innovative features of the platform raise unique concerns. TikTok largely optimizes content for minutes and hours of view time, internal documents leaked in 2021 showed, rather than prioritizing metrics like clicks and engagement favored by most social media platforms before. In order to do that, the company has deployed a unique algorithm and a landing page that marks the most extreme departure yet from a chronological to an algorithmic feed. \u201cWhat that does to the brain, we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Lorenz-Spreen. Studies show that when chronological feeds are discarded in favor of suggested content, the algorithm frequently gives rise to more extreme views. One report in 2021 showed more than 70% of extremist content found on YouTube was recommended to users by the algorithm. And it incentivizes users to share attention-grabbing content that gets picked up by the feed. In recent years, TikTok has faced intense scrutiny for dangerous challenges the algorithm has given rise to. The \u201cBenadryl challenge\u201d, wherein participants took a large amount of antihistamines in an attempt to produce hallucinogenic effects, led to at least one death. A new lawsuit claims the \u201cblackout challenge\u201d led to deaths of several young girls. \u201cCompared to other social media sites, TikTok is uniquely performative,\u201d said Rich, the pediatrician. \u201cThis leads to both interesting content, and some edgy ways of seeking attention that are less healthy.\u201d TikTok also appears to be \u201cfaster than any other platform at detecting interest\u201d, said Marc Faddoul, co-director of Tracking Exposed, a digital rights organization investigating TikTok\u2019s algorithm. The app\u2019s For You Page seems to know its users\u2019 desires and interests so well it has sparked memes and articles such as The TikTok Algorithm Knew My Sexuality Better Than I Did and \u2018Why is My TikTok For You Page All Lesbians?\u2019 Asks Woman Who is About to Realize Why. Researchers are still parsing what that uncanny tailoring means for users, particularly as it relates to targeted content around mental illness and other sensitive issues. \u201cThe app provides an endless stream of emotional nudges, which can be hard to recognize and really impact users in the long run,\u201d Faddoul said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to make anyone depressed overnight, but hours of consumption every day can have a serious impact on your mental health.\u201d These concerns are particularly pronounced in the realm of ADHD content, where users have reported being diagnosed by medical professionals after seeing videos about their symptoms. But while the prevalence of the #ADHD hashtag has brought increased awareness of the condition experts have warned of unintended negative effects, including medical misinformation, especially as the platform accepts advertising money from a number of for-profit mental health startups such as Cerebral. TikTok declined to comment on criticisms relating to health misinformation and users self-diagnosing based on content seen on the app. It also declined to comment on its partnership with mental health startup Cerebral or its policies on medical information used in advertisements. The algorithm may replicate existing inequalities that heighten mental health concerns for minority groups, researchers say. Black content creators on TikTok have long complained about their content being \u201cshadowbanned\u201d, or demoted by the algorithm, and in 2019 TikTok admitted to censoring videos from users it identified as disabled, overweight or LGBTQ+ in a misguided attempt to crack down on bullying. \u201cPeople of color on TikTok are constantly having to think about the ways in which the algorithm is surveilling them,\u201d said Chelsea Peterson-Salahuddin, an internet researcher at the University of Michigan School of Information. \u201cPutting the onus on marginalized people to constantly monitor themselves is very mentally and emotionally taxing.\u201d \u2018It creates a replacement for social interaction\u2019 Researchers say the Covid-19 pandemic has illustrated the impact of the platform on users\u2019 lives, especially young ones. When Covid-19 hit, and the world went into lockdown, TikTok\u2019s use exploded. The app was flooded with young people posting about the ways in which the pandemic was upending their lives. What has resulted is a very young user base taking advantage of the app to connect with one another during a very vulnerable time, said Yim Register, a researcher who studies mental health and social media. \u201cThe largest effect of the pandemic is being faced with large uncertainty, and under uncertainty our brains want to reduce uncertainty and make sense of the world,\u201d Register said. \u201cWe want to be able to accurately predict what\u2019s going to happen and we turn to social media to sense-make collectively.\u201d Register said that ethos had contributed to TikTok\u2019s unique \u201cplatform spirit\u201d, a term coined by researcher Michael Ann Devito to characterize the nature of content and communication on a given app. \u201cThe platform spirit of TikTok seems to be about posting very loudly about very intimate and intense things,\u201d Register said. \u201cAnd people are encouraged to be vulnerable to fit that spirit.\u201d This has given rise to viral videos using a wry, ironic tone to share often devastating personal stories. \u201cThings people on the internet have said to me since my sister passed away from addiction,\u201d says one video, with 3.5m views, featuring a user dancing to upbeat music and lights. \u201cThings my ex boyfriend said to me as I held my lifeless babies,\u201d the caption on another video using the same music and dancing reads. Backlash has already emerged on the platform itself over the increasingly personal nature of the app. \u201cI truly believe years from now people will deeply regret trauma dumping on TikTok,\u201d a user says in one viral video, adding that such content is less likely to be shared on Facebook and YouTube. \u201cWhat it is it about TikTok that drives people to reveal their deepest, dirtiest secrets?\u201d Experts agree, saying that while these kinds of videos can offer support and a creative way to deal with grief, it can also lead to additional trauma. \u201cFor many people, disclosing abuse or mental health issues can be traumatic and harmful,\u201d said Rich, the children\u2019s mental health expert. \u201cIn clinical work, we have systems in place for if a disclosure occurs \u2013 there is a safety net to catch them. And that does not exist in a social media environment.\u201d The dangers are heightened by the anonymous nature of TikTok, whose feed differs from that of social media in the past, researchers say. While apps such as Facebook historically offered a feed of personal content primarily from friends and family, on TikTok the majority of people who see a user\u2019s videos are largely strangers. \u201cWith TikTok in particular, because of its large user base and the way its algorithm works, videos have the potential to get very big very fast, and not everyone is prepared for that,\u201d Register said. \u201cThere are serious consequences to going viral.\u201d Often commenters will demand more engagement on viral TikToks, with a common refrain of \u201cstory time?\u201d encouraging the original poster to elaborate on the traumatic share. Register said issues like these have led more researchers to call for better protections of users. \u201cMost computing is not trauma informed, and when social media is not trauma informed it can exacerbate trauma,\u201d Register said. \u201cWhen I look at social media, the question is not how it affects your mental health, but how do mental health issues you already have get exacerbated by its design?\u201d TikTok in March 2021 introduced new tools \u201cto promote kindness\u201d on the app, allowing users to more easily filter spam and offensive comments. It also added an automatic pop-up prompt for users leaving potentially violating comments asking them \u201cto reconsider\u201d. \u201cOur goal is to promote a positive environment where people support and lift each other up,\u201d said Tara Wadhwa director of US policy at TikTok. Meanwhile, TikTok\u2019s opaque algorithm is slowly being cracked open. In August, Chinese regulators required TikTok to open up its algorithms for review, and the company around the same time began to allow Oracle to audit its content moderation models. Rich said this was just the beginning, and more transparency was needed. \u201cLegislators and these companies need to invest more in really understanding this interface between human nature and these platforms,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need more information to make informed decisions on how we\u2019re going to help younger people understand how to use them thoughtfully and mindfully \u2013 or not use them at all.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-10-05T09:00:04Z",
            "content": "When Liz Truss and her chancellor drew up the policies that crashed the pound and threatened pension funds, they were working to a blueprint devised in the Hotel du Parc of Mont-P\u00e8lerin in 1947. Among those gathered were the economists Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman and the philosopher Karl Popper, and they were profoundly depressed. \u201cThe central values of civilisation are in danger,\u201d they declared, caused by a \u201cdecline of belief in private property and the competitive market\u201d after the Great Depression and world wars. They fleshed out a belief that the state and collectivism were mortal threats to the individual\u2019s ability to succeed: Margaret Thatcher and her would-be torchbearer Truss would come to follow it with zeal. The neoliberals, as they became known, used their political exile wisely, going on to found thinktanks such as the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Adam Smith Institute to lay the intellectual foundations and find funders. But what these ideologues really needed was turmoil. \u201cOnly a crisis \u2013 actual or perceived \u2013 produces real change,\u201d Friedman observed. \u201cWhen the crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas laying around.\u201d In a foreshadowing of today, the surging inflation of the 1970s \u2013 back then, spurred on by a massive oil shock \u2013 offered that opportunity. As unions went on strike to defend falling real wages, Thatcher cleverly wove a story of individual effort stifled by the state. \u201cWe believe that everyone has the right to be unequal,\u201d she declared, arguing that while ordinary workers were crucial to society, there were \u201cothers with special gifts who should also have their chance\u201d. That meant slashing taxes for the rich, flogging off state assets and hobbling trade unions in the name of liberty. In the eyes of Truss, Thatcher\u2019s prescriptions freed Britain from the corset of socialism and ushered in a new age of prosperity \u2013 and so a return to her vision will end the same way. The problem is, it was all a myth. Despite the lifeline offered by the discovery of North Sea oil, economic growth in the 1980s was no greater than the crisis-ridden 1970s, just less equitably distributed. One rare defender of our current prime minister \u2013 from the Institute of Economic Affairs, obviously \u2013 beseeched her to stay the course, arguing that early Thatcherism was savaged just as Trussonomics is now, but that it paved the way for the growth of the following decade. A nonsense: the average annual economic expansion in the 90s was the lowest of any postwar decade up to that point, and the next two decades were weaker still. The best performing decade was the 1960s \u2013 the heyday of statism. The legacy of Thatcherism was an economy too dependent on the City of London, with communities stripped of secure work, creaking infrastructure and public services, and an explosion of inequality. When the chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, talks of Britain\u2019s \u201ccycle of stagnation\u201d, and Truss damns the \u201cbusiness-as-usual economic management\u201d that has delivered low growth for decades, both are right. But it is the ideas of the Mont Pelerin Society to blame. Slashing corporation tax will punch a \u00a318.7bn-size hole in the nation\u2019s revenues, but trickle-down theory says it will pay for itself with investment. But as the former chancellor Rishi Sunak has said, \u201cthat low corporation tax rate we had has done absolutely zilch for investment in our economy, it has not increased, it is still one of the lowest in the developed world: it accounts for over half our productivity difference.\u201d Just as the winter of discontent became a salutary fable about the dangers of collectivism, \u201cthat time the Tories crashed the economy by slashing taxes on the rich\u201d should become an eternal warning hung around the neck of rightwing dogmas. Any attempt to repeat this failed experiment should conjure up images of economic ruin. Here\u2019s an opportunity for Labour. Unlike Thatcher, Truss has no electoral mandate, limited support from MPs, no North Sea oil or Falklands war, and the communication skills of an unprepared supply teacher. But Friedman was right \u2013 in a crisis, radical change depends on the ideas lying around. Labour has made some good tentative steps in the right direction, from nationalisation of rail to a sovereign wealth fund to a public energy generation company. But now\u2019s the time to go further. Instead of old-style top-down nationalisation, Labour could argue for democratic public ownership, where workers and communities own public utilities. Taxes on wealth and income could fund devastated public services, and fix inequalities that even the International Monetary Fund now recognises destabilise the economy. A new charter of rights for trade unions and higher wages could stop the wealth generated by workers being hoovered up by a tiny few, stashed away in tax havens. A Swiss dream became our nightmare \u2013 but their hubris will only truly meet its nemesis if Labour has the same courage and determination as the true believers of Mont Pelerin.

            "date": "2022-10-28T05:30:20Z",
            "content": "Over the past few months, at a state school in the centre of Colombo, Sri Lanka, it has become common for children to faint in the middle of class. Students, coming from homes in the capital where parents can barely afford a meal a day, have been arriving at school quietly starving, as the country continues to grapple with the worst economic crisis since the great depression. \u201cParents can\u2019t afford the meat, eggs and milk that children need,\u201d says Sandarenu Amarasiri, a teacher, adding that many were also missing school because financial hardship meant they could not afford transport, uniforms and shoes. This month, in an attempt to tackle the rampant hunger, the school began a programme giving basic lunch to students. \u201cEven we teachers try to give a meal to our students whenever we can,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it is not easy with the prices of food.\u201d Since the beginning of the year, the once-thriving Sri Lanka has been brought to its knees. As a result of a series of disastrous economic decisions, compounded by corruption, the pandemic and the Ukraine war, the country found itself without any foreign currency reserves to import essential items, including food, fuel and medicines. Food shortages, blackouts and school closures have become the norm for the island\u2019s 22 million people. Many have warned that it is children bearing the brunt of the crisis. Food inflation has continued to rise, hitting a record 94.9% in September according to the Colombo Consumer Price Index, meaning parents have been unable to afford even basics such as rice and dal, while vegetables and meat have become unaffordable luxuries for many households. The crippling crisis spawned a mass protest movement which led to the toppling of president Gotabaya Rajapaksa in July, who was blamed for financial mismanagement and rife corruption. However, the change in leadership, to the Rajapaksa ally Ranil Wickremesinghe, has done little to ease Sri Lanka\u2019s economic woes, with experts warning it could be years before the country is back on its feet, despite a $2.9bn (\u00a32.5bn) loan from the International Monetary Fund tentatively agreed last month. With 90% of people relying on state handouts, child malnutrition has soard across Sri Lanka. According to Save the Children, two-thirds of families are now struggling to feed themselves, while Unicef\u2019s regional director for south Asia, George Laryea-Adjei, says that \u201cchildren are going to bed hungry, unsure of where their next meal will come from\u201d. In Mahavita village in Yakkala, about 20 miles from Colombo, mothers speak despairingly of not being able to feed children. Wasanthi Jennifer, 43, a single mother to a 15-year-old son who earns a tiny income from a shop run out of her house, recently did not have enough money even for dal so foraged kohila leaves, a Sri Lankan herb, from the roadside to give her son lunch. \u201cIt broke my heart to watch my son eat just kohila and rice,\u201d says Jennifer. \u201cHe is a good boy. He eats whatever we have at home without complaining.\u201d Jennifer says they could no longer afford milk for tea, and she regularly went without breakfast. \u201cI have to live by the day,\u201d she says. She could also not afford another much-needed school uniform. \u201cAs soon as he comes back, we wash it so that he can wear it the next day,\u201d she says. \u201cLast week, he didn\u2019t go to school because his shoes were torn. I had to take a loan from a villager to buy him a new pair of shoes.\u201d The loan \u2013 4,000 rupees ($10.94) \u2013 is more than double the cost of buying him shoes last year. In Sri Lanka\u2019s poverty-stricken regions in the north, parents have started leaving their children in care homes as they can no longer feed them. An official working in child protection in the northern province, who was not authorised to speak to the media, confirmed to the Guardian that \u201cmore and more parents are leaving their children in children\u2019s homes because of financial issues \u2026 I have personally met parents who say that they can\u2019t provide for their children any more.\u201d The 65m rupees in funding that the northern province child services used to receive has been cut, meaning that the authorities don\u2019t have the means to step in and help families when finances are causing the problem. According to figures from the Department of Probation and Child Care Services, in the first six months of this year, 246 children in the northern region were sent to care homes, almost double the 146 children put into state care for the whole of 2021, a rise which local officials directly attributed to the economic crisis. Experts say the long-term implications on child development could be severe, and damage Sri Lanka\u2019s much-lauded literacy rate of 92%, which is the best in the region. Ishanka Maduwanthi, 34, another mother living in Yakkala near Colombo, says she could no longer afford the school fees to send her five-year-old son to school, and her nine-year-old daughter was also forced to regularly miss school when they couldn\u2019t afford the bus fare or food for her. Her husband used to earn money as a daily wage earner but now all the work has dried up in the crisis. Fish, milk and chicken have become distant memories, and now the family of four live off only rice, lentils and sambol, a simple dish made from grated coconut. If she can, Maduwanthi buys eggs twice a month in a effort to provide some protein to her children, but even that is a push for the family, and she recently had to rely on a donation of rice as she did not have the money to buy it herself. \u201cSometimes my daughter feels faint and has bad stomach aches,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I am doing the best I can.\u201d"

            "content": "Anxious business leaders have cautiously welcomed Rishi Sunak as prime minister amid signs the UK economy is heading for recession after a sharp fall in confidence among company bosses during Liz Truss\u2019s brief premiership. The latest snapshot from the economy showed optimism among business leaders collapsed in October to the lowest level since April 2020, during the early stages of the Covid pandemic, as intense inflationary pressures, escalating political uncertainty and rising borrowing costs weighed on growth. Industry leaders said the new prime minister had to take urgent steps to help repair battered business confidence. UK government borrowing costs fell on global markets on the news of Sunak\u2019s victory as Conservative leader, while the pound was little changed against the dollar. Tony Danker, the director general of the CBI lobby group, said the former chancellor had a \u201ctrack record of seeing the economy through difficult times\u201d during the Covid pandemic. \u201c[He] is now coming in at a time of great uncertainty with tough choices ahead. \u201cThe new prime minister can lose no time in easing the impact of market turmoil on households and firms, and helping to restore fiscal credibility.\u201d In a brief victory speech, Sunak said he recognised the \u201cprofound economic challenge\u201d facing Britain, adding: \u201cWe now need stability and unity.\u201d The pound fell to record lows in the immediate aftermath of the mini-budget, but has gradually recovered as the government rowed back on its plans and was trading at about $1.13 against the dollar on Monday. The yield \u2013 or interest rate \u2013 on 30-year UK government bonds dropped by 0.3 percentage points to below 3.8%, falling back close to levels seen before Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s disastrous fiscal statement a month ago. Sunak will formally take over as prime minister after meeting the king at Buckingham Palace, most likely on Tuesday, at which point Truss will have served 50 days in the job. Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said his appointment came after a \u201chugely damaging\u201d few months of political and economic uncertainty. \u201cWe cannot afford to see any more flip-flopping on policies \u2013 the UK\u2019s businesses need a sustainable, long-term economic plan they can believe in.\u201d Juergen Maier, the former chief executive of Siemens UK, said he thought the former chancellor was the best candidate to \u201ctry to bring some much needed calm\u201d but that deep political risks still remained. \u201cHe needs to stand up to the ERG rightwing faction of his party, who have created untold economic damage. All prime ministers since Brexit have stumbled over this.\u201d The S&amp;P Global/CIPS UK purchasing managers\u2019 index dropped to a 21-month low in October, the latest release on Monday showed, reflecting the growing risks of recession as households and businesses cut back their spending amid the highest rates of inflation for 40 years. The monthly survey of company bosses was the third in a row in which a majority reported a contraction in activity. This included delays to business investment decisions due to political uncertainty, as well as concerns over higher borrowing costs as the Bank of England raises interest rates. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: \u201cOn top of the collapse in political stability, financial market stress and slump in confidence, these higher borrowing costs will add to speculation of a worryingly deep UK recession.\u201d It comes as the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, pushes ahead with preparations for the government to announce debt-cutting plans on 31 October. Although some experts have suggested the Tory leadership race could delay the announcement, others say sticking to the agreed date would help prevent a sharper rise in interest rates from the Bank of England when it next meets to decide on borrowing costs on 3 November. Dave Ramsden, one of the Bank\u2019s deputy governors, said on Monday that Threadneedle Street was \u201cengaging\u201d with the Treasury over the potential fiscal event. The plan, effectively a second budget in as many months, is expected to confirm deep cuts to public spending after a series of U-turns over Kwarteng\u2019s unfunded tax cutting pledges. Sunak had enjoyed popularity in opinion polls during his time as chancellor in the Covid pandemic, when he approved billions of pounds in spending to help businesses and workers through the health emergency. However, that began to wane as he initially refused to provide cost of living support earlier this year. He also warned tough tax and spending choices were needed before losing to Truss in the Tory leadership race over the summer. Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec, said: \u201cTrying to win back voters when the economy faces a number of different difficulties and taxes are going up is a different matter entirely.\u201d"

            "content": "Asking prices for houses in the UK edged higher in October, although demand from first-time buyers has dropped as mortgage rates surge. Despite the economic turmoil since the government\u2019s mini-budget last month, there has been little immediate sign of the housing market slipping, according to Rightmove. The property website said that the average price of a property coming to market this month was up 0.9%, to a new record of \u00a3371,158, slightly below the average increase for the time of year. However, Rightmove warned that the effects of wider economic uncertainty could take time to filter through, with some buyers rushing to complete on the back of existing mortgage offers. Others have predicted that the market will soon decline, with Halifax reporting a marginal decrease in sold prices in September, and surveyors RICS tipping the end of the 13-year UK housing boom next year. First-time buyer demand was 21% lower in the last two weeks compared with 2021, but still significantly higher than in 2019, Rightmove said. However, it said some new movers had paused their plans in the face of uncertainty over prices and rates. It said the vast majority of agreed sales were going ahead, with some buyers accelerating the process to ensure they could proceed with lower fixed-rate mortgage offers before they expired. Prices were reduced on 23% of homes on sale, compared with 21% last month. About 1,000 mortgage deals were removed from sale by lenders last month, after the former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s mini-budget on 23 September spooked financial markets and prompted expectations of far higher interest rates. Rightmove said asking prices were likely to drop in November and December, in line with normal seasonal price changes, and that there were \u201cmore economic events to play out\u201d before forecasting the market in 2023. Tim Bannister, Rightmove\u2019s director, said: \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to house prices is understandably on the minds of many home-movers right now, especially after the market uncertainty after the government\u2019s mini-budget. There has been no immediate effect on prices, but the trend of a slight softening in the pace of growth continues. He said it would take time for the market to settle into a more normal level of activity after \u201ctwo years of market frenzy\u201d, adding: \u201cSome aspiring first-time buyers will have had their plans dashed by the sudden nature of the mortgage rate rises, and now face a difficult situation with rents also rising, and a shortage of available homes to rent.\u201d"

At least, that is how advisers to Sir Keir Starmer would like it framed: the super-wealthy and preternaturally young new prime minister versus their reliably grownup leader. If Wednesday\u2019s prime minister\u2019s questions is any guide, Labour ministers will need to deepen and broaden their attack. It\u2019s not that they lack for material, served up in a reliably adult manner by the leader of the opposition. From Rishi Sunak\u2019s non-dom wife to his reappointment of Suella Braverman to the very office she quit in disgrace just last week, all was present and correct. One can see in this the germ of this winter\u2019s political debate \u2013 and the two big problems with it. Not only did Mr Sunak have his guard up, he\u2019d brought his own parries. In the new prime minister\u2019s view, his rival is a north London remainer who worships Jeremy Corbyn. Missing from this tired ding-dong between Sir Forensic and a reedy, dweeby understudy of Boris Johnson was the fact that the vast majority of voters are suffering a vicious squeeze on their living standards. Meanwhile, pubs and churches are setting themselves up as warm hubs, so that people who can\u2019t afford to heat their homes do not freeze this winter. Hospitals in Leicester have started food banks for their own workers. Not only does the parliamentary pantomime ring particularly hollow in this brutal winter, but the post-2020 dynamic of Labour competence against Conservative culture war is over. To rehash an old rule of politics: it\u2019s the economic crisis, stupid. And neither Mr Sunak nor Sir Keir is prepared. In fairness to the new prime minister, he has got one thing right. By putting off the next budget until mid-November, he has given his government breathing and thinking space to make more serious fiscal plans. The bad news is he plans another disastrous round of austerity. Wednesday\u2019s most telling challenge came from the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, who asked for a guarantee that benefits would rise in line with inflation \u2013 a guarantee the prime minister refused to give. This will drive to destitution some of the lowest-paid Britons, as recognised by a Tory chancellor who just a few months back swore benefits would be linked to inflation. That chancellor was none other than Mr Sunak. The odds-on favourite to be the next prime minister is of course Sir Keir, and it is natural that he will be asked more and more what he would do differently. So far, the honest answer is: we don\u2019t know. Labour has a \u00a328bn-a-year green investment package and a pledge to scrap the non-dom tax loophole. But it needs to do more on wealth taxes, and it should argue that spending cuts amid a recession are madness. Far better to protect benefits and public servants\u2019 wages, and to lay out plans to grow the economy. Given how fast food prices are rising, it should also guarantee meals for schoolchildren \u2013 in and out of term. Oppositions don\u2019t win elections, it is often said; governments lose them. From Boris Johnson to Liz Truss, through parties and lobbying scandals and foolhardy budgets, this government has done its level best to lose the next election. Now it\u2019s up to Labour to prove why it should win. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "content": "That\u2019s all for today. Time for a quick recap. The pound has rallied back over $1.13 after Liz Truss announced she is resigning as prime minister, teeing up a short battle to replace her. The London stock market has also closed higher, while some UK bond prices have strengthened a little today, lowering the cost of long-term borrowing a tad. Analysts see Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt as the front-runners, with the winner due to be named a week on Friday. The end of Truss\u2019s brief, calamitous, stint in Downing Street will also likely end the push for Trussonomics, following the frenzied market reaction to her unfunded tax cuts paid for by higher borrowing. Analysts say a shift to more orthodox conservative economic policy could stabilise market, and remove the so-called \u2018moron risk premium\u2019 which hit UK assets. As Paul Dales of Capital Economics put it earlier: \u201cOverall, the resignation of Truss is a step that needed to happen for the UK government to move further along the path towards restoring credibility in the eyes of the financial market. \u201cBut more needs to be done and the new prime minister and their Chancellor have a big task to navigate the economy through the cost of living crisis, cost of borrowing crisis and the cost of credibility crisis. The situation is clearly going to evolve very quickly.\u201d Business leaders have demanded that Truss\u2019s successor acts rapidly to stabilise the crisis-hit economy. Our Politics Liveblog has all the action: In other news\u2026 A Bank of England deputy governor has predicted that interest rates may not rise as high as the markets expect. Investors now believe the Bank is likely to raise interest rates by three-quarters of a point in November, not the full percentage-point increase expected recently.

A National Grid director has explained how the plan will reward homes and businesses for using energy outside of peak hours: In other energy news, the gas and electricity supplier Ovo has revived its interest in snapping up nationalised rival Bulb. Asset managers have said they are navigating tough investment conditions in the UK, as economic turmoil reduced the value of their portfolios and persuaded customers to pull and divert their cash. Jupiter Fund Management said the macroencomic backdrop was worsening, while Schroders reported a drop in sssets under management, including a \u00a320bn decline in its \u201csolutions\u201d division, which covers funds focused on liability driven investing, or LDI. And National Express has reported a further rebound in passengers and a rise in revenues after it stepped up services during rail strikes and helped shuttle police during the Queen\u2019s funeral. In other news tonight, the gas and electricity supplier Ovo has revived its interest in snapping up nationalised rival Bulb, potentially gazumping a bid by Octopus Energy. Ovo has written to Bulb\u2019s special administrator to inform it that it is again considering a purchase. Ovo originally submitted an offer to buy Bulb shortly after it collapsed in November last year, but later pulled out of the auction, during which several bidders have fallen away. Discussions between government officials and Octopus have dragged on for months. Industry sources told Sky News, which first reported Ovo\u2019s renewed interest, that its proposals would not require additional taxpayer funding, unlike those of Octopus. Britain has been through the wringer since September\u2019s mini-budget, our economics correspondent Richard Partington writes. Not only was Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s not-so-mini plan the trigger for a domestic financial crisis and raising mortgage costs for millions, it lit the blue touchpaper for his political downfall and that of his close friend, Liz Truss. It was all supposed to be so different. Truss had spent the summer promising to cancel the rise in national insurance and corporation tax in the Conservative leadership race. Those pledges, plus the popular energy price freeze, would have been plenty for the new government to announce in the supposedly stripped-back tax and spending event. Instead, it was a bumper, ideologically driven occasion that left Truss\u2019s defeated political rival, Rishi Sunak, vindicated. As he had warned, there was indeed a run on sterling, gilt market freefall and spooked global investors. Even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) intervened with a stunning public rebuke. Rarely has a budget caused such political and economic damage. Not even George Osborne\u2019s \u201comnishambles\u201d budget, when he was forced in 2012 to back down from the pasty tax, comes close. More here: Business leaders have responded with anger and dismay to the UK\u2019s political crisis, saying that Liz Truss\u2019s replacement must act rapidly to stabilise the crisis-hit economy. Paul Drechsler, the chief executive of BusinessLDN, a group representing companies in London, said the UK was in the grips of an \u201cunmitigated political and economic crisis\u201d and the government would need a \u201crock solid\u201d cabinet as well as a new leader. However, he argued against an immediate general election, which could add to the government\u2019s paralysis for several weeks. \u201cWe don\u2019t need more Cirque du Soleil. We don\u2019t want any more circus, any more theatre, any more shenanigans. Just do your job.\u201d More here: Shares in London have closed higher tonight, on hopes that the UK\u2019s political turmoil could ease, soon. Following Liz Truss\u2019s resignation, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index closed 19 points higher at 6943, up 0.27%. Some UK companies were among the top risers, including Lloyds Banking Group (+3.5%), commercial property firm Land Securities (+3%), property portal Rightmove (+2.8%), warehouse operator Segro (+2.8%) and housebuilder Barratt (2.6%). The smaller FTSE 250 index, which is a better gauge of the domestic economy, jumped 141 points or 0.8% to finish at 17,388. Analysts said a change of PM might calm the markets \u2013 depending who it is. Viraj Patel, global macro strategist at Vanda Research, says: \u201cInitially, this is likely to take an uncertainty premium out of the market but it depends who takes over. You need a steady hand at the top. Philip Shaw of Investec wins a small prize for the title of his analyst note on today\u2019s political turmoil: Britannia Untrussed \u2013 Britain heads for third PM this year Following a chaos-strewn 45 days as Prime Minister, PM Liz Truss stood down today, stating that she could not deliver the mandate on which she was elected by Conservative Party members. Indeed even the past week has been filled with turmoil, starting with the sacking of Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng last Friday and culminating yesterday in the departure of Home Secretary Suella Braverman and total confusion among Tory MPs in the House of Commons over a vote on fracking. By contrast with the political situation, conditions in markets have calmed down over the past week or so. At the time of writing, ten-year gilt yields are 43bps points are lower since last week\u2019s close and 30-year yields down 81bps (helped by the Bank of England stating that for now, it will not sell gilts of more than 20 years\u2019 maturity in its Quantitative Tightening operations, which it plans to start from 1 November). Sterling is also a touch higher [now $1.131]. The critical point here is that new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt acted quickly to reassure markets on Monday morning, making it clear that he would jettison almost all of Kwarteng\u2019s unfunded tax cuts, saving \u00a332bn per annum. He also announced that Truss\u2019s plan to freeze the domestic energy price cap at \u00a32,500 would be curtailed from two years to six months, with a (yet to be decided) more targeted scheme to replace it in April next year. Furthermore Hunt stated that additional painful decisions need to be made both in terms of taxation and public spending. The Budget on 31 October has therefore become a critical event. Interest rate markets have rallied to price in a lower peak in the Bank rate, from 6.25% in late September to a touch above 5.00% now, but after the events of the past month and a half, the reputation of the UK remains on the line. While credibility is easily lost, it can take a very long time for it to be regained. In this respect markets will consider it essential for the Chancellor to be able to carry through his plans to bring the UK back on course to meet its fiscal rules. Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, thinks Rishi Sunak is the most likely candidate to replace Liz Truss, followed by Penny Mordaunt (who came third in the MP\u2019s ballot last time). Rahman also sees a 10% chance of a general election: Some senior Tories will now urge contenders to reach agreement on a \u201ccoronation\u201d. But for now, both Sunak and Mordaunt appear unwilling to stand aside for each other. Braverman might also insist on her right to stand. If she secured a place in a run-off among the members, the election of Truss this summer suggests that Braverman would have a chance of winning. But we suspect the final two in this scenario would be Sunak and Mordaunt. Sunak would start as the front-runner, due to his greater experience than Mordaunt, but he has enemies among MPs loyal to Johnson and Truss, who might try to scupper his bid. We assign a 35% chance of Sunak becoming PM; 30% for Mordaunt; 15% for Braverman; 15% Badenoch and 5% for Johnson. We continue to think a general election is unlikely but raise the odds from 5% to 10% due to fears, shared by some ministers, that the party\u2019s mutinous MPs have become \u201cungovernable.\u201d Steven Swinford of The Times, though, says there are questions about whether the fiscal event will have to be delayed beyond 31 October, given the leadership contest. The Treasury has confirmed the government will push ahead with plans for holding a debt-cutting announcement on 31 October as planned, although any final decision to proceed will be the responsibility of the incoming prime minister. Jeremy Hunt has indicated he will not run for prime minister. The chancellor is expected to announce cuts to public spending, after U-turning on almost all of Liz Truss\u2019 unfunded tax cuts contained in last month\u2019s ill-fated mini budget. The pound has now rallied higher, up one cent to $1.132 against the US dollar. Sterling pushed higher amid reports that former chancellor Rishi Sunak, who warned against Liz Truss\u2019s tax-cutting plans, is \u2018certain\u2019 to stand in the leadership battle, according to the Telegraph. Electing Rishi Sunak as prime minister would be the best way to remove the \u2018risk premium\u2019 that is hurting UK bonds, and the pound. So explains Neil Mehta, portfolio manager at asset manager BlueBay A political reset would continue to erase the risk-premium embedded in UK assets after the ill-fated Truss/Kwarteng mini-budget. Particularly if front-runner Rishi Sunak becomes PM and implements more orthodox conservative economic policy. With Jeremy Hunt as chancellor, we could see a more meaningful shift towards a more centrist government, with more focus on the economy rather than populist areas such as migration and Brexit. This will likely embolden Gilts and the pound, but the longer terms challenges facing the UK economy on cost of living and inflation will unlikely abate \u2013 with a Labour government in the waiting. After the last few weeks of complete chaos and dysfunctional government, UK firms are pleading for some calm, and actual help to get them through the tough winter. Martin McTague, National Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, says Liz Truss\u2019s successor needs to secure economic growth and improve the economy: \u201cIt is incumbent upon the next Conservative Party leader to show they can provide stability and take the necessary steps to secure economic growth in the face of significant recessionary pressures. Businesses are crying out for an end to the political turmoil and a focus on remedying the economy, supporting small firms through the hard winter ahead. \u201cWhoever becomes Prime Minister must knuckle down, see through the delivery of the energy support package for small businesses - as already approved by Parliament - and the reversal of the hike in National Insurance. \u201cBeyond that there must be a focus on securing prosperity for the longer term, making sure we have the right support for improving broadband, housebuilding, labour supply, and the tax and regulatory framework \u2013 so we can build our way out of the increasingly negative economic climate.\u201d The pound is slightly higher against the euro today, up 0.1% at \u20ac1.1484. It had fallen to \u20ac1.142, before starting to rally this afternoon even before the official announcement: The resignation of the prime minister after just six weeks, following mounting chaos and financial turmoil, does not make Britain a particularly attractive place to invest. Jason Paltrowitz, director at US financial services group OTC Markets, says its hard for American investors to put money into the UK at the moment: From the US, early reaction to the PM\u2019s resignation fits the recent narrative that the lack of political certainty is proving difficult for UK equities and subsequent valuations. It will therefore continue to be difficult for US investors to participate and look at future buying opportunities without clarity soon. Sam North, market analyst at eToro, says the current economic crisis warrants fast action from the Conservative Party to elect a new leader. \u201cThe longer a race takes, the more turmoil there could be for markets. UK gilts and GBP have reacted somewhat to her resignation, but we haven\u2019t yet seen a big move. This might begin to change if the contest drags on. \u201cChancellor Jeremy Hunt is due to deliver a new Budget and OBR forecast on Halloween, but there is plenty of time for markets to spook before that, making his job tougher, and worsening conditions for households in terms of inflation and interest rate expectations and ensuing tax implications.\u201d Timings wise, Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee, has said it will be possible to conduct a leadership ballot by 28 October. He says: I have spoken to the party chairman, Jake Berry, and he has confirmed that it will be possible to conduct a ballot and conclude a leadership election by Friday the 28 October. So we should have a new leader in place before the fiscal statement which will take place on the 31st. Our Politics Live blog reports that Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, and trade secretary Kemi Badenoch are expected to stand, but that Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove are not. Update: Former British prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to stand too. Although the resignation of Liz Truss as Prime Minister leaves the UK without a leader when it faces huge economic, fiscal and financial market challenges, the markets appear to be relieved, writes Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. The pound has climbed from $1.12 to $1.13 and 30-year gilt yields have fallen further from 3.95% to 3.90%. In other words, the markets are further pricing out the risk premium that the Truss government generated. There is still a lot of uncertainty, but the lesson surely is that the economic, fiscal and financial market backdrop matters. Dales also points out that fiscal policy has swung from being ultra loose, to less loose to outright tight in just a few weeks, as Jeremy Hunt took charge of the Treasury and \u201calmost wiped from history\u201d the tax policies of Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng. But the new Prime Minister and their Chancellor have a big task to navigate the economy through \u201cthe cost of living crisis, cost of borrowing crisis and the cost of credibility crisis\u201d, Dales concludes. Liz Truss\u2019s departure should help calm the markets, predicts Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group. An initial bounce in the pound has begun to fade, as the implications of yet another period of uncertainty sink in. But given how quick the change is expected, and with the chancellor likely to stay in place, we should expect market tensions to calm. In all likelihood Rishi is ready to step in, and with Hunt in alignment with him we can expect a very different approach, but one more likely to please markets. Although Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has managed to reinstate some economic credibility, there is still a long way to go before political credibility is restored, warns Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor: The pound is trading higher, attempting to climb back up its 2-week highs logged earlier this week as investors cheer Truss\u2019 departure and the potential for a more economically savvy, market friendly leader. Sterling\u2019s strength is weighing on the FTSE 100 with its major UK exporter stocks like Diageo and CocaCola languishing near the bottom of the UK index. There is still plenty of caution towards the UK as an investment destination given the ongoing political uncertainty, the growing risk of recession and Britain\u2019s persistent inflation problem with price levels hovering at 40-year highs. The pound is still up half a cent at $1.126 as investors digest the departure of Liz Truss, having hit $1.13 as news broke she was resigning. As Neil Wilson of Market.com point out, although the PM\u2019s \u2018sorry reign\u2019 is over, there is still huge uncertainty about whether the Tory party can survive in power. So that uncertainty means there\u2019s not a firmer move in the markets (the FTSE 100 has now dropped back into the red for the day. Wilson writes: The economic policies were already dead in the water so the market doesn\u2019t have a huge amount of genuine new information to move on despite the seismic events of the last 24 hours. Truss\u2019s decision to standing down may allow for a new leader to see out the parliamentary term, Wilson suggests. It could be a Rishi Sunak/Jeremy Hunt ticket - meaning fiscal restraint. Wilson also adds that the markets \u201cprobably likes orthodox one-nation Tory economics\u201d rather than anything else. Liz Truss is resigning as prime minister. in a brief statement outside Downing Street, Truss (who took office just 44 days ago) says she has notificed King Charles that she will step down as PM. There will be a leadership contest, to be completed within the next week, and Truss will stay on until her successor is chosen. Our Politics Liveblog has all the action on another day of chaos in Westminster: The stock market has actually slipped back a little, but the UK-focused FTSE 250 is still up 0.6% today and the pound is still trading near $1.13. Update: Here\u2019s Liz Truss\u2019s resignation speech in full: I came into office at a time of great economic and international instability. Families and businesses were worried about how to pay their bills. Putin\u2019s illegal war in Ukraine threatens the security of our whole continent. And our country had been held back for too long by low economic growth. I was elected by the Conservative Party with a mandate to change this. We delivered on energy bills and on cutting national insurance. And we set out a vision for a low tax, high growth economy \u2013 that would take advantage of the freedoms of Brexit. I recognise though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to His Majesty The King to notify him that I am resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party. This morning I met the Chair of the 1922 Committee Sir Graham Brady. We have agreed there will be a leadership election to be completed in the next week. This will ensure we remain on a path to deliver our fiscal plans and maintain our country\u2019s economic stability and national security. I will remain as Prime Minister until a successor has been chosen. Thank you . Stocks are rising in London, on news that Liz Truss is to give a statement outside Number 10. The FTSE 250 index of smaller, more domestically-focused stocks, has gained 0.8% today: The FTSE 100 index is up 0.3%, with Lloyds Bank (+4.4%) leading the risers. The pound has pushed higher on reports that Liz Truss will give a statement outside Number 10 Downing Street on her future at 1.30pm. Sterling is now up two-thirds of a cent at $1.128, the highest since yesterday morning. Earlier today, a spokesperson for the prime minister told reporters that Truss will continue in office beyond the fiscal statement on 31 October. The pound has hit its highest level of the day, after more Conservative MPs reveal they have lost confidence in the prime minister. Sterling has risen a third of a cent to $1.125, the highest level this session, after Jill Mortimer, Conservative MP for Hartlepool, said she had submitted a letter. Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs, is currently meeting with Liz Truss inside No 10. National Express has reported a further rebound in passengers and a rise in revenues after it stepped up services during rail strikes and helped shuttle police during the Queen\u2019s funeral. The coach and bus operator said revenues rose by 33% in the three months to the end of September and were now above 2019 levels, thanks in part to strong growth in its UK and Spanish coach business. In the UK, it said demand was partly driven by industrial action on the country\u2019s train network. That included August strikes by rail operators that halted intercity trains across Britain. ING\u2019s James Smith also believes UK interest rates will peak lower than the &gt;5% which the markets had been pricing in: The head of the CBI has warned that the UK\u2019s growth engine is grinding to a halt in some places, as political instability leaves business owners confused and unwilling to invest. Tony Danker (who once hailed the mini-budget as a \u2018turning point\u2019 for the economy*) says political and market stability is needed. That means firms can grow, meaning more employment and tax revenues, and less need to slash public spending or hike taxes. * \u2013 and in many ways it was, unfortunately. Here\u2019s the Broadbent effect \u2013 market expectations for interest rate rises are down: Back in the markets, UK government bond prices have also strengthened following Ben Broadbent\u2019s speech. The yields on two-year, 1o-year and 30-year bonds are all now down today, pushing down government borrowing costs. Markets are react to the deputy governor\u2019s warning that interest rate forecasts may be too high, and have reached levels that would deliver a \u201cpretty material\u201d hit to the economy. In another worrying sign, more than a quarter of companies said their turnover decreased in September. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) found 26% of trading businesses reported their turnover was lower compared with August 2022, while just 14% reported their turnover was higher. The accommodation and food service activities industry saw the biggest drop-off, with 52% of businesses reporting a drop in turnover compared with August (when the summer holidays will have boosted some takings). A quarter (25%) of businesses also reported their performance had decreased in September 2022 compared with September 2021. Companies are also suffering from the economic and political turmoil. In early October (shortly after the min-budget) more than a third of businesses reported economic uncertainty was having an impact on their turnover. A fifth expect their turnover to decrease in November 2022. As we covered earlier, the UK hospitality sector is already shrinking at the fastest pace since the 2021 pandemic lockdown: Over 40 percent of UK firms have either no cash reserves left, or have less than three months worth to help them through the downturn. That\u2019s the worst situation since June last year, the Office for National Statistics reports: The situation is particularly tight in the education industry, where 51% of private sector and higher education businesses have less than three months cash left. The administrative and support service activities industry reported the largest increase in the proportion of businesses reporting having no cash reserves or three months or less, up to 44% from 35% reported in early July. This is an important intervention by Ben Broadbent, says Chris Giles of the Financial Times. He reckons that if the markets take the deputy governor seriously, we\u2019ll see a fall in expected bank rate. That could leading to lower debt interest service costs for the government \u2013 in time to shrink the fiscal \u2018black hole\u2019 facing Jeremy Hunt, and also lower mortgages rates in a few days time. Ben Broadbent has also produced a fascinating chart, showing how market interest rates have risen much higher than the Bank of England\u2019s internal modelling suggests is necessary. The barchart is the \u201coptimum\u201d level of rate increases you\u2019d expect given the energy support package and the fall in sterling, while the blue line shows the actual, rather higher, rise in yields. Broadbent says we should treat this with some scepticism, as it uses a simple policymaking \u201cbot\u201d to work out the optimal rate path. Plus, there are other factors at work \u2013 including political uncertainty (that \u2018moron risk premium\u2019 we looked at earlier). Or as Broadbent puts it more diplomatically: The market may also be wary about further changes in fiscal policy, and to take a skewed view of the risks in that respect. Ben Broadbent\u2019s speech shows that Bank of England are cautious about how fast to raise interest rates, with the economy weakening. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s take: Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said it\u2019s not clear that UK interest rates need to rise as much as investors expect and warned about a hit to the economy if markets bets come to pass. While \u201cthe justification for tighter policy is clear\u201d in the face of soaring inflation, demand will slow to some extent anyway along with higher prices, Broadbent said in the text of a speech on Thursday. If rates follow the current path, it could cause a 5% hit to GDP, he said. The remarks indicate caution at the BOE about how quickly to tighten monetary policy as the risk grows that the UK has already slipped into recession. It also feeds into a tumultuous few weeks for the central bank and the outlook for the economy after Prime Minister Liz Truss\u2019s government first announced a huge fiscal stimulus on Sept. 23 and then subsequently unwound much of the program. Ben Broadbent also warned that achieving a \u2018soft landing\u2019 in the UK economy will be difficult. He explained that the UK\u2019s terms-of-trade shock is far more severe than in the US, where the Federal Reserve is also struggling to get inflation down without pushing America into recession. Ben Broadbent\u2019s speech, on the inflationary consequences of real shocks, is online here. It\u2019s about 20 pages long \u2013 but the conclusion is that the markets may have overestimated how high interest rates will rise, points out economics writer Duncan Weldon: Lifting rates over 5% by next summer would certainly be hawkish, given the UK could be in recession by then. Broadbent also points out that we\u2019ve barely seen much of the impact of tighter policy that is being priced in, and which will have a big hit to demand: The financial markets are dialling back their forecasts for November\u2019s interest rate rise. They now indicate there\u2019s an 85% chance that the Bank raises rates to 3% on 3rd November, from 2.25% today, which would be a three quarter-point rise. A full percentage point rise, to 3.25%, is only a 15% chance. Before Ben Broadbent\u2019s speech, it was a 25% probability, according to Reuters. Interest rate expectations surged after the mini-budget rocked markets, but have been falling back after the government began ditching the plan. At one stage after the mini-budget, the markets thought the Bank would choose between a 1% increase, and a monster 1.25% hike. But even a three-quarter point increase would be the largest rise in UK Bank Rate in 33 years, putting more pressure on borrowers, and meaning remortgaging will be expensive. Just in. Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent has said it \u2018remains to be seen\u2019 whether UK interest rates have to rise as much as the markets predict. That could bring some relief to mortgage-holders, who are concerned that interest rates are currently forecast to more than double to over 5% by next summer. Speaking at Imperial College London, Broadbent explains that the economy has been hit by severe real shocks. The pandemic raised the global demand for goods and reduced their supply; Russia has cut back severely its supply of gas to Europe. These have had dramatic effects on relative prices. In particular, import prices have risen significantly compared with the price of UK output. This has unavoidably depressed real incomes: the volume of output may have just about recovered to pre-Covid levels but its consumption value has not. Broadbent also warned that the economy would suffer a hit if market bets about rising rates come to pass. Broadbend explains that the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee will respond promptly to news about fiscal policy (the MPC is due to set interest rates on November 3rd, three days after Jeremy Hunt is due to announce his fiscal plan). Broadbent says the justification for tightening monetary policy is clear (inflation is five times over the Bank\u2019s 2% target, for starters). But much of the overshoot in inflation is due to higher import prices (such as gas, and food which has risen by over 14% in the last year). That effect should fade as prices stabilise. Broadbent explains that the path of wholesale energy prices is highly uncertain, but financial markets suggest we\u2019re more likely to see negative than positive inflation in wholesale gas prices a couple of years from now. Domestic inflation tends to be persistent, however. And reducing it requires the economy to grow below its trend rate for a period of time, he warns. Broadbent concludes: Because they\u2019ve depressed real incomes, that slowing in demand will to some degree follow from the very same rises in import costs that have pushed up headline inflation. Equally, if government support mitigates that effect, there is more at the margin for monetary policy to do. The MPC is likely to respond relatively promptly to news about fiscal policy. Whether official interest rates have to rise by quite as much as currently priced in financial markets remains to be seen. After three days of falls, the interest rate on UK 10-year government bonds has risen close to 4% this morning, as the bond market watched the turmoil in Westminster. This chart shows how 10-year gilt yields had already been climbing through September, but then surged after the mini-budget as investors were alarmed by unfunded tax cuts. They had been recovering this week, as the City welcomed Jeremy Hunt\u2019s decision to ditch most of the mini-budget. But uncertainty over Liz Truss\u2019s future is now hitting bond prices, with a member of the 1922 Committee has told ITV News\u2019 Paul Brand that the \u201codds are against\u201d her surviving the day as prime minister. Our Politics Liveblog has all the details: Incidentally, the Financial Times\u2019s Alphaville site has written a detailed piece on the rise in borrowing costs caused by the UK\u2019s financial turmoil, here: Quantifying Britain\u2019s moron risk premium What is the cost of the chaos and incompetence in Westminster on the UK\u2019s financial position? Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, has calculated that Britain is currently paying significantly more to borrow for a decade than it would do under a competent government. He explains that the UK ten-year bonds would be trading at a yield of 3.25% (given how British debt had been trading compared to other G7 nations until late summer), not around 4% today. That 75 basis-point diffence means billions of pounds extra being paid out in interest, rather than investing in services. This extra cost has been dubbed the \u201cmoron risk premium\u201d by economist Dario Perkins of TS Lombard. Here\u2019s Simon\u2019s thinking: Inflationary pressures are rising in Germany too, where the prices charged by producers are rising at a record pace Producer prices soared by a staggering 45.8% year-on-year in September, matching August\u2019s reading, which was the highest since 1949. Energy prices were the primary factor \u2013 132.2% higher than in the same month last year. But rising energy costs drove up other prices too, with intermediate goods (+16.8%), capital goods (+7.8%) and durable and non-durable consumer goods (10.9% and 18.3%) also rising significantly. In September alone, prices rose 2.3%, which was also above consensus for 1.3%. City fund managers are also having a tough year, as investors are spooked by recession fears and soaring inflation. Jupiter Fund Management told shareholders this morning that: A worsening macroencomic backdrop, continued geopolitical challenges and inflationary concerns, particularly in the UK, again weighed upon investor sentiment in the third quarter Net outflows from Jupiter slowed in the third quarter to \u00a3600m, meaning clients pulled out cash at a slower rate \u2013 although it did see net inflows of \u00a3500m from institutional investors. Matthew Beesley, CEO, says: \u201cI am encouraged by the improved flow picture in Q3, despite continued market volatility. Schroders has reported a 2.7% drop in assets under management during the quarter to \u00a3752bn, down from \u00a3773.4bn three months ago, due to a drop in its asset management arm. UK government bond prices have fallen at the start of trading, as investors watch the chaotic scenes in Westminster, with Liz Truss\u2019s government on the brink. This has pushed up the yield, or interest rates, on both short and long-dated gilts, although they\u2019re still well below the peaks seen after the mini-budget. Bill Blain, strategist at Shard Capital, says the markets are watching events \u201cin a kind of stunned, open-mouthed horror\u201d. He told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that the last couple of weeks have destroyed the image of political competency \u2013 which is a key element to make any economy work. He explains that countries need a stable currency, a sustainable bond market, and you need competent politics. Because it looks like competent politics are broken, that\u2019s creating the volatility that we\u2019re seeing in markets. And I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s going to continue\u2026. Whatever it is that Liz Truss tries to do to introduce stability, it just creates more chaos. Blain concludes that markets will only rally when they see real change, and that probably means a general election, he says. Two-year gilts are yielding 3.6%, up from 3.5% last night, while 30-year bond yields have risen to 4.06%, from below 4%. Yields rise when bond prices fall, and rising yields show that investors want a larger return for holding the debt. The oil prices has risen to its highest level in almost a week, which could add to inflationary pressures this winter. Oil was lifted by news that China is considering easing its Covid-19 restrictions, such as cutting the amount of time people coming into the country must spend in mandatory quarantine. Brent crude has gained almost 1% to $93.25 per barrel. It had dropped below $85 per barrel last month, prompting Opec+ to agree to cut output. Car drivers are also being squeezed, with insurance premiums up 14% year-on-year, the biggest annual increase in the past 5 years. Figures from comparison site Confused.com show that insurance premiums have risen for the last four quarters, meaning drivers are now paying \u00a3586 on average. In the past 3 months alone, premiums have increased for motorists by \u00a332 (6%), on average, the\u2019ve calculated. The UK\u2019s biggest food bank network is preparing to spend millions of pounds topping up charity food parcels this winter, my colleague Patrick Butler reports. The Trussell Trust will be offering help to record numbers of families at risk of going hungry as a result of the cost of living crisis. The expenditure was needed to ensure food banks had adequate food reserves because the Trussell Trust\u2019s customary main source of food supplies \u2013 donations from the public \u2013 was failing to keep pace with rapidly increasing demand. The trust said it expected 1.3m emergency food parcels would be distributed by its members over the next six months to help soaring numbers of households in need \u2013 including 500,000 to families with children. Here\u2019s the full story: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. The cost of living crisis is hitting UK firms, and forcing millions of people to skip meals as soaring inflation leaves them unable to buy essentials. A survey by Which? just released found that almost half of all consumers are finding it harder to eat healthily compared to before the crisis, rising to 78% of those finding it very difficult to cope financially in the worst squeeze in decades. Around 9% people are now finding it \u201cvery difficult to get by\u201d \u2013 and half of those people say their household was skipping meals. A quarter of those who are finding the current situation \u201cquite difficult\u201d are also skipping meals. Which? is calling on supermarkets to help their customers with clearer pricing, promotions targeted at supporting shoppers on low incomes and by ensuring budget lines are widely available, particularly in locations where people need them most. Which?\u2019s findings chime with data from the Food Foundation charity this week, which found that more people went hungry than during the chaotic first weeks of the Covid lockdown. Hunger levels have more than doubled since January, according to the foundation\u2019s latest tracker, with nearly 10 million adults and 4 million children unable to eat regular meals last month. Retailers are also feeling the chill. Homeware chain Dunelm, which has enjoyed years of strong growth, has reported an 8% drop in sales in the last quarter. Dunelm made sales of \u00a3357m for the 13 weeks to 1 October, while gross margins fell compared to last year, although it is seeing a \u201cvery good response\u201d from customers to its seasonal \u201cwinter warm\u201d products including rugs, curtains and blankets. Dunelm warns that the macroeconomic environment \u201cremains challenging\u201d, pointing to the \u201cparticularly volatile\u201d exchange rate movements in recent weeks. The pound\u2019s wild swings will have made it hard for many businesses to judge the price of imports. Nick Wilkinson, Dunelm\u2019s chief executive officer, warned that the landscape is demanding as shoppers face a tough winter: \u201cAs we enter what will clearly be a challenging winter for consumers, our absolute focus remains on making every pound count for everyone, through a tight grip on operations. Across the economy, there are signs of a slowdown as consumers cut back. Tourism and recreation, which includes pubs, hotels, restaurants and leisure facilities, saw the sharpest fall in output of any UK sector in September, according to the latest Lloyds Bank UK Sector Tracker. Demand fell for the fourth month running as consumers reined-in discretionary spending amid rising inflation \u2013 which hit 10.1% in September, the highest in 40 years. Also coming up today European leaders will discuss the Commission\u2019s latest proposals for easing the energy crisis, when they meet for a summit today. They\u2019re expected to back proposed emergency regulations to allow joint gas buying across the EU to negotiate better prices, and provisions to permit greater cooperation between countries in a gas supply emergency. But they remain split over whether and how to cap gas prices to stem high inflation and stave off recession. The Commission is proposing a new, more stable gas price benchmark, and a new mechanism to curb volatile prices if they spike excessively. The pound is hovering around $1.122 in early trading, as investors digest the deepening turmoil in Westminster after a chaotic Wednesday which saw the resignation of home secretary Suella Braverman, and total disarray in the Commons over a vote on fracking.

            "date": "2022-10-25T15:41:27Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak is undoubtedly a popular local MP, with a whopping, unassailable majority in Richmond, one of the UK\u2019s safest seats. But while many in the stunning Yorkshire Dales town of Hawes felt pride in his becoming prime minister, the joy was not felt by all. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have been my choice,\u201d said Julie Gordge, who owns a craft supply shop on the town\u2019s main street. \u201cFirstly, he\u2019s our local MP but I\u2019ve never, ever seen him in Hawes. He might have been here, but I\u2019ve never seen him. \u201cSecondly, I lost a lot of respect for him when the reporters found out about his billionaire wife avoiding paying her taxes here. It just showed all MPs are the same, they are all out for themselves \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter which party they are.\u201d Further along the road is Walters Quality Country and Leisure Wear, which sells everything from dog leads to waxed jackets and wellies. Its owner, Gordon Walters, had not seen much of Sunak in Hawes either, but felt that was beside the point. \u201cWhat we need now is stability, that is all we are asking,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last few weeks have been chaos \u2013 it\u2019s made us look like a banana republic. \u201cI don\u2019t know who these Tory party members are who voted for Liz Truss, or where they are. Why weren\u2019t they voting for Rishi in the first place? What was their thinking? I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d Stan Johnson, 67, lives in Hawes and has worked for 40 years at the dairy that makes wensleydale cheese, the town\u2019s main claim to fame. Today, he is collecting for the Royal British Legion by selling poppies. \u201cHe should have got in first, before Liz Truss. He\u2019s done a good job round here up to now, and he deserves his chance as prime minister. \u201cYou don\u2019t see a lot of him, but he\u2019s got other things to do. Good luck to him. I don\u2019t think we should have a general election, you need to give him time to sort things out.\u201d Johnson said Boris had been brought down by lying to the public about parties. \u201cIf he [Sunak] is truthful about everything and he comes clean on things, then he will be all right. Bolton Castle, where Mary, Queen of Scots was, is only down the road, so there\u2019s always a place for him there if he tells any lies.\u201d Annette and Jonathan Langhorn, who run a farm in the Dales village of Carperby, were in Hawes to have Covid jabs. \u201cThe biggest emotion for us was relief,\u201d said Annette. \u201cThe last few weeks have been appalling. I think Rishi is the best of a bad job.\u201d Neither were particularly effusive about Sunak, who was parachuted into the constituency eight years ago. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem as visible as the last MP, William Hague,\u201d said Jonathan. \u201cEven though Hague was foreign secretary he would be at school events, everything, as well as doing his national stuff. I don\u2019t think you see Sunak as much. \u201cBut he\u2019s OK, he\u2019s grown on us. We could have worse. We could have Liz Truss.\u201d Every local person the Guardian spoke to knew where Sunak\u2019s constituency house is \u2013 an opulent manor house in the village of Kirby Sigston, with recently added swimming pool, hot tub, tennis court and gym complex. But not many seemed to mind the wealth and trappings. \u201cGood luck to him,\u201d said Jonathan Langhorn. \u201cI wish I had his money. And he wasn\u2019t born straight into money, was he? I imagine most MPs aren\u2019t on the breadline. Nigel Cooke, a retired shipmaster, was spending the day in Hawes with his wife, Norma. They are constituents and Sunak supporters. \u201cMost people round here would say he is an excellent MP,\u201d said Nigel. \u201cHe does get around, he does care. I\u2019ve sent him a couple of emails on various things and he has responded.\u201d Norma agreed. \u201cI think there is a sense of pride that he has become prime minister, although you\u2019ll always get the detractors. He has always pushed stuff for us in the area.\u201d Nick and Fiona Vyse, from Giggleswick, are not constituents but do have an opinion. \u201cHe should have been made leader first time round,\u201d said Fiona. \u201cIt was all an unfortunate mistake having Liz Truss.\u201d Her husband agreed. \u201cI am delighted \u2013 I think we have a period of stability coming, and boy do we need it. I think he will do a good, steady job and the big challenge is whether or not he can turn things around before the next general election. \u201cThe last few weeks have been a fiasco. I feel slightly embarrassed. Our son has just married a girl whose father is a French politician, and the whole of British politics recently has just been embarrassing. We\u2019re very much hoping that will change.\u201d Janice Dowden, 74, moved from the home counties to Leyburn five years ago and is delighted. \u201cI think he will make a very good prime minister, I really do. Finance is his thing. \u201cI was disappointed that they ousted Boris, but that\u2019s water under the bridge. I think Rishi will make an excellent prime minister and we\u2019re rooting for him.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-10-29T05:00:48Z",
            "content": "When I worked at River Cottage, we\u2019d instinctively make remouillage, or a second stock, from bones that had already been boiled for stock. The rich stock ingredients had heaps of flavour left in them even after being cooked and strained, so we\u2019d refill the pot with water and make a second, weaker stock to use in soups, for boiling greens or to make boulang\u00e8re potatoes. We\u2019d also make fresh bone stock in remouillage rather than water, creating a very potent jus. Remouillage, or second stock Remouillage is a French cooking term that translates to \u201crewetting\u201d. Used stock bones are returned to the pot, often in the company of fresh vegetables, then covered with water and simmered until tasty, so making a second, extra-thrifty stock. To create the best flavour and extract the most nutrition, including the collagen and micronutrients from bones, a stock should be simmered for as long as possible: ideally, chicken should be cooked for at least four hours and beef for eight. The most energy-efficient way to do this is in a slow cooker; you can also make stock in a pressure cooker, and in doing so cut the cooking time by two-thirds. However, the intense boil created in a pressure cooker will create a cloudy and potentially more bitter stock than a slowly simmered one, though in my experience it\u2019s still fine to use. Remouillage is, of course, weaker than stock made from scratch, but it\u2019s still surprisingly full of flavour. It can be combined with a first stock, or reduced to your desired flavour and viscosity. Used stock bones (eg, chicken carcass, beef marrow bones, lamb bones) Stock vegetables, all roughly chopped (eg, carrot, celery, celeriac, leek, onion, parsley, lovage, garlic, mushrooms, bay leaves, etc), to taste Put the stock bones in a suitably sized pot (or slow cooker or pressure cooker) and add an equal quantity of fresh stock vegetables or saved peelings and scraps. Crush everything down with a rolling pin, then add enough water just to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a trembling simmer and cook for as long as possible, and for at least two hours. Take out a spoonful,add a pinch of salt to bring out the flavour, and taste. If using a pressure cooker, cook for at least an hour following the instructions. The best option \u2013 to make the best remouillage and to save energy \u2013 is to make it in a slow cooker and cook for at least eight hours. Strain the stock and, if there is still more flavour and minerals in the bones, consider using them to make a second remouillage. If, however, the strained stock is already on the weak side, simmer for longer or reduce to your liking."

            "content": "Yanis Varoufakis offers an unsparing analysis of the delusional aspirations of the Tory political elites who control our destinies (Trickle-down Truss is carrying on the dirty work of Thatcher, Blair and Osborne, 1 October). The \u201cdoom loop\u201d analysis says it all. Thatcherite ideological baggage is being dusted down by Liz Truss and co and presented as a solution to deep-seated problems of the governance and accountability of British state and enterprise. He might also have mentioned the dysfunctional first-past-the-post electoral system that sustains it all. Reliance on \u201ctrickle-down\u201d economics will only deliver further tragic setbacks. There will be benefits for the wealthier classes, but a further collapse of state-funded institutions and loss of real incomes will leave the rest of society poorer. It guarantees the continuing systemic failure of the British economy. The ideologies of the Tory party are bankrupt and ruinous for the vast majority of our citizens. Time to learn from our failures and move on. Richard Tudway Principal, Centre for International Economics \u2022 Your editorial (30 September) describes the Tory \u201cbelief in the benefits of the free market\u201d as \u201cfaith-based politics\u201d. This is an alarming feature of our late-capitalist economy, whose nature is crisis-ridden. We are held hostage to what the veteran social scientist David Harvey calls \u201cthe madness of economic reason\u201d, whereby it is essential for all owners of capital to exploit people and planet in pursuit of unlimited accumulation and profit into \u201cbad infinity\u201d. It is the common interest of the capitalist class to maintain flows of capital. At moments of deep crisis, in what Yanis Varoufakis terms \u201cthe vicious financial cycle\u201d of \u201cthe doom loop\u201d, governments resort to \u201cstate-maintained wealth appropriation\u201d to save the profit-driven system. But this is unsustainable when the ruling class is running insanely rampant. This is an enigma of capital that Labour, once in power, presumably will confront. Unfortunately, reformism/redistribution, although necessary, will simply reproduce capitalist relations of production if our norms of production and distribution remain operative. This is preferable to a Tory hardening of the state in a protofascist manner, but an alternative government has to be transformational in vision and practice. It is imperative to realise a visionary political project \u201cdraw[ing] its poetry from the future\u201d, as Karl Marx said, and not only the past. Malcolm Stanton Broome, Shropshire \u2022 I wonder if it has ever occurred to the Tory party that significantly raising the minimum wage, benefits and pensions would put more money in people\u2019s pockets than reducing taxes. More disposable income for those with little would result in more money being spent. This in turn would increase demand and thus promote growth. It would also help reduce the number of people dependent on food banks and increase government revenue via taxation. David Plumpton Warrington, Cheshire \u2022 I didn\u2019t get a place at Oxford to study PPE. I didn\u2019t get into grammar school. I finally made it into higher education at Manchester Polytechnic when I was 30. But even I could see that the mini-budget was illogical and more damaging to the poor than any other political policy of my lifetime. To quote my then primary-age son, some people are very clever but not very intelligent.

The Pre-owned service, which launches on 3 November and will be Zara\u2019s first step into resale or repair, will enable shoppers to book repairs and donate unwanted items online or via a store, and post now-unwanted Zara purchases online for sale. Sellers will take pictures of goods with detailed product information provided by Zara. The company will run the sales platform via its website and app, with payment handled by the Stripe system. Buyers\u2019 details will be passed on when a sale has been agreed so the goods can be sent by the seller. Zara started installing clothing donation bins in Europe in 2016. Under a new partnership with the Red Cross, shoppers can request collection from their home. It is understood that the Pre-owned service is not expected to be profitable initially. Paula Ampuero, the head of sustainability at Zara, said: \u201cAt this stage, this platform is exclusively conceived as a tool to help customers extend the lifetime of their clothing and take a more circular approach.\u201d Zara joins a number of retailers dabbling with rental, resale and repair as the industry faces criticism over its high carbon footprint and shoppers demand more environmentally sustainable or \u201ccircular\u201d options that enable reuse or recycling of resources. Marks &amp; Spencer has teamed up with Dotte to enable resale of children\u2019s clothing, Joules is working with Reskinned on resale, and John Lewis\u2019s FashionCycle service offers shoppers a discount voucher in return for bringing back five items. The resale and refurbishment market is forecast to outgrow fast fashion in the coming years, with brands from Mulberry and Harvey Nichols to Asos, Asda, Dr Martens and H&amp;M taking part. The Selfridges department store group aims for almost half its interactions with customers to be based on resale, repair, rental or refills by 2030.

            "date": "2022-10-28T18:21:17Z",
            "content": "Voters are angry. America\u2019s 8.2% inflation rate sucks and has taken a big bite out of their paycheck. And $4-a-gallon gas hurts, too. Many Americans are angry and blame Joe Biden for today\u2019s high inflation. Indeed, polls show that many people plan to vote for Republicans in November because they\u2019re upset with Biden over the economy. (Unfortunately, many Americans forget that there\u2019s been more job growth \u2013 10 million jobs \u2013 during Biden\u2019s first 20 months in office than during any previous president\u2019s first 20 months.) For any American who is thinking of voting Republican out of anger about inflation, here\u2019s some advice: look before you leap. Republicans won\u2019t do anything more than Biden has done to slow inflation. Indeed, they\u2019ll probably do less. Despite the flood of GOP ads attacking Biden over inflation, Republicans haven\u2019t put forward any proposals about how they would slow inflation. They talk of their plan to make Trump\u2019s tax cuts permanent for the rich and big corporations, but that won\u2019t do anything to reduce inflation. (By the way, inflation has been higher in many other countries \u2013 in Britain, it\u2019s 8.8%, and in Germany, it\u2019s 10.0% \u2013 so it\u2019s ridiculous to suggest inflation is all Joe Biden\u2019s fault.) There\u2019s another reason voters should look before they leap. Republican lawmakers actually support several policies that will increase inflation. Republicans have vowed to repeal the Biden-backed law that lets Medicare negotiate lower prescription drug prices, a law that will reduce inflation for nearly 63 million Americans on Medicare. Congressional Republicans were so eager to help big pharma instead of inflation-battered Americans that they blocked Biden from setting a $35-a-month price cap on insulin. That means higher prices \u2013 and inflation \u2013 for Americans with diabetes. Republicans are also intent on repealing Obamacare, which would push up healthcare prices for many Americans. Republicans have vowed to take numerous other steps that would make it harder for tens of millions of Americans to cope with inflation. Republicans are threatening to create a debt ceiling crisis to shut down the government unless Biden surrenders to GOP demands to cut social security and Medicare. Many Republicans say social security and Medicare are far too generous, and their plans to cut those programs will further squeeze millions of older Americans who are already badly squeezed by inflation. Republicans are also pushing an idea that will make it harder for millions of young Americans to deal with inflation. Through lawsuits and other means, GOP lawmakers to pushing to overturn Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness plan, which will forgive $10,000 or $20,000 in student debt for 40 million Americans. Not only that, Republicans have hurt many parents\u2019 ability to cope with inflation by blocking Biden\u2019s plan to expand childcare subsidies for families with young children. Biden has also taken on the oil industry giants, calling on them to roll back gasoline prices as they make obscenely high profits, even as inflation pummels consumers. It\u2019s hard to imagine that Republicans, with their big donations from big oil, would criticize their fossil fuel friends about their exorbitant profits. Many angry voters will argue that we should of course blame Biden for today\u2019s inflation because, as Harry Truman said, \u201cthe buck stops here,\u201d meaning the Oval Office. But let\u2019s be honest, Biden is hardly to blame for inflation. Despite what Republicans say, if any president should be blamed for high inflation, it\u2019s President Putin. Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine, a major agricultural exporter, has pushed up prices for wheat and many other foods worldwide. Putin\u2019s war has also caused oil and gas prices to soar. The pandemic has caused huge supply chain disruptions that are a second big factor behind inflation. China has locked down thousands of factories, causing shortages of furniture, appliances and many other products, and that has pushed up prices. China\u2019s lockdowns have caused a severe shortage of computer chips that American automakers rely on \u2013 that has reduced car production and jacked up auto prices. These supply chain problems aren\u2019t Biden\u2019s fault. There\u2019s a third major, often unappreciated factor fueling inflation: many US corporations have exploited the inflationary environment by aggressively increasing their prices and profit margins. Exxon\u2019s second-quarter profits soared to $17.9bn, more than triple what it earned in last year\u2019s second quarter, while Chevron\u2019s earnings also more than tripled, to $11.6bn. The Economic Policy Institute, a progressive thinktank, found that roughly 40% of the recent inflation in the US can be attributed to fatter corporate profit margins. Maybe Republican TV ads should be attacking corporate greed rather than Joe Biden. I\u2019m not saying Biden is blameless. Like Donald Trump, he sponsored a badly needed program of checks to US households to help Americans get through the pandemic. Those checks increased consumer demand and pushed up prices somewhat, but not nearly as much as Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine, supply chain disruptions or corporations fattening their profit margins. Americans who plan to vote Republican because they\u2019re angry about inflation are deluding themselves if they think Republicans will do anything to reduce inflation. For the past four decades, the Republican party\u2019s economic policy has focused on one thing and one thing alone: cutting taxes on corporations and the wealthy. If you care about cutting taxes on the rich, then vote Republican, but if you seriously care about fighting inflation, Republicans will do zilch about that \u2013 other than saying you should blame Biden and the Democrats. People who vote Republican out of anger about inflation could end up hurting themselves economically. With Republicans in power, there will be cuts in social security and Medicare, higher drug prices, higher healthcare prices, no student loan forgiveness, and less government aid for childcare. Moreover, Republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage and want to weaken labor unions. With the Federal Reserve aggressively raising interest rates, inflation will no doubt be tamed in a year or two, regardless of whether Republicans or Democrats are in power. But with many Republican candidates indicating that they won\u2019t honor election results \u2013 and majority rule \u2013 if Democrats win, our democracy could be fatally weakened if Republicans prevail in November. High inflation will be gone in a year or two, but if we lose our democracy, we won\u2019t get it back anytime soon.

            "date": "2022-10-25T06:45:28Z",
            "content": "Friday is market day at Goliati in the Thyolo district of southern Malawi, and usually the stalls are bustling. The area is known for its fruit and vegetables such as tomatoes and cabbages and people make the one-hour journey to the town from Blantyre, the country\u2019s commercial capital, to buy in bulk from Goliati farmers in order to resell in their shops and roadside stalls. However, things have been hard for everyone over the past few months. Grace Manda, 35, would normally be rushed off her feet, but on this Friday she sits chatting with a friend as would-be customers walk on by. Manda, a single mother with two children at secondary school, owns half an acre of land and was able to build a small two-bedroom house from her tomato sales. She was getting by until earlier this year. \u201cThings are not all right now; everything has gone up,\u201d she says. \u201cThe prices of fertilisers and herbicides have gone up, and when we come here to sell, very few vendors are coming to buy.\u201d With less fertiliser, her yield from the poor soil she has tilled year after year has significantly reduced in 2022, almost by a quarter. Severe deforestation in the country has over the years degraded the land. Like Manda, most smallholder farmers can only cultivate the same piece of land and so fertiliser had become necessary to replace lost nutrients. But now that is not so easy. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has affected the availability and affordability of fertiliser, of which both countries are major producers. Prewar, 50kg of fertiliser was 22,042 Malawian kwacha (about \u00a319). In April it rose to 49,000 kwacha; this month, the price reached 65,000 kwacha. For those who can, it\u2019s back to almost-forgotten traditional methods. Manda has started looking for manure, even investing in a few chickens and goats to produce it. Some farmers are using neem leaves and the tuberous shrub locally known as mphanjovu (Neorautanenia mitis), as natural pesticides. Meanwhile, Goodfellow Phiri\u2019s Lilongwe business is thriving. He is receiving more orders for his \u201cbionitrate fertiliser\u201d \u2013 which he makes by collecting urine from local people \u2013 than ever. Phiri says not only is his product more affordable but it is more beneficial than chemical fertilisers. \u201cBionitrate is good for vegetative and fruiting crops such as maize, rice, wheat, vegetables, lawns, flowers, and sorghum or millet, and when applied, it is also substrate for maggot farming,\u201d he says. \u201cThis year the demand for this fertiliser has grown by 75%.\u201d On the wider scale, however, Malawi is reeling. The economy is predominantly agriculture-based, with farming accounting for 30% of GDP and generating more than 80% of export earnings. Malawi devalued the kwacha by 25% in May to stabilise dwindling foreign currency reserves and return to a market-determined exchange rate regime. However, inflation soon soared; cooking oil doubled in cost, and petrol and diesel prices have been increased at least twice this year. In Blantyre, Zione Chapweteka, a 25-year-old tomato vendor, says soaring prices from the farmers mean she is making a loss for the first time in years. \u201cWe buy at higher prices from farmers and when we come here we\u2019re making losses,\u201d she says. \u201cAt first, a dish of tomato was at 13,000 kwacha; now we buy it at 28,000. People don\u2019t have money, so it is a difficult situation for everyone.\u201d Frighton Njolomole, the president of the Farmers\u2019 Union of Malawi, says the prices make the cost-of-living issues during Covid seem \u201cmild\u201d. With planting season approaching, he fears things will worsen. \u201cThe farmers with large-scale farms to the medium scale, they always do mechanisation, like hiring tractors to work, so those are equally affected because fuel has gone just too high,\u201d he says. \u201cEven when a farmer foots all these costs, the prices are not going to be the same, and if they raise the price unnecessarily, who is going to buy? I don\u2019t think most of our farmers will survive. If things do not change, survival is going to be a big thing.\u201d He is in favour of a return to traditional practices to plug the gap. \u201cWe need to experiment with indigenous methods as well,\u201d Njolomole says. \u201cIf they work and help the farmers to maximise their outputs while reducing the cost of production, let farmers use them, as long as they work.\u201d But nature\u2019s ingredients are not available to help everyone in a country where many survive through entrepreneurship. Margaret Mhango, 43, is a soap-maker in the capital, Lilongwe. Since she first started manufacturing in 2020, the price of her ingredients, palm oil and caustic soda, have tripled and quadrupled. The price of her soap has to go up. \u201cDemand has grown, but I can\u2019t sustain it at the current cost of production,\u201d she says. \u201cMost people are now asking to acquire the product on loan, which is risky. I am worried about the village shop owners who used to buy from me and resell in their villages.\u201d However, the jump in prices has helped more than just sales of urine \u2013 cheaper foodstuffs like potatoes and cassava have risen in popularity. William Biliati, who sells cassava in Blantyre\u2019s Limbe markethas had to raise prices, but business has been growing. \u201cAt first I could only manage to sell half a bag of potatoes per day, but now I can sell two. Most of the customers are now coming to us since they can\u2019t afford bread,\u201d he says."

            "date": "2022-10-20T08:00:48Z",
            "content": "If, after the 8 November midterms, Americans wake up to find their statehouses and congressional seats packed with Republicans who deny the outcome of the 2020 election, participated in the January 6 insurrection and hold extremist views on abortion, they may well have high inflation to thank. The rising cost of just about everything Americans buy has become a major liability for Democrats fighting to maintain their narrow control of Congress, and a pair of recent surveys has dashed hopes that the trend is fading \u2013 or that voters have found a bigger worry. Last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly consumer price data, which indicated inflation remained high in September, even if it was down from earlier this summer. On Monday, a New York Times/Siena College poll showed more voters than ever rank the state of the economy as their top concern, and Republicans have a four-point lead over Democrats when it comes to which party respondents plan to vote for. \u201cPrices just simply haven\u2019t come down, and I think for a lot of people that\u2019s a reflection of government spending and that there hasn\u2019t been enough action by the Biden administration to tackle inflation,\u201d said Jonathan McCollum, a lobbyist with Davidoff Hutcher &amp; Citron who has advised Democrats on campaign strategy. \u201cRepublicans have spent a tremendous amount of money in advertising, especially in these swing states and just really hitting on inflation over and over and over again, and I think that message has started to break through.\u201d Beyond just offering a potent line of attack for Republicans, the data undercut the cautious optimism Democrats were feeling over the summer, when some in the party believed circumstances had aligned to spare them from the losses American presidents historically suffer in their first midterms. Gas prices had dropped from the records highs reached after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine rocked global oil markets while many voters were angered by the conservative-dominated supreme court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v Wade and end nearly 50 years of abortion access nationwide. Democratic candidates were given plenty to campaign on after president Joe Biden and his allies in Congress went on a streak of lawmaking, passing the Inflation Reduction Act to lower prescription drug costs and fight climate crisis, and the Chips Act to boost domestic semiconductor production. And the president has sought to direct voters\u2019 attention towards the healthy labor market, where the unemployment rate is back where it was before Covid-19 caused tens of millions of job losses. But as fall arrived, the boost of Biden\u2019s congressional success appears to have worn off, as has the shock over the implications of the rightwing supreme court. By late September, a Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Republicans with a slight edge on the generic congressional ballot, and more trusted to handle crime, inflation and the economy, though Democrats were seen as better bets by voters concerned with climate crisis and abortion. \u201cI think we\u2019re not getting the credit we deserve in many cases. I don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s something we could have done differently,\u201d said congressman Scott Peters, the vice-chair for policy of the centrist New Democrat Coalition in the House of Representatives. Meanwhile, the relief from inflation many Democrats hoped would arrive has not come. Consumer prices rose at a year-on-year rate of 8.2% in September, down from a peak reached in the summer but still a rate comparable only to the early 1980s. Gas prices may be set for an uptick after the Opec+ block of crude producers decided to cut their output earlier this month, though Biden on Tuesday announced he\u2019d released 15m barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve in an attempt to offset that. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and a former economist in Republican president George W Bush\u2019s administration, said Democrats will simply have to get used to running in a climate of high prices. \u201cIt is baked in the cake,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no rabbit that can be pulled out of any hat that can save them between now and the midterms.\u201d The Republicans, who are fielding an array of candidates including those who promote Donald Trump\u2019s baseless conspiracies about the 2020 election, are favored to take the House, though control of the Senate is seen as a far tighter contest. But for all the parties\u2019 promises to fight inflation, Holtz-Eakin said the Federal Reserve with its ability to hike interest rates is best placed to combat price growth \u2013 and neither Congress nor the White House has any comparable ability. \u201cThe inflation fight is in the hands of the Fed, and that\u2019s the reality,\u201d he said. As for Congress, \u201cDo we really want to ask them to do anything? Because they\u2019ll probably make things worse.\u201d Melissa Morales, president of Democratic Latino voters organization Somos Votantes, has surveyed Americans across the country for the Winning Jobs Narrative Project, aimed at helping progressive politicians reframe how they talk about the economy. She sees an opening for candidates who talk about the economy in a way that puts workers at the center, and the government in a position to support them and their families. \u201cThere is still a lot of time to win this economic argument,\u201d Morales said. \u201cVoters are searching for answers and if they hear one it will, in my mind, definitely sway the vote.\u201d Peters believes Democrats can make the case that under their control, Congress approved legislation Republican majorities in the past failed to agree upon, like last year\u2019s nationwide infrastructure overhaul. \u201cDemocrats are going to have continue to remind people that it\u2019s under Democratic leadership that government has worked,\u201d he said. \u201cThe frustrating thing for a lot of folks is the Republicans don\u2019t seem to have an answer except to complain.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-10-27T05:00:21Z",
            "content": "By any concrete rubric, restaurants in New York City are the same as they\u2019ve always been. All the pieces are intact \u2013 there are new, exciting restaurants; there are old, exciting restaurants. According to New York Magazine, this fall is \u201cthe busiest opening season in years\u201d. Since the city\u2019s vaccine mandate was lifted back in February after nearly two years of no indoor dining and limited capacity, there are have been no formal rules at all. Things are normal. Better than normal. \u201cEvery single month is our strongest month ever,\u201d Resy CEO, Alexander Lee, told the Atlantic; it had been true for all of 2022, he said, and he saw no signs demand for reservations would be slowing down. It is incredible, I keep reminding myself, to talk and laugh inside a room of talking, laughing strangers, eating food I did not \u2013 probably could not \u2013 cook. So then why doesn\u2019t it feel the same? There doesn\u2019t seem to be any single thing that\u2019s wrong, so much as the overarching sense that it used to be better and more fun. Didn\u2019t it? It\u2019s largely a confluence of two factors \u2013 inflation and the ongoing labor shortage, two unsexy forces that are being felt in all kinds of industries. But in restaurants, they are so distinctly visible: prices are high, service is strapped. It is all almost normal. Fine. Good, even. It could go on like this forever! For diners, the experience feels \u2013 not bad, so much as limp. For chefs and servers, there is a sense of suspended animation. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know where we\u2019re at,\u201d says Leah Cohen, a chef with two Manhattan restaurants \u2013 Pig &amp; Khao, on the Lower East Side, and the newer Piggyback in Midtown. \u201cWe\u2019re in this weird limbo phase.\u201d In 2020, when the world shut down, restaurants became a beacon and a cause. Suddenly, everybody was talking about the service industry, about the undocumented workers who make up as much as 40% of the city\u2019s kitchens. All at once, everyone seemed to understand the precarity of the industry, but also the transcendence of it: people love restaurants. They missed restaurants. They missed restaurants so much they made restaurants for chipmunks. There was a giddy magic in the first days of reopening, when diners were tipping wildly, and the people venturing out were just elated to be back. \u201cCustomers went from being pains in the asses to being like, \u2018We love you guys! You\u2019re essential workers!\u2019\u201d laughs Cohen. \u201cThat was very short-lived.\u201d *** While Cohen\u2019s staff are dealing with the return of demanding diners, Cohen, as an owner, is feeling the impact of inflation first-hand across the board: ingredients are more expensive, labor is more expensive, equipment is more expensive, and as a result, dinner out is more expensive. Cohen reports that while once she charged \u201cmaybe $36\u201d for the half-duck, the current price is $42. Recently, the New York Times broke down the increase in costs for a restaurant in North Carolina, and their reasons: Canola oil, up 159% (the war in Ukraine); a new hot water heater, up 25% (the cost of stainless steel). Diners feel the trickle-down effect. \u201cThat\u2019s the price we have to charge, because that\u2019s how much stuff costs now,\u201d Cohen says, and even knowing that as well as anyone, she understands: it\u2019s a lot. \u201cWhen I go out to eat, and I see the bill, it\u2019s not a shock to me, but it\u2019s something I have to process,\u201d she says. Paying more would hurt less if the dining experience was uniformly stellar. I would like that to be the case \u2013 everyone would like that to be the case! \u2013 but that is not the current world. \u201cWe have not come back in a form that looks anything like what we were before Covid,\u201d one veteran server at an high-end Italian restaurant in Manhattan told me. (Like many of the restaurant workers interviewed for this story, he asked to remain anonymous to avoid potential repercussions.) \u201cAnd I think the biggest reason for that is because it\u2019s impossible to hire staff.\u201d The industry-wide labor shortage is old news: in January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics noted the restaurant industry\u2019s year-over-year quit rate was more than any other job sector, even as the hiring rate remained the same. As of September, jobs in New York City food service were still at 87% of pre-pandemic levels. Many restaurants have increased wages and reworked benefits in an attempt to attract staff, but while the improvements are long overdue, alone, they haven\u2019t been enough. \u201cI mean, we hire anyone, if you\u2019re good or bad,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have the ability not to. At some point you hire for bodies and pray and hope that some of them are good.\u201d In dining rooms across the city, the shift is palpable. \u201cWe had to start over from near-scratch,\u201d says Rashaad Jones, a former captain at Eleven Madison Park, one of the city\u2019s fanciest restaurants. \u201cWe were always hiring and always had new people coming in,\u201d he says, \u201cbut if you have 90 people that are seasoned veterans of the restaurant training one person who\u2019s brand new, that\u2019s a seamless transition, versus five seasoned veterans training 150 people.\u201d Jones left the restaurant this summer. \u201cIt was no longer good for my body or my mental health,\u201d he says. He\u2019s remained in the industry, consulting on a new restaurant, and working part-time in wine. People whose experience might have got them a back waiter job before \u2013 an entry-level position clearing and setting tables \u2013 are skipping straight to front waiter posts, the server at the high-end Italian restaurant explains; one new colleague, who\u2019d been hired as a captain \u2013 the absolute top of the front-of-house pyramid (\u201cthat\u2019s where the buck stops if there\u2019s a problem\u201d) \u2013 had only ever answered phones. The result is that everyone is scrambling to get the new generation up to speed. \u201cIt\u2019s very stressful,\u201d a longtime server at a popular Brooklyn pizza spot told me. \u201cYou\u2019re already stretched thin because you\u2019re understaffed, so people really aren\u2019t getting the support and the training that they need,\u201d she says. And at the same time, \u201cyou have a lot of the veterans burning out.\u201d Meanwhile, the kitchen line is also new, understaffed and still in training, and food is often slow, and there isn\u2019t necessarily anyone with the institutional memory to know what a dish is meant to look like. \u201cIt really does change the way the restaurant works,\u201d says Sophie, 30, a longtime server at a casual fine-dining restaurant in Lower Manhattan, who estimates that about a third of people working front of house are new since the pandemic. (To speak freely, she asked to be identified by her first name only.) \u201cIt changes the culture.\u201d It is perhaps less united that it used to be, divided by default into an old guard and a new guard, \u201cwhich is kind of the opposite of what I would want in a restaurant culture, which would be solidarity and inclusivity\u201d, she says. Jones, a classical cellist by training, likens restaurants to orchestras. \u201cThere\u2019s all these components, but there\u2019s a collective as well,\u201d he says. \u201cThat whole machine is what is able to accomplish things. No one part is more important.\u201d Or as Sophie, whose restaurant pools tips, puts it, less romantically: \u201cWe\u2019re all making each other\u2019s money. \u201cPeople who didn\u2019t work at the restaurant prior to the pandemic are more real about the job,\u201d Sophie says. \u201cThis is a restaurant job, just like my other restaurant jobs.\u2019 Whereas a lot of folks who were there before the pandemic, myself included, are like, this is different. This is the most special restaurant job you\u2019ll ever have.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s this moment. I think it\u2019s New York,\u201d says the pizza server, who has been struggling to motivate new colleagues. People are \u201cjust in survival mode right now\u201d, she says. \u201cNobody really feels excited in their current moment or place.\u201d I deeply understand; I am struggling to think of anyone I know, in any industry, who is deeply excited about their current time and place. Not having the same pre-pandemic solidarity behind the scenes \u201cmakes work less fun and more stressful\u201d, Sophie agrees. \u201cAnd that\u2019s tough, because there are so many other factors that make work less fun and more stressful.\u201d *** It is not a secret that people are on edge. \u201cEveryone is acting so weird!\u201d the Atlantic observed this past spring, citing what seemed to be a general uptick in deranged public behavior. In October, NPR talked to researchers at Florida State University College of Medicine who\u2019d found evidence that years two and three of the pandemic have left Americans with \u201csignificant declines in the traits that help us navigate social situations, trust others, think creatively and act responsibly\u201d. \u201cI feel like anxiety is at a real high,\u201d says Sophie. \u201cAnd it\u2019s resulting in people being wild, getting fucked up, getting aggressive,\u201d and while it\u2019s everywhere, \u201cit feels heightened in the restaurant space\u201d. What is a restaurant if not a distillation of the vibe? The other night, she says, a guest, apparently appalled at the service he\u2019d received, had to be held back by his friend in a manner she describes as \u201cjoking, but not really\u201d. There have always been unhappy diners, difficult people, off nights. \u201cBut that kind of extreme emotional response to bad service in a restaurant is new.\u201d \u201cThere is an existential malaise that\u2019s sort of blanketed everybody,\u201d one Brooklyn expediter told me. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know what the future holds. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s solid any more. You don\u2019t know what you can hang your hat on. So why put in the effort if there\u2019s no guarantee that it\u2019s going to be there tomorrow?\u201d He was talking about restaurant workers, but he could have been talking about diners, too. It is restaurants, but it is also everywhere: everything that felt permanent isn\u2019t, and yet the world continues to go on, and nobody is exactly sure what happens now. There are reasons to be hopeful. The longtime server at the high-end Italian restaurant, a 50-year veteran of the industry, is optimistic about the future. Even the staff turnover, he argues, has an upside. \u201cThere\u2019s just an eagerness and an energy that people who are doing something that\u2019s really new to them have. It brings a little more excitement than there might have been with more seasoned staff who\u2019ve seen it and done it all.\u201d In just the last few weeks, Jones says, for the first time since 2020, he\u2019s been able to go out and forget the last few years. \u201cI think there\u2019s been a marked change in how people are feeling in dining rooms,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s feeling better and better.\u201d But it isn\u2019t quite the same; of course, Sophie points out. It can\u2019t be. \u201cThe pandemic kind of pulled back the veil of the service industry,\u201d says Sophie. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s hard, from both ends, to pull the veil back.\u201d"

            "content": "The owner of Premier Inn and restaurant chains including Beefeater has reported a bounceback in profits to above pre-Covid levels but warned of a \u00a360m increase in costs this year fuelled by soaring inflation. Whitbread, which runs 844 Premier Inn hotels, also said it was increasing its target of number of rooms from 110,000 to 125,000 to take advantage of independent accommodation operators going bust in the UK and Ireland. The company, which operates hotels in the UK, Ireland and Germany as well as chains including Bar &amp; Block and Brewers Fayre, beat forecasters\u2019 expectations, reporting pre-tax profits of \u00a3307.4m in the six months to 1 September. This compares with a loss of \u00a319m in the same period last year, and is 40% ahead of the same period 2019, before the pandemic struck. Total revenues of \u00a31.35bn were 25% above pre-Covid levels, although its food and beverage business remains 5% below 2019. In the UK, revenues at Whitbread\u2019s Premier Inn business \u2013 which in January said it would raise room prices to help offset cost increases \u2013 hit \u00a31.3bn with profits of \u00a3317m, each up 21% on pre-pandemic levels. \u201cPremier Inn UK has enjoyed a strong summer thanks to the release of pent-up demand for travel post pandemic which has helped to boost sales of hotel rooms,\u201d said Victoria Scholar, the head of investment at Interactive Investor. \u201cWhile sales have held up going into the third quarter so far, there is likely to be a reduction in demand with a post summer lull with schools going back and the warm weather fading.\u201d Whitbread said a combination of inflation in labour, utility bills including those for energy and food and beverage costs \u2013 as well as increased investment in IT and marketing \u2013 would cause its total costs to increase by \u00a360m for the year to March. The company, which will have a new chief executive in Domino\u2019s Pizza boss Dominic Paul come next year, said that demand for rooms looking forward remains strong but the pub and restaurant sector \u201cremains challenging\u201d. It said that total UK sales from 1 September until 20 October were running 23% ahead of the same period in 2019, while accommodation sales were up 37%. Earlier this month, Whitbread increased staff hourly pay to a minimum of \u00a310 with effect from next month, and provided a one-off payment of \u00a3300 that 34,000 employees were eligible to receive. The pay award cost \u00a315m. \u201cDespite macroeconomic uncertainties, our current trading performance is strong and our business has proven its resilience in previous downturns,\u201d said Alison Brittain, the chief executive of Whitbread. \u201cWith a robust balance sheet and significant growth potential in both the UK and Germany, we remain confident in the full year outlook and our ability to deliver long-term value for all our stakeholders.\u201d"

            "content": "The UK is likely to enter a deeper recession than previously expected next year, while interest rates and inflation will be lower than forecast, according to revised analysis from Goldman Sachs. The US investment bank downgraded its outlook for Britain, in analysis released on Sunday, forecasting the UK economy would shrink by 1% next year, down from its previous estimate for a 0.4% contraction. Goldman Sachs said that the increase in corporation tax to 25% in April \u2013 after Truss U-turned on one of her key Conservative leadership campaign commitments \u2013 was one factor. Its report said: \u201cFolding in weaker growth momentum, significantly tighter financial conditions, and the higher corporation tax from next April, we downgrade our UK growth outlook further and now expect a more significant recession.\u201d Analysts said that Truss backtracking on her corporation tax plans could help to ease pressure on the Bank of England for a tougher rise in interest rates. Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Barclays said a 0.75 percentage point increase in rates to 3% was now more likely at the Bank\u2019s next meeting in November, down from previous estimates for a rise of one percentage point made immediately after the mini-budget. Goldman analysts believe UK interest rates will now peak at 4.75%, slighter lower than the 5% previously factored in. A separate business survey by the accountants Deloitte found that UK companies are expecting the rise in interest rates will make it more difficult to cope with a slump in sales and recession over the next year. Finance directors at some of Britain\u2019s largest firms said that borrowing was more costly than at any time since 2010, making investments harder to justify. The poll by Deloitte found that a majority of finance directors expected revenues to fall over the next 12 months and that plans to cut costs and control the outflow of cash had become their top two priorities. While the survey was conducted before Kwasi Kwarteng was sacked on Friday and the prime minister decided to roll back much of last month\u2019s mini-budget, it is likely companies will continue to focus on reducing costs to minimise the impact of the downturn. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said the rise in borrowing costs following steep rises in the Bank of England base rate was forcing firms to change the way they financed investment. \u201cA 12-year period of easy credit conditions is drawing to an end. Corporates are seeing a reset in the cost and availability of credit. \u201cNot since the credit crunch have chief financial officers rated debt \u2013 whether that\u2019s bank borrowing or corporate bonds \u2013 as being less attractive as a source of finance for their businesses than they do today.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-10-27T15:35:16Z",
            "content": "The European Central Bank has increased the cost of borrowing to tackle inflation, which soared across the eurozone last month to 9.9%. Matching financial market expectations, the ECB\u2019s 25-member governing council raised the deposit rate by three-quarters of a point to 1.5% \u2013 the joint fastest rise in the eurozone\u2019s history. Pledging to bring inflation back down to 2%, the ECB president, Christine Lagarde, said she was nevertheless concerned by a looming recession across the 19-member currency bloc, sending a strong signal that future rate rises would be muted. Investors have bet that the deposit rate, which governs the borrowing costs passed on by commercial banks, is expected to peak at 3% next year as the German, Italian, French and Spanish economies contract. Asked about the concerns of political leaders that rocketing interest rates would hit growth, Lagarde said she was aware of the potential harm to poorer households from a recession and was also anxious about the effect of inflation on those most vulnerable to high prices. Lagarde said inflation remained far too high and would stay high for an extended period, so further ECB rate hikes should be expected. \u201cWe are not done yet. There is more ground to cover,\u201d she said. Carsten Brzeski, the global head of macroeconomics at the Dutch banking group ING, said the turnaround in policymaking at the central bank represented a \u201cparadigm change\u201d from last year when Lagarde gave a tough defence of looser monetary policy. \u201cIn slightly more than three months, the ECB has now hiked interest rates by a total of 2 percentage points,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the sharpest and most aggressive hiking cycle ever.\u201d Lagarde said the ECB had put on hold plans to begin selling some of the \u20ac5tn (\u00a34.3bn) of government bonds it held under its quantitative easing programme, many of them issued by the eurozone\u2019s weakest countries. Maturing bonds would continue to be repurchased by the ECB, she said. Italy\u2019s new prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said this week that increases in interest rates were punishing households and businesses and were \u201cconsidered by many to be a rash choice\u201d. Her remarks followed those of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who complained about central banks \u201csmashing demand\u201d to tackle inflation, which is only 5.6% in France. The ECB\u2019s critics have asked why the central bank is raising rates during a long and damaging war in Ukraine and when the economic outlook is already showing growth in gross domestic product turning negative. Other central banks have been asked the same question, including the Bank of England, which is expected to push its base rate to 5% in 2023. The US Federal Reserve raised its rates by three-quarters of a point for the third consecutive time last month to a range of 3% to 3.25%. It is expected to raise them again at its next committee meeting in two weeks\u2019 time. Inflation in the US is near 40-year highs of 8.2%, fuelled in part by stronger growth and more pandemic support spending than in Europe. The ECB foresees inflation in the eurozone falling to 2.3% by the end of 2024."

            "title": "Whitehall fears Hunt\u2019s spending cuts could tip UK into deep recession",
            "date": "2022-10-23T08:00:32Z",
            "content": "Senior Whitehall officials are concerned that Jeremy Hunt now risks going too far in cutting public spending and should delay the Halloween statement outlining his austerity plans, the Observer has been told. Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, is understood to have been made aware of concerns that the chancellor risks going too far in cutting back spending if he decides to go ahead with a sweeping programme of reductions. Some in the Treasury are understood to be among those to believe that it would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d to present the promised medium-term fiscal plan at the end of the month. It would come just days after the appointment of the new prime minister, risking further uncertainty over the stability of the proposals. In particular, Whitehall concerns have emerged over any move to delay infrastructure investment seen as crucial to Britain\u2019s ability to secure economic growth in the years ahead. In the short term, there is nervousness that slashing increases to welfare payments would risk tipping the UK into recession. However, some of those with concerns believe Hunt has deliberately come out hard in favour of swingeing cuts in order to reassure the markets and lower Britain\u2019s borrowing costs. Lower borrowing costs will actually help shrink the size of the fiscal hole that Hunt is required to fund. \u201cSome are worried that Hunt is going beyond where the Treasury is suggesting in terms of cuts,\u201d said a source. \u201cThere\u2019s a danger that this pushes the economy into either a deeper recession or stops the chances of building long-term growth through capital investment in projects and infrastructure. The view of many is that we don\u2019t need to do the statement on 31 October and that Jeremy is basically going a little bit far.\u201d More tax increases and spending cuts are being considered by Hunt and his Treasury team as they draw up their plans. Some sources believe that even with additional measures, there is still a fiscal hole to fill of more than \u00a330bn. Measures being examined include holding down overseas aid to 0.5% of GDP for longer than anticipated, freezing income tax thresholds and performing another major U-turn by sanctioning a wider windfall tax on energy companies. A promised increase in defence spending is also having to be re-examined. It comes after Hunt junked Liz Truss\u2019s entire leadership pitch in an extraordinary televised address on Monday. In it, he slashed the energy price freeze which the prime minister had repeatedly championed, even as her premiership was crumbling. Hunt used the address to state that the 20p basic tax rate would remain indefinitely, sweeping away the proposed 1p cut and opting not simply to delay it. Changes to dividend taxes, a VAT-free shopping scheme and a freeze on some alcohol duties were dropped. The statement effectively installed Hunt as the government\u2019s most powerful figure, as MPs plotted to oust Truss. There is now a debate taking place within the Conservative party over whether his position as chancellor is guaranteed, whoever finally wins the leadership. The leadership contender Penny Mordaunt has let it be known that she would keep Hunt in place as a reassuring figure for the markets. However, senior Tory sources said last night that he was not irreplaceable should Johnson or Sunak win the leadership. \u201cThe entire new social contract with the public, especially in the north-east and north-west [of England], is based on more investment in roads, hospitals and universities and everything else,\u201d said one party source. \u201cThat is literally the kind of Johnsonian agenda that Rishi as chancellor pushed for. People are assuming too much that we have to keep Hunt as chancellor. It\u2019s obviously completely open to Rishi to move Hunt, not least because the markets will be reassured by Rishi as leader. If it\u2019s Boris, he could make Rishi chancellor and nobody would blink.\u201d A Treasury source warned that, according to current declared plans, the fiscal hole remained around \u00a340bn and pointed out there was already a windfall tax on fossil fuel producers, though did not rule out its expansion. \u201cThe chancellor understands that whoever wins, savings will need to be made,\u201d they said. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to holding [the medium-term fiscal plan] on 31 October.\u201d They said that the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee meets to discuss interest rates on 3 November, making the 31 October date for the chancellor\u2019s statement important."

            "title": "IMF tells central banks to focus on inflation as recession looms",
            "date": "2022-10-11T13:00:05Z",
            "content": "The International Monetary Fund has told central banks to \u201cstay the course\u201d in their fight against inflation, despite warning that a third of the global economy will be in recession next year. In its half-yearly update, the Washington-based IMF said the \u201cworst was yet to come\u201d. It cited a combination of cost of living pressures, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and a slowdown in China as important factors behind a fresh growth downgrade. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, said storm clouds were gathering but insisted central banks needed to maintain their \u201claser focus\u201d on defeating inflation or risk the need for even tougher action later if upward price pressures became embedded. Gourinchas said the IMF, like central banks, had underestimated the strength of inflationary pressures when they first emerged in 2021, but said there had since been a \u201crapid and synchronised tightening of monetary conditions, alongside a powerful appreciation of the US dollar against most other currencies\u201d. The US, the EU and the UK have reported inflation reaching levels not experienced since the early 1980s and Gourinchas said price pressures were proving \u201cquite stubborn\u201d. He added: \u201cThe risk of monetary, fiscal or financial policy mis-calibration has risen sharply at a time when the world economy remains historically fragile and financial markets are showing signs of stress.\u201d The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, has raised interest rates by 0.75 points at its last three meetings, while the Bank of England has raised borrowing costs from 0.1% to 2.25% since last December. Gourinchas said the danger of doing too little outweighed the cost of doing too much, but said central banks still needed to be careful. \u201cOver-tightening risks pushing the global economy into an unnecessarily harsh recession,\u201d he said. The IMF\u2019s half-yearly world economic outlook (WEO) estimated that global growth will slow from 6% in 2021 to 3.2% this year and 2.7% in 2023. The prediction for 2022 is 0.4 percentage points lower than six months ago but unchanged on an updated forecast made in July. For 2023, growth has been downgraded by 0.9 points since April and by 0.2 points since July. The outlook for 2023 is weaker for 143 countries \u2013 representing 92% of global output \u2013 than it was six months ago. More than a third of the global economy will contract in 2023, while the three largest economies \u2013 the US, the EU and China \u2013 will continue to stall,\u201d Gourinchas said in the WEO\u2019s foreword. \u201cIn short, the worst is yet to come, and for many people 2023 will feel like a recession.\u201d Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was continuing to destabilise the global economy, Gourinchas added. \u201cBeyond the escalating and senseless destruction of lives and livelihoods, it has led to a severe energy crisis in Europe that is sharply increasing costs of living and hampering economic activity,\u201d he said. Germany and Italy \u2013 both heavily reliant on Russian energy \u2013 are expected to experience shrinking in their economies next year, by 0.3 and 0.2 points respectively, while France is expected to post growth of 0.7%. Of the other G7 countries, Japan is expected to post the strongest growth (1.6%) followed by Canada (1.5%) and the US (1%). The UK is forecast to grow by 0.3%. China, affected by tough Covid lockdown restrictions and a weakening property market, is forecast to more than halve its growth rate from 8.1% in 2021 to 3.2% this year before picking up to 4.4% in 2023."

            "title": "Fitch predicts deeper UK recession; mortgage rates climb \u2013 as it happened ",
            "date": "2022-10-10T14:25:06Z",
            "content": "That\u2019s all for today, here\u2019s the main stories so far: A British court has granted permission for US-based hedge fund Elliot Associates and Jane Street Global Trading to sue the London Metal Exchange (LME) for cancelling nickel trades in March, Reuters reports, citing a court document. Elliott Associates and Jane Street are invoking the Human Rights Act and are seeking to sue the LME for a combined $472 million. Back on 8 March, the LME cancelled all the nickel trades that took place that day as the price doubled to a record $100,000 per tonne, in frenzied trading. The surge was due to a \u201cshort squeeze\u201d which reportedly left a Chinese nickel tycoon facing heavy losses which could have run into billions of dollars. Tsingshan Holding Group, controlled by Chinese tycoon Xiang Guangda, had taken a short position on nickel, and saw its losses balloon on concerns that Western sanctions against Russia would hit global supply of nickel, pushing up its price. This prompted the LME to suspend nickel trading to protect \u201corderly\u201d conditions,and to then restart with limits on the daily market moves in metals for physical delivery. Elliott claims that the LME acted \u201cunreasonably and irrationally\u201d. Regulators launched an investigation back in April. Here\u2019s our news story on Liz Truss\u2019s decision to name James Bowler as the new top civil servant at the Treasury, by our deputy political editor Jessica Elgot. She points out that the government has switched tack, choosing an insider with 20 years\u2019 experience in an apparent reversal of plans to bring in an outsider, and also emphasising this experience. Cat Little and Beth Russell have been appointed as second permanent secretaries. Little is currently director general of public spending at the Treasury, and Russell is director general of tax and welfare, as well as head of the Darlington Economic Campus . Credit rating agency Fitch has warned that the UK faces a deeper recession than previously forecast. Fitch, which last week cut the outlook on the UK to \u2018negative\u2019, has now predicted that the UK GDP will shrink by 1% in 2023, following the \u201cextreme volatility in UK financial markets and the prospect of sharply higher interest rates.\u201d Last month, Fitch had forecast a drop of -0.2% of GDP next year. Fitch has warned that rising funding costs, tighter financing conditions (including for mortage borrowers) and increased uncertainty will outweigh the impact of the government\u2019s tax cuts next year. Fitch sees the economy entering recession from 4Q22 as \u201crapid rate rises compound the impact of the energy crisis and the contraction in the eurozone\u201d. Fitch also predicts that the Bank of England will have raised interest rates to 4.25% by December, from 2.25% today, and up to 5% by the second quarter of 2023. The Government says it is confident it can provide enough detail on policy for the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to publish its economic forecasts alongside the Chancellor\u2019s financial strategy on October 31. The Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesperson told reporters today: \u201cThere\u2019s been discussions between the Treasury and OBR on what is possible and that is the timescale that they have agreed. \u201cObviously, the work of the OBR, as you know, is iterative by its nature and informed by ongoing policy decision. \u201cWe are confident we will be able to provide sufficient level of detail to the OBR (before) it completes that forecast.\u201d Asked why Kwasi Kwarteng brought forward his medium-term fiscal plan, the official said: \u201cI think as the Chancellor said in his letter to the Treasury Select Committee, to provide the full economic and fiscal outlook quickly, we recognise the importance of that and wanted to set out his commitment to debt falling over the medium term, and set out the detailed plans as soon as possible, and we believe that 31st is is the right time to do that.\u201d Veteran civil servant James Bowler has been appointed as the top official at the Treasury. Bowler has been named as permanent secretary to the Treasury, succeeding Tom Scholar who was ousted a month ago, shortly after Kwaski Kwarteng was appointed chancellor. There had been reports that the government had been keen to appoint Antonia Romeo, permanent secretary at the justice department, to the Treasury as part of their push to challenge economic \u201corthodoxy\u201d at the Treasury. But the Financial Times reports this morning that Liz Truss has ordered a U-turn over this plan, favouring an experienced candidate to help reassure markets. Bowler was one of several candidates who had spent large parts of their careers at the Treasury. Here\u2019s our political editor, Pippa Crerar: Recession worries have pushed the oil price a little lower today, after strong gains last week when Opec+ decided to cut output. Brent crude has dipped by almost 1% today, to $97 per barrel. Last werk, Brent climbed from around $88/barrel to $98/barrel, as the Opec cartel and allies including Russia decided to cut output in November by 2 million barrels per day. US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen warned over the weekend that the cut was \u201cunhelpful and unwise\u201d for global economic growth. The Post Office handled a record of almost \u00a33.5bn in cash for customers in August, against a backdrop of bank branch closures and the cost of living crisis. The \u00a33.45bn in cash crossing Post Office counters in August was the highest total since it began recording volumes it handles through its 11,500 local branches five years ago. August is traditionally a quieter month for cash transactions at its branches. \u201cPost Office attributes the continuing high levels of cash withdrawals to the ongoing closure of local bank branches with people turning to the Post Office to support them with their cash needs,\u201d the company said. \u201cAs the cost of living begins to bite, people are also increasingly turning to cash to manage their budget on a week-by-week basis and often day by day.\u201d Average two and five-year fixed mortgage rates are continuing to climb above 6%, according to new figures today. Across all deposit sizes, the average two-year fixed-rate mortgage on the market on Monday had a rate of 6.31%, Moneyfacts.co.uk found. Two-year fixed rates breached 6% last week for the first time since 2008. The average five-year fixed rate was 6.19%, having hit 6% last week for the first time since 2010. UK government bond yields remain higher on the day, despite the Bank of England announcing new measures to protect pension funds from market turbulence, and the bringing forward of the government\u2019s medium-term debt-cutting plan. Kwasi Kwarteng will bring forward the date of his debt-cutting plan to 31 October after pressure from MPs over the unfunded tax and spending promises announced in last month\u2019s mini-budget, my colleague Richard Partington writes. The chancellor told the Commons Treasury select committee that he would use the new date to announce his \u201cmedium-term fiscal plan\u201d, alongside the release of fresh forecasts for the economy and public finances from the Office for Budget Responsibility. The plan to bring forward the date from 23 November follows turmoil in financial markets after Kwarteng promised more than \u00a340bn of unfunded tax giveaways largely directed at middle and high earners last month. The OBR had been sidelined from his previous tax and spending event. Kwarteng told Mel Stride, the chair of the Treasury committee, that he hoped the \u201cshort extra delay\u201d in the publication of the OBR forecasts would be acceptable. It\u2019s been a busy morning, with: the Treasury bringing forward its fiscal plan to 31 October, following pressure from MPs and the markets Independent analysis from the Office for Budget Responsibility will also be published on Halloween The Bank of England stepping up its bond buying scheme to help calm financial markets But despite this two-pronged approach, government bond prices are weaker and the pound is little changed. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: It\u2019s clear there is still much scepticism about the government\u2019s plans just as Kwasi Kwarteng prepares to head to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual conference where his policies are set for fresh scrutiny. All eyes will be on the independent assessment of his spending plans, and the risk is that if the numbers don\u2019t add up, the markets could take fright again on Halloween.\u2019\u2019 Here\u2019s Professor Paul Krugman, who won the 2008 Nobel Prize for Economics, on this year\u2019s winners: Just in: A former top US central banker has won a share of the biggest prize in economics. U.S.-based economists Ben Bernanke, Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig have been awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, for their research on banks and financial crises. They will share 10 million Swedish kronor (\u00a3800,000). Diamond and Dybvig have been recognised for their work on how banks are vulnerable to rumours about their imminent collapse. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences says: If a large number of savers simultaneously run to the bank to withdraw their money, the rumour may become a self-fulfilling prophecy \u2013 a bank run occurs and the bank collapses. These dangerous dynamics can be prevented through the government providing deposit insurance and acting as a lender of last resort to banks. Ben Bernanke shares the prize, for his academid work analysing the Great Depression of the 1930s, the worst economic crisis in modern history. That expertise helped Bernanke through the 2008 financial crisis, when he was leading the US Federal Reserve. The citation explains: Among other things, he showed how bank runs were a decisive factor in the crisis becoming so deep and prolonged. When the banks collapsed, valuable information about borrowers was lost and could not be recreated quickly. Society\u2019s ability to channel savings to productive investments was thus severely diminished. The pound has recovered some of its earlier losses, after Kwasi Kwarteng brought forward the date of his debt-reduction plan. Sterling is now almost flat on the day, at $1.107. There\u2019s not much financial reaction, as the chancellor had been expected to present the medium-term fiscal plan earlier\u2026. \u2026although there was confusion after he told GB News last week it would still be on 23 November. Kwarteng\u2019s decision to bring forward the medium-term fiscal plan by over three weeks follows pressure from MPs, as well as the financial market. Having forced a u-turn on the abolition of the 45p top rate of tax, some Conservative MPs have also been resisting the idea that benefits might only rise in line with earnings, not rising prices. Earlier this morning, Victoria Prentis, a Department for Work and Pensions minister, gave a strong hint that Truss is backing down and giving into the demands of Tories from all wings of the party who want benefits to be uprated in line with inflation. That would mean a larger increase for households in need (as wages are not keeping up with inflation). In an interview with Sky News, Prentis said: It\u2019s really important that we make sure that we target the government resources at the most vulnerable. Andrew Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has all the details: Kwasi Kwarteng told the Treasury Committee in his letter that: \u201cUpon my arrival in office, I received preliminary analysis from the OBR, but I have since made significant policy announcements including the Growth Plan. \u201cIt is important that a forecast includes a full and final assessment of the impact of policy measures on the economy and public finances and, as such, it would not be appropriate to publish the initial analysis that the OBR provided. \u201cThe new forecast date on 31 October will allow the OBR to capture data releases, such as the recent Quarterly National Accounts and Blue Book revisions. \u201cIt will allow for a full forecast process to take place to a standard that satisfies the legal requirements of the Charter for Budget Responsibility enacted by Parliament and that also provides an in-depth assessment of the economy and public finances. \u201cAnd it will provide time for the Medium-Term Fiscal Plan to be finalised. In the meantime, the Prime Minister and I met with the OBR\u2019s Budget Responsibility Committee on Friday 30 September to discuss the economic and fiscal outlook, and we will continue to work closely together throughout the forecast process and beyond.\u201d Mel Stride MP, chair of the Treasury Committee, has welcomed the decision to bring forward the medium-term fiscal plan to 31 October. Stride points out that the Bank of England is due to set interest rates three days later \u2013 if Kwasi Kwarteng calms the markets, then interest rates may not need to rise as quickly. The market turmoil caused by the unfunded tax cuts in the mini-budget (totalling over \u00a340bn) and the lack of accompanying independent forecasts, heaped pressure on the chancellor to act faster to set out how the government would pay for the plan, and what their long-term impact would be. Just in: Kwasi Kwarteng has brought forward the date of his medium-term fiscal plan, in which he will lay out the government\u2019s debt-cutting plans, to 31 October. The chancellor announced the change in a letter to parliament\u2019s Treasury Select committee. The Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s independent economic forecasts will also be published that day. The medium-term plan had been scheduled for 23rd November, but Kwarteng has faced growing pressure to present his plan sooner. Investor morale in the euro zone has fallen the third month running, to levels that signal a deep recession. The Sentix index for the eurozone confidence has tumbled to -38.3 points this month, from -31.8 in September, the weakest since May 2020, early in the pandemic. Sentix\u2019s expectations index dropped to -41.0 from -37.0, hitting its lowest value since December 2008, during the financial crisis. Sentix Managing Director Manfred Huebner said: At the beginning of October, the sentix economic indices signal an unchanged difficult economic situation - in Europe, but also globally. At -38.3 points, the overall Eurozone index sinks to its lowest level since May 2020. The ongoing uncertainties about the gas and energy situation in winter have not diminished due to the attack on the Nordstream pipelines. In addition to the economic worries, there is now also an increasing probability of an esca-lation of the military conflict in Ukraine. Globally, there is little reason for hope. Only China seems to be stabilis-ing somewhat at present. With the dollar strengthening, the pound has dropped to its lowest level since the end of September. Sterling is down 0.5% at $1.103, below its levels before the mini-budget (but still above the record low of $1.035 set two weeks ago). The Russian rouble has hit a three-month low as fears grow that Moscow could escalate the Ukraine war, following the attack on Kyiv this morning. The rouble has dropped to 63 roubles to the US dollar for the first time since early July, before a small recovery. Russian stocks have also dropped, as geopolitical tensions rise, exacerbated by energy giant Gazprom\u2019s shares starting to trade ex-dividend. The dollar-denominated RTS index has tumbled 6%, while the rouble-based MOEX is down 4%. The UK government bond selloff is gathering pace, with the 30-year gilt now over 4.5% \u2013 up 16 basis points (0.16 percentage points) today. Despite the Bank\u2019s announcement, long-dated UK bond prices have opened a little lower. The yield on 30-year UK government bonds have inched up to 4.45%, from 4.38% on Friday night. Yields rise when prices fall. Before the mini-budget, the 30-year gilt yield was around 3.8%, but it surged over 5% in the days after Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s statement, forcing the Bank to act. The Bank of England is providing liquidity support because financial stress in the UK markets remains \u2018quite elevated\u2019, explains Professor Costas Milas, of the Management School of the University of Liverpool. The UK index of financial stress (which takes into account the rise in UK interest rate spreads as well as their volatility) remains as high as when the BoE started its intervention in late September. Equally important, and as I explain for The Conversation, persistently high financial stress can have a depressing impact on UK GDP for as many as 20 months. So we are not out of the woods yet\u2026 Stocks have opened lower in the City, as worries over the global economy and the Ukraine war weigh on markets. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index has dropped by 32 points to 6958, down 0.45%. The domestically-focused FTSE 250 index of smaller companies has lost 0.8%. Markets are in risk-off mood, after Kiev was targeted by at least four missiles this morning, after a key Russian built bridge in the Crimea was hit by a huge explosion. The pan-European Stoxx 600 has dropped 0.4% Last Friday\u2019s US jobs report, showing a continued rise in employment, has deflated investors\u2019 hopes that the Federal Reserve would slow its interest rate rises soon. And data over the weekend has shown that China\u2019s services activity in September contracted for the first time in four months, as COVID-19 restrictions hit demand and business confidence. Updated: Izabella Kaminska of The Blind Spot explains the Bank of England is trying to prevent a \u2018fire sale\u2019 of assets, by providing a new facility to help banks provide liquidity to pension funds. The new facility could also address any shortages of collateral (assets that can be swapped for ready cash). The Bank launched its support for the pensions industry almost two weeks ago, as pensionsfunds invested in liability driven investment (LDI) were dragged close to a \u2018doom loop\u2019. My colleague Richard Partington explains. The funds had invested in complex derivatives, using long-dated government bonds as collateral \u2013 assets pledged as security to back up a financial contract. In the market turmoil after the mini-budget, the value of UK government bonds fell sharply as investors began to lose faith in the credibility of the Truss administration to run a sustainable tax and spending policy. This meant a rise in yields \u2013 which move inversely to bond prices \u2013 in a reflection of the increased cost of government borrowing. As a result pensions funds invested in LDI schemes faced rolling \u201cmargin calls\u201d as the value of the bonds they had pledged as collateral collapsed. The funds then moved to sell other long-dated bonds they held to cover the cash demands, which in turn led to further selling pressure in the bond market in a self-reinforcing downward spiral. The Bank says that its support will help LDI funds to\u2026 \u201c\u2026address risks to their resilience from volatility in the long-dated gilt market. LDI funds have made substantial progress in doing so over the past week. Resolution Foundation\u2019s Torsten Bell says the Bank is telling the markets not to test its pledge to restore stability in the long-dated government bond market. Former pensions minister Steve Webb says today\u2019s move should reduce the risk of a \u2018cliff edge\u2019 when the Bank\u2019s bond-buying programme ends on Friday. Some snap reaction: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The Bank of England has announcing fresh measures to keep the UK\u2019s financial markets functioning, following the turmoil which hit the pensions industry after last month\u2019s mini-budget. In a statement this morning, the Bank says it will take three \u2018additional measures\u2019 to broaden its support, as it prepares to end its emergency backstop support on Friday. That emergency support saw the Bank promise to buy up \u00a365bn of long-dated UK bonds \u2013 at up to \u00a35bn per day. So far, it has only bought around \u00a35bn, having calmed the market panic that saw bond prices slump. But with that support ending on Friday, the Bank is pledging to increase the maximum auction size, to up to \u00a310bn per day. That could help maintain financial stability this week, preventing bond prices tumbling and forcing liability driven investment (LDI) pension funds into a dangerous spiral again. The Bank says: To date, the Bank has carried out 8 daily auctions, offering to buy up to \u00a340bn, and has made around \u00a35bn of bond purchases. The Bank is prepared to deploy this unused capacity to increase the maximum size of the remaining five auctions above the current level of up to \u00a35bn in each auction. Secondly, the BoE is launching a temporary scheme to help UK banks to ease the liquidity squeeze on liability driven investment (LDI) pension funds, who were forced to sell assets when UK government bond prices slumped. This Temporary Expanded Collateral Repo Facility (TECRF) will.. \u201cenable banks to help to ease liquidity pressures facing their client LDI funds through liquidity insurance operations\u201d. TECRF will run beyond the end of this week, providing support once the Bank\u2019s bond-buying scheme ends. It will let the Bank accept a range of assets as collateral \u2013 including UK gilts and corporate bonds \u2013 to help pension funds facing a liquidity squeeze. Thirdly, the Bank says it also \u201cstands ready\u201d to help the LDI pension industry through its regular \u201cIndexed Long Term Repo operations\u201d. That will also allow funds to borrow cash from the BoE in exchange for handing over assets as collateral. Last week, deputy BoE governor Sir Jon Cunliffe explained to MPs that some pension funds came close to collapse amid an \u201cunprecedented\u201d meltdown in UK government bond markets after Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s mini-budged This morning\u2019s announcement comes as BoE governor Andrew Bailey prepares to face intense scrutiny in Washington this week, where the annual IMF and World Bank meetings are taking place. Policymakers and investors worldwide, as well as in the UK, have been wondering whether there will be more market disorder once the the Bank\u2019s bond-buying programme ends on Friday. There are also concerns that by protecting the pensions industry, the Bank is also supporting the government by lowering borrowing costs.

            "content": "\u201cEquity is not an issue for us. We\u2019re here to save the world.\u201d From 1986 to 1990, I worked in an inner London borough as an environmental policy adviser. I worked on raising awareness of local environmental issues, paying special attention to those affecting the borough\u2019s lower-income residents. There were very few jobs such as this in local government, and I was the only Black person employed in one. Unlike the US, in Britain there was no policy discourse or social movement tackling environmental or climate justice at that time. Yet it was obvious to me through my work, and to a growing number of other activists of colour, that the poorest residents in urban Britain, many of whom were Black and Brown, lived in the most deprived areas in terms of proximity to large polluting roads, poor or unaffordable housing stock, social exclusion, lack of educational and economic opportunity, disinvestment and lack of green and play spaces. But these issues were being (actively) ignored by (white) environmental activists, who were focusing instead on their stock-in-trade issues: biodiversity, conservation and climate change (not climate justice). Further reinforcing the exclusivity of white environmental activist agendas, those employed in the environmental and emerging sustainability policy arenas were almost entirely white. In response to this exclusion, a group of activists of colour, including Ingrid Pollard, Judy Ling Wong, Roland de la Mothe, Vijay Krishnarayan, Swantee Toocaram and I founded the Black Environment Network (BEN) in 1988 to increase activism, reframe environmental and sustainability agendas and get more people of colour into environmental jobs. We had read the landmark report Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States (United Church of Christ, Commission for Racial Justice 1987) which had contributed significantly to the development of public awareness in the US of \u201cenvironmental racism\u201d: the intentional and disproportionate loading of environmental \u201cbads\u201d such as pollution and toxic waste on communities of colour, and the lack of access to environmental \u201cgoods\u201d, such as parks and open spaces. The cry for a \u201cjustice\u201d framing of environmental and sustainability issues was growing louder in the US, culminating in President Bill Clinton\u2019s 1994 executive order called Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations. Environmental injustice was now a civil rights issue. At BEN, our evidence was largely anecdotal and remained so until Friends of the Earth\u2019s groundbreaking 1999 report, Pollution Injustice: The Geographic Relation Between Household Income and Polluting Factories, that showed that low-income areas in Britain suffered most from industrial pollution. Race, however, was not factored into Friends of the Earth\u2019s report, unlike Toxic Wastes and Race in the US. We argued that in Britain, like the US, income is a pretty good proxy for race. With this, and BEN\u2019s work on \u201crural racism\u201d, we had the beginnings of a British environmental justice agenda. On a personal level, the justice frame gave me my mantra, which, with every passing year, I\u2019m more convinced is true: \u201cThe social justice perspective must be included in green campaign agendas because, short of coercive measures, true environmental wellbeing will only exist when there is human wellbeing.\u201d Not everyone understood the need for this linkage at that time. While researching a TV programme in the early 1990s, I asked a staff member of a large international environmental organisation if she felt her employees reflected multicultural Britain. She replied calmly: \u201cEquity is not an issue for us. We\u2019re here to save the world.\u201d While the concept of intersectionality was new at the time, the deep rupture between environmental activism on the one hand and the need for an equity framing on the other was widespread among activists and policymakers. Not only was this a major factor in keeping people of colour out of both the environmental movement and environmental jobs, but it also kept the \u201cgreen\u201d agenda away from tackling \u201csocial\u201d issues such as poverty, racism, equity and justice. However, in recent years research has shown that the issue of environmental quality is inextricably linked to that of equity and human equality at all geographic scales. Wherever in the world environmental despoliation and degradation is happening, it is almost always linked to questions of social justice, human rights, racism, equity and people\u2019s quality of life in its widest sense. From recent floods in Pakistan to excessive heat in formerly redlined US neighbourhoods, from pollution-related deaths such as Ella Kissi-Debrah who lived within 30 metres of London\u2019s South Circular Road, to the toxic plight of the copper pickers at Agbogbloshie, the world\u2019s largest e-waste dump in Accra, Ghana, the poorest are bearing the brunt of environmental \u201cbads\u201d, and in the case of climate \u201cbads\u201d, they are the least responsible for carbon production. Today, the situation among activists and policymakers is very different from the 1980s and 1990s. I would argue that it is the justice framing, which was initially called for by activists of colour, that has had the most impact on environmental and sustainability agendas worldwide. We now have the discourses of environmental justice, food justice and climate justice, white supremacy, decolonisation and oppression permeating mainstream environmental and sustainability agendas, activism and policy. We also have Kate Raworth\u2019s equity-focused Doughnut Economics, the justice-focused Greenhouse Development Rights framework developed and modelled by the Stockholm Environment Institute, the UN Sustainable Development goals which more fully reflect poverty and inequality, racism, Indigenous and women\u2019s rights, and we have Fridays for Future \u201cstrikes\u201d in around 450 places worldwide, demanding that rich countries pay reparations for \u201closs and damage\u201d due to global heating and climate-related disasters. We\u2019ve come a long way, but there\u2019s still a long way to go.

            "title": "Kiribati controversy as attorney general becomes acting chief justice",
            "date": "2022-10-30T02:17:52Z",
            "content": "The separation of powers crisis in Kiribati escalated on Friday, with the Pacific country\u2019s attorney general, Tetiro Semilota, appointed acting chief justice. Semilota was sworn in on Friday afternoon at a closed ceremony in the capital, Tarawa. Under the Kiribati constitution, the chief justice is appointed by the president, Taneti Maamau, acting on the advice of his cabinet. It was not immediately clear whether Semilota had first resigned her position as attorney general. Guardian Australia understands that Semilota is set to be formally welcomed to the high court at a special sitting on Wednesday. She is the first i-Kiribati citizen, and the first woman, to hold the position in Kiribati, where the use of foreign judges is common. The Kiribati government has been at war with its judiciary for the past year. The crisis began in 2021 when the government blocked high court judge and Australian citizen David Lambourne from returning to the country \u2013 a move subsequently ruled unconstitutional by the chief justice, New Zealand judge William Hastings. The government then suspended both Lambourne and Hastings, before briefly detaining and attempting to deport Lambourne \u2013 in defiance of orders from Kiribati\u2019s court of appeal. The government then suspended all three judges of the court of appeal, after they had condemned the government\u2019s actions. The appointment of the government\u2019s chief law officer as acting chief justice raises major questions about the separation of powers in Kiribati. The Kiribati constitution mandates \u201can independent and impartial\u201d court system. The latest development in the ongoing crisis comes as an intervention by the United Nations special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Diego Garc\u00eda-Say\u00e1n, recently became public. In communication to the Kiribati government in August, Garc\u00eda-Say\u00e1n wrote that he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d with the suspensions of Lambourne and Hastings and the consequence that \u201cKiribati does not currently have a functioning high court.\u201d Semilota\u2019s appointment as acting chief justice will do little to address the mounting backlog in cases caused by the constitutional crisis. She will have a conflict of interest in all criminal cases, given her involvement in signing indictments as attorney general, and most pending civil cases are against her government. Guardian Australia contacted the attorney general, her office and a spokesperson for the president, but did not receive a response by the time of publication. However, a post to the president\u2019s Facebook page on Saturday afternoon confirmed the appointment. The post indicated that the president had issued a statement in which he \u201creaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to up-hold the Rule of Law and respect to the powers of the Judiciary. He concluded stating that government remained ready to work together with Judiciary for the betterment of Kiribati and the people.\u201d Kiribati has been in the geopolitical spotlight in recent years since shifting its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 2019. China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, visited earlier this year and China\u2019s influence is believed to have contributed to Kiribati\u2019s withdrawal from the Pacific Islands Forum. Australia and New Zealand, Kiribati\u2019s two primary development partners, have remained quiet during the constitutional crisis. \u201cThe broader issues between the government of Kiribati and its judiciary are matters for the government of Kiribati to resolve, consistent with its constitutional and legal processes,\u201d a spokesperson for Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in August when Lambourne was briefly detained."

            "content": "Kanye West is buying rightwing social network Parler for an undisclosed sum. From our story: The purchase by the rapper, who legally changed his name to Ye last year, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year. \u201cIn a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves,\u201d he said in a statement. George Farmer, the chief executive of Parler\u2019s parent company, Parlement Technologies, said: \u201cThis deal will change the world, and change the way the world thinks about free speech. Ye is making a groundbreaking move into the free speech media space and will never have to fear being removed from social media again.\u201d The purchase caps off an increasingly erratic couple of weeks for the star, which started at Paris fashion week at the beginning of the month. West and rightwing activist Candace Owens, who is also Black, appeared at Paris fashion week in matching \u201cwhite lives matter\u201d sweatshirts. After that, West was invited on Tucker Carlson\u2019s Fox News show, where he attacked Trump\u2019s Jewish son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for seeking personal profit in his involvement with the peace process in Israel. West was criticised for the antisemitic undertone of the attack, while in leaked footage, he shared even more explicitly racist conspiracy theories that Fox declined to broadcast. He then turned to Instagram, sharing screenshots of a long conversation between himself and fellow star Sean Combs, better known as Puff Daddy, in which Combs pleaded with West to recant some of his statements. Instead, West accused his friend of being told what to do by Jewish people, for which his account on the service was suspended. So he went on Twitter, where he declared he would go \u201cdeath con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE\u201d. His tweet was deleted and his account was suspended. Luckily for West, Candace Owens got him into this mess, and she could get him out of it, too. Parler chief executive George Farmer, the wealthy heir of Brexiteer peer and former Conservative party treasurer Michael Farmer, happens to be her husband. The \u201cfree-speech\u201d social network Parler was founded by Rebekah Mercer and John Matze in 2018, the second major attempt at building a post-Twitter social network for the US right, after the launch of Gab in 2016, and it succeeded in building a moderately sized base of users with its promise of zero moderation. Unfortunately, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a moderately sized group of American right-wingers on a platform with zero moderation must be in want of an insurrection. In the aftermath of the January 6 invasion of the US Capitol, Parler was deplatformed by most major tech companies. Matze was chucked out, and Farmer brought in to replace him and rebuild the site in a more respectable image. It isn\u2019t hard to imagine the conversation unfolding, with Owens as a matchmaker. West has a problem: as he sees it, he\u2019s been banned from major social networks because they\u2019re afraid of him speaking the truth about the powerful Jewish lobby, and he needs somewhere to post that won\u2019t censor him any further. Farmer has a problem: while he\u2019s restored Parler to the iOS and Android app stores, and built a technical backend for the social network that can survive Amazon\u2019s refusal to provide services, the social network is a shadow of its former self, with the Trump-backed Truth Social sucking the air out of the room, and the less ideologically affiliated Telegram offering effectively moderation-free social networking to anyone who wants it. It\u2019s the best exit Parler is going to get. Despite constant accusations of biased moderation on the part of mainstream social networks, the dream of a rightwing splinternet has repeatedly failed to pass. That\u2019s partially because the structural weight of content moderation runs deeper than the simple surface choices of social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. You can build a site that mimics their interfaces but offers no moderation, like Parler did, but you run into the same pressures one layer down the \u201cstack\u201d: Apple and Google are unwilling to allow the sort of content that true \u201cunmoderated\u201d apps inevitably end up hosting, from actionable calls for violence to nonconsensual sexual imagery and worse. If you give up on apps altogether and exist purely as a website, building a high-traffic site that doesn\u2019t rely on cloud services from Amazon, Google or Microsoft is tricky. Even if you pull it off, as KiwiFarms did, you can only succeed for as long as your obscurity stops the same pressures bearing down on the smaller companies who are unwittingly partnering with you. If this all sounds familiar, it sort of should. It\u2019s the same basic pressures we talked about last week, leading to the slow death of the porn-friendly internet. And the root cause of a lot of these changes are, well, the same pressure that we talked about the week before last, with a UK coroner finding that the \u201cnegative effects of online content\u201d played a direct role in the death of teenager Molly Russell in 2017. Just like last week\u2019s topic about porn, there\u2019s a weird exception to this, too: the messaging service Telegram operates a social network that is effectively an unmoderated Twitter. That platform has become the haven for many users exiled from Parler; to this day I keep tabs on Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, on his Telegram account with almost 160,000 followers, long after he was removed from every major website. But despite its far softer moderation practices, even Telegram can\u2019t completely replace Twitter, Facebook or TikTok for a fully rightwing splinternet, because the site doesn\u2019t have the one thing the movement needs: left-wingers. The essence of political activism on a social network is somewhere between open warfare or a player-versus-player video game. Without political opponents, there\u2019s a hollowness to these communities that means that the mass exoduses never quite occur. That isn\u2019t to say their existence isn\u2019t meaningful: an unmoderated space to congregate can be a powerful thing for any movement, particularly one at the radical end of the political spectrum. But, Kanye or not, Parler will always be a sideshow to the main event. There is one last twist to the story: Elon Musk, who may end up owning Twitter before the month is out, and seemingly loves the idea of it being considered in the same breath as Parler and Truth Social. It would be a slow ship to turn, but what if the rightwing-friendly version of Twitter is \u2026 Twitter? Giphy a C! Giphy an M! Giphy an A! For anyone wondering about Britain\u2019s position on the global stage given gestures vaguely towards Westminster, don\u2019t worry: We\u2019ve still got it, if \u201cit\u201d is \u201cthe regulatory power to kibosh multimillion dollar tech deals\u201d. The CMA has forced Meta to give up on its dream of buying Giphy. From our story: The Competition and Markets Authority told Meta in November that the only way to resolve competition concerns was to dispose of Giphy, the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks such as Snapchat, TikTok and Twitter, which it acquired two years ago for $400m (\u00a3290m). Meta appealed against the decision, which the regulator said would \u201cprotect millions of social media users\u201d and stop Facebook \u201cincreasing its significant power in social media\u201d, which was upheld by the Competition Appeal Tribunal on five of the six grounds challenged. After the tribunal\u2019s ruling in July, the CMA conducted an \u201cexpedited review\u201d of its original ruling, which included new submissions from Giphy and Meta, and on Tuesday it said it stood by its order to sell the business. Giphy\u2019s appeal included the memorable argument that gifs are \u201ccringe\u201d and \u201cfor boomers\u201d, and thus the company has no future unless it is taken under the wing of a stable parent. The CMA didn\u2019t buy it, arguing that it would \u201csignificantly reduce competition in two markets\u201d \u2013 display advertising and social media \u2013 if the merger were to go ahead. Meta will likely try and find a buyer for Giphy, since the company stands little chance of surviving on its own. Where it ends up will be interesting. My guess? A company in the content business: a Netflix or Disney would have the most use for a service that now exists solely as a platform for hosting shareable clips of commercial entertainment.

He told me the places he\u2019s been and the things he\u2019s done. It wasn\u2019t intimidating, but I did think: \u201cI\u2019m over my head a bit.\u201d Charles I asked what Chris\u2019s motivating principle is, where he comes from when he\u2019s approaching anything. He said something like sympathy, empathy, passion, those sort of words. I come from a place which is more about the consent of the governed \u2013 under what basis are rules set, and who sets them? That\u2019s a big foundational disagreement, you might say, between heart and head. The big beef Chris Our biggest difference was in how we view the world and how we want to change it. For me it\u2019s more about rights, social justice, wanting a fairer and more equal society. He talked a lot about his hatred of communism. Charles I have lived in communist countries and seen the results. The idea is that the end justifies the means; there are no limits to government. The spirit of communism is alive and well, and pops up in all sorts of places \u2013 in some of these cancel culture things, the ideological uniformity in US universities, for example. Chris He said the reason he didn\u2019t like the left is that they are mean-spirited and always assume the worst in people. That\u2019s my experience of the right. Charles What I dislike is the angry, aggressive, obnoxious left. Chris didn\u2019t seem to be part of that at all \u2013 he seemed to have a libertarian instinct of some sort, which was fine. We could sit down and talk about ideas. Sharing plate Chris We agreed about how divided and tribal the country is in the way we talk about issues, and how that is driven by social media. Charles Everyone is living in echo chambers and the algorithms are making it worse. They serve up the stuff they know you like because they want to send you advertising. For afters Chris We talked about taking the knee, which I support if someone wants to show their solidarity with people who suffer racism in football. It became a thing in 2020 and 2021 when enmity and violence against the black community was a world issue. If it had been before George Floyd was murdered by the police, and people just said they wanted to show solidarity and drive out racism, I don\u2019t think it would have had that much attention. Charles You\u2019ve got all these people taking the knee. What attitude do you take to the people who don\u2019t take the knee? The way it\u2019s presented is that if you somehow challenge it, or laugh, or boo or whatever you do to show your disapproval, then you are ipso facto a racist. It\u2019s a sort of all-or-nothing view, and that to me is obnoxious. Chris It\u2019s not just a leftwing issue. Poppy outrage is driven by the right. Every year, TV presenters get complaints if they\u2019re not seen to be wearing poppies or not wearing them early enough. Charles Chris hit back over the net pretty well there, but it\u2019s not clear to me that it\u2019s analogous. If you don\u2019t wear a poppy, I don\u2019t go around saying you\u2019re anti-patriotic; there\u2019s no mass movement of people demanding everyone wears poppies in the same way as you would be attacked if you said taking the knee was ridiculous. Takeaways Chris I was a little bit disappointed afterwards because I didn\u2019t feel I had said enough. I felt he bamboozled me a bit. At one point I thought: \u201cWhat am I doing here? I have nothing to say.\u201d Charles He seemed to go away with some things he hadn\u2019t thought about before, and to some degree I did, too. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a vegan or a vegetarian, but he seemed unimpressed by his courgettes, which made me warm to him, because everyone\u2019s unimpressed by courgettes.

He recently attempted suicide for the third time. It was several days before she was told by the authorities that he had been taken to hospital, where he was treated before being released back to Casuarina prison. \u201cThere\u2019s something going wrong there \u2026 for them kids to think dying is the only way to get out of there,\u201d she says. Across the country, the juvenile justice system is in crisis, according to families of incarcerated young people, lawyers and human rights advocates. There have been calls for urgent reforms in WA, the Northern Territory and Tasmania, while federal, state and territory governments have committed to reducing juvenile detention rates by 30% by 2031. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning This week WA\u2019s corrective services minister, Bill Johnston, announced a review into the state\u2019s juvenile justice legislation. He acknowledged the state is facing a \u201cchanging youth justice landscape\u201d. The review will also examine the over-representation of young Aboriginal people in detention, the impact of cognitive impairment disabilities and the separation and isolation of detainees. In a report released in April, the state\u2019s custodial inspector, Eamon Ryan, found there had been 24 attempted suicides at Banksia Hill between January and November of 2021. Neil Morgan, who inspected WA\u2019s adult prisons and its sole juvenile detention centre for more than a decade, says conditions at the facility are contributing to declines in the behaviour of young detainees\u2019 mental health, causing them to act out. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t ill before you went there, you would be ill within a very short time of being in that facility,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is completely counter-therapeutic and yet that\u2019s where we put young people who are most in need and most at risk.\u201d Morgan says the transfer of young offenders to the adult prison is a sign the system is buckling under the strain. \u201cThe bottom line is it should never have come to this. We should never have been in the position of having to transfer young people to an adult prison,\u201d he says. During his time inspecting the state\u2019s prisons, Morgan says more than a dozen of his reports were tabled, along with numerous reviews and inquiries, including into the 2013 decision to transfer youths to Hakea prison. \u201cMy job was to report on custodial facilities to parliament once every three years,\u201d he says. \u201cIt tells you a big story that I was reporting on Banskia Hill every year because things were just not right.\u201d The former inspector and lawyer says while national or state inquiries are costly, too often they fail to provoke meaningful reform. \u201cIt\u2019s inquiry after inquiry. We need some action,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I think the government probably knows what needs to be done, which is to close Banksia Hill and have a plan to move to smaller, more trauma-informed facilities. But it will be expensive upfront and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re prepared to spend that sort of money.\u201d Banksia Hill is not alone in facing fierce criticism. Other juvenile detention centres, such as Don Dale in the NT and Ashley in Tasmania, have also been criticised as unfit for purpose. Donna, 69, is an outspoken critic of Don Dale, a former male prison that holds children as young as 10. Her grandson was one of them. The year 5 student had just celebrated his 11th birthday two weeks before he was sent to Don Dale. \u201cThat was pretty horrific for me, to know that my [grandson was] gonna be sleeping in a cell in a cage at a condemned male prison,\u201d says Donna, whose surname has not been published for legal reasons. Her grandson sought comfort and kinship with young people from similar backgrounds, she says, but run-ins with the law quickly became normalised. \u201cThey speak the same language and they understand one another because of the traumas they faced.\u201d Don Dale was internationally condemned in 2016 after media revealed children at the facility were teargassed and spit-hooded. Public outcry led to the 2017 royal commission into the detention and protection of children in the Northern Territory. Donna\u2019s grandson is now out of detention and when Guardian Australia spoke to the family, he was celebrating his 12th birthday. \u201cHe\u2019s back with his dad. He can see some of his friends again now. He\u2019s been doing really well, complying with his bail agreements \u2013 so hopefully that continues,\u201d Donna says. Last year the NT government settled a class action, paying $35m to former Don Dale detainees mistreated between 2006 and 2017. Meanwhile, lawyers in WA are preparing to bring a class action against the state government over the alleged ill-treatment of Banksia Hill detainees. In Tasmania, the Ashley youth detention centre has been at the centre of harrowing reports of historical allegations of physical and sexual abuse, as well as punitive lockdowns due to staffing shortages. Amnesty International\u2019s Rodney Dillion says the centre should be \u201cburned to the ground\u201d, after damning allegations surfaced during the state\u2019s inquiry into institutional child sexual abuse. He says widespread reforms across the juvenile justice system are needed to reduce young people revolving in and out of prisons. \u201cThe system\u2019s broken and not only in Tasmania \u2013 this is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Dillion says. \u201cI would say these places are not fit for children. \u201cThe detention centres end up being like a kind of apprenticeship to the big prisons, the adult prisons. What\u2019s gonna happen to those kids that come out of that system?\u201d Holistic and trauma-informed programs and early intervention schemes need to be put in place to divert children at risk of ending up in detention, he says. \u201cWe need ones that are run by Aboriginal people for Aboriginal kids, because they show that when the kids go in those places [the detention centres], they come out worse.\u201d The state has committed to closing centre by the end of 2023 as a key part of reforming its juvenile justice system, according to a spokesperson for Communities Tasmania. \u201cThe Tasmanian government has also commenced a comprehensive reform of the youth justice system, including development of new facilities to replace the Ashley youth detention centre. The NT government has committed to closing its detention centres within the same timeframe. It also says it\u2019s committed to overhauling the youth justice system and delivering a \u201cprogressive\u201d system, focusing on early diversion and intervention programs. \u201cThe youth justice system we have today is a far cry from that which this government inherited,\u201d a spokesperson for the NT government said in a statement. \u201cIt includes a therapeutic model of care developed with extensive stakeholder input, which is now being rolled out across the system.\u201d The WA government declined to answer questions on the future of Banksia Hill but said multimillion-dollar upgrades are being carried out to create a more therapeutic environment for young people at risk. The government said detainees are provided trauma-informed comprehensive support in both Banksia Hill and unit 18 at Casuarina. \u201cThis includes systemic interventions, as well as support from various services available, such as psychologists, mental health workers, Aboriginal youth support officers, aboriginal visitors, family and community supports and mentors.\u201d The most recent statistics show there are signs of progress in reducing incarceration in all jurisdictions except for the Northern Territory, where youth detention rates are climbing. The federal minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, says she was alarmed at reports of children self-harming. \u201cI am deeply concerned about reports of self-harm and abuse in youth detention facilities and the transfer of young people to an adult maximum security facility,\u201d she says. Burney says the federal government is committed to reducing the drivers of incarceration by way of justice reinvestment programs around the country to divert at-risk young people away from incarceration. The federal attorney general\u2019s office said it is working with states and territories to reduce young people\u2019s contact with the justice system, including raising the age of detention and criminal responsibility. The grandmother of the 15-year-old boy incarcerated at Casuarina says it cannot come soon enough for her and other families like hers. \u201cWe don\u2019t need Band-Aids; we need people that work with kids and put their money into working with them.\u201d \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. Other international suicide helplines can be found at befrienders.org"

            "date": "2022-10-31T06:00:47Z",
            "content": "A controversial Metropolitan police list of alleged gang members that mainly targeted black men \u201camplified disproportionality\u201d and must be radically reformed, Britain\u2019s top police officer has said. The gang violence matrix was branded part of a \u201cracialised war\u201d on gangs by Amnesty International and was found potentially to be breaching data laws by the information commissioner. It ranked people by the threat they posed, and the matrix faced claims that hundreds of youngsters in London were placed on it who should not have been. Now more than 1,000 young men who were on the list even though they were classed as posing little or no risk of violence have been removed. Those on it could be subject to \u201cAl Capone-style\u201d disruption tactics, such as losing housing, or driving licences, as part of \u201clawful harassment\u201d. Met commissioner Sir Mark Rowley vowed to implement reforms, after Sadiq Khan had pressed the force for change. A report for the mayor of London, to be released on Monday, found: \u201cThere remains an over-representation of young Black males on the overall GVM [gang violence matrix] population as compared to both police recorded offending and victimisation cohorts.\u201d The matrix now has 1,933 individuals, a fall of 49% from its peak in 2017, when 3,881 people were on it. Rowley said: \u201cWe acknowledge that the gangs violence matrix does need to be redesigned, taking into account improvements in statistical methods and technologies. \u201cWe know that young men, and in particular young black men, continue to be over-represented on the matrix. \u201cSadly, there is a reality that levels of violent crime do disproportionally affect young black men \u2013 both in terms of victimisation and offending \u2013 and our tactics do need to be targeted so we can protect those most at risk. \u201cHowever, it is not appropriate that the matrix further amplifies this disproportionality. As an immediate response, we are removing all the lowest-risk individuals. This represents 65% , or more than 1,100 people.\u201d In 2018, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office found the gangs matrix was potentially breaking data protection laws and failed to distinguish between victims of crime and offenders. In an embarrassing move for the Met, the ICO issued Britain\u2019s biggest force with formal enforcement notices to improve. The same year the Guardian revealed that more than 40% of young people on a matrix list from Haringey, north London, were scored as posing \u201czero\u201d risk of causing harm. Some were assessed as being much more likely to be victims than offenders. Khan said: \u201cThe fact black Londoners have less trust in the Met should concern us all. That is why the comprehensive overhaul of the gang violence matrix is so important \u2013 increased scrutiny and transparency will help increase the degree of confidence all of London\u2019s diverse communities can have in the Met. \u201cAs a direct result of the police acting on the recommendations, the Matrix database is now more effective and more evidence-based than ever before.\u201d The average age of those on the matrix is 23 and most are male. The proportion who are black or ethnic minority has fallen from 89% in 2019 to 77% in 2021. Critics say more still is needed. Veteran campaigner Stafford Scott said those being removed should be told, and he condemned the unfairness of how widely the matrix had encroached on young people\u2019s lives when they posed little or no risk of violence. He said: \u201cThese young people have been the recipient of the Met\u2019s \u2018achilles heel\u2019 policing policy that requires all government agencies to penalise those targeted. \u201cThis means that their human rights have been breached by multiple organisations. These young people will feel that these services are still unavailable to them. Unless they are informed and enabled to seek redress. They continue to live chaotic lives on the margins of society doing whatever they feel is necessary to survive.\u201d Oliver Feeley-Sprague of Amnesty International said reforms were needed to clean up the Met: \u201cWe sounded the alarm over the Met police\u2019s racist gangs matrix years ago, so this review is welcome but long overdue. \u201cStigmatising young black men on the basis of the music they listen to, their social media behaviour or who they are associated with is completely unacceptable, damaging numerous people\u2019s lives and further damaging trust in the institution of policing itself.\u201d Liberty is bringing a legal action, which reaches court next month. Emmanuelle Andrews from the civil rights group said: \u201cBeing on the matrix can have a devastating consequence on your life, from increased stop and searches to having private data shared with schools and housing providers that affects your education and accommodation statuses. \u201cIt is right the Met police have today removed more people from the gangs matrix, but this still does not go far enough. \u201d The matrix was devised after the 2011 riots when the Conservative government were convinced gangs were to blame for the worst mass violence to hit England in modern times. Report after report found poor social conditions and poor relations with police were more of a factor."

            "date": "2022-10-11T23:01:17Z",
            "content": "The children\u2019s commissioner for England has poured cold water on Liz Truss\u2019s proposal to scrap regulations governing child-to-staff ratios in nurseries, describing it as tinkering around the edges and calling instead for ambitious and transformative reform of the childcare sector. In an interview with the Guardian, Dame Rachel de Souza said children\u2019s safety and wellbeing must be \u201cparamount\u201d in any plans to reform childcare and she said she thought it was \u201creally depressing\u201d if the current conversation about childcare focused purely on ratios. The former headteacher, whose work as children\u2019s commissioner has highlighted the cost of living crisis affecting families across the country, also said she thought benefits should be uprated in line with inflation \u2013 an issue the chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, will address in his fiscal plan to be published at the end of this month. Concerns have been mounting about the state of the childcare sector in England, with parents facing spiralling costs, nurseries complaining of underfunding and the number of places available for preschool children going down. The government has said it is exploring a range of options to make childcare more affordable and easier to access to help boost economic growth through getting people back to work. One proposal is to relax childcare ratios from one adult to four two-year-olds, to allow one adult to care for five children \u2013 a move which has been overwhelmingly opposed by everyone involved in the sector on safety grounds. Ministers are also reported to be considering getting rid of the regulatory requirement on ratios altogether, leaving it up to childcare settings to decide how many staff they need to care for their children. De Souza said she had looked at the figures and although it might save some money, she dismissed it as \u201ctinkering financially\u201d. \u201cI do think it\u2019s really depressing if the conversation we have about childcare is about ratios \u2013 not about a vision for transforming childcare. This is a moment to actually really create that vision,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing from government is they want a growth plan, and for that growth plan to work, they need people to be in the workforce and I would imagine there\u2019s an interest in childcare because they need mums and dads to be working. So this is a great moment to look at what fantastic childcare actually is.\u201d Asked about another proposal under discussion to give a flexible childcare budget direct to parents in place of a paid-for space in nursery, De Souza agreed the current system was \u201cungainly\u201d and funding streams were complicated for parents. But she added: \u201cI\u2019m not saying giving all the money up front is the answer. What I\u2019m saying is let\u2019s do the thinking to make this system work for everybody, particularly the most vulnerable children.\u201d On Wednesday the children\u2019s commissioner published her own report, Vision for Childcare, which included new research highlighting the varied uptake of the government\u2019s current offer of 15 hours\u2019 free childcare a week for all three and four-year-olds. In 2019, overall uptake was 93%, but significantly lower for certain groups, including Chinese (71%), Irish traveller (66%), Gypsy/Roma children (62%), children with English as an additional language (85%), children in London (90%) and those with profound learning difficulties (83%). An audit of 60 local authorities also found it was difficult to access information on childcare providers in more than a quarter (27%) of local authorities, while for 60% of local authorities the childcare directory didn\u2019t contain all the information recommended in statutory guidance. The report said schools should be at the heart of \u201ca new model for early education and childcare\u201d. With school rolls falling and the number of pupils in state primaries set to fall by a fifth over the next decade, De Souza said spare capacity in schools should be used to provide more early years provision. The report also called for childminders to be placed \u201cfront and centre\u201d of the new childcare offer, with an agency for childminders in every local area to provide \u201ca bespoke brokerage service for parents\u201d to meet individual needs. De Souza also suggested removing Ofsted from regulation of childminders, suggesting it might be better done by a local authority. \u201cFor the past decade within government there has been a relentless focus on driving up school standards,\u201d the report said. \u201cNow this focus must be extended to the early years. \u201cEvery parent and carer should have confidence that the early education they choose for their child will be of the highest quality. But we also need a flexible childcare offer that wraps around education, and that works for the realities of family life.\u201d Neil Leitch, CEO of the Early Years Alliance, said: \u201cOver recent days, we have seen a whole range of seemingly random, ill-thought-out and in many cases completely unworkable proposals for early years reform from government. \u201cAs such, we share the children\u2019s commissioner\u2019s view that what both the sector and families need is a long-term, ambitious vision for childcare and early education in this country, and not more tinkering around the edges. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cWe will carefully consider the commissioner\u2019s recommendations as we explore a wide range of options to make childcare more accessible and affordable for parents.\u201d"

            "content": "A Scottish government minister has resigned ahead of a Holyrood debate on a new law to streamline how transgender people can change their legal sex, understood to be the first time a serving minister has stood down over a matter of conscience since the founding of the Scottish parliament. The community safety minister, Ash Regan, resigned in order to vote against the government\u2019s bill, prompting Nicola Sturgeon to accuse her of failing to raise her concerns with colleagues. News of Regan\u2019s resignation broke less than an hour before the start of the chamber debate on plans to introduce a system of self-declaration for legal gender recognition, removing the need for a psychiatric diagnosis of gender dysphoria, and reducing the age for applicants from 18 to 16. In her resignation letter, Regan, who is one of several Scottish National party MSPs known to have significant concerns about the bill, wrote: \u201cI have considered the issue of gender recognition reform very carefully over some time. I have concluded that my conscience will not allow me to vote with the government at the stage one of the bill this afternoon.\u201d Accepting her resignation and thanking Regan for her contribution, the first minister replied: \u201cI note that at no stage have you approached me \u2013 or indeed the cabinet secretary for social justice \u2013 to raise your concerns about the gender recognition reform bill or the vote this evening.\u201d Sturgeon continued: \u201cHowever, in circumstances in which a minister is unable to support the government, it is the case that the only options available are resignation ahead of the vote or dismissal thereafter.\u201d The gender recognition reform bill is supported by every party in Holyrood bar the Scottish Conservatives, but has also been the subject of angry protests outside the parliament and fiercely contested by some groups. They argue it will fundamentally alter who can access women-only services and believe they have not been adequately consulted. Speaking to reporters after first minister\u2019s questions, Sturgeon\u2019s official spokesperson said Scottish government ministers were obliged to vote in line with government policy. He said the SNP parliamentary group decided whether or not to insist that backbench MSPs voted in line with government policy, ministers were \u201ccovered by the usual protocols\u201d and had no leeway. It has been previously reported that some senior SNP figures wanted a free vote on the draft bill. The government is expected to win tonight\u2019s vote, and the bill will move on to the second stage where amendments will be considered."

            "content": "Canada\u2019s federal police force is investigating reports that clandestine Chinese \u201cpolice stations\u201d are operating in Toronto amid reports of a global network used to target overseas dissidents. The Royal Canada Mounted Police said it was investigating \u201creports of criminal activity in relation to the so-called \u2018police\u2019 stations\u201d but did not specify the location of the sites. The police also warned that \u201cforeign states may seek to intimidate or harm communities or individuals within Canada\u201d. The revelations come days after the Dutch government said it was investigating two suspected stations. The stations were first identified by Safeguard Defenders, a Spanish civil rights group which alleged the Fuzhou and Qingtian police agencies had between them opened 54 \u201coverseas service centres\u201d in 25 cities across 21 countries, including Canada. Safeguard Defenders identified a residential home, commercial building and convenience store in the greater Toronto area as the locations of the suspected operations. China\u2019s embassy has denied the buildings are staffed by police, instead suggesting they are \u201cservices stations\u201d meant to offer consular and bureaucratic assistance. \u201cDue to the Covid-19 epidemic, many overseas Chinese citizens are not able to return to China in time for their Chinese driver\u2019s licence renewal and other services,\u201d the embassy said in a statement. \u201cFor services such as driver\u2019s licence renewal, it is necessary to have eyesight, hearing and physical examination. The main purpose of the service station abroad is to provide free assistance to overseas Chinese citizens in this regard.\u201d The embassy also said the staff were volunteers and not police officers, adding: \u201cThey are not involved in any criminal investigation or relevant activity.\u201d But recently unsealed court documents in New York corroborate accusations that China has engaged in a foreign interference campaign, harassing and surveilling Chinese nationals abroad. In one case, a Chinese citizen living in Canada was pressured to return to China to face charges of embezzling nearly C$380,000 (US$280,000) in public funds. In the court document, the US alleges the pressure campaign is related to China\u2019s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and Operation Fox Hunt, which has been used to target both corruption and dissent. Canadian lawmakers have previously warned of the issue. At a House of Commons special committee on Canada-China relations in early October, the Conservative member of parliament Michael Chong asked Canada\u2019s foreign affairs ministry about the existence of the police stations. Weldon Epp, director general of North Asia and Oceania at Global Affairs Canada said there was space for \u201clegitimate police liaison cooperation\u201d between countries. \u201cBut the allegations reported in the press would fall well outside of that, and we would have deep concerns if they proved to be true.\u201d The allegations are likely to once again strain relations between Ottawa and Beijing, which have remained tense following a string of disputes between the two nations, including the arrests of the Huawei executive Meng Wenzhou, and the Canadian businessmen Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor."

The author of the fan-led review into football governance, which was published 10 months ago and met with widespread support, said she was \u201cfrustrated\u201d by the slow progress of government action, with a white paper on the proposals still to be published. Speaking at an event chaired by the UK Onward think tank, Crouch was asked if implementing the fan-led review was high up the current government\u2019s agenda. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are coming up to the one-year anniversary and it feels like there hasn\u2019t been much public progress. \u201cI know the DCMS has been working hard on the white paper, but it still hasn\u2019t been published. I would expect nothing less than top quality [from the white paper], but it is being delayed by politics and that is frustrating as I am keen to get on with it. \u201cThe sooner we start the sooner we can prevent another Bury [who went into administration in November 2020]. It would have been nice to have some sort of safety net at least started to have been put in place.\u201d The government, under Boris Johnson, had said previously that a white paper would be published in the summer though there was no commitment to a firm date. A report in the Times last month suggested the current prime minister, Liz Truss, was considering putting plans on hold, however. On Tuesday evening, sources inside the DCMS insisted to the Guardian that the white paper was still going ahead. Crouch said that she still believed a regulator would be implemented, even if it took a future Labour government to implement it. \u201cIt\u2019s a no brainer, I want it done as soon as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be honest I\u2019m relatively relaxed because in five years we\u2019ll have an independent regulator. But it\u2019s incredibly frustrating. \u201cLet\u2019s put the fact we\u2019re a bazillion points behind in the polls to one side. When an election comes, it only takes [one club owner] to write in the match programme that the government hasn\u2019t delivered and you lose 500 votes and potentially a seat.\u201d Also speaking at the debate was chairman of the EFL, Rick Parry. One aspect of the fan-led review had required the EFL and Premier League to discuss an alternative to the current system of parachute payments given to relegated Premier League teams. If an agreement was not reached, the review argued, it should be settled through the intervention of an independent body. Parry told the event that discussions between the EFL and Premier League had not taken place. \u201cDiscussions over parachute payments [have] not yet started,\u201d he said, \u201cand it just isn\u2019t going to happen without independent intervention.\u201d"

Lee White said governments were not yet behaving as if global heating was a crisis, and he feared for the future he was leaving to his children. He said the $100bn of promised climate finance from rich nations was not reaching poor countries, which was driving distrust in the UN climate process. The UN has framed Cop27, which begins next week in Sharm el-Sheikh, as \u201cthe Africa climate conference\u201d, and loss and damage finance for countries experiencing the worst consequences of global heating will be a key issue. \u201cWith everything that\u2019s happened in the last year in the Horn of Africa and Pakistan \u2013 those places really count,\u201d White said. \u201cBut with the once-in-a-500-year drought in Europe, fires in France, and the New York subway becoming Niagara Falls, we might be at a point where things are getting bad enough that developed nations start taking the climate more seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible thing to say but until more people in developed nations are dying because of the climate crisis, it\u2019s not going to change,\u201d White said. Recent reports show how close the planet is to climate catastrophe, with scientists warning that the world has reached a \u201creally bleak moment\u201d. Gabon, one of the most forested nations and home to more than half of the remaining critically endangered African forest elephants, is holding one of the largest ever sales of carbon credits, generated by protecting its portion of the Congo basin rainforest, the world\u2019s second largest and the last that sucks in more carbon than it releases. White said his country, which gets about 60% of its state revenue from oil, accepted that the oil economy would go and that greater emphasis needed to be placed on sustainable forestry and timber. \u201cWe\u2019ve not really actively promoted the death of the oil industry like Costa Rica,\u201d he said, referencing the Beyond Oil &amp; Gas Alliance launched at Cop26 in Glasgow by the Central American country and Denmark. \u201cWe recognise that the oil industry will disappear.\u201d The politician, originally from Manchester, said he had seen only small amounts of climate funding for his country despite big promises, which was driving frustration with the UN climate process. \u201cOver and over again, developed nations have committed and not delivered. They\u2019ve committed to reduce emissions and they\u2019re not delivering sufficiently. They\u2019ve committed to funding and that funding doesn\u2019t ever seem to materialise. We didn\u2019t create the problem and so you would expect a more sincere engagement from developed nations and you would expect them to respect their word and their engagements,\u201d he said. \u201cI have three kids. I tell them that my absences are about trying to save the planet. They get it, because it\u2019s real. We are creating a really big problem for the next generation.\u201d"

This had reinforced a \u201cpolicy paralysis problem\u201d in responding to the climate crisis because the dominant public narrative \u201cunderrates both the urgency to act and the extent of change needed\u201d. \u201cThe consequence of this is that the public get a muted view of the climate situation from government agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is more grim and dangerous than most people realise and that\u2019s problematic.\u201d Vertessy told Guardian Australia he had never been directed by a minister to \u201crefrain from public commentary on climate change or even tone down my style\u201d but there were \u201cvarious cues that you get to calibrate your approach\u201d. \u201cNonetheless you do come to understand you can\u2019t just go out there and keep creating heat in the media environment for the government, because that backfires on your agency,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best-case scenario then is you are frozen out and not consulted. The worst case is you are punished by being overlooked in future budgets. It is all very unspoken and, dare I say it, grey and shadowy.\u201d He said public servants \u201cunderstand and accept that it is verboten [forbidden] to criticise government policies\u201d but at the science-policy interface \u201cthere is some grey area when it comes to public comment\u201d. Reporting scientific facts was uncontentious, he said, but if doing that \u201cinvokes media and public criticism of government policies\u201d then friction arises \u201cand this is certainly common in the area of climate change\u201d. The Meteorology Act established the role of the bureau and its director but it predates concerns about climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s uncontentious that weather and forecasts is core business,\u201d Vertessy said. \u201cBut there\u2019s less formal direction when it comes to climate. When it comes to climate change, a mandate for being the voice for it is not reflected in the 1955 act.\u201d Instead, Vertessy said, governments, ministers and the bureau\u2019s director of meteorology (which is the title of the chief executive) \u201chave had degrees of discretion about whether [the bureau] is in that game or not\u201d. Vertessy said there had \u201cprobably been a greater appetite for senior officials to hold forth on climate change with progressive governments than conservative ones\u201d. \u201cMy sense is that the current government is more welcoming of expert opinion on climate change matters as it seeks to build community support for policy action,\u201d he said."

            "title": "Cross country skiers given cold shoulder as Falls Creek climate change planning sparks trail row",
            "date": "2022-10-15T19:00:15Z",
            "content": "Paul Gray knows better than most what\u2019s at stake if a world-renowned cross-country ski trail becomes collateral damage in a bid to boost year-round tourism at Falls Creek. As a boy, Gray and his brothers would get up early on Fridays to nab the best set of hire skis from the high school at Mount Beauty, before spending their weekends out on the north-east Victorian resort\u2019s extensive network of sheltered trails. It was on this nurturing ground that Gray was able to hone his skills, eventually becoming a two-time Olympian and the first Australian to win the Kangaroo Hoppet, the country\u2019s premier long-distance cross-country ski race. \u201cFalls Creek has been a huge part of my life for a long time,\u201d Gray, now 53, says. \u201cIf they clear the road we lose what makes this place special.\u201d \u201cThe road\u201d is Bogong High Plains (BHP) Road, which climbs from Mount Beauty up to the Victorian government-owned and managed ski resort of Falls Creek. In winter, the road beyond the alpine village out to the high plains is closed to traffic, forming a key part of a free network of cross-country ski trails. But in June, the resort announced plans to start clearing snow next year from a 1.2km stretch to allow cars and shuttle buses to reach a major new development near Rocky Valley Lake. The decision sparked anger among some residents, who warn it will lay waste to Falls Creek\u2019s reputation as Australia\u2019s home of cross-country skiing. Meanwhile, business operators hope the development will offer protection against the impending impacts of climate change on resort trade. \u2018Bombshell\u2019 announcement Down at the resort\u2019s lakeside precinct, the views are spectacular across the Bogong High Plains but there are no facilities apart from some kayaks and paddle boards for hire in summer. To address this, the 2016 Falls Creek master plan identified the area as a base for \u201cgreen season\u201d leisure activities. So when Falls Creek Resort Management (FCRM) announced $3.5m in funding for the \u201cLakeside Development Project\u201d \u2013 with $2.5m for \u201cwater sport activation\u201d \u2013 there was an expectation for a summer project that would shield the village from a diminishing ski season and other economic effects of climate change. However, FCRM then announced the project \u2013 which will upgrade the historic Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition shed into a large new cafe with a lookout deck, and build 100 new car spaces \u2013 would operate year-round, requiring a major section of the Bogong High Plains Road to be cleared to allow winter access. \u201cI was at the initial meeting when the bombshell about road clearing in 2023 was announced,\u201d Birkebeiner Nordic Ski Club secretary Ronice Goebel says. \u201cThe club has had no communication since. This is a sorry business given the connection and sense of place many locals have for Falls Creek.\u201d \u2018Main artery\u2019 of trail network After moving to Melbourne to study, Gray returned to Mount Beauty 13 years ago with his wife and two daughters. They are now heavily involved in volunteer coaching of young skiers, passing on Gray\u2019s skills and passion to the next generation. He says while Falls Creek has an extensive network of cross-country trails, what sets it apart from other resorts is the sheltered terrain created by the road network, of which BHP Road is the \u201cmain artery\u201d. This is where beginners and school groups spend all their time, Gray says. Clearing 1.2km of road actually impacts about 4km of flat, protected terrain which is \u201cmassive for a beginner\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ll take 1.2km away from Wombat\u2019s Ramble, you\u2019ve got all the rest of the mountain to ski on\u2019. It doesn\u2019t work that way. This is the main artery, the whole system\u2019s based around this part of BHP Road, so we lose all the interconnecting trails.\u201d Planning for the impacts of climate change Both the FCRM and the board declined requests for an interview, however in an emailed statement, chief executive Stuart Smythe said the Falls Creek master plan clearly referenced year-round activation and increased commercial operations \u201cthroughout the entire document\u201d. The year-round activation of the lakeside precinct is supported by business operators, according to the Falls Creek Chamber of Commerce president, Lisa Logan. \u201cWe know there is more interest in coming to Falls Creek outside of winter but also the aspect over the lake would be a great thing to open up during the winter time,\u201d Logan says. She says the area\u2019s close proximity to the ski lifts on the south-facing slopes would be an advantage, as the north face struggles to hold enough snow in a warming climate. \u201cThen we can see some more longevity in terms of what offerings the village can make,\u201d she says. Tawonga South resident Jonathan Spring is an avid cross-country and downhill skier and cyclist who visits Falls Creek with his family throughout winter. Spring says there is public concern that summer season activation is being used as a Trojan horse by FCRM to establish additional winter car parking, while green season activation is secondary. He points to an email from FCRM to a community member which states that over time climate change will make the north-facing slopes unviable for skiing and the southern-facing slopes will become \u201cincreasingly important to the long-term viability of the resort\u201d. The email goes on to say: \u201cThis will similarly necessitate a requirement to provide day parking in the vicinity and the potential for new lifting infrastructure in this area.\u201d Spring says: \u201cThe addition of winter car parking to this project, with the associated road clearing, is not part of the master plan.\u201d The cost of speaking up Tawonga South resident Ben Derrick is leading the campaign to stop the road clearing as president of Cross Country Skiing Association Victoria. As a former resort employee for 14 years, Derrick delivered the 2016 master plan as director of economic development. He maintains it was not the plan to develop winter day parking, or any kind of lifted infrastructure, or any kind of satellite commercial infrastructure out by the lake. While acknowledging climate change will impact the resort, he questioned the use of it to justify the plan to clear BHP Road. \u201cIf there\u2019s no front side skiing then all you need to do is just get people over to the back of the resort, you don\u2019t need to put a whacking great carpark out by the lake and increase the development footprint of the resort,\u201d he said. Derrick was in August sent \u201ccease and desist\u201d letters from a legal firm representing the FCRM board. The letters accuse him of breaching his employment agreement and spreading misinformation in what he maintains is \u201ca legitimate, peaceful and transparent\u201d public campaign to oppose the proposed lakeside development. He believes citizens should be free to criticise public servants without fear of being sued. \u201cIt\u2019s really offensive to get notifications like I\u2019ve done something legally wrong, when all I\u2019ve done is stand up for the community, and stand up for the industry as well, so they don\u2019t make poor decisions like this,\u201d Derrick says. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep at night, my wife didn\u2019t sleep, we were just waiting for the next instalment to come back.\u201d FCRM declined to respond to questions about the legal threats. Complicating matters is a state government overhaul that means the FCRM board ceased to exist on 30 September, replaced by Alpine Resorts Victoria \u2013 the new centralised governing body of Victoria\u2019s alpine resorts from 1 October. Before its tenure ended, the FCRM board clarified it had \u201cnot made a decision with respect to clearing snow from the road and will not be doing so in its remaining term\u201d. In the meantime, Gray plans to continue fighting for a sport he loves. \u201cI\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll value what we have here,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose the beauty of Falls Creek.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-10-18T09:00:03Z",
            "content": "We cannot shield children from history. In Ukraine, millions of families have lost their homes to Vladimir Putin\u2019s war. In Delhi, record shattering temperatures of 50C saw kids locked inside this summer, unable to study or play. Global food prices are soaring, causing children all over the world to go hungry. So, surely it is inevitable that the next generation want to confront the big questions: why are there wars? What is our place in nature? What is money and why is it so important? Often, children take these questions far more seriously than grownups. They question things that adults take for granted. Adults might find it annoying when a child replies \u201cwhy?\u201d to our every answer. But typically, the child is just trying to get to the bottom of things in a way that adults have long stopped doing. Another thing we cannot shield children from is exposure to false historical narrative. From a very early age, the young are bombarded with myths and disinformation, not just about current events, but also about the basic storyline of humanity itself \u2013 who we are, where we come from and how we got here. In my home country of Israel, for example, even secular schoolchildren typically learn about the Garden of Eden and see colourful images of Noah\u2019s Ark long before they hear about Neanderthals or see the cave art of Lascaux and Sulawesi. This has an impact. It\u2019s possible to trace a direct line from the Genesis decree of \u201cfill the earth and subdue it\u201d to the Industrial Revolution and today\u2019s ecological crisis. Another direct line of influence can be drawn from the historical narratives Russian children learn in school, to Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing global food crisis. If we abandon children to myths, unlearning these ideas later in life is a difficult, sometimes impossible, task. It\u2019s vital we talk with kids openly about the big issues in a responsible, scientific way based on evidence, rather than dogmatic faith. This is a challenge I myself have wrestled with recently when writing the history of the world for children. What I\u2019ve learned from this project is that addressing the big issues for children is a delicate job. Some subjects are fun, like exploring the daily lives of stone age hunter-gatherers, when people lived in the wild and kids spent their days learning to climb trees, track animals and make fire. But other subjects are more challenging. Examining what happened when ancient Sapiens met Neanderthals, for example, leads us to discuss what life might have been like for a child with a Sapiens mother and a Neanderthal father, bringing up subjects such as racism, war, genocide and extinction. It\u2019s crucial to talk about the dark side of history, but how do we avoid paralysing children with fear? One guiding principle is that we should wait to share explicit descriptions of horrors until the listener is mature enough to handle them. Instead, when dealing with calamities and injustices, it is best to emphasise agency: no matter how terrible things are, people can usually make a change for the better. That\u2019s not wishful thinking, but the very essence of history. After all, history is not the study of the past, or simply a list of wars and disasters and dead kings who ruled thousands of years ago. History is the study of how things change. If we think the world has always been the same, and that how we live now is the only way for humans to live, then it\u2019s natural to feel that change is impossible and that the problems we face are unsolvable. Even if things are very unfair, what can we do? That\u2019s just how the world is, we tell ourselves. But by studying history we learn that humans didn\u2019t always live like we do, and that the world is changing all the time. People made the world what it is \u2013 and people can therefore change it. Of course, that\u2019s no easy task, but it\u2019s been done many times before. That\u2019s why history is so powerful. It is the key to changing the world. So much so that, in many places, governments are afraid of history. Leaders seldom ban people from learning mathematics or physics. But many governments forbid people \u2013 and especially young people \u2013 from learning at least certain parts of history. It all goes back to those dead kings who ruled thousands of years ago, their icy hands reaching out from beyond the grave to grasp our minds and freeze change. After all, it was those long-dead kings who invented and spread various stories about gods, nations, money and love that so many people today still believe and adhere to. To gain some freedom from these narratives and behave differently we need to understand how they were created and spread in the first place. Otherwise, we will never see them for what they are: just stories. Children asking \u201cwhy?\u201d are a powerful force that can rock these old tales to their foundations. But in addition to avoiding terror, we should also be careful to avoid burdening the young with our own responsibilities. The oldest sin in the grownup\u2019s playbook is to expect kids to take on our projects, and in particular, to solve the problems we want solved \u2013 but haven\u2019t figured out how. When talking with children about big issues, we should, every now and then, ask ourselves why we are really doing it. Every person in the world carries a heavy burden. When we teach history to young people, we sometimes do it in order to shift some of our burden on to the shoulders of the next generation. We want the young to keep carrying the beliefs, the memories, the identities and the conflicts that have weighed on us throughout our lives. \u201cHere, kid, I carried these things up to this point \u2013 now it\u2019s your turn!\u201d That\u2019s unfair. A far better reason to teach history is to help liberate kids from at least some of their fears, illusions and hatreds. \u201cSee these things, kid? I got stuck with them for years, and they made me miserable. Be careful! You don\u2019t have to pick them up, too!\u201d I hope history becomes a tool to free people rather than bind them. A tool to forge new concords rather than perpetuate old conflicts. After all, the point of learning history is not to remember the past, but to be liberated from it.

            "content": "The government has a crucial opportunity to help people find ways to save energy as heating and power bills rise significantly this autumn and winter. That is the key message from experts urging the government to intervene with campaigns that would provide guidance on how to cut energy bills. \u201cWe have a great window of opportunity,\u201d said Professor Lorraine Whitmarsh, director of Bath University\u2019s Centre for Climate Change &amp; Social Transformations. \u201cLots of things influence people\u2019s decisions about energy use. Financial considerations are definitely one. So telling people directly how they can save money and putting specific sums to actions is going to be more effective than talking in relatively abstract terms about cost saving.\u201d Whitmarsh stressed that people are now very focused on rising energy costs and likely to be highly receptive to suggestions on how to save power. \u201cIn addition, some measures \u2013 like improving insulation \u2013 may take time to implement, so we need to act now.\u201d Whitmarsh highlighted two previous campaigns that had differing impacts on changing people\u2019s behaviour: getting them to eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, and the strategy to put calorie information on restaurant menus. \u201cThe five-a-day campaign has been relatively ineffective because it did not target people when they were actually making decisions to buy food,\u201d she said. \u201cThey may have read about the value of eating fruit and veg but when in a supermarket many other factors \u2013 price, taste and other issues \u2013 confuse their choices. \u201cBy contrast, putting calorie data on menus provided key information at just the right time \u2013 when a person is about to choose what she or he wants to eat. In short, timing is crucial.\u201d Using smart meters to monitor electricity use when boiling a kettle or using an oven would therefore give the same kind of immediate feedback that will be crucial in cutting bills. \u201cOn the other hand, letting people know that by simply using the minimum amount of water in a kettle \u2013 instead of boiling a full one every time you want a cup of tea \u2013 makes a difference to your bills.\u201d Whitmarsh is very critical of the government\u2019s decision not to launch any energy-saving campaigns. \u201cOffering advice is the very minimum the government should be doing. In fact, they should be going much further and giving significant discounts on insulation and things like that. \u201cPeople expect leadership from ministers, and if they don\u2019t provide that it suggests the government is not really taking this issue seriously, so why should the public bother?\u201d"

            "title": "Carbon emissions from energy to peak in 2025 in \u2018historic turning point\u2019, says IEA",
            "date": "2022-10-27T07:49:34Z",
            "content": "Global carbon emissions from energy will peak in 2025 thanks to massively increased government spending on clean fuels in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, according to analysis by the world\u2019s leading energy organisation. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said that government spending on clean energy in response to the crisis would mark a \u201chistoric turning point\u201d in the transition away from fossil fuels, in its annual report on global energy. The invasion of Ukraine has prompted an energy crisis around the world, with global gas prices initially surging. The crisis has caused steep inflation that has made households poorer around the world. Governments have been scrambling to find other sources of energy. Some analysts have questioned whether fears over energy security could lead to the use of fossil fuels for longer, slowing the world\u2019s race to net zero carbon emissions. Some countries \u2013 including the US and the UK under previous prime minister Liz Truss \u2013 have pledged to encourage fossil fuel extraction to try to ease prices. However, Fatih Birol, the IEA\u2019s executive director and one of the world\u2019s most influential energy economists, said the energy crisis caused by Russia\u2019s invasion \u201cis in fact going to accelerate the clean energy transition\u201d. The IEA said planned investments in green energy in response to the crisis meant that \u2013 for the first time \u2013 government policies would lead to demand for polluting fossil fuels peaking this decade. The agency cited notable contributions from the US Inflation Reduction Act, the EU\u2019s emissions reduction package, and actions by Japan, South Korea, China and India. Under the new plans investment in low-carbon energy such as solar, wind and nuclear power will rise to $2tn (\u00a31.7tn) a year by 2030, an increase of more than 50% from today. However, annual clean energy investment would have to reach $4tn by 2030 to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, a figure that illustrates the scale of the challenge facing governments around the world. The IEA analysis showed that current government policies would still lead to global temperatures rising by 2.5C, which would have catastrophic climate impacts. That would be far above the target of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The 1.5C target, agreed at the Paris climate conference, would prevent the worst effects of climate breakdown. The analysis adds to a consensus among scientists that governments are not doing enough to prevent climate disaster. A separate UN study, published on Wednesday, also found that government pledges so far to cut emissions will lead to 2.5C of heating. The wave of clean energy investment will also cost Russia $1tn in lost fossil fuel revenues by 2030 compared with before the invasion, Birol said. Russia, previously the world\u2019s largest exporter of fossil fuels, would have a \u201cmuch diminished role in international energy affairs\u201d as the world\u2019s reliance on burning methane gas for power falls, he added. \u201cThe golden age of gas is approaching the end,\u201d Birol said. Birol said the crisis had not changed the IEA\u2019s assessment, first published last year, that all new fossil fuel projects should stop immediately in order for the world to hit net zero emissions by 2050. New oil and gas extraction projects \u201cwill jeopardise our climate goals\u201d, he said. He also dismissed criticism from some climate deniers that spending on clean energy had contributed to higher energy prices, saying that argument was \u201chiding who sparked the energy crisis, which is Russia\u201d. The IEA found that higher shares of renewable energy were correlated with lower electricity prices. \u201cNone of the government leaders complained about too much clean energy,\u201d Birol said. \u201cThey complain that they don\u2019t have enough clean energy.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-10-10T04:11:36Z",
            "content": "The biggest generator of Australian carbon credits has joined critics in calling for a revamp of the scheme\u2019s governance, saying it has \u201cfundamental problems\u201d. GreenCollar, which describes itself as the country\u2019s largest environmental markets investor, natural resource manager and conservation-for-profit organisation, has made a joint submission to a government review of the carbon credit system with academics including Prof Andrew Macintosh, who used to be responsible for the scheme\u2019s integrity. The submission stresses they do not agree on all points and support the use of carbon offsets to help a \u201ctimely transition to a low carbon economy\u201d. But both believe the scheme needs to be overhauled to improve measurement of how much carbon dioxide is being drawn from the atmosphere and stored in vegetation, and to improve the governance of the system overseen by the Clean Energy Regulator. It is the biggest intervention to date by a major player in the carbon credit market supporting calls for changes in how it operates. It follows several companies that run projects to cut emissions from landfill sites backing analysis by Macintosh and his colleagues that the system was generating meaningless credits and resulted in emissions increasing. Macintosh, an environment law and policy professor and the former head of the government\u2019s Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee, said in March the growing carbon credit market was \u201clargely a sham\u201d and a fraud on taxpayers and the environment, as regulation failures meant up to 80% credits approved might not represent real or new cuts in emissions. GreenCollar\u2019s chief executive, James Schultz, said the company did not agree with that, but had long called for changes to strengthen the scheme. He said he was confident his company\u2019s projects regrowing native forests in cleared areas were generating real emissions reductions, but there were issues with measurement and integrity that should be addressed. \u201cWe\u2019ve agreed with a lot of the criticisms and we were on the record on most of this stuff before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t agree with it all, but we agree with a lot.\u201d The joint submission said both parties had deep experience in carbon and environmental markets and supported the use of carbon offsets, preferably in conjunction with an effective carbon pricing scheme. Both said land-based projects could also have environmental and social benefits, including improving biodiversity and employment in regional areas. But they identified three \u201cfundamental problems\u201d. First, they said the legislation overseeing carbon credits, which was relaxed under the Coalition, did not ensure all methods used to create carbon offsets met high integrity standards. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Second, the two parties said the Clean Energy Regulator had too many roles and was potentially conflicted, and called for its powers to advise government and prepare methods under which carbon credits were created to be given to other agencies. Third, they said the model used to estimate how much carbon dioxide was stored in regenerating forests was not calibrated for use in areas that already had significant amounts of vegetation and could lead to overestimation of emissions reductions. GreenCollar said this could be addressed by excluding areas with more than 5% of their maximum vegetation and using direct measurement, not modelling. The academics said direct measurement would be better, but argued it would be \u201cchallenging and risky\u201d to do it in a way that ensured growth was due to changes in management and not just rainfall. They said it would be better if uncleared rangelands were restored through biodiversity markets and straight payments for stewardship of the land, not carbon credits. Macintosh said the joint statement \u201creflected very well\u201d on GreenCollar and, after the statement by major landfill gas project owners, was the latest in a string of big players that \u201chad the courage and character\u201d to publicly acknowledge change was needed. He said it reflected \u201cvery poorly\u201d on the Clean Energy Regulator and the Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee. \u201cThere really is no argument now for the government not to act,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know there are multiple other market participants and scientists that agree with what we are saying and what GreenCollar is now saying. It is now time for them to lend their voices to the calls for change.\u201d The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has said carbon credits were vital to reduce emissions and appointed a former chief scientist, Prof Ian Chubb, to oversee a review of the system. The Clean Energy Regulator has rejected the criticisms. In a statement in June, the regulator and the Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee said Macintosh and his colleagues had failed to present robust evidence of a lack of integrity in the system and \u2013 as the precise areas of land where carbon credit projects took place could not be released due to legal restrictions \u2013 had based their analysis on an incomplete dataset. Chubb is due to report back by the end of the year."

            "content": "A legal challenge has been launched against a road scheme that opponents say clashes with climate goals. Changes aimed at improving car journeys between Milton Keynes and Cambridge by upgrading junctions and building a 10-mile dual carriageway on the A428 between Black Cat and Caxton Gibbet were approved in the summer. The scheme, estimated to cost \u00a3810m-\u00a3950m, is listed in the government\u2019s growth plan for accelerated delivery. But Transport Action Network (TAN) filed for judicial review at the end of September, arguing the Department for Transport (DfT) was wrong to only assess emissions from the scheme against the national carbon budget. Instead, the climate campaign group points to professional guidance from the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment, which recommends using sectoral, regional and local carbon budgets to contextualise a project\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Regional targets set by England\u2019s Economic Heartland, a subnational transport body, are to reach net zero by 2040 and achieve a 5% cut in car traffic by 2030. These are tighter than any national ambition. \u201cIf you look at local carbon budgets, very often you see the increases caused by the roads consumes quite a substantial proportion,\u201d said TAN\u2019s founder, Chris Todd. \u201cAnd that shows that these roads are not sustainable.\u201d National Highways\u2019 figures submitted during examination of the A428 scheme show it would generate 3.5m tonnes of extra carbon emissions during construction and from the extra traffic. That makes it the third most polluting of the 50 planned road schemes. TAN is also challenging the broader need for the project. Todd said it was \u201cmadness\u201d to be investing in roads that increase traffic in a climate emergency. \u201cWhat we are trying to get the government to accept by challenging these sorts of schemes is that you can\u2019t just keep deferring making the changes to a future date. In an emergency, you have got to tackle things now.\u201d It is not the only roads project under scrutiny. Andrew Boswell, a retired computer scientist and climate activist, has filed two lawsuits against road-building schemes in his home county of Norfolk over the past two months. They relate to existing stretches of the A47 that are being turned into dual carriageways: North Tuddenham to Easton, and Blofield to North Burlingham. The works are part of four road projects planned within 10 miles of Norwich over the next four years. Boswell says the government should not have given consent to National Highways for either project, because it failed to properly assess the cumulative impact on carbon emissions they would have in combination with other nearby road schemes. \u201cWhen you take individual schemes in isolation, you\u2019re only looking at the incremental increases in traffic that that scheme makes,\u201d Boswell said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an ideal situation here where you should do a cumulative [carbon] assessment \u2026 but they have gone to every length to salami-slice it and look at each scheme\u2019s emissions separately.\u201d Boswell is being represented by some of the lawyers who successfully took the government to court on its net zero strategy this year. He sees his lawsuit as a test case for other places where multiple road schemes are being developed in the same area. Last year, development consent for expansion of the A38 in Derby was quashed by the high court after campaigners made a similar legal challenge. The transport secretary at the time, Grant Shapps, was forced to admit that his decision to approve the scheme failed to provide a reasoned conclusion on its cumulative climate impacts with other road schemes in meeting the UK\u2019s national climate targets. The government is now redetermining the scheme. TAN also previously challenged the government over RIS2, its \u201clargest ever\u201d road investment strategy to date, arguing it did not take national climate goals into account. Although unsuccessful, the court judgment said there was \u201cno reason\u201d the impact of individual schemes on the latest and most ambitious carbon budgets \u201cmay not be taken into account\u201d. Another lawsuit challenging the government\u2019s national policy statement on roads revealed Shapps overrode official advice to review it on environmental grounds. That statement is under review. The DfT would not comment on ongoing legal proceedings but a spokesperson said the department had made ambitious pledges to achieve net zero transport and better connect communities. \u201cThis includes plans to decarbonise road vehicles, boost public transport and active travel and cut carbon from road construction, maintenance and operations.\u201d Stephen Elderkin, the director of environmental sustainability at National Highways, said the organisation believed its net zero highways plans were \u201cambitious and credible\u201d. He added: \u201cIt charts a detailed pathway to net zero, given the influence National Highways has and the national context.\u201d However, these are unlikely to be the last legal challenges. Approval for changes to the A303, including a tunnel near Stonehenge, was successfully challenged in the high court last year but campaigners say they are willing to return to court if and when the scheme is resurrected."

            "content": "There is \u201cno credible pathway to 1.5C in place\u201d, the UN\u2019s environment agency has said, and the failure to reduce carbon emissions means the only way to limit the worst impacts of the climate crisis is a \u201crapid transformation of societies\u201d. The UN environment report analysed the gap between the CO2 cuts pledged by countries and the cuts needed to limit any rise in global temperature to 1.5C, the internationally agreed target. Progress has been \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d it concluded. Current pledges for action by 2030, if delivered in full, would mean a rise in global heating of about 2.5C and catastrophic extreme weather around the world. A rise of 1C to date has caused climate disasters in locations from Pakistan to Puerto Rico. If the long-term pledges by countries to hit net zero emissions by 2050 were delivered, global temperature would rise by 1.8C. But the glacial pace of action means meeting even this temperature limit was not credible, the UN report said. Countries agreed at the Cop26 climate summit a year ago to increase their pledges. But with Cop27 looming, only a couple of dozen have done so and the new pledges would shave just 1% off emissions in 2030. Global emissions must fall by almost 50% by that date to keep the 1.5C target alive. Inger Andersen, the executive director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), said: \u201cThis report tells us in cold scientific terms what nature has been telling us all year through deadly floods, storms and raging fires: we have to stop filling our atmosphere with greenhouse gases, and stop doing it fast. \u201cWe had our chance to make incremental changes, but that time is over. Only a root-and-branch transformation of our economies and societies can save us from accelerating climate disaster. \u201cIt is a tall, and some would say impossible, order to reform the global economy and almost halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, but we must try,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery fraction of a degree matters: to vulnerable communities, to ecosystems, and to every one of us.\u201d Andersen said action would also bring cleaner air, green jobs and access to electricity for millions. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said: \u201cEmissions remain at dangerous and record highs and are still rising. We must close the emissions gap before climate catastrophe closes in on us all.\u201d Prof David King, a former UK chief scientific adviser, said: \u201cThe report is a dire warning to all countries \u2013 none of whom are doing anywhere near enough to manage the climate emergency.\u201d The report found that existing carbon-cutting policies would cause 2.8C of warming, while pledged policies cut this to 2.6C. Further pledges, dependent on funding flowing from richer to poorer countries, cut this again to 2.4C. New reports from the International Energy Agency and the UN\u2019s climate body reached similarly stark conclusions, with the latter finding that the national pledges barely cut projected emissions in 2030 at all, compared with 2019 levels. The UNEP report said the required societal transformation could be achieved through government action, including on regulation and taxes, redirecting the international financial system, and changes to consumer behaviour. It said the transition to green electricity, transport and buildings was under way, but needed to move faster. All sectors had to avoid locking in new fossil fuel infrastructure, contrary to plans in many countries, including the UK, to develop new oil and gas fields. A study published this week found \u201clarge consensus\u201d across all published research that new oil and gas fields are \u201cincompatible\u201d with the 1.5C target. The UNEP report said about a third of climate-heating emissions came from the global food system and these were set to double by 2050. But the sector could be transformed if governments changed farm subsidies \u2013 which are overwhelmingly harmful to the environment \u2013 and food taxes, cut food waste and helped develop new low-carbon foods. Individual citizens could adopt greener, healthier diets as well, the report said. Andersen said: \u201cI\u2019m not preaching one diet over another, but we need to be mindful that if we all want steak every night for dinner, it won\u2019t compute.\u201d Redirecting global financial flows to green investments was vital, the report said. Most financial groups had shown limited action to date, despite their stated intentions, due to short-term interests, it said. A transformation to a low-emissions economy was expected to need at least $4tn-6tn a year in investment, the report said, about 2% of global financial assets. Despite Andersen\u2019s doubts that the necessary emission cuts can be made by 2030, she pointed to the plummeting costs of renewables, the rollout of electric transport, major climate legislation in the US, and moves by pension funds to back low-carbon investments. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to be the ever hopeful person, but [also] to be the realistic optimist,\u201d she said. \u201c[This report] is the mirror that we\u2019re holding up to the world. Obviously, I want to be proven wrong and see countries taking ambitious steps. But so far, that\u2019s not what we\u2019ve seen.\u201d"

            "content": "The climate crisis has reached a \u201creally bleak moment\u201d, one of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists has said, after a slew of major reports laid bare how close the planet is to catastrophe. Collective action is needed by the world\u2019s nations more now than at any point since the second world war to avoid climate tipping points, Prof Johan Rockstr\u00f6m said, but geopolitical tensions are at a high. He said the world was coming \u201cvery, very close to irreversible changes \u2026 time is really running out very, very fast\u201d. Emissions must fall by about half by 2030 to meet the internationally agreed target of 1.5C of heating but are still rising, the reports showed \u2013 at a time when oil giants are making astronomical amounts of money. On Thursday, Shell and TotalEnergies both doubled their quarterly profits to about $10bn. Oil and gas giants have enjoyed soaring profits as post-Covid demand jumps and after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The sector is expected to amass $4tn in 2022, strengthening calls for heavy windfall taxes to address the cost of living crisis and fund the clean energy transition. All three of the key UN agencies have produced damning reports in the last two days. The UN environment agency\u2019s report found there was \u201cno credible pathway to 1.5C in place\u201d and that \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d progress on cutting carbon emissions means the only way to limit the worst impacts of the climate crisis is a \u201crapid transformation of societies\u201d. Current pledges for action by 2030, even if delivered in full, would mean a rise in global heating of about 2.5C, a level that would condemn the world to catastrophic climate breakdown, according to the UN\u2019s climate agency. Only a handful of countries have ramped up their plans in the last year, despite having promised to do so at the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow last November. The UN\u2019s meteorological agency reported that all the main heating gases hit record highs in 2021, with an alarming surge in emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Separately, the IEA\u2019s world energy report offered a glimmer of progress, that CO2 from fossil fuels could peak by 2025 as high energy prices push nations towards clean energy, though it warned that it would not be enough to avoid severe climate impacts. Rockstr\u00f6m, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a really bleak moment, not only because of the reports showing that emissions are still rising, so we\u2019re not delivering on either the Paris or Glasgow climate agreements, but we also have so much scientific evidence that we are very, very close to irreversible changes \u2013 we\u2019re coming closer to tipping points.\u201d Research by Rockstr\u00f6m and colleagues, published in September, found five dangerous climate tipping points may already have been passed due to the global heating caused by humanity to date, including the collapse of Greenland\u2019s ice cap, with another five possible with 1.5C of heating. \u201cFurthermore, the world is unfortunately in a geopolitically unstable state,\u201d said Rockstr\u00f6m. \u201cSo when we need collective action at the global level, probably more than ever since the second world war, to keep the planet stable, we have an all-time low in terms of our ability to collectively act together.\u201d \u201cTime is really running out very, very fast,\u201d he said. \u201cI must say, in my professional life as a climate scientist, this is a low point. The window for 1.5C is shutting as I speak, so it\u2019s really tough.\u201d His remarks came after the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said on Wednesday that climate action was \u201cfalling pitifully short\u201d. \u201cWe are headed for a global catastrophe [and] for economy-destroying levels of global heating.\u201d He added: \u201cDroughts, floods, storms and wildfires are devastating lives and livelihoods across the globe [and] getting worse by the day. We need climate action on all fronts and we need it now.\u201d He said the G20 nations, responsible for 80% of emissions, must lead the way. Inger Andersen, head of the UN environment programme (UNEP), told the Guardian that the energy crisis must be used to speed up delivery of a low-carbon economy: \u201cWe are in danger of missing the opportunity and a crisis is a terrible thing to waste.\u201d Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, at the University of East Anglia, UK, said: \u201cIt is fundamental to avoid cascading risks that responses to existing crises are made in a way that limits climate change to the lowest possible level.\u201d Further reports published in the last two days said the health of the world\u2019s people is at the mercy of a global addiction to fossil fuels, with increasing heat deaths, hunger and infectious disease as the climate crisis intensifies. In the UK, the government was accused of a \u201csevere dereliction of duty\u201d in leaving critical UK infrastructure at risk to climate impacts. The new prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will not attend COP27, his spokesman said on Wednesday. High gas and oil prices delivered huge profits to Shell and TotalEnergies on Wednesday, which booked $9.5bn and $9.9bn respectively. Shell said it would not pay any UK-imposed windfall tax this year as the profits were being offset against investment in North Sea fields. The fossil fuel industry as a whole amassed $4tn in 2022, according to another new report from International Energy Agency (IEA), a sum that could otherwise transform climate action. The IEA report said: \u201cNet income for the world\u2019s oil and gas producers is set to double in 2022 to an unprecedented $4tn, a huge $2tn windfall.\u201d The oil and gas sector has gained an average of $1tn a year in unearned profits for the last 50 years. The IEA said clean energy investment would have to be at least $4tn a year by 2030 to hit net zero emissions by mid-century. \u201cIf the global oil and gas industry were to invest this [$2tn] additional income in low\u2010emissions fuels, such as hydrogen and biofuels, it would fund all of the investment needed in these fuels for the remainder of this decade.\u201d Prof Myles Allen, at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cThe combined profits, taxes and royalties generated by the oil and gas industry over the past few months would be enough to capture every single molecule of CO2 produced by their activities and reinject it back underground. So why are we only talking about transforming society and not about obliging a highly profitable industry to clean up the mess caused by the products it sells?\u201d \u201cThe situation is serious and bleak,\u201d said Prof Simon Lewis, at University College London. \u201cShell has made \u00a326bn profit this year, carbon emissions are back at pre-pandemic levels, while 53,000 people died of heat stress in Europe in the summer, and floods have displaced millions from Nigeria to Pakistan. The solution is to do everything we can to defeat the fossil fuel industry \u2013 they stand between us all and a prosperous future.\u201d Rockstr\u00f6m was pessimistic about any breakthrough in the speed of climate action at the Cop27 climate summit, which he said would be dominated by nations such as Pakistan demanding funding to rebuild their countries after climate disasters. Rich, high-emitting nations have long rejected such claims, fearing unlimited liabilities. \u201cThis is a necessary discussion,\u201d Rockstr\u00f6m said. \u201cBut it leads to a deeper rift between the global north and the south. And that\u2019s exactly what we do not need now.\u201d But he said progress could be made within a few years: \u201cThe Ukraine war is the nail in the coffin for the fossil-fuel-driven advanced economies. In the short term, it costs us a lot and we lose speed on climate action.\u201d But in the longer term, he said, the energy and food crises add national security to the planetary and health reasons for climate action. Prof Michael Mann, at the University of Pennsylvania in the US, said it was important to note that progress was being made: \u201cMore work clearly needs to be done if warming is to be kept below 1.5C, but nobody foresaw the major policy progress in recent months in both Australia and the US. It is estimated that the US legislation will lower national emissions by 40% this decade. With US leadership, we can expect other major emitters to now come to the table at Cop27.\u201d Climate experts agree that every action that limits global heating reduces the suffering endured by people from climate impacts. \u201cThe 1.5C target is now near impossible, but every fraction of a degree will equate to massive avoided damages for generations to come,\u201d said Prof Dave Reay, at the University of Edinburgh, UK. R\u00f6ckstrom said: \u201cDespite the fact that the situation is depressing and very challenging, I would strongly advise everyone to act in business or policy or society or science. The deeper we fall into the dark abyss of risk, the more we have to make efforts to climb out of that hole. It\u2019s not as if we don\u2019t know what to do \u2013 it\u2019s rather that we\u2019re not doing what is necessary.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-10-20T10:00:52Z",
            "content": "The US secretary of state visited Silicon Valley this week, on a trip that experts say highlights the Biden administration\u2019s growing concerns over cybersecurity and officials\u2019 push to collaborate more closely with the US\u2019s powerful tech industry. Antony Blinken on Monday spoke at Stanford University and was scheduled to meet with tech executives to \u201chighlight the key role for technology diplomacy in advancing US economic and national security\u201d, according to the state department. The agency shared few other details about the visit, and did not respond to a request for comment. But experts said national security concerns including the growing threat of cyberwar and potential foreign interference in upcoming elections were almost certain to be on the agenda. US administrations have long interfaced with the tech world, but amid the ongoing brutal war in Ukraine, Blinken\u2019s visit comes at \u201can incredibly tense time internationally\u201d, said Theresa Payton, cybersecurity expert and former White House chief information officer. \u201cEvery presidential office since the beginning of the internet has tried to do outreach to Silicon Valley, some more successfully than others,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the war in Ukraine has created a critical tipping point in the need for collaboration.\u201d In the last year, Russian hackers have carried out several cyber-attacks on Ukraine, including one in January that temporarily brought down more than 70 government websites. The scope of Moscow\u2019s cyberwarfare against Ukraine and its allies has been smaller than analysts predicted at the onset of the war, but experts have warned that as the conflict wears on, and Russia\u2019s losing streak on the ground continues, the risk of more comprehensive and catastrophic state-directed cyber-attacks grows. \u201cThe state department is likely considering what Putin\u2019s plan B would be, and attempting to get ahead of it by meeting with Silicon Valley,\u201d Payton said. \u201cThere are concerns that such an attack could wreak havoc internationally as well as on American businesses.\u201d In addition to foreign cyber-attacks, the state department is likely attempting to work with Silicon Valley on solutions to ongoing concerns of election interference, said Joshua Tucker, co-director of the Center for Social Media and Politics at NYU and senior adviser at security solutions firm Kroll. \u201cWith midterms approaching, all eyes are on social media platforms \u2013 not only for the public, but also from policymakers,\u201d he said. Those concerns include cyber-attacks that could interfere with the voting process, including the disruption of voter registration lists or the counting of ballots, as well as coordinated disinformation campaigns like the one mounted by Russia during the 2020 presidential election. Blinken\u2019s trip highlights growing recognition from the government that the private sector plays a crucial role in national security issues, said Glenn Gerstell, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the former general counsel of the National Security Agency. \u201cIn the early days of Silicon Valley, tech operated with relative impunity from government regulations and responsibility,\u201d Gerstell said. But the rise of authoritarian censorship, foreign interference in elections and state-led attacks from countries like Russia and China have underscored the need for more information sharing from the industry, he argued. \u201cTech companies have way more eyes and ears on the ground in terms of cyber presence around the world than governments ever will,\u201d Gerstell said. \u201cBoth sides need each other.\u201d Meanwhile, Blinken\u2019s trip comes at a \u201ccritical time\u201d for the tech industry as cyber risks rise globally, he added. A series of high-profile major hacks in the US in recent years has put a more urgent focus on national cybersecurity. From the hack of the Colonial pipeline in 2021 to the more recent disruptive ransomware attack on the country\u2019s second-largest school district, it has become more clear that the US needs to better prioritize preparedness, said Gerstell. This extends to private businesses, as the number of cyber-attacks increased 31% between 2020 and 2021 alone. \u201cThe government needs the private sector, but the private sector has also realized it needs the government to help,\u201d Gerstell said. \u201cThe bottom line is both sides need to meet each other.\u201d Evidencing the Biden administration\u2019s concern over issues like cybersecurity, the state department this year asked for a 50% increase in its IT budget and created a bureau of cyberspace and digital policy, which will work to \u201cencourage responsible state behavior in cyberspace\u201d and \u201cadvance policies that protect the integrity and security of the infrastructure of the internet\u201d. The department also appointed former Marine Corps officer and cyber executive Nathaniel Fick as its first \u201ccyber ambassador\u201d. In testimony during his Senate approval process, Fick stressed the need to partner with other governments and the private sector to \u201cunderstand how digital technologies can help people exercise their human rights and reach their full potential\u201d. But the state department outreach also comes at a tense time for tech companies in the US. The tech space has for some time seen growing backlash from the public and regulators in regarding its unchecked power, with the majority of Americans saying such companies should be better regulated. Such skepticism of big tech may extend to government collaborations with the industry, said Tucker. \u201cConfidence in tech companies is down, and people are going to be more suspicious of everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a long tradition in the US of being wary of government having too much power to surveil its citizens.\u201d"

            "content": "Germany\u2019s interior minister has sacked the country\u2019s cybersecurity chief, after allegations he had turned a blind eye to a firm with links to Russian security circles. Arne Sch\u00f6nbohm, the president of the German Federal Office for Information Security, was released from his duties with immediate effect on Tuesday, the news magazine Der Spiegel reported, citing security sources. A spokesperson for the interior minister, Nancy Faeser, confirmed that Sch\u00f6nbohm would be barred from his office, as \u201cnecessary public trust in the neutrality and impartiality of his leadership as president of the most important German cybersecurity agency has been damaged\u201d. Sch\u00f6nbohm, who has since 2016 been in charge of the agencies overseeing the government\u2019s computer and communication security, has come under scrutiny after his links to a Russian company in a previous job were highlighted by Jan B\u00f6hmermann, a German comedian, in a late-night satire show. Before heading up the government\u2019s cybersecurity agency, Sch\u00f6nbohm had helped found the similarly named Cyber Security Council Germany, a lobbying group registered as a voluntary association. Among its membership roster, the Cyber Security Council Germany has since 2020 listed a Berlin-based cybersecurity firm, Protelion, previously known as Infotecs, a subsidiary of a Russian company founded by an ex-KGB employee who has received a medal of honour for his services from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. \u201cThe Russian company Infotecs that wants to protect our critical infrastructure from Russian cyber-attacks works with Russian intelligence services,\u201d B\u00f6hmermann said in his programme, expressing incredulity. \u201cRussian agents use Infotecs, which under the name Protelion GmbH sells German companies security software.\u201d While the programme did not allege that Sch\u00f6nbohm had continued to keep close ties with Protelion after becoming the government\u2019s security chief, the revelation raised questions about a key official\u2019s judgment at a time when concerns about the vulnerability of Germany\u2019s critical infrastructure run high. After B\u00f6hmermann\u2019s programme, the Cyber Security Council Germany expelled Protelion from its list of members but rejected allegations of undue Russian influence as \u201cabsurd\u201d. Nonetheless, several companies, including the software firm TeamViewer and energy company E.ON, cancelled their membership of the group. It further emerged that even though Sch\u00f6nbohm had been urged to distance himself from the Cyber Security Council Germany he had co-founded, the cybersecurity chief had appeared at the lobbying association\u2019s 10th anniversary party as recently as early September."

That\u2019s all from us today. We will be back with all the latest news tomorrow. Until then, I hope you have a nice evening. A Victorian man has been charged after an attempted abduction of a woman earlier this year, AAP reports. The 27-year-old Hampton Park man faces a series of sexual assault charges and will face Dandenong magistrates court at a later date. It is alleged the man approached a 36-year-old woman from behind while she was on a walk through Churchill national park late in the afternoon of 18 June. He allegedly grabbed her around the waist and put his hand over her mouth as he tried to drag her to the ground. The woman broke free and ran before calling police. It is alleged a second woman was also assaulted at the same location that same day. The man has been charged with two counts of sexual assault, two counts of assault with intent to commit sexual act and two counts of common law assault. The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations (AFUO) has welcomed the announcement that the Australian government will impose further sanctions on Russia for its war on Ukraine. Stefan Romaniw, AFUO co-chair said: New sanctions and support for Ukraine\u2019s case against Russia with the ICJ are important to ensure Russia is held to account for its brutal and criminal actions in Ukraine. In Ukraine, the reality is the war is ongoing \u2013 civilians and defenders are continuing to die. Only two days ago, civilians were killed and wounded in a Russian strike on a civilian convoy in Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine needs additional military assistance so it can continue to protect its people, liberate occupied areas, and restore its territorial integrity. To date, Australian military aid has been highly valuable. The Australian Bushmaster armoured vehicle played an important role in Ukraine\u2019s successful counter-offensive around Kharkiv. We urge the government to consider more aid of this kind.

The First Lap program has offered $18m in vouchers for swimming lessons during its first year with a $100 voucher for parents of children aged 3 to 6. \u201cNSW families were quick off the blocks, diving in to the First Lap program and redeeming more than 180,000 vouchers for swimming lesson fees in the first year of the program, giving their children vital water safety and survival skills,\u201d Perrottet said. \u201cAs a father, I know how important swimming lessons are and how helpful the First Lap vouchers are for families. \u201cThis program is one of more than 70 ways for households to save and boost their budgets. My message to families is simple \u2013 check to see if you\u2019re eligible for this voucher and redeem it. You\u2019ll save money and could save a life.\u201d The Royal Life Saving Society NSW chief executive, Michael Illinsky, said it was the right of every child to access a quality swimming and water safety education. Learning skills such as general swimming techniques and treading water, survival techniques and strategies, floating and rescue skills is vital for Australian children. The First Lap vouchers help provide many children with their first swimming and water safety experience which in turn leads to a lifetime of fun and enjoyment in, on and around water. First Lap vouchers can be accessed from Service NSW and redeemed with registered providers. A list of First Lap providers is available on the Service NSW website. Can the opposition leader change voters\u2019 minds by pasting on a smile? Peter Dutton can smile again. Not only smile, he can laugh. Crack jokes. Remember birthdays. Have nuanced conversations. He\u2019s not just the Liberal party leader, he\u2019s a family man, an organic farmer. They might be for multimillion-dollar properties, but he has mortgages. In case you hadn\u2019t noticed, Dutton is just like you. Or at least those pushing his image overhaul really hope you think so. Dutton\u2019s role in previous Coalition incarnations was no accident. He came to the parliament ready to fight. His first speech in 2001 made his position clear, as he spoke about his former career in the Queensland police, showing him the best and worst of society. \u201cI have seen the sickening behaviour displayed by people who, frankly, barely justify their existence in our sometimes over tolerant society,\u201d he said. That man now wants to try to win back disillusioned Liberal voters, who voted for more tolerant candidates at the most recent election. For more on the man who would be prime minister, read Guardian Australia political reporter Amy Remeikis\u2019s examination of the best the Coalition have got. Football Australia has released a statement about the behaviour of the crowd at the Australia Cup final between Sydney United and Macarthur on Saturday night in Sydney. Fans were heard to be booing during the welcome to country, with some in the crowd observed to be doing Nazi salutes. Football Australia said there was a record crowd of 16,461 and the evening was \u201cby and large a celebration\u201d but strongly condemned \u201cthe actions of a small minority of individuals who engaged in behaviour that is not consistent with Football Australia\u2019s values and wider community expectations\u201d. Football Australia said eight people were evicted from the match, and footage is now being assessed, including that of members of the crowd doing the Nazi salute. Football Australia said: Football Australia is working closely with the management of CommBank Stadium and NSW Police to determine strong and swift action on any identified anti-social behaviour, which may also be deemed as illegal in the state of NSW. Football Australia also acknowledges that the noise level of the crowd during the welcome to country performed by Erin Wilkins before the commencement of the game reached unacceptable levels. We regret that this occurred and are reviewing all available footage and audio to further analyse the incident. Football Australia said it was working with Wilkins and the Indigenous Advisory Group for guidance on the matter. Football is for all, where there is absolutely no place for anti-social behaviour in our game or the community at large. Football Australia will not let the actions of a few cast a shadow over our great game, which is loved by millions across Australia. Football Australia will be holding discussions with Sydney United 58 FC about the behaviour of certain fans, which could lead to both individual and club sanctions. Australian whistleblower David McBride has weighed into the debate over whether hearings at the federal Icac should be public or private. Man shot and killed by police in Queensland overnight A man has allegedly been killed by police in Queensland overnight after threatening officers with a knife at Airlie Beach. Investigators say the 24-year-old approached two police officers on Shute Harbour Road early on Saturday morning. It\u2019s alleged the man was brandishing a four- to five-centimetre knife as he advanced towards the officers, who drew their weapons and gave some verbal commands. Supt Graeme Paine said officers fired when the man continued to advance and he was fatally injured from the shots. Paine said the officers involved were well trained to identify and respond to different threats. \u201cThe officers have done that. They do go through a process, even when it\u2019s a split-second thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe officers do make an assessment and act based on that assessment.\u201d Paine said police were reviewing CCTV footage of the incident and speaking with several witnesses. They were investigating if the man had been involved in other incidents earlier in the night and why he was allegedly carrying a knife. The man had been working in Townsville but was from Western Australia. Paine said police were also investigating why the man allegedly approached police. A forensic examination of the scene was under way. The shooting will be investigated by the ethical standards command with oversight by the crime and corruption commission. More than 10,000 vocational education and training students have been hit with historical debts after a computer glitch. A system failure resulted in government loans, worth a total of $24.2m, becoming \u201cstuck\u201d in the student payment system, officials say. Most are for amounts under $2,000, but about 3% of students have debts of more than $10,000. The loans became repayable when the beneficiary\u2019s income reached a set threshold, however they were only transferred to Australian Taxation Office accounts after a recent IT update. More than 90% of the loans relate to study in 2017, with a total of 10,252 students impacted. The skills minister, Brendan O\u2019Connor, said in a statement he had instructed his department to conduct an investigation and attempts had been made to individually notify and offer assistance to students. I have been made aware that a number of historical student loans have unexpectedly been applied to students\u2019 ATO profiles. The previous coalition government had student loans held up in its systems for several years after the relevant study was undertaken and we are still discovering and fixing instances of carelessness and incompetence. I am determined to get to the bottom of what happened in this situation. O\u2019Connor said the government would make every effort to put the wellbeing of students first. We understand personal circumstances have to be taken into account and I have directed the department to further investigate the causes of this issue, with a focus on preventing all unfair impacts to current and former students. The minister said the government was also working with the tax office to ensure issues related to older debts were managed fairly. The deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, said the first notices to students were issued on September 12 but the government had been silent on the issue. The minister has significant questions to answer. He has been silent as more than 10,000 students and 100 providers across the country received communications from his department demanding that students pay up in full or face penalties. Ley said it was also possible that some debts might not be legitimate but the onus had been put on students to find out if they qualified for redress measures. \u2013 from AAP Victorian Liberals propose government debt cap if elected A legislated government debt cap will be introduced to stop wasteful spending if the Victorian opposition wins the state election in November. In a joint statement the opposition leader, Matthew Guy, and the shadow treasurer, David Davis, said the Liberal and National parties would include placing a limit on spending to control state debt, which is predicted to hit $167bn by 2025. This is the biggest debt of any state in Australia, and more than New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania combined. The interest bill on Daniel Andrews\u2019 debt will reach more than $6bn by 2025, that\u2019s enough to build six Melton hospitals. The debt cap legislation would prohibit any government from exceeding the legislated maximum without parliamentary approval. The opposition didn\u2019t specify a level for the cap, saying this would be set once an accurate baseline debt level was known. On Friday, Davis contacted the Department of Treasury and Finance requesting an urgent update on Victoria\u2019s balance sheet. Guy previously vowed to ditch the government\u2019s $35bn Suburban Rail Loop and instead pour the money into Victoria\u2019s struggling health system. Last month, a poll for the Age found the premier, Daniel Andrews, maintained a comfortable lead over Guy as preferred premier by 46% to 28%. \u2013 from AAP Police officer charged over alleged sexual assault of child A New South Wales police officer has been arrested and charged with two counts of having sexual intercourse with a child, following an investigation, AAP reports. The 28-year-old probationary constable was apprehended at a home about 7pm on Saturday and taken into custody over allegations of abuse involving a 15-year-old girl. He has been stood down from duties and his employment status is said to be under review after an investigation by the professional standards command. He was refused bail to appear at Parramatta local court on Sunday. Under section 66C of the NSW Crimes Act 1900, any person who has sexual intercourse with a child who is of or above the age of 14 years and under the age of 16 years in circumstances of aggravation is liable to 12 years\u2019 imprisonment. Australian government to address Pfas contamination The Australian federal government has released the third version of its national plan to manage environment risks in Australia such as contamination from toxic, long-lived \u201cforever chemicals\u201d such as Pfas. After more than 50 years of broad use, in everything from food packaging and cookware to paint and industrial products, Pfas chemicals are now ubiquitous. Less than a fortnight ago, a team of researchers announced Pfas chemicals were detected in all of the 30,000 umbilical cord blood samples used in 40 different studies over the last five years. Scientists say governments must make sure Pfas chemicals are not in products to begin with. The head of plastics and human health at the Minderoo Foundation, Sarah Dunlop, says the current situation is an \u201cafter-the-crime\u201d approach that leaves scientists and governments scrambling to work out what\u2019s out there, in what concentrations, how dangerous it is, how to clean it up, and how to regulate it. \u201cIt should be the other way around,\u201d she says. \u201cThey [chemical producers] should give a full disclosure at the time of the making of the product.\u201d Crucially, she says, that must include the spectra of their chemicals, the fingerprints that allow substances to be traced back to their makers and the right regulatory settings to be held accountable for them. At the moment we have to hit in the dark. Often they don\u2019t provide the spectra ... because it\u2019s proprietary information. The other thing they don\u2019t do is provide the chemical standard, which you use in your measurement techniques to make sure you really know what you are measuring. The federal Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water says it\u2019s working with the states and territories to implement a new standard for the management of industrial chemicals. Australia is also working towards ratifying the listing of the most researched types of Pfas under the international Stockholm Convention, which seeks to guard against long-lived pollutants that accumulate in animals. - with AAP. NSW council votes to rein in Airbnb rentals Randwick City council in Sydney\u2019s east has voted to introduce rate variations for owners operating Airbnb rentals which it says is making housing shortages and affordability worse. The Sydney Morning Herald reports there are 1785 short-term rentals in the Randwick City Council area, but not all these properties were listed with a government registry of short term rentals. Rental prices in the council area have spiked up to 24% over the past 12 months. The decision follows others from Brisbane City council to increase council rates of landlords who rent out their entire property for more than 60 days a year by 50 percent. Other councils charge registration fees for short-term rentals with a 90-day a year cap. However it is unclear whether councils have the authority to charge differential rates in New South Wales. Day two of Conservative Political Action Conference in Sydney Earlier on the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) heard from One Nation\u2019s Mark Latham and his former Sky News colleague Ross Cameron (a session we sadly didn\u2019t catch), British rapper and commentator Zuby and former Labor president/Liberal candidate Warren Mundine. Mundine, the chairman of CPAC, gave a short speech which touched on criticisms of the free sense of political progressives, and called on conservatives to stand up for their traditional values which he claimed were \u201cunder threat\u201d. Mundine, touching again on yesterday\u2019s criticism of the Labor government\u2019s proposed indigenous voice to parliament, claimed \u201cthey want to put unequal rights in the Australian constitution\u201d. He was followed later by Ian Plimer, a geologist and professor emeritus at Melbourne University, who spoke against climate science and claimed human emissions of carbon dioxide did not contribute to climate change. Plimer, in criticising reforms toward renewable energy, told the audience that many solar panels were made by slaves in China If you\u2019re a supporter of solar you must be a supporter of slave labour. We have to attack the morality of the other side. Conservative commentator and teacher Kevin Donnelly is now making a speech against \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d. His speech is titled \u201cI identify as a tree\u201d. Former Liberal senator Amanda Stoker, One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts, and internet talk-show host Alan Jones are among those due to address the conference this afternoon. O\u2019Neil says \u201cwe do not have the right laws\u201d in Australia to manage breaches, as with Optus. Under the previous government, there was a set of laws passed that were meant to be the be all and end all of cybersecurity reform in the country. And the instructions on the labels told me that these laws would provide me with all the powers I would need in a cybersecurity emergency incident. To make sure that we can repair the damage. I can tell you that those laws were absolutely useless to me when the Optus matter came on foot. O\u2019Neil says she\u2019s \u201cnot making any specific directions for reform\u201d but says \u201cI simply know that we do not have the right laws in the country to manage cybersecurity emergency incidents\u201d. What we do need is a federal government that has the laws its fingertips to make sure that we can do things, for example, mandating reporting to customers when the data has been breached within a certain time period. Bill Shorten urges Optus to work with government Shorten is laying it on pretty heavily: We are asking them to a greater transparency, I acknowledge that they had a full-page newspaper ad in the paper on the weekend, but an ad is not a strategy. That is not a plan. We know Optus is trying to do what it can, but having said that it is not enough. It has been 11 days since the breach, it is peculiar that we still cannot identify who, for example, has had to get, who used the Medicare information and number for identification. We don\u2019t need this tomorrow or the next day, we needed it days ago. Now is not a time to listen to the lawyers and the damage-control merchants, now is the time to take the high road and work with us in all areas as they have been doing in some. Ministers call for Optus to be transparent Clare O\u2019Neil: What I would like to say today to Optus\u2019s transparency and accountability is paramount here, it is crucial that everyone who has been affected by the breach is properly notified of that. We would like them to be transparent about the numbers of people who have had specific identity documents compromised, and that information has not yet been provided. Bill Shorten is speaking now and says he would like to \u201creiterate\u201d the call for Optus to ensure full transparency with Australians. Specifically on 27 September, services Australia of the agency wrote to Optus and said that we need to identify full and completely who may have used Medicare information, or other Centrelink information to get their 100 points of data so they could get an Optus plan. We still have not received that information. I understand that Optus is trying to do its best now to fix up some of the problems that have been created. We call upon them to understand that this breach has introduced systemic problems for 10 million Australians in terms of personal identification. Business as usual, motoring along in third or fourth gear is not enough. Cybersecurity minister gives update on Optus data breach The cybersecurity minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, says that she has been advised by the Australian Signals Directorate and the Australian Cybersecurity Centre that they have completed their technical with Optus and that she wishes to thank the company for its cooperation. \u201cI spoke with commissioner Reese this morning, but investigation is progressing well and I will that the federal police provided details about that during the week,\u201d she says. Australian authorities are currently focussed on finding who is responsible for the breach and Optus has contacted the 10,200 whose information has been shared onto the internet. O\u2019Neil urges those people to immediately cancel their cards and begin the process of renewing any identity documents. Federal government considers buy-back scheme for properties in NSW flood zones The federal government is considering a formal proposal to buy back properties in NSW flood zones, treasurer Jim Chalmers said this morning. Chalmers told Sky News that the upcoming federal budget was under pressure, but that the government would consider a NSW request to co-fund the property purchase, reportedly worth hundreds of millions of dollars. He said: We received a formal proposal along these lines towards the end of last week, and we\u2019ll go through it in the usual considered and cooperative way. The people of northern NSW have obviously been through a horrific time when it comes to these natural disasters and the federal government has been there for them under [prime minister] Anthony Albanese\u2018s leadership. So we\u2019ll do what we can, subject to the pretty substantial budget constraints that we have, recognising that the funding of natural disaster relief is one of the big pressures on the budget. He said the October budget would show \u201cthe beginnings\u201d of the government\u2019s multinational tax policy and that there would be other conversations around budget savings. Australia is \u201cnot out of the woods by any measure\u201d on cost of living, Chalmers said. The federal government is not expecting or forecasting a surplus in the forward estimates, he said. Privacy Act to get overhaul in wake of Optus data leak: Dreyfus The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has flagged legislation to overhaul privacy law in Australia in the wake of the Optus data breach will be brought to the parliament before the end of this year. Just over a week and a half after Optus revealed the personal information of 10m of its customers was exposed in one of the largest data breaches in Australia\u2019s history, and Dreyfus said the government\u2019s response to the long-running review of the Privacy Act would contain \u201ctough penalties\u201d and changes to make companies think harder about why they are storing personal information. He said he had yet to hear a reason why Optus had kept data as far back at 2017, and indicated the data should only be collected when opening an account. It comes as Optus has taken out full-page ads in newspapers across the country, and on digital billboards apologising for the breach. Customers are still waiting to hear from Optus as to whether they are part of the 10,000 included in an online drop of records by an alleged attacker earlier this week, and if Optus will be paying to replace their identification documents. The Bureau of Meteorology expects a trough sweeping over Western Australia and the Northern Territory to head east next week bringing more rain for regions of New South Wales that have already endured significant flooding. New South Wales state emergency service says those in the south and central west need to remain should remain vigilant over ongoing flood risk. Ahead of a press conference with Bill Shorten and Clare O\u2019Neil on the latest with the Optus data breach the pair have put out a statement this morning claiming that the telco is not being entirely forthcoming with information. ABC host says two hands are often needed for big knobs. ABC News presenter Fauziah Ibrahim offered the candid insight while speaking with Associate Prof Alice Motion from the University of Sydney about the biggest science stories of the week. After a discussion about an anti-malaria drug that developed from traditional Chinese medicine and reports suggesting dogs can smell when a human is stressed, the interview turned to the discussion of the Ig Nobel prize, a satirical science prize for unexpectedly interesting research. This year the prize was won by a Japanese scientist who investigated the optimal physics for opening a doorknob, leading to the following exchange: Motion: The summary is that the bigger the doorknob, the more fingers are needed to open the doorknob and there is a limit to the size and shape that have doorknob. Ibrahim: Well, in certainly my experience, sometimes you need two hands to deal with a big knob. Motion: Well \u2026 yes. The exchange took place early on Sunday morning and was rebroadcast in full later that day.

The October cash rate decision, which is expected to see the RBA lift its target from the current 2.35 per cent, is likely to dominate headlines this week alongside CoreLogic\u2019s latest update on house prices. Due on Monday, the monthly home value index is likely to reveal another drop in property prices as the aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle continues to drag the market lower. - from AAP Yesterday was international coffee day, so if you\u2019re just waking up with some of the good stuff here\u2019s how that happened. With Jeff Kennett\u2019s speech at a Hawks event making headlines on Sunday morning, it is worth revisiting an episode from 1996 during his tenure as Victorian state premier. During a cost-cutting drive Kennett\u2019s newly elected government embarked on a plan to close 300 schools across the state. Among those to close was Northland secondary college, which had the highest Indigenous student population of any high school in Victoria, in Preston The decision sparked a three-year campaign to save the school that included a mock attempt to enrol kids at Scotch college, the elite private school where Kennett\u2019s sons attended. A decision by the supreme court forced the government to reopen the school. The struggle to save the school was retold in a cabaret in 2021. The outgoing Hawthorn president, Jeff Kennett, has called the leaking of racism allegations at the AFL club \u201cunfair\u201d and hopes the unfolding saga can be resolved by the end of the year. Speaking at the club\u2019s best and fairest awards function on Saturday night, the former Victorian premier said the club was not in crisis and he described the issue as a \u201cbump along the highway\u201d. But he told the audience he was \u201csomewhat flabbergasted \u2013 and worse\u201d when he read the draft report of the club\u2019s internal review into the experiences of Indigenous players and their partners while at Hawthorn. Former coach Alastair Clarkson, his then assistant, Chris Fagan, and former development manager Jason Burt were named in the cultural review. Kennett said on Saturday: I do not consider this to be a crisis. When I read the draft report \u2026 I was somewhat flabbergasted and worse. It wasn\u2019t a good read. I hope this matter can be resolved quickly by all parties involved. Kennett said the people interviewed for the report had requested confidentiality and Hawthorn respected that. Sadly, they made a decision to talk to the press \u2026 they named people with whom they had very real issues. That was unfair to those [people] so therefore we need to have this resolved. I don\u2019t see this as a crisis \u2013 I know this club, I know its history and I know its strength. We will deal with this and assist in any way we can. Clarkson said on Wednesday the allegations were \u201cfalse and deeply offensive\u201d and those close to him knew \u201chow important family is to me\u201d. Fagan, now coaching the Brisbane Lions, released a statement categorically denying the allegations against him. Burt last week released a statement to \u201ccategorically deny the conduct attributed to me in the media\u201d. Kennett said the issues were historic and called on any Hawthorn employees to tell the club at the time if they believed there was inappropriate behaviour. The one thing the investigation showed was that we have a safe cultural workplace now. So these are issues of the past. Kennett said he hoped there could be some form of mediation so any issues could be resolved quickly. At the end of his speech, Kennett insisted the Hawks would \u201covercome\u201d the issue. Understand this as being a bump along the highway but \u2026 it is an important bump and it has to be dealt with professionally. \u2013 with AAP On Mark Dreyfus\u2019 interview on ABC Insiders, the attorney general was asked about the sports rorts scandal and gave his view of what occurred saying: \u201cI thought it was a rort on any view.\u201d I thought the idea that a decision made in the prime minister\u2019s office when he had no power over the matter with 51 coloured spreadsheets revealed by the auditor general, that looked pretty corrupt to me, but it won\u2019t be my decision. It will be a matter for this independent commissioner to decide if someone refers a matter to her or him, to decide. Dreyfus made very clear that it wouldn\u2019t be up to him to decide whether the affair was investigated by the new national anti-corruption commission saying he wanted to \u201cmake it clear\u201d that \u201cthis is not an exercise in political payback\u201d. This is a very large integrity reform that\u2019s been described as the single biggest reform for decades. It\u2019s not partisan. It\u2019s there to improve standards in Australian public life. We are not setting this up to go after our political opponents. It won\u2019t be for me to decide if something is corrupt \u2013 it will be for this commission. On Hawthorn, Dreyfus won\u2019t be drawn on whether the allegations require an independent inquiry: These are shocking allegations, David. These abuses of power in sport, which we\u2019ve seen not just in not ball, the AFL, but in other sports, are a real concern. That\u2019s going from junior to elite. The sports minister talked on Friday about a new division within Sports Integrity Australia. I think that will be a start. At the moment, the AFL are conducting an independent inquiry. On Optus, Dreyfus describes the incident as a \u201cwake-up call for corporate Australia\u201d and flags changes to the Privacy Act. Keeping the very personal data of customers who had ceased to be customers years ago. I have yet to hear a reason why that was going on. And Optus failed to keep the information safe. Dreyfus says companies should not treat customers\u2019 information as an asset but as a liability. Companies throughout Australia should stop regarding all of this personal data of Australians as an asset to them, they should think of it as a liability. This is a wake-up call for corporate Australia. We will look very hard at the settings in the Privacy Act. I may be bringing reforms to the Privacy Act before the end of the year, to try to both toughen penalties and make companies think harder about why they are storing the personal data of Australians. It\u2019s an interesting proposition from Dreyfus that contradicts how data is the currency of the modern information economy. Dreyfus pushes back on reports in the Murdoch papers this morning that union officials will be excluded from the Icac. That report this morning is simply, in in one of newspapers is wrong. Union officials are not excluded. Any third party seeking to adversely affect public decisions making in corrupt way will be subject to investigation by the commission. Dreyfus says activities whether activities in workplaces won\u2019t be covered. The activities set up under this bill for this commission are directed at the public sector in Australia. It\u2019s not directed at private activity. It\u2019s directed at the public sector and is interaction third parties have with public officials, adversely affecting the way they go about their duties in a formal, honest manner. Asked about whether people making donations to get a particular outcome, Dreyfus says the commission will have \u201cthe power to investigate any third party seeking to adversely influence the out of a public function and that\u2019s the preface of the commission\u201d. Donations to political parties in Australia are lawful. They are regulated. There is disclosure requirements. We have said we will lower the disclosure threshold because we want more transparency in donations, I but I don\u2019t think anyone suggests that the mere giving of money to a political party, be it the Greens or the Liberal or the National party or the Labor party should be banned. Some suggested that but because they should we should go to complete public funding but we\u2019re not. We want more transparency, David, in the giving of donations. We\u2019re not about to ban donations. Dreyfus says information collected that relates to national security will be \u201cvery carefully stored\u201d: There\u2019s a whole set of provisions in the bill that \u2013 in is the distinction that you have to make for a national anti-corruption commission \u2013 it\u2019s potentially going to be dealing with national security information, that\u2019s not something generally speaking that state and territory commissions have to worry about \u2013 there will special provisions here to deal with it. This is actually an interesting point about the differences between state and federal Icacs. Speers is asking about the various details of the proposal, including what is meant by \u201ctimely\u201d and whether investigations can run for longer than 12 months. He also asks Dreyfus about the proposal for consultation \u2013 Dreyfus says of course they\u2019ll be consulting widely with the cross bench. Dreyfus confirms the commission will be able to tap the phones of politicians \u201csubject to warrant\u201d but won\u2019t say whether this will include encrypted messaging apps like Signal or Whatsapp. I think everyone needs to watch out. We don\u2019t want corrupt activity infecting our system of government. That\u2019s why we\u2019re creating at long last an anti-corruption commission for Australia. David Speers is asking about the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d test in order to allow public hearings. Mark Dreyfus is skirting around asking why this has been included \u2013 and specifically whether he had expert legal opinion supporting the inclusion of this test. Dreyfus says it\u2019s about \u201cgetting the balance right\u201d and that some legal experts have argued for public hearings, some against. But he also notes that Labor\u2019s proposal for a commission contrasts with the Coalitions on one key detail: theirs wouldn\u2019t allow any public hearings at all. Dreyfus: Some legal experts think this is exactly right. Others expressed the contrary view. That that is that is what will be talked about in the committee process we\u2019re about to have. Attorney general on federal anti-corruption commission The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, is speaking to ABC Insiders host, David Speers, this morning with the first subject on the proposed anti-corruption commission. First question: why not make them public? What you heard me saying is that there is good reasons to hold public hearings and there are. Equally, there are good reasons sometimes for holding your hearings in private. We think that is getting the balance right and the experience of anti-corruption commissions over the last 30 year less \u2013 bear in mind we have three decades of experience to look at \u2013 where the commonwealth is the last jurisdiction to get a commission \u2013 that experience for those jurisdictions with public hearings is very few hearings are held in public, mostly held in private. Dreyfus does not explain what those reasons actually are. Australia on track to select nuclear submarine by March: Marles The Aukus program is \u201con track\u201d, the defence minister, Richard Marles, said this morning, after a meeting with the US defense secretary, Lloyd J Austin III, in Hawaii. Australia is set to choose either a US or UK nuclear-powered submarine design by March next year, amid ongoing concerns that there will be a capability gap between the retirement of the existing fleet and the acquisition of the new one. Marles declined to commit to when those submarines are likely to be in the water. He said: You don\u2019t build a nuclear-powered submarine quickly. Aukus is \u201cgoing along very well\u201d, Marles said: We are on track to making an announcement around the optimal pathway that Australia will pursue in relation to acquiring nuclear powered submarines, to make that announcement in the first part of next year. The pair also discussed making their defence industrial bases \u201cmore seamless\u201d. Marles said there was \u201cincreasing pressure\u201d on the global rules-based order in both Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and in China\u2019s actions in the Pacific: We watch China seek to shape the world around us in a way that we have not seen before. Austin said the US and Australia were united on \u201cenhancing deterrence and strengthening security in the Indo Pacific\u201d: We talked about enhancing our interoperability and expanding our operations and advancing our ongoing posture, force posture initiatives and deepening our defence industrial cooperation. Aukus has \u201cmade tremendous progress over the past year\u201d, Austin said. Earlier, the two ministers had a trilateral meeting with their Japanese counterpart, Yasukazu Hamada. Russia\u2019s \u201csham referenda\u201d have prompted the government to legally support Ukraine in the international court of justice (ICJ) and to put financial sanctions and travel bans on another 28 \u201cRussian-appointed separatists, ministers and senior officials\u201d. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has announced the annexation of four regions in Ukraine after holding illegitimate referenda. In a release, the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, and the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus said: The regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are sovereign Ukrainian territory. President Putin\u2019s annexation is illegal and any claims that these territories are now part of Russia are baseless and false. Australia has also filed an intervention in the ICJ case brought by Ukraine against Russia, supporting Ukraine\u2019s claims Russia has violated the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide (genocide convention). Wong said the additional sanctions \u201creinforce Australia\u2019s strong objection to the actions of President Putin and those carrying out his orders\u201d. She said: The areas of Ukraine currently occupied by Russian forces are the sovereign territory of Ukraine. No sham referendum will change this. Dreyfus said: Our intervention underscores our commitment to upholding fundamental rules of international law and the integrity of the genocide convention. Overnight the occupied town of Lyman fell overnight after Ukrainian troops completed an encirclement of 4,000 Russian troops who had been stationed there. Welcome to another Sunday morning Guardian live blog. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, and the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, have pledged Australia\u2019s support to Ukraine in an application to the international court of justice (ICJ) and added sanctions on senior Russian and separatist officials. In a joint press release, Wong and Dreyfus said Russia\u2019s annexation of four Ukrainian regions was \u201cillegal\u201d and any claims they were part of Russian territory were \u201cbaseless and false\u201d. Former Victorian premier and the Hawthorn football club president, Jeff Kennett, has criticised three Indigenous football players who spoke about their experiences of alleged racism at the club. In a speech at the club\u2019s best and fairest awards on Saturday night, Kennett told his audience it was \u201cunfair\u201d for the players to name names and denied the club was in crisis, saying it was experiencing \u201cjust a bump along the highway\u201d albeit an important bump. I\u2019m Royce Kurmelovs, taking the blog through the day.

            "date": "2022-10-21T15:01:00Z",
            "content": "Hackers from rogue states could attempt to discredit the Conservative leadership contest with spurious claims about the integrity of an online members\u2019 vote, experts have said. If there are two candidates remaining in the race after Monday, Tory party members will take part in an online vote to decide the new prime minister. The National Cyber Security Centre, an arm of the GCHQ spy agency, contacted the Conservative party over its leadership voting preparations on Thursday, having also intervened before the previous leader ballot. That August intervention resulted in the party enhancing security around the voting process, but it is understood that NCSC has not advised changes to the voting system this time. Cybersecurity experts contacted by the Guardian said altering the leadership result would be difficult for any hostile foreign state, including Russia. However, they said disrupting the process via false claims about the integrity of the process, or hampering the vote with a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, could have an impact among the wider electorate by discrediting the ballot. Jamie Collier, a consultant at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, said: \u201cThere could be an attempt at sowing disinformation after the vote. Even if there is no security compromise, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Russia starts pumping out narratives that it was compromised, in order to undermine the result and the integrity of the process.\u201d Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at the University of Surrey, said altering the result of the leadership ballot would \u201ctake some doing\u201d, but discrediting the process would be easier. \u201cYou can discredit the process with disinformation,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to hack and change the result, but it\u2019s quite easy to get people to distrust the system.\u201d Steven Murdoch, a professor of security engineering at University College London, said electronic ballots were highly risky ventures, especially when choosing a new national leader. Murdoch pointed to an Electoral Commission report on trial electronic voting at English local elections in 2007, which said: \u201cThe level of risk placed on the availability and integrity of the electoral process was unacceptable.\u201d Murdoch said a DDoS attack, in which websites are disabled by being bombarded with traffic, could be launched to disrupt and discredit a vote. \u201cThere could be genuine disruption, and that could cause people to question the legitimacy of the election.\u201d A Conservative party spokesperson said: \u201cWe ran online voting just a few months ago in the last leadership contest. We worked with the National Cyber Security Centre, followed their security recommendations, and it proved to be secure. We continue to work with the NCSC to once again run a secure online ballot.\u201d An NCSC spokesperson said: \u201cAs the UK\u2019s national technical authority for cybersecurity, we continue to provide advice to the Conservative party, including on security considerations for online leadership voting.\u201d"

            "content": "A San Francisco jury has found Uber\u2019s former chief security officer, Joe Sullivan, guilty of criminal obstruction for failing to report a 2016 cybersecurity incident to authorities. Sullivan, who was fired from Uber in 2017, was found guilty on counts of obstruction of justice and deliberate concealment of felony, a spokesperson from the US justice department confirmed on Wednesday. \u201cSullivan affirmatively worked to hide the data breach from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and took steps to prevent the hackers from being caught,\u201d said Stephanie Hinds, US attorney for the northern district of California. The case was being watched as an important precedent regarding the culpability of individual security staffers and executives when handling cybersecurity incidents, a concern that has only grown at a time when reports of ransomware attacks have surged and cybersecurity insurance premiums have risen. The case pertains to a breach of Uber\u2019s systems that affected data of 57 million passengers and drivers. The breach took place in 2016, but Uber only disclosed it publicly a year later. Public disclosures of security breaches are required by law in many US states, with most regulations mandating that the notification be made \u201cin the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay\u201d. Uber\u2019s revelations sparked several federal and state inquiries. In September 2018, Uber paid $148m (\u00a3130m) to settle claims by all 50 US states and Washington DC that it was too slow to disclose the hacking. The two hackers involved in the year pleaded guilty to hacking Uber and then extorting Uber\u2019s \u201cbug bounty\u201d security research program the following year. The justice department filed criminal charges against Sullivan in 2020. At the time, prosecutors alleged he arranged to pay the hackers $100,000 (\u00a387,964) in bitcoin and had them sign nondisclosure agreements that falsely stated they had not stolen data. Sullivan was also accused of withholding information from Uber officials who could have disclosed the breach to the FTC, which had been evaluating the San Francisco-based company\u2019s data security following a 2014 breach. In July, Uber accepted responsibility for covering up the breach and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution of Sullivan over his alleged role in concealing the hacking, as part of a settlement with US prosecutors to avoid criminal charges. An FTC spokesperson said in a statement on Thursday: \u201cThe court\u2019s decision affirms that hiding serious breaches of data from the FTC will not be tolerated and makes clear that big tech executives are not above the law.\u201d Sullivan\u2019s lawyer David Angeli did not respond to a request for comment."

            "date": "2022-10-09T23:01:10Z",
            "content": "The world\u2019s biggest oil-producing nations cutting production at a time of soaring energy costs is \u201cunhelpful and unwise\u201d for global economic growth, the US Treasury secretary has warned, amid intense pressure from sky-high inflation. Ahead of meetings hosted by the International Monetary Fund in Washington this week, Janet Yellen said the move by Opec+ \u2013 the oil production cartel led by Saudi Arabia, plus Russia \u2013 risked undermining the world economy. The Biden administration has reacted angrily to last week\u2019s decision to cut daily output by 2m barrels, more than expected, describing it as a geopolitical move. Meanwhile, Yellen said it would risk hurting developing countries more than most. \u201cOpec\u2019s decision is unhelpful and unwise,\u201d she said in an interview with the Financial Times. \u201cIt\u2019s uncertain what impact it will end up having, but certainly, it\u2019s something that, to me, did not seem appropriate, under the circumstances we face. We\u2019re very worried about developing countries and the problems they face.\u201d Her warning comes ahead of sharp downgrades for global growth expected from the International Monetary Fund this week. Attended by more than 190 countries from around the globe, the fund will hold its annual meeting against a backdrop of fragmenting cooperation between nations over the inflation shock exacerbated by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Discussions will also focus on the impact of rising interest rates around the world, and the effects of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Yellen said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to exchange views on whether our countries are addressing these problems, and try to consider whether our collective reaction adds up to something that is sensible, and the best we can do, in that difficult environment.\u201d The IMF is expected this week to downgrade its growth forecasts for the world economy. Erik Nielsen, group chief economics adviser at UniCredit bank in London, said: \u201cBoth Opec+\u2019s decision and the US response are important wake-up calls for us Europeans. \u201cThe huge supply shock is eroding real income at a frightening pace and it is now being supplemented by a demand shock, illustrated by plummeting confidence indices. Not surprisingly, the IMF has indicated that it will revise down \u2013 again \u2013 its forecast for global growth, as most other forecasters have done in recent weeks.\u201d The UK chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, is due to fly to the IMF\u2019s annual meetings later this week at a delicate moment for the UK economy, amid the shock to the global economy from high inflation and market turmoil sparked by his mini-budget. The sweeping tax cuts, which mainly benefit the wealthy, and lack of independent assessment by the Office for Budget Responsibility spooked investors, sending the pound sliding and the cost of government borrowing soaring. Since then, Kwarteng has been handed independent forecasts by the OBR on the state of the UK finances that are expected to show a hole of more than \u00a360bn left by his tax cuts and a sharply slowing economic growth outlook. The forecasts are due to be published alongside a fiscal statement planned for 23 November, which is expected to be brought forward to this month. It comes as figures show business activity declining across most regions of the UK as companies struggle with soaring costs, according to a survey from NatWest. The lender said there were only a few remaining pockets of growth across the UK in September, according to its regular monthly snapshot of regional private sector activity. Demand for goods and services fell in most areas amid increased uncertainty around the outlook, which took a toll on hiring. Business activity fell in all but three of the 12 monitored UK regions and nations last month. The fastest rates of contraction were seen in Northern Ireland and the south-west, while London was the best-performing region, despite seeing growth slow to a 20-month low, ahead of Yorkshire and Humber. Business activity in the south-east was unchanged on the month, after dipping in August. Business leaders are growing increasingly concerned about the impact of the cost of living crisis on households and the wider economy. Former Sainsbury\u2019s boss Justin King, who now sits on Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s board, said the emergency was the worst since the 1970s. Responding to questions over Asda\u2019s decision to offer cheap meals to over-60s, he told Sky News: \u201cSupermarkets have always taken very seriously the role that they play in helping their customers, if you like, make ends meet. \u201cThe challenge hasn\u2019t been as great as this since \u2026 the 1970s, which is probably the last time the challenges to households were as great.\u201d"

            "content": "Rising interest rates, a falling stock market, a seesaw in the price of gas, a high dollar and chaos in world finance \u2013 we see in all this, once again, the folly of trying to run the world\u2019s largest economy through a central bank. It\u2019s time to rethink the basics: what has happened in America? And what should be done? Adam Smith wrote: \u201cWealth, as Mr Hobbes says, is power.\u201d Today in the United States we find islands of wealth and power on one side and an ocean of precarity and powerlessness, alongside poverty, on the other. This is a structural development over 50 years, the effect of politics and policies, but also of industrial change, globalization and new technologies, with intense regional, social, demographic and political implications. From the 1930s to the 1970s America had a middle-class economy centered in the heartland, feeding and supplying the world with machinery and goods while drawing labor from the impoverished south to the thriving midwest \u2013 an economy of powerful trade unions and world-dominant corporations. This has become a bicoastal economy dominated by globalized finance, insurance and high-end services on one coast, and by information technology, aerospace and entertainment on the other. Finance and technology do not create many jobs, and the conduct of business in those sectors is rapacious and predatory, shading often into fraud. Some years ago we calculated the rise of income inequality measured between counties during the 1990s boom years, and found that half the increase was due to income gains in just five counties: Manhattan, Silicon Valley, Seattle. There have been other big gainers since, but the fact remains: the largest income and wealth gains in America have become highly concentrated in a few very specific places, sectors \u2013 and people. Yet practically all new jobs created in the past 30 years have been in services, and most of those in \u201cstagnant services\u201d \u2013 the profusion of restaurants, retail shops, hospitals and clinics, offices and entertainment venues, fueled by household incomes (and borrowings) exceeding requirements for material goods. Pay in these jobs is mediocre and employment is unstable. Families compensated by having two or more earners, each sometimes holding two or more jobs, where 50 years ago the norm was one earner with a steady job paying a living wage. Then Covid blasted the sector. For better or worse, we can\u2019t go back: globalization and the digital revolution are irreversible facts of life. The June 2021 White House Review on the supply chain made this very clear, using semiconductors, rare earths, batteries and pharmaceuticals as examples. Our advanced sectors need world markets \u2013 including the Chinese market \u2013 as much as they need access to the world\u2019s resources. US consumers benefit from imported goods and from the efficiencies of the information age. The question is: what do we do now? We can adjust, and build a fair and secure middle-class society, free of poverty and of oligarchy alike, with tools that are broadly familiar. These tools include: Expand social insurance Social security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment insurance and Snap already greatly reduce poverty, insecurity and hunger in America. They can be broadened and strengthened. If we can\u2019t get Medicare for All, then drop the age of eligibility to 55 \u2013 that would cover a large part of the most vulnerable population and reduce in a stroke the burden of private health insurance on employers. Raise the minimum wage A federal minimum wage at $15 per hour would provide a raise to at least 20% of all working Americans. It would solve in a stroke the supposed problem of \u201clabor shortage\u201d \u2013 without hurting any employer relative to any other. Nor would it encourage immigration, since US workers would step up to take decently paid jobs. Implement a job guarantee A federal job guarantee is well-prepared proposal that would eliminate involuntary unemployment, set a basic wage standard, and provide willing workers with continuous employment on useful projects, giving private employers a labor pool from which they can easily recruit the workers that they need. Stabilize energy prices and supplies The TVA and other agencies provide stable power under long-term contracts. Why should oil and gas be run by private equity on a boom-and-bust basis? Stabilize energy prices and supplies \u2013 with regulation, quotas, price controls (as in Germany right now), long-term contracts and public utilities \u2013 and many other problems would become much easier to solve. Build public services, infrastructure, and fight climate change And do this while cutting military commitments and spending. The main job of infrastructure is to improve the quality of life, with clean water and air, good transport and communications, and \u2013 urgently \u2013 to change the resource mix so as to mitigate, so far as possible, global warming. We cannot meet these needs and at the same time devote our talents and resources to wars \u2013 the limits to that are clear after Afghanistan and Iraq. It is past time to end the illusion that the United States can or should run the world. Shift taxation toward land rent A great principle of classical economics was that taxes should encourage labor and enterprise while discouraging waste in both the public and private spheres. In the 1980s, taxes were shifted away from personal and corporate incomes and capital gains and toward payrolls and sales \u2013 and the unsurprising result was the rise of an oligarchy of hyper-wealthy persons. The remedy now is to tax these accumulations and the associated rents \u2013 land values, mineral rights, technology \u201cquasi-rents\u201d \u2013 so as to bring the new plutocrats back to earth. A stronger estate-and-gift tax can spur the transfer of great fortunes to foundations and non-profits, such as hospitals, universities and churches, while working to prevent the emergence of dynasties, financial and political. Reform banking before it\u2019s too late The Glass-Steagall Act protected the middle class \u2013 the ordinary depositor at a commercial bank \u2013 from the speculative whims of the elites. Today big money is back in charge, despite the great financial crisis \u2013 and much of the American public as well as the larger world is sick of it. Perhaps the toughest, most necessary reform is to reduce debts including student debts, to shrink the banks, to restore effective regulation, to prosecute frauds, and to discipline finance to serve the public good. This will take the glamour out of being a banker \u2013 and the intoxicating power out of running the Federal Reserve. Is this program realistic? Perhaps not. But consider the path we\u2019re on. What I propose is an alternative \u2013 to pitchforks, anarchy and civil war. James K Galbraith holds the Lloyd M Bentsen Jr chair in government/business relations at the Lyndon B Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin.

            "title": "What do US curbs on selling microchips to China mean for the global economy?",
            "date": "2022-10-19T02:00:11Z",
            "content": "The US has taken unprecedented steps to limit the sale of advanced computer chips to China, escalating efforts to contain Beijing\u2019s tech and military ambitions. The moves are designed to cut off supplies of critical technology to China that may be used across sectors including advanced computing and weapons manufacture. The crackdown marks the most significant action by Washington against Beijing on technology exports in decades, escalating a trade battle between the world\u2019s two most powerful economies. After the export controls, Apple reportedly put on hold plans to use memory chips from China\u2019s Yangtze Memory Technologies in its products. The Nikkei newspaper said Apple had planned to use the chips in iPhones sold in China. What action has the US taken? On 7 October, the Biden administration imposed a sweeping set of export controls that included measures to cut China off from certain semiconductor chips and chip-making equipment. Under the rules, US companies must cease supplying Chinese chipmakers with equipment that can produce relatively advanced chips unless they first obtain a licence. The new regulations also add controls on some semiconductor production items and transactions for specific end-uses of some integrated circuits or chips. The US also wants to increase its export controls to include semiconductor products and software, technology, and other things used to develop and make integrated circuits. In a further restriction, US citizens and green-card holders will also be banned from working on certain technology for Chinese companies and entities. What products are blocked by the curbs? The export curbs will include high-end computing chips, such as NVIDIA\u2019s A100/H100 and Intel\u2019s GPU (Ponte Vecchio), according to Brady Wang, associate director of Counterpoint research in Hong Kong. The rules, some of which go into effect immediately, build on restrictions sent in letters earlier this year to top toolmakers KLA, Lam Research and Applied Materials, requiring them to halt shipments of equipment to wholly Chinese-owned factories producing advanced logic chips. The US department of commerce said the export controls \u201crestrict [China\u2019s] ability to obtain advanced computing chips, develop and maintain supercomputers, and manufacture advanced semiconductors\u201d. How significant are the curbs? The chip ban was described by the seasoned China analyst Bill Bishop as a \u201cmassive escalation\u201d in the rumbling trade and geopolitical tensions between the US and China. \u201cWe are all still trying to understand the impacts of the new controls,\u201d he said in his Sinocism newsletter, \u201cand frankly I think many underestimate just how significant they are, both for technology supply chains and future developments but more broadly for the US-China relationship\u201d. The international research firm GlobalData said the US announcement \u201ctranscends the semiconductor industry\u201d and was about nothing less than the leadership of the world economy. \u201cThis is about [artificial intelligence] dominance,\u201d said Josep Bori, the firm\u2019s thematic research director, \u201cwhich underpins what many call the fifth industrial revolution, and, ultimately, about global economic leadership in the next few decades.\u201d Although they have another year to comply with the restrictions, semiconductor manufacturers in Asia such as the market-leading Taiwanese company TSMC, SK Hynix, and Samsung are also threatened by them. S&amp;P Global Ratings credit analyst Clifford Kurz said: \u201cMany of the Asia-Pacific tech issuers that we rate have the financial strength to absorb the blow for at least the next 12 months. But longer term, the rating implications are clearly negative.\u201d Can China use locally made chips instead? China consumes more than three-quarters of the semiconductors sold globally, but produces only about 15% of global output. Experts say China\u2019s own equipment makers remain four to five years behind their overseas counterparts, making them unsuitable as instant substitutes for equipment lost from US suppliers such as KLA Corp, Applied Materials and Lam Research. Boston Consulting Group estimated in 2021 that a country would need at least $1tn in incremental upfront investment to build fully \u201cself-sufficient\u201d local chip supply chains. The new restrictions may spur Chinese chipmakers to try producing advanced chips by using creative engineering solutions with older technologies not subject to the sanctions. Brady Wang from Counterpoint said: \u201cThe most recent US restrictions will greatly slow China\u2019s advanced semiconductor industry and derivative technologies, including AI, supercomputers, training in self-driving etc.\u201d China may be forced instead to concentrate its manufacturing capacity on \u201cmature technologies and leverage the service outside China\u201d. How has China reacted? The China Semiconductor Industry Association said in a statement that it hoped the US government would reverse its decision and return to international trade negotiation processes. The importance of technological self-sufficiency, already a priority for Xi in the past decade, surfaced as a theme at this year\u2019s congress with Xi Jinping emphasising the hostility of foreign rivals. However, experts said that Beijing may have few ways of forcing Washington back to the table. The ongoing congress meant reaction from Beijing had been muted but Bill Bishop said China\u2019s options were limited beyond restricting US access to the important rare earth metals that China controls. \u201cTheir options are limited as many seemingly obvious actions, like targeting Apple, would also do a lot of damage to the [Chinese] economy. Boeing would make sense, but they already are being punished. I would not be surprised to see rare earths weaponised. What will happen next? Singapore\u2019s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, warned greater decoupling between the US and China would create a \u201cless stable world\u201d. \u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s latest move is a very serious one, I\u2019m sure they have considered it carefully. It can have very wide ramifications,\u201d he said at a press conference in Australia. Reuters contributed to this report"

            "content": "It used to be said that London\u2019s streets were paved in gold but in reality they were running in blood \u2013 the blood of tens of thousands of people executed by the state for crimes ranging from treason to petty theft. Over 700 years, public executions in the capital \u2013 often intended as a deterrent against criminal activity \u2013 were watched by vast crowds, creating an \u201cexecution economy\u201d built on a thirst for grisly details and a physical hunger born of hours of anticipation. By the end of the 18th century, more than 200 crimes were punishable by death. London\u2019s courts ordered the deaths of more people than courts in the rest of the country combined. \u201cPublic executions became embedded in London\u2019s landscape, culture, society and economy,\u201d said Beverley Cook, the curator of Executions, a new exhibition at the Museum of London Docklands, that opens on Friday. \u201cThey were a very visible part of Londoners\u2019 lives for many centuries, with some events attracting tens of thousands of people.\u201d From the first public execution in 1196 to the last in 1868, the exhibition tells the stories of people put to death and the impact on society. It includes engravings, paintings, death warrants, last letters of the condemned, clothing, shackles, a gibbet and the diary of the governor of Newgate prison, where condemned prisoners were held. A noose was \u201cprobably the most difficult object to put on display because of the contemporary connotations\u201d, said Cook. No spot in the City of London is more than 500 metres from a place where gallows once stood, according to the exhibition. People were confronted with the decaying bodies of executed criminals hanging in gibbet cages, traitors\u2019 heads on spikes over London Bridge and body parts displayed on city gates. Methods of execution went far beyond hanging. Traitors were hung, drawn and quartered \u2013 dragged from prison to the execution site, hanged until nearly dead, then castrated, disembowelled, beheaded and cut into quarters. Members of the nobility were often simply beheaded, out of respect for their high status. Burning to death was the standard punishment for heresy, aimed at striking fear into people who questioned the teaching of the church. Boiling to death was rare, and usually reserved for poisoners. A roll call of 5,000 people \u2013 names, ages, crimes and place of execution \u2013 who were publicly put to death is the result of meticulous research carried out for the exhibition. Amid the traitors, murderers and highway robbers are many people executed for minor crimes such as pickpocketing, burglary and shoplifting. One was Ambrose Newport, 21, put to death in 1731 for \u201cstealing a black-brown mare\u201d. Perhaps the most famous of those executed before a public audience was Charles I, convicted of \u201cHigh Treason and other high Crymes\u201d and beheaded in 1649 at Banqueting House in Whitehall in front of an \u201cabundance of Men and Women\u201d. Among the items on display is an intricately woven silk vest said to have been worn by the king at his execution. The cause of visible stains on the garment has not been conclusively identified. The spectators flocking to the gallows and other execution sites to witness the spectacle of state-sanctioned death provided others with an opportunity to make money. Window views and grandstand seating were hired out to the wealthy; the poor stood for hours fortified by beef, mutton, eel and fruit pies, depending on the season. Execution \u201cbroadsides\u201d, costing about a penny, were hawked all over the country, describing the crime and the death in everyday street language. They were written in advance, with their authors sometimes caught out by a last-minute reprieve. \u201cMurder is, doubtless, a very shocking offence; nevertheless, as what is done is not to be undone, let us make our money out of it,\u201d wrote one broadside seller in 1861. By then, the death spectacles were coming to an end. Some argued that public execution days disrupted London\u2019s economy, and social reformers questioned the morality of watching people die. Transportation to the colonies and new Victorian prisons offered alternative punishments. On 26 May 1868, the last public execution in London took place. Michael Barrett was an Irish Republican convicted for his part in an explosion at the Clerkenwell House of Detention. He always protested his innocence. Three days later, public executions were abolished, although the death penalty remained until 1969. The issues raised in the exhibition were not merely of historic curiosity, said Cook. Many of its themes will be \u201csurprisingly familiar\u201d to people today. \u201cThe struggle to protect an urban population from crime, and the enduring issues of poverty, a rising population, discrimination and domestic violence.\u201d And, she added, \u201c55 countries still have capital punishment on their statute books. We don\u2019t want visitors to think this is the end of the story\u201d. The last section of the exhibition includes a video interview with Paul Bridges, the chair of Amnesty\u2019s anti-death penalty project. Execution opens at the Museum of London Docklands on Friday 14 October, entrance from \u00a312"

            "date": "2022-10-28T18:00:35Z",
            "content": "Heatwaves brought on by human-caused climate breakdown have cost the global economy about $16tn since the 1990s, according to a study. The research calculates the financial impact of extreme heat on infrastructure, agriculture, productivity, human health and other areas. \u201cWe have been underestimating the true economic costs we\u2019ve suffered because of global warming so far, and we are likely underestimating the costs going out into the future,\u201d said Justin Mankin, an assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth College and senior author of the study published in the journal Science Advances. Despite having the lowest carbon emissions, it is the tropics and the global south that bear almost the entirety of the economic brunt of extreme heat. This is because they are warmer and therefore hit harder by heatwaves, and also because they are more economically vulnerable and therefore more susceptible to economic depression and the costs of adapting to the climate crisis. Using data covering about 66% of the world\u2019s population, the researchers examined temperature measurements from the hottest five-day periods of the years between 1992 and 2013 and compared them with national economic data from that same period, segmented for regions. Extreme heat had a wide range of effects on people and economies, said Christopher Callahan, a researcher at Dartmouth College and lead author of the study. \u201cWe know that heatwaves kill crops and cause illnesses like heat stroke, but they also have other effects such as increased interpersonal aggression, increased rates of workplace injury, and reduced mental performance.\u201d Until recently, most studies on the subject were based on averages, but these can mask the effects of local and temporary events, according to Dr Leonie Wenz, the deputy head of the research department on complexity science at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThey do not fully reflect how we as humans experience temperature. What really matters for us, what affects our wellbeing, our productivity, and our decisions are the extremes and the fluctuations from one day, or week, to the next.\u201d The study found that the world\u2019s wealthiest regions, such as areas of Europe and North America, experienced an average 1.5% loss of GDP per capita per year due to extreme heat. By comparison, low-income regions \u2013 such as India and Indonesia \u2013 recorded a 6.7% GDP per capita loss yearly. The bill had been footed mainly by countries that had not benefited from industrialisation, said Mankin, creating a vicious cycle. \u201cLow-income countries have been asked to develop and industrialise in a global economy that strategically disadvantages them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re doing so while also being hammered by the impacts of global warming that has been generated by the global north. It\u2019s kind of a double whammy.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-10-23T06:00:31Z",
            "content": "Republicans were in trouble. Mitt Romney, their US presidential nominee, had been crushed by Barack Obama. The party commissioned an \u201cautopsy\u201d report that proposed a radical rethink. \u201cIf we want ethnic minority voters to support Republicans,\u201d it said, \u201cwe have to engage them and show our sincerity.\u201d Ten years after Romney\u2019s loss, Republicans are fighting their first election since the presidency of Donald Trump. But far from entering next month\u2019s midterms as the party of tolerance, diversity and sincerity, critics say, they have shown itself to be unapologetically the party of hate. Perhaps nothing captures the charge more eloquently than a three-word post that appeared on the official Twitter account for Republicans on the House of Representatives\u2019 judiciary committee \u2013 ranking member Jim Jordan \u2013 on 6 October. It said, simply and strangely: \u201cKanye. Elon. Trump.\u201d The first of this unholy trinity referred to Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, who has recently drawn fierce criticism for wearing a \u201cWhite Lives Matter\u201d T-shirt at Paris fashion week and for antisemitic messages on social media, including one that said he would soon go \u201cdeath con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE\u201d. The second was billionaire Elon Musk, who published a pro-Russian peace plan for Ukraine and denied reports that he had been speaking to the Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin. The third was former president Donald Trump, who wrote last weekend that American Jews have offered insufficient praise of his policies toward Israel, warning that they need to \u201cget their act together\u201d before \u201cit is too late!\u201d The comment played into the antisemitic prejudice that American Jews have dual loyalties to the US and Israel. It was condemned by the White House as \u201cinsulting\u201d and \u201cantisemitic\u201d. But when historian Michael Beschloss tweeted: \u201cDo any Republican Party leaders have any comment at all on Trump\u2019s admonition to American Jews?\u201d, the silence was deafening. Republicans have long been accused of coded bigotry and nodding and winking to their base. There was an assumption of rules of political etiquette and taboos that could not be broken. Now, it seems, politics has entered a post-shame era where anything goes. Jared Holt, an extremism researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue thinktank, said: \u201cThe type of things they would say in closed rooms full of donors they\u2019re just saying out in the open now. It\u2019s a cliche but I always remember what I heard growing up which is, when people tell you who they are, you should believe them.\u201d The examples are becoming increasingly difficult to downplay or ignore. Earlier this month Tommy Tuberville, a Republican senator for Alabama, told an election rally in Nevada that Democrats support reparations for the descendants of enslaved people because \u201cthey think the people that do the crime are owed that\u201d. The remark was widely condemned for stereotyping African Americans as people committing crimes. And Marjorie Taylor Greene, a congresswoman from Georgia, echoed the rightwing \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory when she told a rally in Arizona: \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s 5 million illegal aliens are on the verge of replacing you, replacing your jobs and replacing your kids in school and, coming from all over the world, they\u2019re also replacing your culture.\u201d Such comments have handed ammunition to Democrats as they battle to preserve wafer-thin majorities in the House and Senate. Although the party is facing electoral headwinds from inflation, crime and border security, it has plenty of evidence that Trump remains dominant among Republicans \u2013 a huge motivator for Democratic turnout. Indeed, Trump did more than anyone to turn the 2013 autopsy on its head. In his first run for president, he referred to Mexicans as criminals, drug dealers and rapists and pledged to build a border wall and impose a Muslim ban. Opponents suggest that he liberated Republicans to say the unsayable, rail against so-called political correctness and give supporters the thrill of transgression. Antjuan Seawright, a senior adviser to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said: \u201cHe has been the creator of the permission slip and the validator of the permission slip. For many of them, he is their trampoline to jump even further with their rightwing red meat racial rhetoric.\u201d Beyond Republicans\u2019 headline-grabbing stars, the trend is also manifest at the grassroots. In schools, the party has launched a sweeping assault on what teachers can say or teach about race, gender identity, LGBTQ+ issues and American history. An analysis by the Washington Post newspaper found that 25 states have passed 64 laws reshaping what students can learn and do at school over the past three academic years. There are examples of the new extremism all over the country. The New York Republican Club will on Monday host an event with Katie Hopkins, a British far-right political commentator who has compared migrants to cockroaches and was repeatedly retweeted by Trump before both were banned by the social media platform. In Idaho, long a deeply conservative state, Dorothy Moon, the new chairwoman of the state Republican party, is accused of close associations with militia groups and white nationalists. Last month she appeared on Trump ally Steve Bannon\u2019s War Room podcast to accuse the state\u2019s Pride festival and parade of sexualising children. A recent headline in the Idaho Capital Sun newspaper stated: \u201cHate makes a comeback in Idaho, this time with political support.\u201d Michelle Vincent, a senior adviser to Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stephen Heidt, noted the such currents have long been a problem in Idaho but said: \u201cTrump made hate OK. He made bad behavior seem OK because of the extremes of what he was doing. They started emulating him. People were were abused here during Black Lives Matter protests. We have so much militia here and they are out of control.\u201d In many cases, the naked bigotry goes hand in hand with Trump\u2019s \u201cbig lie\u201d that the last election was stolen from him due to widespread voter fraud. A New York Times investigation found that about 70% of Republican midterm candidates running for Congress in next month\u2019s midterm elections have either questioned or flat-out denied the results of the 2020 election. They can now count on support from Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who in 2017 met with the Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, and dismissed his entire opposition as \u201cterrorists\u201d Gabbard this week defected to the Republicans and campaigned for Kari Lake, the Republican nominee for governor of Arizona and an unabashed defender of the big lie. Another election denier is Doug Mastriano, a political novice running for governor of Pennsylvania with the help of far-right figures. He was outside the US Capitol during the January 6 insurrection and photographed watching demonstrators attacking police before he supposedly walked away. Mastriano has repeatedly criticised his opponent, the state attorney general, Josh Shapiro, for attending and sending his children to what he brands a \u201cprivileged, exclusive, elite\u201d school, suggesting that this demonstrates Shapiro\u2019s \u201cdisdain for people like us\u201d. It is a Jewish day school where students receive both secular and religious instruction. After a long courtship, Trump himself has in recent months begun embracing the antisemitic conspiracy theory QAnon in earnest. In September, using his Truth Social platform, the former president reposted an image of himself wearing a Q lapel pin overlaid with the words \u201cThe Storm is Coming\u201d. A QAnon song has been played at the end of several his campaign rallies. Ron Klein, chair of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said: \u201cIt\u2019s very unfortunate that the Republican party is either silent and complicit in this antisemitic language that\u2019s being put forward by Donald Trump and others that align with him. But it\u2019s very indicative of a Republican party that does not want to take on rightwing extremists.\u201d Klein, a former congressman, added: \u201cSome members of Republican party did use dog whistles and symbolic language to make their points about minorities, including the Jewish community, and that was very troubling. But the era of Donald Trump has just lifted the rock under which these people now feel it\u2019s OK and even helpful for them to make these kinds of statements and use these kinds of words to gain political power and political stature, which is very troubling in our American political system.\u201d The 2013 autopsy now looks like a blip, an outlier, in half a century of Republican politics. Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 \u201claw and order\u201d message stoked racial fear and resentment in the south. Ronald Reagan demonised \u201cwelfare queens\u201d in 1976 and, four years later, launched his election campaign with a speech lauding \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d near the site of the \u201cMississippi Burning\u201d murders \u2013 seen by many as a nod to southern states that resented the federal government enforcing civil rights. A political action committee linked to George HW Bush\u2019s campaign in 1988 paid for an attack advert blaming Democratic rival Michael Dukakis for the case of Willie Horton, an African American convict who committed rape during a furlough from prison. Lee Atwater, Bush\u2019s campaign manager, bragged that he would turn Horton into \u201cDukakis\u2019s running mate\u201d. The Atwater playbook is being deployed again in Senate midterm races as Republicans Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Mehmet Oz of Pennsylvania run attack ads accusing their Democratic opponents, Mandela Barnes and John Fetterman, of being soft on crime, often with images of Black prison inmates. Stuart Stevens, a veteran Republican campaign strategist who wrote a withering indictment of the party\u2019s trajectory, It Was All a Lie: How the Republican Party Became Donald Trump, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think Donald Trump made people more racist or antisemitic; I think he gave them permission to express it.\u201d Stevens, a senior adviser at the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, continued: \u201cIt\u2019s a party of white grievance, and anger and hate is an element of that.\u201d Kurt Bardella, a Democratic strategist and former Republican congressional aide, agreed: \u201cThe real consequence of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is it did give permission to so many people within the party who used to try to mask or hide their racism. They now feel like they can proudly wear it and they do.\u201d With hate crimes on the rise across America, there are fears that comments by Trump, Tuberville, Greene and others will lead to threats and violence that put lives in danger. Bardella added: \u201cWe learned after January 6 that, to the Republican party faithful, these aren\u2019t just words, they are instructions. It\u2019s a very dangerous development that one of the major political parties in America has made the conscious decision to wrap itself in the embrace of white nationalism.\u201d"

            "content": "It won\u2019t be Boris Johnson, but whoever the new prime minister turns out to be, they will have been dragged into office by \u201ceconomic orthodoxy\u201d and its henchmen. Their mandate is pre-written in the data you have been deluged with about the impact of unfunded tax cuts, from the depreciation of the pound to rises in interest rates, and the untenable upward effect this has had on mortgages and rents. The charts have spoken \u2013 an ideological experiment has gone terribly wrong and must be reversed. But it is a tale of two crises, and only one is being told. Attracting far less fanfare is another set of statistics about cold and hunger. More than a million people are expected to be pushed into poverty this winter. Their slide into deprivation will test an informal support network already stretched to its limit. Last week, the food bank charity the Trussell Trust launched an emergency appeal for donations because need for food banks has now outstripped donations. Charities like this, private citizens and schools are mobilising to bridge the gap. The hole is too large to plug. Half of all primary schools in England are trying to feed children in poverty who are ineligible for free school meals because their parents\u2019 income does not meet the threshold. But there are 800,000 of them. It can be hard sometimes to grasp the scale of the problem through bare statistics, but vivid and haunting details can flesh them out. Children are eating school rubbers to line their stomachs and dull the ache and nausea of hunger. Others are bringing in empty lunchboxes then pretending to dine on their phantom food away from classmates, too ashamed to reveal that they have nothing to eat. If these children\u2019s families can\u2019t afford to eat, they definitely can\u2019t afford to keep warm as winter approaches and energy prices rocket. How can children expect to learn with their minds impaired by hunger and cold? Over the past year, reading ability among seven-year-olds from poor families fell at double the rate of those from affluent families, their future prospects receding before they have even begun. But my goodness, the scenes in Westminster! Kwasi Kwarteng sacked on a plane, Suella Braverman gone for a data breach, reported manhandling, jostling and shouting outside the voting lobby. And if that wasn\u2019t already enough to drown out the rumble of tummies and chattering of teeth, Liz Truss threw in the towel, kicking off another attention-sucking vortex of new leadership speculation and horse-trading. \u201cI worry,\u201d Naomi Duncan, chief executive of Chefs in Schools, told me, two hours after Truss resigned, \u201cthat the ongoing political turmoil will divert attention.\u201d The solution for her is simple: to give one meal a day to all children based on need, not an income calculation that has long since ceased to be relevant. It does sound simple, doesn\u2019t it? But the sort of government that tackles poverty, hunger and cold is not the government anyone who matters is clamouring for. As the emergency intensifies, politicians and opinion makers are calling not for a firefighter to treat this as the crisis it truly is, but for a \u201cgrownup\u201d to make those economic charts read better. \u201cThe grownups are back,\u201d declared Liam Fox, after Jeremy Hunt and Penny Mordaunt\u2019s performance at the dispatch box last week. \u201cIf Truss cannot quickly sort herself out,\u201d the Sun (of all papers) told us, \u2018\u201cthe grownups need to get in a room\u201d and \u201cagree a peaceful transition to a sensible figure\u201d. This trope exemplifies the detachment of both Westminster and Westminster watchers. As the country enters into the winter crisis proper, those at the top are looking for a leader with unspecified technocratic skills who, like a contracted management consultant, will be able to \u201cstabilise\u201d UK plc. It\u2019s not the mouths of children that need feeding, but the markets. If this new leader must have an ideology, it should be one that aligns with the aim of \u201cfiscal responsibility\u201d, itself a byword for reduced state spending. They must \u201clook like a leader\u201d, and enact whatever callous cuts they have to, preferably while exhibiting suitable regret at having to make \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d. The result of this settlement is a chilling absence of politicians able to articulate the exceptional pain the public is going through. Also absent are any policies that would tackle the cost of living and energy emergency through higher taxes on the wealthy, or an economic stabilisation agenda that addresses the goals not only of those who want to prosper, but those who need to survive. Even among a fuming opposition there is a sort of bloodless anger. \u201cThe damage to mortgages and bills has been done,\u201d tweeted Keir Starmer as if the economic impact is being felt by pieces of paper rather than people. It seems everyone has understood that injecting feeling and channelling the fear and deprivation that stalks people every day disqualifies you from being taken seriously as a politician. The \u201cadult\u201d approach seems to be keeping the markets happy and achieving abstract \u201cgrowth\u201d, rather than also prioritising the security of those so on the margins they cannot benefit from that growth; those who will suffer most when the next round of soberly dictated cuts arrive. To include in your economic vision the importance of benefits, subsidies or improvements to public services to the wellbeing of those not able to fully participate in the housing or job market is somehow outside the parameters of acceptable politics. But it is staying in that lane of acceptable politics that has resulted in our political and social crises. The delusion is that if we try just one more time with someone like Rishi Sunak, a man who flat out complained of funding being \u201cshoved into deprived areas\u201d, the right or right of centre will crack it. Despite the fact that this is the tribe which over the past two decades pursued the deregulation agenda of big businesses, allowed working conditions and wages to be run into the ground, slashed benefits, and failed to invest any money saved from painful cuts into, to take just one example, any future-proofing green energy that would have mitigated this winter crisis. I wonder, even with attention constantly yanked back to the Westminster spectacle, just how many more chances the grownups can get away with when every day another adult or child starts to go without food, or another family bundle themselves up at night instead of putting the heating on. Just how much longer can people put up with a consensus that placates the financial system with an \u201cacceptable\u201d number of losers? Grownup politics is literally that: disregarding those who do not \u201cmatter\u201d, considering the economically marginalised simply as collateral damage, excluding their passions from the cool halls of power and cultivating resignation to ever more suffering. But with their numbers rising and their pain intensifying, that may be about to become an impossible task.

            "date": "2022-10-29T05:00:50Z",
            "content": "The bloody hammer attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has sparked increased fears over political violence in America just weeks before the country\u2019s crucial midterm elections. The assault \u2013 by someone who reportedly entered the Democratic leader\u2019s home specifically in search of her \u2013 comes amid an alarming rise in violent rhetoric and threats targeting US lawmakers. As Americans prepare to go to the polls on 8 November, many experts and observers have warned of the danger of acts of political violence. The election has played out in an atmosphere of conspiracy and intimidation amid widespread rightwing claims of voter fraud and persistent evidence-free accusations that the 2020 election was stolen. Paul Pelosi\u2019s assailant reportedly posted on social media numerous far-right conspiracy theories around the election, as well as other issues such as big tech and the Covid-19 pandemic. According to police, a suspect identified as 42-year-old David DePape broke into Pelosi\u2019s San Francisco home and beat her husband with a hammer until officers disarmed him. The suspect is now facing a number of charges, including attempted homicide and assault with a deadly weapon. Pelosi was taken to a nearby hospital, and the speaker\u2019s office said he was expected to make a full recovery. CNN has reported that the assailant appeared to have targeted the speaker, who was not in San Francisco at the time of the attack. The suspect reportedly entered her home shouting, \u201cWhere is Nancy, where is Nancy?\u201d The assault marked the latest in a string of incidents involving threats of violence against American lawmakers, judges and political candidates. In June, a man carrying a gun was arrested outside the home of the supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh after threatening to kill him. A month later, Seattle police responded to a call about a man standing outside the home of Pramila Jayapal and shouting death threats and racial slurs against the progressive congresswoman. Days after that, New York gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin was attacked at a campaign event, when a man with a sharp weapon charged at him. Jayapal weighed in on the assault against Pelosi\u2019s husband, saying on Twitter, \u201cMy heart breaks for @SpeakerPelosi and Paul Pelosi, and for our entire country. This violence is horrific. Our prayers are with them both and their family.\u201d The US Capitol police has reported an overall rise in the number of threats against members of Congress since the deadly January 6 insurrection last year. According to USCP data, officers tracked 9,625 threats and directions of interest (meaning concerning actions or statements) against members of Congress in 2021, compared with 3,939 such instances in 2017. The House sergeant at arms has responded to this worrisome trend by giving lawmakers up to $10,000 to upgrade security at their homes. Although both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have faced a number of threats in recent months, the increase is not evenly distributed along the political spectrum. According to a study conducted by the Anti-Defamation League, rightwing extremists have committed about 75% of the 450 political murders that occurred in the US over the past decade, compared with 4% attributed to leftwing extremists. The January 6 insurrection, which was carried out by a group of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters attempting to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s electoral victory, provided a vivid example of the danger of rightwing extremism. A bipartisan Senate report released in June concluded that seven people died in connection with the insurrection. The words of the man who assaulted Pelosi\u2019s husband on Friday echoed those of the January 6 insurrectionists. One man who participated in the Capitol attack was recorded saying, \u201cWhere are you, Nancy? We\u2019re looking for you.\u201d The attack against Pelosi\u2019s husband prompted calls for Republican lawmakers to condemn the use of threats and violence against political opponents. One of those calls came from Adam Kinzinger, a Republican member of the the House select committee investigating January 6 whose family has received death threats over his work with the panel. \u201cThis morning\u2019s terrifying attack on Paul Pelosi by a man obsessed with election conspiracies is a dangerous reality encouraged by some members of my own party,\u201d Kinzinger said on Twitter. \u201cThis must be condemned by every Member of Congress [and] candidate.

            "date": "2022-10-23T00:39:48Z",
            "content": "The New South Wales transport minister, David Elliott, has lamented factionalism on all sides of politics and ruled out a tilt at Canberra after confirming he would quit politics to avoid a preselection battle. After months of speculation about his future, Elliott, who also serves as veterans minister, announced he would leave at the upcoming election. His seat of Baulkham Hills will be abolished at the 2023 election and Elliott did not have the support for a preselection battle in nearby Castle Hill. He had already ruled out running in his renamed and reshaped home seat of Kellyville to avoid competing against factional ally and current Castle Hill MP, Ray Williams. Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup \u201cI made some inquiries over the course of the last couple of days and it was quite clear that there was no support for me in Castle Hill and I accept that,\u201d he said on Sunday. \u201cContemporary politics is transactional and I accept that. You can\u2019t come into this game and be so thin skinned that you spit the dummy just because a deal is done or [a faction] plays out against you.\u201d Reflecting on comments from the former prime minister John Howard, Elliott said political parties had, to the disappointment of himself and the general public, become ruled by factionalism. \u201cUnfortunately on occasions they\u2019re built around personalities and on this occasion, for some strange reason, my personality didn\u2019t win out,\u201d he said. Elliott is the latest in a string of NSW ministers and MPs leaving before the next state poll. The customer service minister, Victor Dominello, the infrastructure minister, Rob Stokes, and the corrections minister, Geoff Lee, have also announced they will leave at the election. The premier, Dominic Perrottet, said he would have preferred for Elliott to remain in the position over a candidate from his own hard-right faction. \u201cI spoke to David late last night who advised me of his decision. I encouraged him to stay,\u201d he said. The premier dismissed suggestions that there was an issue with the number of senior members of the government leaving at the election and said it was a \u201cnatural part of politics\u201d. \u201cIt is important that new blood comes through,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for renewal.\u201d He said he would consider shuffling the cabinet \u201cin due course\u201d. Elliott has also served as the police, counter-terrorism and emergency services minister. In a statement published to LinkedIn on Saturday night, Elliott thanked the people of Baulkham Hills, police and corrections officers, volunteer and salaried fire fighters, emergency services and transport personnel and his family, including his kids and wife, Nicole. \u201cNicole and I moved to The Hills shire when I was discharged from the Army more than 20 years ago and we immediately felt welcomed,\u201d he said. \u201cWhilst the boys and I have always had a good giggle at the emotion and thought invested into the \u2018constructive feedback\u2019 I\u2019ve sometimes attracted, I know Nicole often took it personally. Her loyalty has been inspirational.\u201d Elliott said he would spend some time playing golf before entering the private sector, ruling out a federal run. The divisive MP has found himself in the centre of multiple scandals, including when he went to bed on the eve of the Sydney train shutdown at the start of the year. He has also overseen a decline in the relationship between the RTBU and the government over pay and conditions. Earlier in the year, Elliott said the union had \u201cshat on me from a great height\u201d. While police minister he was investigated over a road rage incident where he told a P-plate driver he \u201cworked for the cops\u201d. He denied grabbing the 17-year-old driver\u2019s arm during the heated argument on a Sydney road but admitted he claimed to work for the police. He was also known as a political operative willing to speak his mind and go against members of his own party. Elliott said he would not spend the next five months \u201cthrowing spears\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not in my best interest to go and settle scores,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you retire from politics, you need more friends than enemies.\u201d The opposition leader, Chris Minns, praised Elliott for his service to the state, making particular note of the work he had done in the veterans portfolio. He said the senior government member\u2019s departure was a sign that the government\u2019s \u201cbest days are not in front of them\u201d. \u201cTheir most senior politicians are not recontesting and as a result, we\u2019ve got a lot of rookies coming through the system,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2022-10-30T07:23:47Z",
            "content": "Somalia\u2019s president has said he will press ahead with a major offensive against Islamic extremists despite twin car bombings that killed at least 100 people and injured three times as many at a busy junction in the centre of the capital, Mogadishu. The toll in Saturday\u2019s attack \u2013 the country\u2019s deadliest attack since a truck bombing at the same spot five years ago killed more than 500 \u2013 is expected to rise. The al-Shabaab extremist group, which has been waging a deadly insurgency against Somalia\u2019s fragile central government for about 15 years, claimed responsibility, saying it targeted the education ministry. It claimed the ministry was an \u201cenemy base\u201d that receives support from non-Muslim countries and \u201cis committed to removing Somali children from the Islamic faith\u201d. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud told journalists that the country remained at war with al-Shabaab \u201cand we are winning\u201d. \u201cOur people who were massacred \u2026 included mothers with their children in their arms, fathers who had medical conditions, students who were sent to study, businessmen who were struggling with the lives of their families,\u201d Mohamud said after visiting the scene. The bombing came days after Somali officials announced gains by government troops in a key strategic stronghold held by the extremists south of Mogadishu and elsewhere across the country. Al-Shabaab has sought to distance itself from its most bloody attacks and has frequently avoided making claims of responsibility when large numbers of civilians are killed, as in the 2017 blast. Analysts believe that this time the group, which controls much of Somalia\u2019s rural zones, is seeking to send a message to the Somali government as it pushes forward with its new offensive and makes further efforts to recruit clan-based militia. Officials have also said they want to shut down al-Shabaab\u2019s extensive and highly profitable financial network which raises huge sums for the extremists through illegal taxation, racketeering and smuggling. In its statement, al-Shabaab said it was committed to fighting until the country was ruled by Islamic law, and it asked civilians to stay away from government areas. The group want to impose their vision of an Islamic state on Somalia. The attack overwhelmed first responders in Somalia, which has one of the world\u2019s weakest health systems after decades of conflict. At hospitals and elsewhere, frantic relatives looked under plastic sheeting and into body bags, looking for loved ones. Halima Duwane was searching for her uncle, Abdullahi Jama. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether he is dead or alive but the last time we communicated he was around here,\u201d she said, crying. Witnesses to the attack were stunned. \u201cI couldn\u2019t count the bodies on the ground due to the [number of] fatalities,\u201d said witness Abdirazak Hassan. He said the first blast hit the perimeter wall of the education ministry, where street vendors and money changers were located. Mohamed Moalim, who owns a small restaurant near the intersection, said his wife, Fardawsa Mohamed, a mother of six, rushed to the scene after the first explosion to try to help. \u201cWe failed to stop her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was killed by the second blast.\u201d Abdiasis Abdi, a 22-year-old student, spent hours into the night looking for his sister who last said she lived in Zobe, a busy commercial hub with restaurants, pharmacies and banks hit by the car bombs. \u201cWe found her this morning with only some of her clothes recognisable,\u201d Abdi said. Her body had been completely charred. \u201cI have never seen a horrible scene like that.\u201d An Associated Press journalist at the scene said the second blast occurred in front of a busy restaurant during lunchtime. The blasts demolished tuk-tuks and other vehicles in an area of many restaurants and hotels. Mohamed Ganey described seeing victims \u201cscattered\u201d on hospital floors as they looked for his missing sister-in-law. But the joy of finding her did not last long. \u201cUnfortunately, she died from the injuries just a few minutes after we found her. Everybody is shocked. The only question people have in common today is why kill so many innocent people?\u201d \u201cWe ask our international partners and Muslims around the world to send their medical doctors here since we can\u2019t send all the victims outside the country for treatment,\u201d Mohamud, who was elected earlier this year, said. Medics also appealed for blood. In August Mohamud pledged a \u201ctotal war\u201d against al-Shabaab, one of the most tenacious Islamist extremist groups in the world, after the group attacked a hotel in Mogadishu, killing 23 people. It was not immediately clear how vehicles loaded with explosives again made it to the high-profile location in Mogadishu, a city thick with checkpoints and constantly on alert for attacks. The US has described al-Shabaab as one of al-Qaida\u2019s deadliest organisations and targeted it with scores of airstrikes in recent years. Hundreds of US military personnel have returned to Somalia after Donald Trump withdrew them, and drones are now once more being used intensively to disrupt extremist operations. Last week US Africa Command said it had conducted an airstrike against al-Shabaab fighters who were attacking Somali National Army forces near Buulobarde, Somalia, about 135 miles (218km) north-northwest of Mogadishu. The extremists have already responded to the offensive by killing prominent clan leaders in an apparent effort to undermine grassroots support for the government. Somalia\u2019s government offensive comes as the country is facing a devastating famine. The UN has warned that more than 7 million people face acute food insecurity amid the driest conditions in 40 years, after three consecutive failed rainy seasons. \u201cDrought is compounding the impacts of other recurrent climate shocks, persistent insecurity and instability [and] immediate action is needed to avert a humanitarian catastrophe,\u201d the World Food Programme has said.

            "date": "2022-10-19T15:41:46Z",
            "content": "Samia Suluhu Hassan, the president of Tanzania, has called for better birth control in the east African country in a dramatic reversal of the stance of her authoritarian predecessor, John Magufuli. Since taking power last year, Samia has won praise for her efforts to reverse many of Magufuli\u2019s more controversial policies, most notably his denial of the dangers posed by Covid in Tanzania. Magufuli had described users of contraceptive as \u201clazy\u201d and said that birth control was unnecessary because \u201ceducation is now free\u201d and food cheap. A committed Roman Catholic, the former president also banned young women from returning to school after pregnancy. Samia\u2019s call for more birth control came after a visit to the west of Tanzania, where she learned that more than 1,000 children had been born in a single clinic in one month. \u201cI was told in a Buselesele ward in Geita region [that] one health centre produces 1,000 children a month,\u201d Hassan said. \u201cNow how many classes will be needed after three years? What of health centres? How many will be needed to serve all these children? How many tonnes of food will be needed? Let\u2019s reduce the speed and have a control on this.\u201d Low levels of contraceptive use is one reason for high birthrates in Tanzania, where women have almost five children each on average, according to the World Bank. The number has dropped dramatically over recent years, down from nearly six 20 years ago and seven in 1980, but is still considered far too high. Samia, formerly vice-president, became Africa\u2019s only political female leader after Magufuli died from heart disease in 2021. Soon afterwards she was vaccinated against Covid. Magufuli had refused to allow health authorities to count Covid cases, expressed scepticism about the vaccine and said he preferred traditional remedies to social distancing. She has moved to ease the repression of opposition figures that marked Magufuli\u2019s later years in power, pushing through measures designed to attract investment and bringing more women into government. Though Samia has said she had to fight to gain acceptance as a female leader, she also angered people by saying that some female footballers who won trophies for Tanzania were too masculine looking to attract husbands."

Australian Red Cross Lifeblood\u2019s Stuart Chesneau said the early diagnosis of serious medical conditions like cancer and improved care was behind the growing need for plasma. Early diagnosis has really driven up a lot of demand. It has gone up between seven and 10 per cent every year for the last decade. We\u2019ve got the highest voluntary rate of plasma donation in the world per capita, but still the demand for those products continue to rise. Chesneau said rules on who can donate plasma were not as strict as those for donating blood. \u201cIf you got a tattoo today, you can donate plasma tomorrow. There is no delay at all,\u201d he said.

It is a cautionary tale about what it looks like when you risk getting that wrong. And so that\u2019s not irrelevant to us as we put together our own budget to hand down this month.

Before the launch of the new course, it says, Australian submarine commanding officers were trained in the UK with the Royal Navy and by the Royal Netherlands Navy. The minister for defence personnel, Matt Keogh, said the new course \u201cculminated in a rigorous sea-phase that tested participants in undersea and special warfare scenarios\u201d. He said in a statement: I congratulate the newly qualified submarine commanders for passing the demanding course. The men and women of the Australian Defence Force are our most important capability, so upskilling them to meet our current and future needs is critical. Our Navy can\u2019t wait until new capabilities are ready to train the next generation of leaders \u2013 these commanders must be fully equipped for when the submarines enter into service. A quick reminder: The government expects to make an announcement early next year about how to put into practice the plan to acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines in conjunction with the US and the UK. Did you spot a shooting star over the weekend? It might have been Australia\u2019s first Binar spacecraft coming back down to Earth.

Binar-1 became a real \u201cBinar\u201d as it re-entered Earth\u2019s atmosphere over the weekend.

The latest from the Bureau of Meteorology Looks like the NT and WA are the places to be for the next week: Significant rain and storms are expected to move over the eastern states from late Tuesday. Showers and thunderstorms will increase, particularly over southern South Australia (including Adelaide), and extend into north-west Victoria and the New South Wales South Coast. By Wednesday morning, rain is expected to move further east into Queensland, central NSW, South Australia, and Victoria, with widespread showers and storms peaking in the afternoon and evening. There will be moderate to major flooding in already flooded rivers in NSW, Victoria, and possibly Tasmania and southern Queensland. From Thursday, storm activity will decrease with a slight easing of showers across Queensland, NSW, Victoria and Tasmania by the evening. There\u2019s more, but that\u2019s probably enough for now.

The report, which was finished a year ago but only released today, warned that urgent action was needed to avert the shortages. According to AAP, the report was also written before the Omicron variant hit. The low unemployment rate could also exacerbate the situation. Skills minister, Brendan O\u2019Connor, said the previous government\u2019s delay had \u201conly compounded the problems the sector faces\u201d. He said: Australians deserve to know the truth. Locking a report in a drawer won\u2019t trick Australians, who know there is a challenge that needs to be confronted. O\u2019Connor said the federal government was committed to improving attraction, retention and the sustainability of the care workforce: I am also taking action to address the urgent skills crisis by establishing Jobs and Skills Australia. This is a key priority for me that will fast-track improved workforce planning, including the care sector.

Now he wants the whole investigation done by Christmas. Kennett told radio station KIIS he wanted the AFL to call all parties together, according to AAP: My own preference would be that the AFL, through their new process that they are setting up, call all parties together. All parties agree to sit down and talk it through. And therefore, through mediation, we could have this wrapped up by Christmas. I don\u2019t know if all parties, given the damage that has been done now and the pain that both parties are feeling, I don\u2019t know if that will be possible or not. That is my desire.

I now hand you over to the fantastic (SA based) Tory Shepherd! Speaking of daylight saving \u2026 Who knew there was a special quarter-hour based time zone in Western Australia? Eucla, the eastern-most locality in Western Australia, population 53 people (according to the 2016 census) can boast of having its very own 45-minute time zone. The location in the Goldfields-Esperance region, approximately 11 kilometres west of the South Australian border, is the only one in the country to use Australian Central Western Standard Time (ACWST) which is 8:45 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time. Its local time differs by 45 minutes instead of the normal whole hour, meaning that it\u2019s currently 10.37am in Eucla and 9.53am elsewhere in the state. Apparently coworkers from WA and SA at Eucla Telegraph Station used to get very confused, so the two states gave them their own time zone. The zone still exists although Eucla hasn\u2019t had a telegraph station for many decades.

Hay fever tablet changes cell memory, study finds A daily pill can change immune cell memory and reduce allergic reactions like hay fever and thunderstorm asthma, new research shows, AAP reports. A study led by Monash university found Victorians who took the prescribed medication Oralair for four months in the lead-up to allergy season for three consecutive years had retrained immune cells and had long-term protection against allergic reactions. In 2019, researchers studied 27 Victorians allergic to ryegrass pollen; half of them took the daily tablet consisting of grass pollen under the tongue and the others received antihistamines. Monash University\u2019s Central Clinical School lead researcher Menno van Zelm said: This is very good news ... we compared the samples before and after for any changes in immune memory and what we found is [in] the bases treated with the tablet \u2013 their immune cells that responded to ryegrass pollen had changed. The cells in the patients that were not treated with the medication had not changed. He added the early markers in the sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) will ensure the right patients get the right treatment. More than 4.6m Australians suffer from hay fever, which is often triggered by an allergic reaction to outdoor or indoor allergens like pollen and dust mites, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. In 2016, Melbourne had the world\u2019s largest epidemic thunderstorm asthma event, with thousands of people developing breathing difficulties and at least nine deaths. Australian camera operator drops camera to help people fleeing Hurricane Ian In journalism the moral responsibility to bear witness can rub uncomfortably against the competing reflex to take action.

In the midst of Hurricane Ian devastating Florida, the balance for the Australian camera man for Sunrise Glen Ellis fell to stepping out from behind the camera in order to help. You can watch that moment here: Submarine commanders to be Australian made The navy is preparing to train the next generation of submarine commanders at home as Australia seeks to bolster its military prowess ahead of the arrival of the nuclear vessels, AAP reports. Australia is set to acquire nuclear-propelled submarines from either the US or UK under the trilateral AUKUS security arrangement. The subs are expected to arrive in the late 2030s, with reports Washington could expedite some for the middle of that decade. The federal government is working to train up sovereign domestic nuclear and naval industries so Australia is ready to handle the coveted nuclear secrets of our allies. Defence Personnel Minister Matt Keogh said the inaugural submarine command course met international standards after vigorous undersea and special warfare tests. He said: Our navy can\u2019t wait until new capabilities are ready to train the next generation of leaders. These commanders must be fully equipped for when the submarines enter into service. Australian submarine commanders have been training with the UK and Dutch navies. Defence minister Richard Marles recently announced that Australian personnel would train on British nuclear submarines as part of an effort to upskill the nation\u2019s defence force. Marles is set to make the decision about which submarine Australia will go with by March 2023. Standing alongside his US counterpart Lloyd Austin in Hawaii on Sunday, he told reporters the timeline for the first submarine was pertinent in the decision. Marles said the pair also discussed closer defence industry cooperation to make sharing information \u201cseamless\u201d between the two nations. Should we abolish daylight saving time \u2013 or apply it across Australia? It\u2019s that time of year again when people who have very strong opinions about daylights savings express them.

Two men killed in Western Australian helicopter crash Two men have been killed in a helicopter crash in the Western Australian wheatbelt, AAP reports. The two-seat Robinson R22 helicopter went down near the Cowcowing Lakes at Booralaming on Sunday. It had left Koorda earlier in the day along with 10 planes taking part in a club event. When the two men failed to arrive at Jandakot Airport, police were alerted about 3.45pm by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority\u2019s joint rescue coordination centre. An AMSA search jet then found the wreck. Police went to the scene and confirmed there were no survivors. A man in his 70s and another in his 50s died. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is sending investigators to the scene on Monday and WA Police are preparing a report for the coroner. Chief Commissioner Angus Mitchell said in a statement: Over coming days ATSB investigators will survey and map the accident site and collect any relevant components for further examination and analysis at the ATSB\u2019s technical facilities tin Canberra. They will also obtain and review any recorded data, weather information, witness reports, and aircraft operator procedures and maintenance records. Anyone who may have seen or heard the aircraft in any phase of its flight, or who may have footage of any kind is asked to contact witness@atsb.gov.au. A preliminary report is expected in six to eight weeks. Flood warning for the Snowy River Reactions to Syrian rescue mission stress children\u2019s safety is paramount Environment minister Tanya Plibersek this morning spoke to the Seven Network about the government\u2019s decision to launch a rescue mission for women and children trapped in Syrian detention camps. Plibersek said the government will be following the advice of national security agencies, and stressed the families will require counselling. We\u2019ve got about 40 Australian kids living in one of the most dangerous places on earth in a refugee camp. Some of the women, some of the mothers, were taken there as little more than children themselves and married off to IS fighters. Some of them tricked. Some of them forced to go there. When they come back to Australia, I think it\u2019s going to be very important that the children, in particular, receive counselling, but I think for everybody involved there will be an ongoing expectation that our security and intelligence agencies will stay in contact with them and monitor them. While the shadow home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, has said the government\u2019s decision is concerning, the opposition immigration spokesman, Dan Tehan, said it appeared the security situation had changed to allow for the repatriation after the reported mission. Mat Tinkler, the CEO of Save the Children, a humanitarian organisation that has been calling on the government to support the children in these camps, said the repatriation \u201ccan\u2019t come soon enough\u201d. Children have died in these camps. Australian children are poorly nourished, suffering from untreated shrapnel wounds, and the situation is impacting their mental health. He told the ABC that when he travelled to the Syrian detention camps, the women guaranteed that they would cooperate with the authorities upon their arrival in Australia. When I went to the camps in June, I asked the women individually, \u2018Are you willing to cooperate fully with law enforcement authorities on your arrival?\u2019 They said yes. And they also offered \u2013 and this is unprecedented \u2013 to have a terrorism control order applied on them by consent. That means every aspect of their life can be monitored by an ankle bracelet, communications monitor, under house arrest effectively. So there\u2019s no risk that we can\u2019t mitigate with our robust security architecture here in Australia. The biggest risk right now is that one of the Australian children will die if they\u2019re not repatriated from the camps quite urgently. \u2013 with AAP The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, wants to see lifetime bans imposed on fans who sang fascist songs and made Hitler salutes at Saturday night\u2019s Australia Cup final in Sydney. Speaking on Monday morning in Greenacre, he condemned the behaviour and said it had no place in NSW. What we saw the other day was terrible. It was absolutely horrendous. It has no place, not just at sporting games, but anywhere in our state. If they are caught, there should be life bans in place. Once they are caught, they are not going back to a game in this state. He said anyone caught doing similar things in the future should also be immediately barred. Brazil election getting closer to a final result We love our blogs at the Guardian, if you haven\u2019t noticed, and you might want to check out what\u2019s happening with our Brazil election live blog as the final result is getting closer. The frontrunner is Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, who became the country\u2019s first working-class president in 2002. He stepped down after two terms in 2010 with approval ratings close to 90%, bolstered by the prosperity off the back of the continent\u2019s commodity boom. His opponent is the far-right incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, who, since 2019, has led an administration marked by incendiary speech, his testing of democratic institutions, his widely criticised handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and the worst deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in 15 years. It looks like Lula is ahead, but he will struggle to get the 50% required to prevent a runoff vote. Brunswick scooter riders on notice from this morning Victorian police are ramping up their focus on e-scooters riders in the Brunswick area, as they say the mode of transport is increasing in popularity among locals but so too are the frequency of incidents. The operation led by Fawkner Highway Patrol starts this morning and will see police engage with early morning commuters to ensure compliance with legislation around e-scooters. In a statement, police said: The concerted focus comes following several incidents in the surrounding areas involving e-scooters, including one that left a man with life threatening injuries in Pascoe Vale on 22 September. Investigators were told a man was riding an e-scooter along Cornwall Road when it appeared he lost control of the scooter while travelling over a speed-hump at around 8.20am. The rider was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries and the investigation into the collision is ongoing. Brunswick is not an area included in the Department of Transport\u2019s trial across the City of Melbourne, the City of Yarra, and the City of Port Phillip. Current legislation deems any non-trial e-scooter that can travel over 10km/h or emits over 200 watts is illegal and cannot be ridden on public roads, bike lanes or footpaths. High-powered e-scooters are considered motor vehicles and riders can attract a $925 fine for using an unregistered vehicle, with e-scooters currently unable to be registered and ridden legally on roads. Rain, rain go away \u2013 please We\u2019ve all heard about a \u201cthreepeat\u201d La Ni\u00f1a and many of us have got used to Indian Ocean dipoles* lifting the odds of above-average rainfall for most of Australia. In the next week and more, we\u2019ll see those odds being realised in the form of another bout of rain in the east. Swollen rivers across the eastern states are going to swell a bit more \u2013 with flooding likely in some areas. Near Sydney, Warragamba Dam, easily the biggest in the city\u2019s system, has started to spill again, as will most of the other dams. Whether that triggers flooding again in the benighted Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley seems a little unlikely on current forecasts. Still, Richmond on the Hawkesbury section of the river has a BoM prediction of 30mm or so for both Saturday and Sunday, so there will be some damp spells ahead. As we noted the other day, September itself was another relatively wet month. The average rainfall of 33.62mm across the country was less than September in 2010 and 2016, but before that you have to go back to 1917 to find a wetter September. All that moisture in the soil and the cloud cover tends to moderate temperatures, as we saw last month: But there was quite a difference between days and nights, with maximums relatively cool (even cold) in parts of the country. Minimums, though, were typically warmer than average. Global heating, of course, nudges the background temperatures higher so the chances of unusual warmth, versus historical levels, continue to climb. *The Indian Ocean dipole measures how sea-surface temperatures on the west and eastern parts of the ocean basin compare with each other. The current spell is in its \u201cnegative phase\u201d, with the east relatively warm, increasing the odds of more convection and north-west cloud bands forming, channeling more rain toward the nation\u2019s south-east. Victorian government pledges new Gippsland hospital if re-elected The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has this morning announced his government will build a new West Gippsland hospital, based in Drouin East, if re-elected in November. The Andrews government has pledged between $610-675m for more beds, a bigger emergency department and more operating theatres. Regulators want banks to explain refusals Australia\u2019s banks could be forced to explain to customers their reasons for refusing services under proposed reforms by the nation\u2019s financial regulatory agencies body, AAP reports. The Council of Financial Regulators has recommended four main policy responses to address the problem of de-banking, where a bank declines to offer or withdraws banking services to a customer. In a joint statement, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, and financial services minister, Stephen Jones, welcomed the paper, saying the issue mainly affected the financial technology, digital currency exchange and remittance sectors. The statement reads: De-banking can increase the risks for affected businesses by forcing them to conduct transactions exclusively in cash. The government is committed to promoting innovation and competition in the financial services sector and will continue to work with affected customers. Collecting de-banking data, new transparency and fairness measures, published guidance on risk tolerance to affected sectors by the major four banks and funding targeted education are the key reforms. Banks would be required to document their reason for refusing a customer and provide those reasons to the individual or business. Those customers would then be pointed to the bank\u2019s dispute resolution process and given at least 30 days\u2019 notice before services were closed off to them. The research calls for the \u201clack of systemic data on the extent and nature of de-banking practices\u201d to be addressed through voluntary data collection by the big four. The government said it would formally respond to the recommendations at a later date. Sydney\u2019s main dam starting to spill again Nationals embark on \u2018Listening Tour\u2019 to win back regional women and youth The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has spoken to Sky News this morning about this \u201cListening Tour\u201d the Nationals tour are embarking on, starting in Mildura tomorrow before moving to the NSW north coast and getting to Queensland by the end of the year. Women and youth are set to be the focus of this tour, because Littleproud says despite investing money there has been a lack of connection between the party and these stakeholders. He says the Coalition lost the trust of women not just in metropolitan areas, but also rural areas. Littleproud admits: We didn\u2019t handle Brittany Higgins all that well. In fact, we handed it poorly. While the Nationals didn\u2019t lose the heartland seats the Liberals did at the last election, their safe margins came under major threat. Guardian Australia\u2019s rural editor Gabrielle Chan wrote this very insightful piece after the May election on how community-based independents and regional migration saw huge margins slim down in many electorates like Nicholls and Cowper. \u2018If Labor doesn\u2019t perform \u2026 there will be community efforts against them\u2019: Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court\u2019s Climate 200 organisation backed nine independent candidates at the last federal election who all won their seats, in one of the most notable features of the May election. Holmes \u00e0 Court has published a book about his experience, The Big Teal, and was interviewed about it on ABC Radio this morning. Why did he decide to write the book? There was a lot of misinformation during the campaign about the movement, so I wanted to correct some of that, but I also wanted to situate Climate 200 and myself as part of the much greater movement \u2026 which started over a decade ago when Cathy McGowan took on Sophie Mirabella in the seat of Indi. Asked about the impact Climate 200 might have at the upcoming Victorian state election, he said the state\u2019s donation laws make it harder for independent candidates. The Victorian laws have done a great job in removing the nexus between big business and politics, and removing the opportunity for quid pro quo. While that\u2019s good, they\u2019ve made it much harder for new entrants to come in. In a way we\u2019ve entrenched a two party system. It is more difficult, but there are four very good candidates Climate 200 is supporting. Will Climate 200 be targeting Labor safe seats at the next federal election? We don\u2019t target seats. The question is: will the community stand up and which seats will they stand up in? If Labor doesn\u2019t perform on these issues, if they frustrate the electorate on these issues, then they can be assured there will be community efforts against them. We\u2019ll see this movement grow. Fracking in Lake Eyre the \u2018height of folly\u2019, report suggests The expansion of fracking in the Lake Eyre basin would be the \u201cabsolute height of folly\u201d and its high-cost, high-emissions unconventional gas could rapidly create stranded assets, a report has found. The basin \u2013 home to one of the world\u2019s last major free-flowing desert river systems \u2013 sprawls over nearly one-sixth of the Australian continent, covering parts of the Northern Territory, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. Further RBA rate rises likely to accelerate property price declines Real estate prices are falling in most of Australia (Darwin is a holdout!), according to CoreLogic. We have this version of its monthly report here: The rate of declines eased slightly in September from August but CoreLogic reckons that downward tilt will steepen again if the RBA keeps raising rates. There\u2019s always a lot of focus on home values rather than rents because about a third of the population has paid off their mortgages and another third are paying them off. But for renters \u2013 who make up an increasing share of the population \u2013 the arrow is still pointed upwards. Compared with a year ago, rents are about 10%. Interestingly, for units average rents are up 11.8% and for houses 9.4%, according to Tim Lawless, research director for CoreLogic. For September alone, the rise was 1.1% for units and 0.5% for houses, indicating there\u2019s a switch towards higher-density residences. Lawless says average rents are about $50 a week higher than a year ago, which suggests a \u201cceiling\u201d might be reached in terms of what many people can afford. Tracking Australia\u2019s progress on the climate crisis and the consequences of global heating Guardian Australia\u2019s data magicians, Nick Evershed and Josh Nicholas, together with climate and environment editor Adam Morton, have put together this fantastic interactive which tracks Australia\u2019s progress on the climate crisis. While terms like carbon budget and emissions targets tend to evaporate in the ether of political discussion, this data blog visualises Australia\u2019s contribution to the climate emergency, and tracks our country\u2019s efforts to address it in a really concrete way. Have a look and play around with the settings to understand things like how excluding emissions from land use and forestry can change the picture of Australia\u2019s emissions. Victorian schools get $7.8m for disability needs More than 40 Victorian schools will be upgraded and made more inclusive for students with disabilities as part of a $7.89m funding boost by the state government, AAP reports. Indoor and outdoor learning spaces will be improved to enable better teaching practices and provide opportunities for sensory experiences and peer socialisation. Play areas will also be transformed with new facilities and stimulating and accessible equipment. Education minister Natalie Hutchins said: We\u2019re ensuring every child and young person in Victoria can meet their potential and access great education \u2013 regardless of their background, abilities or differences. Among the schools to receive funding are Briagolong primary school, which has been allocated $200,000 for a new inclusive playground. Ripponlea primary school will also receive $177,834 for a dedicated outdoor inclusive learning space and Stawell West primary school will use $67,519 in funding to upgrade a new indoor area. The Victorian government launched the inclusive schools fund in 2015 and, since then, more than 340 creative projects to build inclusive learning spaces and inclusive playgrounds have been announced. The government has invested $12.8bn to building new schools and more than 1,850 school upgrades over the past eight years. Optus not forthcoming on breach, Tanya Plibersek says A federal minister has slammed Optus for not being forthcoming with either customers or the government more than a week on from the cyber attack, AAP reports. Tanya Plibersek said while people had been receiving their bills on time, the telco had not told customers whether their personal details had been stolen. She told the Seven Network: One of the real problems is the lack of communication by Optus, both with its customers and the government. I don\u2019t think the company is doing a particularly good job with its customers or providing the government with the information we need to keep people safe. It\u2019s extraordinary we don\u2019t have any Medicare numbers or Centrelink numbers that may have been compromised. Nationals MP and former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce said Optus had \u201ccompromised their capacity to do their job\u201d. Joyce told Seven Network: Those in the know say it wasn\u2019t a very sophisticated way to get into the Optus information. He questioned why the telco had \u201cbeen so lax\u201d about the data breach. Why can\u2019t they protect your privacy and get back to people and say we have a real problem here and be careful? Optus was also slammed by Albanese government ministers for not responding to its requests for information to help protect almost 10 million Australians from fraud at a press conference yesterday. Services Australia wrote to Optus on Tuesday asking for the full details of all customers who had their Medicare cards or Centrelink Concession Cards compromised to boost security measures. The government said Optus was yet to respond to the request. \u2018I\u2019m not going to be happy about any seat we lose\u2019 Karen Andrews was also asked about comments that came out of the Conservative Political Action Conference Australia yesterday, where federal vice-president Teena McQueen welcomed the defeat of \u201clefties\u201d within the party. If you want to read more on that, my colleague Josh Butler was in attendance: Andrews said in response to McQueen\u2019s comments: I\u2019m not going to be happy about any seat we lose. We need to look at the principles of the Liberal party \u2026 we need to regroup, which we are doing under Peter Dutton and revisit the policies we took to the last election. We need to be much better at selling to Australians why we are the best party. \u2018Biggest wake-up call\u2019 from the Optus breach is to government, shadow home affairs minister says Karen Andrews continues her criticism of the government in its response to the massive Optus data breach. She says Optus has serious questions it needs to answer but that the government\u2019s response has also been lacking. She said they were late in their responses and didn\u2019t set out what customers could be doing to protect themselves. I\u2019m not going to absolve Optus of its corporate responsibility but there is a role for government. She said there was \u201cno evidence to support Australia being five years behind\u201d in cybersecurity protections, as home affairs minister Clare O\u2019Neil has claimed, criticising the former government. Does Andrews support immediate move to stop companies retaining data for long periods of time? She says she would be \u201chappy to look at legislation\u201d and that there are \u201ca range of issues what data is kept and how it\u2019s kept\u201d but largely doesn\u2019t answer the question of whether she will support the government\u2019s plans for immediate action on data retention. She says the \u201cbiggest wake-up call\u201d from the Optus breach is to the Labor government. Karen Andrews, the shadow home affairs minister, is speaking to ABC radio about the decision that has been taken by government to launch a rescue mission for Australian women and children trapped in Syrian detention camps. It\u2019s a move she decided against when she was the minister responsible in government. She tells ABC Radio she believes the decision is \u201cvery concerning\u201d and that she wasn\u2019t prepare to bring them home for three reasons. She wasn\u2019t prepared to risk Australian officials going into Syria to extract these people from the camps. She was also concerned about the radicalisation of the women and children, and the risk of them back to Australia. She said it posed an unnecessary risk and an enormous cost to be supervised in the community. Does she accept it\u2019s accept it\u2019s Australia\u2019s responsibility to bring its citizens back home? Andrews emphasises the \u201cwomen went there by choice and made their own decisions to be in Syria\u201d. They were complicit in the role they were expected to play \u2026 to support Isis and the foreign fighters there. That was the view at the time and I\u2019ve seen nothing to alter my view. Andrews believes they \u201cabsolutely should be\u201d subject to significant surveillance and control upon their return to Australia. Australian home values have fallen for a fifth consecutive month, with prices dropping in all capitals except Darwin, AAP reports. Home values across the country dropped 1.4% in September after a 1.6% fall in August, according to CoreLogic\u2019s national Home Value Index. In the capital cities, Sydney values were down 1.8% in the month, while Melbourne values fell 1.1% and in Brisbane they dropped 1.7%. Adelaide and Perth saw small monthly reductions of 0.2% and 0.4% respectively, while in Darwin values remained flat. The September decline marks the fifth fall in a row in the national index as the impact of consecutive interest rate hikes plays out in the property market. Anti-corruption commission hearings should be held in public, Lambie says Jacqui Lambie was also asked about the details of the government\u2019s national anti-corruption commission, revealed in parliament last week. One of the major points of contention is the fact that most hearings will be held in private. Lambie is asked why it would be important for the commission to hold hearings in public, given that it will report the outcome of its work? If people are doing the wrong things \u2026 anybody else in a normal court system has to go through that system and if that means being out in the public arena, that\u2019s what happens. Lambie criticises government going public with revelation of Syrian rescue mission But Jacqui Lambie has questioned the fact the government is revealing details of this mission so early: Nobody seems to be talking about these interpreters and their families that helped our men and women in Afghanistan who are stuck there \u2026 and this seems to have gone wayside. Lambie says she would like the Labor party to be honest about the safety of the interpreters: It\u2019s absurd they\u2019re prepared to put this detail out \u2026 when they\u2019re saying it\u2019s going to be dangerous. I\u2019m surprised they\u2019re letting that out there and they\u2019re not just doing it at the cover of darkness. From the briefing I\u2019ve had over the last three years, it is a great risk to try and bring these people home, not just getting them out of there \u2026 but whether or not they\u2019ve been radicalised. They\u2019ve obviously done their homework, they believe it\u2019s the right time, so we just have to trust the decisions of Asio. Senator Jacqui Lambie is speaking to ABC Radio about this news that the government is planning a mission to rescue Australian women and children trapped in Syrian detention camps. She supports the government bringing them home but says there is a great risk in terms of the possibility of radicalisation and emphasises there is the need for great support for those Australians upon their repatriation: With their children, they\u2019re going to need a lot of help when they return home, a lot of that will be psychological \u2026 this will be an ongoing saga for the rest of their lives, no doubt. Lambie has visited the detention camps where the women and children have been living. They are god damn bloody awful \u2026 they are crowded in those tents there. There is rape and an awful lot of abuse. You want to do the right humanitarian thing and bring them home. Is Lambie\u2019s support conditional upon ensuring the repatriation is safe? I think they\u2019re Australia\u2019s responsibility \u2013 we don\u2019t have any choice. After revealing this story exclusively yesterday, Guardian Australia\u2019s immigration correspondent Ben Doherty has more on the support these women and children will need today: Gas industry expect to receive bigger tax bill Australia\u2019s gas exporters predict they will pay billions of dollars more next year \u2013 mostly through income tax. This year the Australia Institute reported that five of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association\u2019s top members had paid no income tax for at least seven years. Others had paid minimal amounts, despite billions of dollars in revenue. The institute\u2019s analysis of tax data found most of those were foreign-owned, \u201cresulting in all profits heading straight offshore\u201d. Appea now says its forecasts show liquefied natural gas exporters will pay almost about $14bn next financial year, more than twice as much as the $4.8bn forecast for last financial year. Of the extra $9bn, corporate income tax makes up almost $7bn. The rest comes from the petroleum resource rent tax, state royalties and excises. There have been calls for a windfall, or super profits tax for fossil fuel exporters as their revenues soar in the wake of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has repeatedly ruled that out as an option. Appea chief executive Samantha McCulloch said the forecasts demonstrated the value of the industry for the Australian economy, and that tax payments were being brought forward as the industry made up for losses in previous years: These forecasts demonstrate some of the direct financial value to the economy and the Australian public of long-term taxation settings that underpin these large, capital-intensive and complex projects. But focussing solely on revenue for determining the industry\u2019s economic contribution ignores our far wider role \u2013 employing 165,000 people along the supply chain, building infrastructure, powering homes and businesses and facilitating growth \u2013 which has been estimated at enabling almost $500bn of economic activity annually. Jim Chalmers fears a global recession is probable, telling the Financial Review this morning that the recession risk in many major economies had tipped from \u201cpossible to probable\u201d. The treasurer\u2019s grim global outlook comes as rapidly rising interest rates at home make a downturn more likely, with markets tipping the central bank to raise interests rates for a sixth time in as many months at its meeting tomorrow. Experts are leaning towards another 50 basis point hike, which would lift the cash rate from the target of 2.35% to 2.85%. In more economic news, house prices have fallen for a fifth consecutive month, with values across the country dropping by 1.4% in September after a 1.6% fall in August. The new data out from CoreLogic\u2019s national Home Value Index showed prices dropped in all capitals except Darwin. Meanwhile, shadow home affairs minister Karen Andrews has raised concerns about the government\u2019s mission to rescue dozens of Australian women and children trapped in Syrian detention camps, which Guardian Australia exclusively revealed yesterday. Andrews told the ABC: Labor needs to assure Australians that individuals who may have been radicalised pose no threat upon their return to Australia \u2014 and explain the efforts they\u2019re going to undertake to monitor and rehabilitate these individuals. Save the Children Australia chief executive Matt Tinkler, who has been campaigning for the women and children to be repatriated, told the ABC it would be \u201cwelcome news\u201d if the repatriation was successful. Let\u2019s kick off!"

            "date": "2022-10-10T08:58:14Z",
            "content": "Taiwan\u2019s president has called for domestic political unity to combat Chinese disinformation and cyberwarfare destabilising society before next month\u2019s local elections. Addressing crowds at Taiwan\u2019s de facto National Day on Monday, Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan had to increase its resilience and international standing in the face of China\u2019s growing authoritarianism. She warned Beijing that Taiwan would not give up its democracy or sovereignty, but she remained willing to restart communications \u2013 which China cut off after her election in 2016. \u201cOnly by respecting the commitment of the Taiwanese people to our sovereignty, democracy, and freedom can there be a foundation for resuming constructive interaction across the Taiwan Strait,\u201d Tsai said. Beijing has sworn to annex Taiwan, which it claims is a province of China, and its threats have increased in recent years. As well as increased military action towards Taiwan, China has also been accused of waging cyberwarfare. Chinese disinformation efforts often increase during Taiwanese election periods, and local elections, scheduled for late November, are often seen as a precursor to presidential elections, which follow about a year later. \u201cTaiwan is one of the countries most targeted by information warfare, a non-traditional security threat that persistently interferes with the functioning of our democratic system,\u201d said Tsai. Differences and debate were welcome \u201cbut we should unanimously and resolutely stand behind our free and democratic system, no matter how much external pressure we face\u201d. Tsai pledged to improve transparency and anti-disinformation work to combat foreign infiltration and sabotage, citing the daily pandemic briefings as an example which informed the public and reduced panic and misinformation. She compared China\u2019s \u201cbullying\u201d of its neighbour and its expansion into the South and East China Seas to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cWe absolutely cannot ignore the challenge that these military expansions pose to the free and democratic world order \u2026 The destruction of Taiwan\u2019s democracy and freedom would be a grave defeat for the world\u2019s democracies,\u201d she said, praising local Taiwanese enthusiasm for civilian defence training. She said it was the best example of being \u201call in this together\u201d. Chinese officials have said Taiwanese people would be subjected to \u201cre-education\u201d after invasion, and that pro-independence advocates would be punished under Chinese law. Tsai also sought to reassure the international community that the tensions were not a threat to the global semiconductor supply \u2013 the majority of which comes from Taiwan. \u201cThe concentration of the semiconductor sector in Taiwan is not a risk, but is the key to the reorganisation of the global semiconductor industry,\u201d she said, pledging to help \u201coptimise\u201d a worldwide restructuring of the chip supply chain, with Taiwanese firms playing a prominent role. Double Ten Day, or 10 October, commemorates the start of the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, which ultimately led to the establishment of the Republic of China, Taiwan\u2019s official name. After the Chinese civil war the ROC government fled to the island of Taiwan and established a government in exile there. Double Ten day is still celebrated in Taiwan, more recently as a de facto national celebration. A few thousand spectators were granted access to the highly secure event area via a lottery, sitting opposite the president and hundreds of dignitaries. Johnny Hsiao told the Guardian he enjoyed the event, but things had changed. \u201cTaiwan Strait is more in conflict now, and opinions are more divided. \u201cI think the status is a little nervous \u2026 but we think it\u2019s safe,\u201d Hsiao said. \u201cI think it\u2019s part of the DPP government\u2019s strategy to make Taiwan people think about independence. Most Taiwan people, including me, want to keep it stable and nobody wants to have any war between China and Taiwan.\u201d This year\u2019s formal celebrations were smaller than in 2021, which was a display of military might, including the parading of missiles and other heavy artillery. Instead it focused on bilateral friendships, with personal thanks to the visiting president of Palau, which is one of just 14 governments that recognise Taiwan. It also heavily featured Japanese connections. Japan switched recognition to China 50 years ago, but is culturally, politically and strategically close to Taiwan, particularly as China grows more aggressive. In her speech, Tsai noted that Taiwan will fully reopen its borders on Wednesday, for the first time since the pandemic began in January 2020. Taiwan ran one of the strictest and most successful responses of the pandemic, but had been slow to reopen to international visitors despite having tens of thousands of local cases a day. \u201cI\u2019m happy about this, it\u2019s been a long time since we went abroad or foreigners came to Taiwan,\u201d said Hsiao. \u201cWe welcome any visitors from the world.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-10-26T05:00:00Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden is \u201ctotally running\u201d for a second term, the MSNBC host Jonathan Capehart has said, just days after interviewing the US president. The oldest president ever inaugurated, Biden will turn 80 on 20 November. He told Capehart: \u201cI can\u2019t even say the age I\u2019m going to be. I can\u2019t even get it out of my mouth. You think I\u2019m joking. I\u2019m not joking.\u201d Speculation about Biden\u2019s age and ambition has become a constant in US politics. Some Democrats have avoided saying he should run again or committing to supporting him if he does. Republicans \u2013 members of a party dominated by Donald Trump, a decidedly erratic 76 \u2013 regularly claim Biden is too old. Regular Biden gaffes, this week including calling Rishi Sunak, the new British prime minister, \u201cRashi Sanook\u201d, have reinforced such impressions in some quarters. Writing for the Washington Post, Capehart said he was sure Biden was ready to run. Capehart said: \u201cAfter my interview \u2026 I got the same question over and over again: How is he? Each time, it was asked in that skittish way one speaks when inquiring about someone they fear is in decline. \u201cFolks, listen to me. Biden is just fine. More than fine. In fact \u2026 I came away with two overwhelming impressions: Biden is totally going to run for reelection in 2024. And he doesn\u2019t just like being president; he loves the job of president.\u201d Capehart said Biden initially \u201cgave his standard answer about not making a formal declaration\u201d about 2024 \u201cbecause of the legal implications of such an announcement\u201d \u2013 but then gave two \u201cnonverbal cues\u201d. The first came when Capehart asked if Jill Biden, the first lady, supported another run. \u201cBiden looked at me as if to say, \u2018Brother, you know I\u2019m not going there,\u2019 which I took as my hint to end the interview. But when I started my goodbye, I saw another nonverbal cue \u2013 one that signaled he wanted to say more but wasn\u2019t sure he should \u2026 I motioned for the president to tell me more. \u201c\u2018My wife thinks that I, that we\u2019re, that we\u2019re doing something very important, and I shouldn\u2019t walk away from it,\u2019 Biden told me. Formal declaration or not, the man is totally running.\u201d Capehart cited an NBC report in which a Jill Biden staffer said the family would support a 2024 campaign. Capehart added that Biden\u2019s \u201csense of duty\u201d had \u201conly grown\u201d since his son Beau died in 2015. Biden told Capehart: \u201cThere\u2019s only one reason \u2026 to be in public life: Can you make life better for other people? And there\u2019s no place that you have a better opportunity to do that than as president of the United States. \u201cI have more substantive experience on the issues facing the country, both in foreign policy and in domestic policy, than any president ever, just because I have been around so long doing this.\u201d Capehart wrote: \u201cSure, Biden is getting old. But the almost-octogenarian I interviewed was fit and eager to take on the decisions that land on a president\u2019s desk. So, stop asking if Biden is OK. He very much is.\u201d Capehart also said Democrats should stop discussing potential successors, the \u201ckind of loose talk [that] will ramp up after the midterms if Democrats get shellacked\u201d. Instead, he said, the party should \u201ccircle the wagons around the Democrat who already has the job. Not as a firing squad, as they are wont to do, but as a sturdy wall of support. He\u2019s going to need it.\u201d"
