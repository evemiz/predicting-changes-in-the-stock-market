            "date": "2023-01-31T21:49:49Z",
            "content": "The Arizona secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, asked the state attorney general Monday to investigate and potentially charge the losing Republican candidate for governor with a felony for sharing images of voters\u2019 signatures online. Fontes, a Democrat, said GOP gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake may have violated a state law that protects a voter\u2019s signature from being accessed or shared by anyone other than the voter or an \u201cauthorized government official in the scope of the official\u2019s duties\u201d. Violations of this law carry a class six felony charge, the lowest-level felony in Arizona. Lake posted the voters\u2019 signatures on Twitter on 23 January, claiming they were part of a \u201cbombshell\u201d that showed mismatching signatures that shouldn\u2019t have been counted, a frequently repeated claim after Republican losses in 2020 and 2022. The signatures she posted were from 2020 ballots. In his letter to the Democratic attorney general, Kris Mayes, Fontes asked that Mayes \u201cinvestigate and take appropriate enforcement action against Kari Lake\u201d. Mayes\u2019 office confirmed receipt of the referral but said it wouldn\u2019t have further comment on the matter at this time. Despite her loss, Lake has continued to fundraise based on the false premise that she actually won the governor\u2019s race and that the election results will be overturned. Lake\u2019s run for governor focused heavily on the false assertion that the 2020 election was stolen. She held a rally in Scottsdale on Sunday when Donald Trump appeared by phone and said Lake will be \u201cvictorious\u201d in her effort to overturn the 2022 election. Since Fontes\u2019 referral became public, Lake has retweeted several accounts who called Fontes\u2019 election into question and who have said the referral was proof that Lake was correct in her claims of a stolen election. Lake wasn\u2019t the first to share voters\u2019 signatures to make claims about their validity. The signatures have been shared by state lawmakers and election-denial groups in presentations at the state legislature, Votebeat\u2019s Jen Fifield pointed out on Twitter, though it\u2019s not clear how the confidentiality of the signatures was originally breached."

            "date": "2023-01-30T02:43:59Z",
            "content": "A mere 11% of the electorate voted in Tunisia\u2019s parliamentary runoffs, with critics of president Kais Saied saying the empty polling stations were evidence of public disdain for his agenda and seizure of powers. Sunday\u2019s runoff vote was however higher than December\u2019s first round, which had a participation rate of 8.8%. \u201cAlmost 90% of Tunisian voters ignored this piece of theatre and refused to be involved in the process,\u201d Ahmed Nejib Chebbi, head of the country\u2019s main opposition the National Salvation Front, told journalists. \u201cI call on political groups and civil society to join hands to work for change, in the form of Kais Saied\u2019s departure and early presidential elections.\u201d About 887,000 voters cast ballots from a total electorate of 7.8 million, the electoral commission said. Final results were not expected on Sunday. The main parties boycotted the vote and most seats are expected to go to independents. Sunday\u2019s poor participation was another blow to Saied, who has stripped the legislature of its powers and granted himself far-reaching authority since his dramatic 2021 power grab. On 25 July 2021, Saied sacked the government and froze parliament before dissolving it and pushing through a new constitution, granting him almost unlimited powers. The latest poll was seen as the final pillar of Saied\u2019s transformation of politics, ushering in a new legislature that will have almost no authority to hold the president or government to account. Opposition groups have accused Saied of a coup for shutting down the previous parliament in 2021, and say he has trashed the democracy built after Tunisia\u2019s 2011 revolution \u2013 which triggered the Arab spring. Saied has said his actions were both legal and necessary to save Tunisia from years of corruption and economic decline at the hands of a self-interested political elite. Though his new constitution passed in a referendum last year, only 30% of voters took part. Economic decline in Tunisia, where some basic goods have disappeared from shelves and the government has cut subsidies as it seeks a foreign bailout to avert bankruptcy, has left many disillusioned with politics and angry with their leaders. \u201cWe don\u2019t want elections. We want milk and sugar and cooking oil,\u201d said Hasna, a woman shopping in the Ettadamon district of Tunis on Sunday. Many Tunisians appeared initially to welcome Saied\u2019s seizure of powers in 2021 after years of weak governing coalitions that seemed unable to revive a moribund economy, improve public services or reduce stark inequalities. But Saied has voiced no clear economic agenda except to rail against corruption and unnamed speculators, whom he has blamed for rising prices. On Friday, Moody\u2019s credit rating agency downgraded Tunisia\u2019s debt, saying it would probably default on sovereign loans. Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"

            "title": "Revealed: Trump secretly donated $1m to discredited Arizona election \u2018audit\u2019 ",
            "date": "2023-01-27T11:00:50Z",
            "content": "One of the enduring mysteries surrounding the chaotic attempts to overturn Donald Trump\u2019s defeat in the 2020 presidential battle has been solved: who made a secret $1m donation to the controversial election \u201caudit\u201d in Arizona? The identity of one of the largest benefactors behind the discredited review of Arizona\u2019s vote count has been shrouded in secrecy. Now the Guardian can reveal that the person who partially bankrolled the failed attempt to prove that the election was stolen from Trump was \u2026 Trump. An analysis by the watchdog group Documented has traced funding for the Arizona audit back to Trump\u2019s Save America Pac. The group tracked the cash as it passed from Trump\u2019s fund through an allied conservative group, and from there to a shell company which in turn handed the money to contractors and individuals involved in the Arizona audit. Cyber Ninjas, the Florida-based company that led the Arizona audit, disclosed in 2021 that $5.7m of its budget came from several far-right groups invested in the \u201cstop the steal\u201d campaign to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s presidential victory. It was later divulged that a further $1m had supported the audit from an account controlled by Cleta Mitchell, a Republican election lawyer who advised Trump as he plotted to subvert the 2020 election. But who gave the $1m to Mitchell? In September 2021, as Cyber Ninjas was preparing to deliver its findings, the New York Times reported that unnamed \u201cofficials\u201d had denied that Trump had played any part in securing the funds. Republican leaders of the Arizona senate who asked Cyber Ninjas to carry out the audit also publicly denied that Trump was involved, saying \u201cthis absolutely has nothing to do with Trump\u201d. Documented\u2019s analysis pierces through that denial. Basing its research on corporate, tax and campaign finance filings, as well as emails and text messages obtained by the non-partisan accountability group American Oversight through public records requests, the watchdog has followed the money on its circuitous journey from the former US president\u2019s Pac to the Arizona review. \u2018Highly hypocritical\u2019 Cyber Ninjas\u2019 widely lambasted inquiry was focused on Maricopa county, Arizona\u2019s most populated area. Biden won the county by 45,109 votes. The purported investigation was suffused with wild conspiracy theories, including the claim that bamboo fibers found in ballot sheets proved they had been printed in Asia. The review was decried even by local Republicans as a \u201cgrift disguised as an audit\u201d. Bill Gates, the Republican vice-chair of the Maricopa county board of supervisors at the time of the Cyber Ninjas audit, said he was \u201cdisappointed, but not surprised\u201d by the Guardian\u2019s revelation that Trump had helped to pay for it. \u201cI have no problem with audits,\u201d Gates said. \u201cWhat I have a problem with is an audit that is undertaken with a goal in mind, and that is literally being funded by one of the candidates. This is absolutely what we do not want to happen.\u201d Gates pointed out that under Arizona law, electoral candidates are not allowed to fund vote recounts which have to be financed with taxpayer dollars. Though the Cyber Ninjas review was technically not a recount, it served a similar purpose. \u201cAt the very least, it is highly hypocritical for the Arizona state senate to have allowed the audit to be funded in this fashion,\u201d Gates said. The money trail exposed by Documented begins with Trump\u2019s loosely regulated leadership Pac, Save America, which raised millions in the wake of Trump\u2019s 2020 defeat on the back of the false election fraud narrative. In its final report released in December, the bipartisan January 6 committee investigating the insurrection at the US Capitol highlighted how Save America Pac gave $1m to the Conservative Partnership Institute (CPI). The committee did not say what the money was for, or where it ended up. Top CPI officials include Mark Meadows, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, along with other senior Trump insiders after they left the White House. The organization is developing a political infrastructure to sustain the former president\u2019s Make America Great Again (Maga) movement. Documented\u2019s research shows that discussions around a possible payment from Trump to the Arizona audit began in June 2021. Records obtained by American Oversight reveal that on 27 June, the retired army colonel and arch election denier Phil Waldron texted the CEO of Cyber Ninjas, Doug Logan, saying: \u201cKurt is going to talk to 45 today about $$.\u201d The \u201c45\u201d in the text is a reference to Trump \u2013 the 45th president of the US \u2013 and \u201cKurt\u201d may have been a reference to the election-denying lawyer Kurt Olsen. Waldron added: \u201cMike L talking to Corey L\u201d \u2013 alluding to Mike Lindell, chief executive of MyPillow who is a devotee of Trump\u2019s stolen election lie, and the former Trump presidential campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. On 16 July 2021, Waldron asked Logan if he had received \u201ca 1mil [payment] from Corey Lewendowsk [sic]\u201d. He went on: \u201cSupposedly Kurt talked to trump and they got 1 mil for you,\u201d but that \u201cI couldn\u2019t verify who sent and who received.\u201d Logan responded that he had not yet received payment from Trump. Ten days later, on 26 July 2021, Trump\u2019s Save America Pac made its $1m transfer to CPI, according to Federal Election Commission records. Two days after that, on 28 July, a new group called the American Voting Rights Foundation (AVRF) was registered as a corporation in Delaware. Tax filings obtained recently show that CPI in turn gave $1m to AVRF in 2021 \u2013 the only known donation that the group has ever received. The date of CPI\u2019s donation to AVRF is not a matter of public record, but other details \u2013 including CPI\u2019s relationship with AVRF, the timing and amounts of the known transfers, and the discussion among Trump allies about the former president\u2019s plans to give $1m to the audit 10 days before Trump gave $1m to CPI \u2013 clearly indicate that it was the money that came from Trump\u2019s Pac. Records obtained by American Oversight showed that AVRF was connected to Mitchell, the former Trump lawyer who is now a senior fellow at CPI. She is best known for having taken part in the infamous phone call in January 2021 that is now being weighed by an Atlanta prosecutor, in which Trump tried to pressure Georgia\u2019s top election official to \u201cfind 11,780 votes\u201d needed for him to win. Documented has discovered that the ties between CPI and AVRF went even deeper. CPI entities effectively controlled AVRF. Tax records show that AVRF\u2019s \u201cdirect controlling entity\u201d is America First Legal, the CPI-launched project led by Trump\u2019s former speechwriter Stephen Miller. Tax records also show that another CPI project, the Center for Renewing America, lists AVRF as one of its \u201crelated organizations\u201d. The final stage in the money\u2019s journey was from AVRF to Cyber Ninjas and the audit itself. The same day that AVRF was registered in Delaware \u2013 28 July 2021 \u2013 Mitchell sent an email connecting the Cyber Ninjas CEO Logan, together with the spokesman of the audit Randy Pullen, to AVRF\u2019s treasurer, Tom Datwyler. The email, contained in the documents obtained by American Oversight, spelled out that money was about to be transferred from AVRF to Arizona contractors approved by Cyber Ninjas. The last step was recorded in an email sent the following day, 29 July, in which Mitchell itemized $1m split into three separate payments going to two entities supporting the audit and to individuals \u201cworking at the audit site\u201d. CPI\u2019s president, Ed Corrigan, is cc\u2019ed on the email. The money had reached its destination, with no Trump fingerprints anywhere in sight. The Guardian has invited both Save America Pac and CPI to comment but they did not immediately respond. \u2018Counter to transparency\u2019 A final mystery remains: why would Trump and his inner circle go to such lengths to keep the former president\u2019s bankrolling of the audit secret? One theory is that Trump might have been worried that the audit would look less credible should he be seen to be funding it. Another possible scenario is that he feared that the review might prove to be such a shambles that he wanted to keep his distance. On Thursday, the Arizona Republic reported further fresh evidence that despite the denials Trump was intimately involved in the audit. New records obtained by the newspaper show that Trump was being directly informed about the progress of the audit as it was being conducted. Newly released messages from the Cyber Ninjas chief Logan also show that he discussed the need for any Trump donation to be made in secret. \u201cI told them there was no way I could take funds directly,\u201d he said in a private digital chat. In the end, the Cyber Ninjas audit not only lacked credibility, it also spectacularly failed to meet its goal. In September 2021, the firm released the results of its investigation and found that Biden had indeed won Maricopa county by 360 more votes than the official count. No conclusive evidence of fraud was uncovered, and the claims raised by the audit were thoroughly debunked in a 93-page report. Cyber Ninjas went out of business in January 2022. Gates, the Maricopa county supervisor, said that a large portion of the $1m that ended up with the Arizona audit would have come from small donations to Trump\u2019s Pac. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that so many small donors had their money used for this effort, and Trump\u2019s attempt to hide that was certainly counter to transparency.\u201d This article was produced in partnership with Documented, an investigative watchdog and journalism project.

            "title": "\u2018Decisions imminent\u2019 in Trump election case, Atlanta district attorney says",
            "date": "2023-01-24T21:58:52Z",
            "content": "An Atlanta district attorney has said \u201cdecisions are imminent\u201d on whether to charge Donald Trump with criminal offences over his attempt to to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. But a highly anticipated hearing on Tuesday remained largely inconclusive after a judge decided not to immediately rule on whether to make public an investigative report on the actions Trump and his allies took to baselessly challenge the legitimacy of the election. Fani Willis, Fulton county district attorney, strongly hinted she could prosecute a former president for the first time in US history at the hearing. She cautioned, however, that openly revealing the grand jury\u2019s investigation could prejudice a fair trial for \u201cmultiple\u201d accused. The judge overseeing the hearing, Robert McBurney, reserved his decision on whether to release the special purpose grand jury\u2019s report before any announcement about prosecutions in what he described as an \u201cextraordinary\u201d case, leaving Tuesday\u2019s hearing without a final conclusion. Willis\u2019s office is holding the only copy of the results of the grand jury\u2019s investigation into a series of alleged crimes, including criminal solicitation to commit election fraud, intentional interference with the performance of election duties, conspiracy and racketeering. The Fulton county district attorney said she wanted to keep the grand jury\u2019s recommendations on who to prosecute, and on what charges, under wraps until she has decided whether to pursue charges for crimes that potentially carry significant prison sentences. \u201cWe have to be mindful of protecting future defendants\u2019 rights,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to make sure that everyone is treated fairly and we say for future defendants to be treated fairly it\u2019s not appropriate at this time to have this report released.\u201d Willis then added: \u201cDecisions are imminent\u201d. If Willis decides to press charges, she will be required to make her case to another grand jury which has the authority to issue indictments. The district attorney spoke about the prospect of \u201cindividuals, multiple\u201d being prosecuted. At least 18 other people have been told they also potentially face charges including Trump\u2019s close ally and lawyer, the former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Before the special purpose grand jury was dissolved two weeks ago after months of hearings, its members recommended releasing its findings. Lawyers for media organisations told Tuesday\u2019s hearing that the grand jury\u2019s wish should be respected because of overwhelming public interest and challenged the claim that the report\u2019s release would prejudice any trial. At the conclusion of the hearing, McBurney reserved his decision on whether to make public the report. \u201cThis is not simple. I think the fact that we had to discuss this for 90 minutes shows that it is somewhat extraordinary,\u201d he said. \u201cPartly what\u2019s extraordinary is what\u2019s at issue here, the alleged interference with a presidential election.\u201d McBurney said that if he does order that the report is made public, he will give prosecutors notice before it is released. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to wake up with the court having disclosed the report on the front page of the newspaper,\u201d he said. Legal scholars have said they believe Trump is \u201cat substantial risk of prosecution\u201d in Georgia over his attempts to strong-arm officials into fixing the election in his favour when it looked as if the state might decide the outcome of the presidential election. Trump\u2019s lawyers did not participate in the hearing because, they said, Willis had not sought to interview the former president for the investigation. \u201cTherefore, we can assume that the grand jury did their job and looked at the facts and the law, as we have, and concluded there were no violations of the law by President Trump,\u201d the lawyers said in a statement. Willis launched her investigation into \u201ca multi-state, coordinated plan by the Trump campaign to influence the results\u201d just weeks after the former president left office. The investigation initially focused on a tape recording of Trump pressuring Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to conjure nearly 12,000 votes out of thin air in order to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s win. Willis expanded the investigation as more evidence emerged of Trump and his allies attempting to manipulate the results, including the appointment of a sham slate of 16 electors to replace the state\u2019s legitimate members of the electoral college. The fake electors included the chair of the Georgia Republican party, David Shafer, and Republican members of the state legislature who have been warned that they are at risk of prosecution."

            "title": "Libyan politicians\u2019 pay goes up 40% as election impasse continues",
            "date": "2023-01-12T05:00:00Z",
            "content": "Western leaders are losing patience with an entrenched Libyan political elite that has collectively failed to agree on the basis of elections for more than a year but has boosted politicians\u2019 salaries by more than 40%, according to official figures. Special envoys from the US, France, Germany, Italy and the UK are due to meet in Washington on 13 January to discuss their next steps after two rival Libyan factions last week failed to reach a final agreement in Cairo on the constitutional basis for national elections. The presidential and parliamentary elections were aborted in December 2021. A previous French-led effort to stage elections, in 2018, had also foundered. A series of unelected and competing interim governments have governed Libya for nearly a decade. Elections planned for 2022 were cancelled due to disputes over the qualifications of candidates to stand, which masked a deeper reluctance by politicians in both the east and west of the country to risk a democratic winner-takes-all process that might see them lose access to state patronage and power. One exasperated western diplomat said: \u201cThey are some making sincere efforts at mediation, but the abiding character of too many Libyan politicians on both sides of the divide is [to] pay lip service to the necessity of elections and then do everything possible to throttle them so they can continue lining their pockets. We may have to stop hoping we can persuade these people to agree to elections and instead find a way to work around them.\u201d The meeting on 13 January of special envoys convened by the US envoy, Richard Norland, will look at how to stage elections and whether to urge the new UN special envoy Abdoulaye Bathily to set a deadline for establishing a national Libyan body to agree on elections. The growth of the Libyan economy is projected to be 17.9% this year, the highest in Africa, but despite this some estimates show that nearly a third of Libyans, especially in the south, live at, or below, the poverty line. Libya\u2019s political leaders have gone round in circles with competing proposals for the constitutional basis of the elections. Months of talks in Cairo between Libya\u2019s House of Representatives speaker, Aguila Saleh, from the east of the country, and the head of the high council of state, Khaled al-Meshri, representing the western area, made some progress, but did not resolve whether dual nationals could stand for the presidency, or for how long candidates would have to permanently resign from any existing position if they wished to stand. Behind these disputes are efforts from either side to bar controversial candidates from standing. Norland has claimed there is no impediment to Meshri and Saleh setting an election date, but the two men have refused to do so. The reputation of the political class has hardly been enhanced by Central Bank of Libya figures published last week showing total state spending rose last year to 127.9bn Libyan dinars, an increase of 42bn dinars or about $9bn in 2021. Figures on how the state is spending money have been unclear for years, with a full UN-commissioned audit of the CBL accounts never published. Public salaries, including those for politicians, rose 42% to 47bn dinars for 2022, compared with 33bn dinars the previous year. This was the single biggest expenditure item. Fuel subsidies racked up 20bn dinars, and development and projects 17.5bn dinars. The Libyan National Oil Corporation was given 34bn dinars \u2013 about $6bn. Oil remains the chief source of state revenue, worth 134bn dinars ($29bn). The House of Representatives, last elected in 2016, was paid 144m dinars or $30m. The high council of state, the remnants of an oversight parliament elected in 2012 under the control of the west and led by Meshri, received 49m dinars, or $10m. The interim Tripoli-based government, also supported by Turkey and led by the interim prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, has also paid out billions in benefits. Critics say even allowing for the devaluation of the Libyan dinar, the scale of the salaries and disbursements suggest that an unaccountable political class is eager to avoid the verdict of the ballot box. Tim Eaton, a Libya expert at Chatham House, said: \u201cThese central bank figures are still opaque, but clearly spending on salaries is staggeringly high. Given the amount of money that is supposedly being spent on public services, ordinary people in Libya are simply not receiving an adequate level of service.\u201d The experienced former UN envoy in Libya, Stephanie Williams, recently said: \u201cA transactional ruling class, some of whose network can be traced back to the days of the former regime, uses Libya\u2019s state and sovereign institutions as cash cows in what could be described as a \u2018redistributive kleptocracy\u2019, bringing into their circles on a regular basis just enough of their compatriots to sustain the system.\u201d She said some Libyan politicians simply did not see the need for elections. Popular frustration with the lack of elections exists. In a statement Aref Nayed, chairman of the Ihya Libya movement, said: \u201cThere is nothing to prevent elections except for a corrupt political junta that is fighting each other over everything, but it is united in confiscating the right of the Libyan people to determine their own destiny and share their wealth.\u201d Zahra Langhi, a women\u2019s rights activist, said \u201cpolitical elites including [the] governor and central bank board have long benefited from a culture of impunity. Libya is witnessing a stalemate in the political track as well as division and capture of state institutions that defrauds the Libyan people of their right to elect their representatives\u201d. The debate among western diplomats is about whether to set a hard deadline for Libya\u2019s political institutions to reach agreement on the basis of elections, and if that deadline is not met, whether to launch a new process. Libyan political institutions have long lost legitimacy with the House of Representatives, which was elected in June 2014 on a turnout of less than 20%. Saleh, the speaker, was elected with little more than 1,000 votes. The high council of state, broadly the upper house and based in the west with a strong Muslim Brotherhood constituency, was elected in 2016. In February 2021, Dbeibah was elected head of the interim government by a 75-strong UN appointed body and was charged solely with preparing for the elections, but before the election date was aborted he had reneged on a pledge not to stand in the elections, contributing to the impasse that led to the elections being called off."

            "date": "2023-01-15T14:50:53Z",
            "content": "The former Czech Republic prime minister Andrej Babi\u0161 has set the scene for a bitter presidential election showdown dominated by rows over the country\u2019s communist past by comparing his rival to Vladimir Putin after a surprise first-round poll defeat. Final tallies after polls closed on Saturday showed Babi\u0161 finishing a close second to Gen Petr Pavel, a former army chief of staff and Nato military chair, propelling the pair into a head-to-head ballot on 27-28 January for the right to succeed Milo\u0161 Zeman as Czech president. In an eight-strong field, Pavel won 35.4% of the vote, compared with 34.99% for Babi\u0161, with turnout recorded at 68.23%. The only female candidate, the economist and academic Danu\u0161e Nerudov\u00e1, who was running neck-and-neck with the pair in pre-election surveys, finished a distant third on 13.9%. Despite the close margin of defeat, the result left the billionaire Babi\u0161 facing an uphill struggle to win over the extra voters needed to prevail in the runoff, especially after Nerudov\u00e1 and two other losing candidates, Pavel Fischer and Marek Hil\u0161er, immediately endorsed Pavel after their defeats. Reflecting the lengthening odds against him, the 68-year-old launched a vitriolic attack on Pavel in a post-results press conference, taking aim at his rival\u2019s past Communist party membership and participation in a military intelligence training course before the 1989 velvet revolution that heralded the end of communism in the former Czechoslovakia. Painting Pavel as a \u201cgovernment nominee\u201d and ex-communist intelligence officer, Babi\u0161 told journalists: \u201cDo you know who else is an intelligence officer at the head of state? Russian president Vladimir Putin. Putin was dropped off and deployed as a KGB agent in the 1980s in Berlin. This is what Mr Pavel was prepared for, to be planted in the rear of the enemy, to get people there to cooperate.\u201d Babi\u0161, who owns two daily newspapers and the country\u2019s biggest commercial radio station, also claimed plans were afoot to release \u201ccompromising\u201d material including doctored photographs, and allegations linking him to the KGB. His broadside was met with widespread ridicule, with critics highlighting Babi\u0161\u2019s past links to the communist-era secret police, the StB, for which he acted as an informant, according to documents upheld as authentic by the constitutional court in his native Slovakia. Ji\u0159\u00ed Pehe, a political analyst and the director of New York University in Prague, said Babi\u0161 was trying to persuade liberal-minded supporters of the candidates who had backed Pavel to abstain in the second round. \u201cThe three candidates who endorsed Pavel won 1.2m votes between them and Babi\u0161 is doing everything in his power to convince those voters that Pavel is just another a former communist apparatchik and spy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut unless something totally unexpected happens, Pavel is going to win. To cross the 50%-plus-one threshold, he needs roughly 500,000 more votes when he has 1.2m at his disposal.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-31T05:00:36Z",
            "content": "Routine violence in south-east Nigeria including attacks on the offices of the electoral commission threatens to derail next month\u2019s presidential elections, experts have said. At least 50 attacks by armed groups against staff and facilities of the electoral commission (Inec) have been recorded between the last election in 2019 and the end of 2022. Most have taken place in the south-east, which is in the grip of secessionist agitation by various elements, especially the Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob). \u201cIt is a possibility that voting might not take place in some areas going by the security situation in the region, and not just in the south-east,\u201d said Malik Samuel, an Abuja-based researcher at the Institute of Security Studies. In south-east Nigeria, scores of assaults have been blamed on the Ipob group or its armed wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN). More than 100 police and other security personnel have been killed since the beginning of 2021 in targeted attacks, according to tallies by local media. Ipob, which says the area has been marginalised at the federal level and seeks a separate state for ethnic Igbo people, has repeatedly denied responsibility for the violence. Since 2021, it has issued a once-a-week stay-at-home order, which completely paralyses economic and social activities across the south-east, in response to the government\u2019s detention of its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, on a series of charges including terrorism. \u201cYou cannot even mention the election,\u201d said a lawyer from the south-east who requested anonymity out of concerns for her safety. The lawyer said that when she mentioned to her mother that she had taken a long round trip to pick up her voting card, her mother replied that it was \u201cnot something you want other ears to hear because you don\u2019t know who is who\u201d. James Barnett, a researcher affiliated with the Hudson Institute in Washington DC, said insecurity remained a significant challenge in the south-east. \u201cThis is seen in the degree to which residents still adhere to sit-at-home orders, not out of sympathy to the militants, but out of fear for their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems clear that militants, whatever their motivations, remain capable of terrorising ordinary Nigerians in the region with concerning consistency.\u201d An influx of arms and a weakened and overstretched military has allowed other armed groups acting with obscure motives to perpetuate attacks. \u201cIpob has become so fractured that it\u2019s difficult to speak of it as a coherent movement any more \u2013 and a lot of criminals or political thugs seem to be using Ipob as a cover for their activities,\u201d Barnett said. Insecurity is a nationwide problem. Security forces are fighting a 13-year war against jihadists in the north-east, and bandit militias are terrorising communities in the north-west, where Ansaru, a terror group linked with al-Qaida, has prohibited local people from participating in the election. Underlining the sense of untrammelled violence in Africa\u2019s most populous nation, dozens of cattle herders and bystanders were killed in a suspect bomb blast last Tuesday in the north-central region, also known as the Middle Belt, which is prone to violence due to clashes between Fulani pastoralists and farmers, who are mainly Christian. Nigerians are set to choose a new president on 25 February to replace Muhammadu Buhari, who has reached the end of his two-term limit. The former military general who previously led the country for a few years in the 1980s after a coup, campaigned for the post on a promise to get to grips with insecurity, but is widely judged to have failed miserably, and has cut an increasingly muted and remote figure. The election pits Bola Tinubu, a 70-year-old former governor from Buhari\u2019s ruling All Progressives Congress against Atiku Abubakar, a 76-year-old former vice-president and wealthy executive from the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic party, who is on his sixth bid for the presidency, as well as Peter Obi, a 61-year-old former state governor running for the Labour party as the \u201cchange\u201d candidate. Nigeria\u2019s elections in the past have been marred by logistical delays, violence and claims of fraud and vote buying. In 2019, the Inec was forced to postpone the election by a week just hours before voting was scheduled to start because of difficulty getting material to polling stations. Elections have also been characterised by low turnout, which dropped from 44% in the 2015 presidential election to 35% in 2019. Experts have said disenfranchisement caused by insecurity could lead to that figure dropping again this year. \u201cIf people for security reasons are not able to vote, that is a problem for the credibility of the election,\u201d Samuel said."

            "date": "2023-01-09T11:36:21Z",
            "content": "The former Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, has been acquitted of charges of subsidy fraud just four days before a presidential election in which he is standing as a candidate. The verdict, handed down in Prague\u2019s municipal court, amounts to a major vindication for Babi\u0161 \u2013 a billionaire tycoon and one of the Czech Republic\u2019s richest men \u2013 and may boost his chances of prevailing in next weekend\u2019s poll, which has been partly overshadowed by his longstanding legal troubles. The ex-PM, 68, had been accused, along with a former aide, Jana Nagyov\u00e1, of illegally obtaining \u20ac2m (\u00a31.7m) in EU small business funds for the development of Stork\u2019s Nest, a lavish hotel and conference centre in rural Bohemia, about 40 miles south of Prague, by concealing that it was part of Babi\u0161\u2019s vast multi-sector Agrofert conglomerate, thus making it ineligible for such subsidies. However, after a 15-day trial, which originally commenced last September, the judge Jan \u0160ott ruled that the evidence did not support the indictment\u2019s claim that a crime had been committed. Neither Babi\u0161 nor his co-defendant were in court to hear \u0160ott read out his verdict, which the judge followed with a lengthy explanation. But the former PM reacted on Twitter, writing: \u201cInnocent! I am very glad that we have an independent judiciary and the court has confirmed what I have been saying from the beginning. That I am innocent and have done nothing illegal.\u201d Babi\u0161 \u2013 who founded the Action of Dissatisfied Citizens (Ano) party in 2011 on an explicit anti-corruption platform \u2013 has long dismissed the allegations as \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d. The result of a seven-year police investigation, they were brought to court after a 2021 general election defeat resulted in him losing his parliamentary immunity against prosecution. The ruling does not necessarily spell the end of the case. Prosecutors, who had been demanding a three-year suspended sentence plus a fine, could appeal against the verdict to the high court. Nevertheless, the immediate effect is to allow Babi\u0161 to contest the presidential poll, in which voters cast their ballots on Friday and Saturday, without a legal shadow looming over him. Babi\u0161 is vying with seven other candidates to replace the populist current incumbent, Milo\u0161 Zeman, who is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. Surveys show the former prime minister running strongly but in a tight race with two other candidates, Petr Pavel, a retired army general and former Nato military commander, and Danu\u0161e Nerudov\u00e1, an economist and academic who is attempting to become the first female Czech head of state. The top two candidates will go forward to a second round poll in late January. Opinion polls have previously indicated that Babi\u0161 is likely to lose to both Pavel and Nerudov\u00e1 in a run-off election."

            "date": "2023-01-19T08:00:04Z",
            "content": "At a recent campaign stop, Peter Obi responded to a regular criticism. Bola Tinubu, a rival candidate in next month\u2019s presidential elections in Nigeria, had called him stingy. Obi told a crowd of supporters that yes, he has been stingy with public funds, and that made him a better fit for the country\u2019s top job. Nigerians go to the polls on 25 February to choose a replacement for Muhammadu Buhari, whose eight-year rule has been sharply criticised for failing to get to grips with rampant insecurity and a cost of living crisis. A former state governor running for the Labour party, Obi is the first third-party candidate to present a real challenge to the dominance of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and its main opposition, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), since the end of military dictatorship in 1999. The 61-year-old has appealed to younger voters with a message that he is different from his old-guard rivals and wants to bring real change to Nigeria. Weyimi Lube, a voiceover artist, had just turned 24 when terrorists struck a Catholic church in the southern city of Owo in June last year, killing at least 40 worshippers. She said the trauma of the attack pushed her into Obi\u2019s camp. \u201cI told myself if we don\u2019t push hard for Obi, I don\u2019t think there will be a Nigeria in the future for me and the people I care about,\u201d Lube said. Analysts say some younger people have turned towards Obi out of a sense of desperation with the status quo in Nigeria and continued anger over the brutal suppression two years ago of the #EndSars movement \u2013 named after a hated police unit \u2013 which demanded better governance. \u201cThe youth are disillusioned with the APC and PDP. Their hopes have been squandered,\u201d said Stephen Lafenwa, a senior lecturer at the department of political science at the University of Ibadan. Obi is no stranger to presidential elections. In the 2019 vote he ran as the vice-presidential candidate for the PDP, whose losing presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar is running again this year. Last year Obi challenged Abubakar to be the PDP\u2019s candidate but resigned just before the primaries and moved to the formerly fringe Labour party, where his grassroots campaign touting his experience as governor and his outsider status has gained momentum, with a vibrant social media following. \u201cIt is really interesting because we now get to see competition beyond the two parties [and] we have an expansion of choice,\u201d said Dengiyefa Angalapu, a research analyst at the Centre for Democracy and Development. \u201cIt is no longer a situation of the devil and the deep blue sea, now it is the devil, deep blue sea and perhaps the Red Sea.\u201d Despite the excitement around Obi\u2019s candidature, he faces an uphill battle against Abubakar and Tinubu, a two-term governor of Lagos state and veteran of Nigerian politics running for the ruling APC. Known as the \u201cgodfather of Lagos\u201d for his political clout, Tinubu will benefit from the ruling party\u2019s national network. Whoever wins will have to grapple with a dire economic outlook \u2013 record inflation is running at 21.47% and the naira\u2019s value has rapidly depreciated \u2013 and an insecurity crisis that has seen a proliferation of terror attacks and attacks for ransom around the country. \u201cNigeria is on the brink,\u201d said Chinua Ubabuko, a recently graduated university student and Obi supporter. \u201cEthnic militias have become forces to reckon with in basically every part of the country and so it is a no-brainer that the next president must be one who can attack the situation and bring peace.\u201d Security forces are fighting a 13-year-old war against jihadists in the country\u2019s north-east, bandit militias in the north-west and separatist tensions in the country\u2019s south-east. Gunmen have repeatedly targeted local offices of the independent national electoral commission, known as INEC, which has warned that it may have to cancel or postpone the vote. Several online polls have placed Obi as the likely winner, but they are being treated with extreme caution by observers, who say their results have been skewed by the youthful profile of Obi voters. Experts say displacing the APC and PDP would be nothing short of revolutionary, but that regardless of the final result, Obi\u2019s candidature for the Labour party will leave a mark by showing a serious challenge to the big two\u2019s dominance is possible. \u201c[Previously] when we had those third forces, the people did not have trust in them. As soon as they [candidates] become strong, they join the ruling party. In Obi, they see someone who is willing to fight until the end,\u201d Angalapu said. Another possibility is that Obi will take enough votes to prevent Abubakar or Tinubu winning in the first round, which requires a simple majority of all votes and 25% of votes in at least two-thirds of the country\u2019s 36 states. A second-round runoff would be a first in Nigerian electoral history. Lube and Ubabuko said young voters like themselves face a clear choice between a brighter future and the continued mismanagement of the country. \u201cObi speaks the language of our problems,\u201d said Lube. \u201cHe understands what Nigeria should look like, sound like and feel like.\u201d Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"

            "content": "Good morning. Donald Trump is scheduled to venture out of his Mar-a-Lago resort and conduct a swing of presidential campaign events later this month, ramping up efforts to secure the Republican nomination after facing criticism around the slow start to his 2024 White House bid, according to sources familiar with the matter. The former US president is expected to travel to a number of early voting states for the Republican nomination \u2013 the specific states have not been finalized \u2013 around the final weekend of January, the sources said, where he is slated to announce his state-level teams. The move comes after a slow start to the campaign and an announcement speech at Mar-a-Lago that has been widely panned as \u201clow energy\u201d and inactive in terms of events, further knocking Trump\u2019s political image after key Senate candidates he endorsed in November\u2019s midterms faced embarrassing defeats. That has apparently given enough confidence for a host of Republicans to prepare their own White House runs and though Trump says he believes a wide field will be beneficial, he seems set to face possible candidates including the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, and former cabinet officials such as Nikki Haley. What else is happening? The US attorney general, Merrick Garland, appointed a special counsel on Thursday to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s retention of classified documents from his time as vice-president. The move to name Robert Hur, a former Trump-appointed federal prosecutor and former top justice department official, was a rapid decision from Garland to insulate the department from possible accusations of political conflicts or interference. How do the Trump and Biden cases regarding classified documents differ? While Trump appears to have wilfully obstructed efforts to recover them, leading to the FBI raid, Biden\u2019s team said they cooperated fully and immediately returned the documents to the National Archives as soon as they were discovered.

Lisa Marie Presley, singer and daughter of Elvis, dies aged 54 Lisa Marie Presley, the singer and the only child of Elvis and Priscilla Presley, has died at the age of 54, after suddenly being hospitalised yesterday. Her 77-year-old mother confirmed Presley\u2019s death last night. \u201cIt is with a heavy heart that I must share the devastating news that my beautiful daughter Lisa Marie has left us,\u201d Priscilla Presley said in a statement. \u201cShe was the most passionate strong and loving woman I have ever known. We ask for privacy as we try to deal with this profound loss. Thank you for the love and prayers. At this time there will be no further comment.\u201d Presley was taken to hospital from her home in Calabasas, California, after a reported cardiac arrest, TMZ first reported. Her mother asked fans to keep her daughter in their prayers in a statement issued when the news first broke. The musician appeared with her mother at the Golden Globes awards ceremony in Los Angeles two days before she was hospitalised, as part of the cohort of talent supporting Baz Luhrmann\u2019s acclaimed biopic Elvis. On the night, actor Austin Butler won best actor in a motion picture drama for his performance as the King. What tributes have been paid to Presley? John Travolta said on Instagram: \u201cLisa baby girl, I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019ll miss you but I know I\u2019ll see you again.\u201d Meanwhile, Bette Midler said: \u201cI\u2019m in shock. So beautiful and only 54 years old; I can\u2019t actually comprehend it.\u201d Frantic search continues for boy, 5, swept away in California floods The danger lurking along a country road in central California\u2019s wine country was not clear to Lindsy Doan as she drove her five-year-old son to school on Monday morning. The region, like much of the state, had been hit by a deadly series of storms that were, but the family had traveled through the area the previous day, her husband told the Guardian, and countless times before on their commutes. Nothing initially appeared wrong and unlike past occasions, there were no signs indicating the road was closed. It only became clear the road was not safe as floodwaters began to carry the vehicle into a creek near the village of San Miguel. Kindergartner Kyle Doan was calm, telling his mother \u201cDon\u2019t worry mommy. It\u2019s OK \u2013 everything will be alright,\u201d according to his father, Brian Doan. As they exited the vehicle together, water rushing in, the fast-moving currents and debris pulled him from his mother\u2019s arms and forced Lindsy under water. Nearby residents were able to rescue her with a rope, but the water carried Kyle away too quickly. With assistance from the national guard, law enforcement search and rescue teams have spent days searching for the five-year-old. The search is one of several that has taken place across the state in recent weeks as a devastating series of storms battered the state. The rains and wind have toppled trees and power lines and flooded rivers and creeks, killing at least 18 people, including three in Sacramento county who were found dead in or near their cars. How\u2019s the search for Kyle going? The search has continued daily since Monday, although authorities suspended the search several times earlier in the week due to severe weather. His family hopes he will return home, but is prepared for the fact that may not happen. In other news \u2026 Hundreds of civilians remain trapped in Soledar, Ukraine has said, as bloody fighting continues over control of the largely destroyed town in eastern Ukraine. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Donetsk, told Ukrainian state TV that 559 civilians remained, including 15 children, and could not be evacuated. Sultan Al Jaber, the government minister for United Arab Emirates who will preside over this year\u2019s crucial UN climate talks, will retain his roles as head of the country\u2019s oil company and sustainable energy businesses, UAE has confirmed. \u201cI didn\u2019t steal funds, and I certainly didn\u2019t stash billions away,\u201d the disgraced cryptocurrency boss Sam Bankman-Fried claimed in his first detailed response to the criminal charges filed against him last month. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges that he defrauded investors. A painting by Vincent van Gogh on display at the Detroit Institute of Art was stolen, a new lawsuit claims.

Stat of the day: US government logs more than 500 UFO reports with hundreds unexplained The US government is examining 510 UFO reports, more than triple the number in its 2021 file. The 2022 report (pdf) by the director of national intelligence (DNI) said that 247 \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena\u201d or UAP reports have been filed with it since June 2021, when it revealed that it had records of 144 sightings of suspicious aerial objects under examination. Of those, close to 200 had \u201cunremarkable\u201d explanations: they were balloons, drones or so-called aerial clutter, which covers birds, weather events and airborne plastic bags. But others have not been explained according to the DNI document, an unclassified version of a report delivered to Congress. Don\u2019t miss this: Not just hot flushes \u2013 how menopause can destroy mental health Midlife mood swings, rage and forgetfulness may be the stuff of jokey Instagram memes. But for many women in perimenopause (the transition stage leading up to periods stopping) and menopause (defined as having gone a year without a period), they are anything but funny. A survey of 2,000 women into menopause at work last year found 75% reported problems with memory or concentration and 69% reported feeling anxious or depressed \u2013 not necessarily to clinical levels, but often enough to reduce concentration and confidence at work. And in rarer cases, those mood swings can be extreme and some women experience suicidal thoughts. Why is more help not available? Climate check: Private jet emissions quadrupled during Davos 2022 Private jet emissions quadrupled as 1,040 planes flew in and out of airports serving Davos during the 2022 World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting. Climate campaigners accused the rich and powerful of hypocrisy in flying in on private jets to a conference discussing climate breakdown. A environmental consultancy calculated that during the meeting last year, CO2 emissions from private jets were four times greater than in an average week. The number of private jet flights to and from airports serving the Swiss ski resort where the conference is held were twice as high during the 2022 meeting compared with a typical week, emitting as much CO2 as 350,000 average cars over that period.

            "date": "2023-01-26T11:00:06Z",
            "content": "The elections director of a rural Republican Arizona county where some officials tried to block certification of the state\u2019s 2022 elections has resigned. The Washington Post reported that Lisa Marra, the appointed elections director in Cochise county, will leave the role. The county has not yet confirmed the resignation to the Guardian. Marra could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. Marra has served as the county\u2019s elections director since 2017. She has been a vocal defender of Arizona elections, especially since 2020, which has led to backlash from Republicans. The Post obtained a letter from Marra\u2019s attorney detailing her resignation, which criticized a work environment that had grown \u201cphysically and emotionally threatening\u201d with \u201cobjectively difficult and unpleasant working conditions\u201d. The resignation comes after two Republican members of the county\u2019s board of supervisors, Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby, sought a full hand-count of ballots of the November election, arguing that a hand-count could double-check tabulator results and that tabulator machines were not properly certified, a claim debunked by state elections officials. Marra did not believe a hand-count was warranted or possible, while the supervisors and recorder pushed for it. A judge ruled in early November that a broad hand-count was not allowed by state law. The two supervisors then refused to certify the election, requiring a court intervention to force them to certify. Crosby is now the subject of a recall effort by local residents over his refusal to certify the election. In recent weeks, Judd and Crosby delayed paying for an outside attorney that Marra required when she, the supervisors, and the elected county recorder were sued over the hand-count. Her representation in the legal case, which was expedited over just a few days, cost more than $30,000. After delaying payment in December, the board approved the payment this week after the law firm that represented Marra sent a letter to the county notifying them that a failure to pay the bill could result in legal action. The county\u2019s deputy director of elections also left the department recently. Martha Rodriguez, who worked for the county for 28 years, mostly in elections, retired on 13 January, the county\u2019s local newspaper reported. The two departures leave Cochise county without seasoned elections officials at a time when elections workers are under increased scrutiny, often leading to threats and harassment. The field has seen high turnover nationwide and in Arizona, where several elections officials in multiple counties have quit in the past year because of the hostile environment. The county recorder and elections director in Republican-dominated Yavapai county both quit in 2022 after facing rounds of harassment and obstacles over the 2020 election, which Trump won handily in the county. In Yuma county, the recorder, and more recently the elections director, have both left in the past year."

            "date": "2023-01-09T06:00:10Z",
            "content": "As Venezuela crumbled and its people began to starve, pastor Jes\u00fas Campo founded a sanctuary for hunger-stricken refugees across the border in Brazil. He called it Vila Esperan\u00e7a \u2013 the Village of Hope. More than 7 million Venezuelans have fled their country\u2019s economic meltdown in recent years and scores of them found shelter in his ramshackle shantytown in the border town of Pacaraima, cobbling huts together from recycled wood, scrap metal and mud. But a decade after Vila Esperan\u00e7a was born on a hilltop near the frontier, Campo sees cause for optimism once again \u2013 this time back in his decaying homeland. \u201cLittle by little, our country is rising up,\u201d the 76-year-old preacher said one recent morning as he sat in a shack built from black plastic and branches. Campo\u2019s confidence stems from the shifting geopolitical circumstances \u2013 partly linked to the Ukraine war \u2013 that have prompted a rethink of how the rest of the world deals with Venezuela\u2019s authoritarian leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Just a few years ago, Maduro was an international pariah and a US-led coalition of more than 50 countries was pushing to replace him with the opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3. But Maduro survived Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign of sanctions and threats, and Joe Biden\u2019s administration has softened its stance. US envoys have visited Caracas, and the White House recently authorised the US energy firm Chevron to resume operations in Venezuela, which boasts the world\u2019s largest proven oil reserves, in an apparent search for alternatives to Russian supplies. The recent election victories of Gustavo Petro in Colombia and Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in Brazil have also boosted Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s heir, with Petro restoring diplomatic ties with Venezuela in August and Lula planning to do so after he takes office in January. Latin America\u2019s top four economies \u2013 Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico \u2013 all now have leftist leaders, who are more sympathetic to Maduro\u2019s regime than the rightwingers they replaced. Talks between Maduro allies and the opposition have restarted in Mexico, with plans for a $3bn (\u00a32.5bn) UN-run fund to address Venezuela\u2019s humanitarian crisis. And Venezuela\u2019s moribund economy has shown some hints of recovery after Maduro relaxed price controls and began dollarising the economy in 2019. \u201cI see a bright future for Venezuela,\u201d Campo enthused as he reflected on those developments during a tour of the shantytown he built for some of his country\u2019s huddled masses. But Venezuela\u2019s humanitarian crisis \u2013 which condemned three-quarters of citizens to extreme poverty \u2013 is far from over. Tens of thousands are still fleeing abroad, with record numbers arriving at the US border this year after braving the perilous jungle trek through the Dari\u00e9n Gap between South and Central America. After a lull during the Covid pandemic, Brazilian aid workers are also seeing more arrivals, with hundreds reaching Pacaraima each day. Those exiles reject the idea that their homeland is bouncing back. \u201cPresident Maduro completely destroyed the country,\u201d said Anthony Llovera, a former paramedic, as he waited for a free lunch outside a migrant shelter in Boa Vista, the biggest Brazilian city next to the Venezuelan border. Llovera, 41, was hoping to find work at a meat-packing factory in Brazil, having ditched his job at a Caracas hospital. He scoffed at the idea that Maduro would offer meaningful political concessions that would allow Venezuela to hold a free and fair presidential election in 2024. Among Vila Esperan\u00e7a\u2019s 176 residents, nearly all of whom are unemployed, there were doubters too. Regina Latinez, 40, a community leader, believed positive change would take decades, if not centuries, to materialise. \u201cI\u2019m not a pessimist, I\u2019m a realist,\u201d said the former teacher, who left her job in Venezuela because her salary was insufficient to buy food and who now lives off government benefits and \u201cblessings\u201d from NGOs in Brazil. In the meantime, Latinez has opened a community centre for exiled children, called Proyecto Nazareth. She hopes her teenage daughter Laura could study dentistry at university in Brazil. They have no plans to return home to the north-eastern state of Monagas. \u201cOnly God can get him out,\u201d Latinez said of Maduro. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is madness.\u201d Phil Gunson, an International Crisis Group analyst in Venezuela, said that after years of pain and instability, Venezuela stood at an uncertain \u201cfork in the road\u201d. He saw limited, superficial signs of economic recuperation after Maduro \u201clet the market rip\u201d in an attempt to retain power. \u201cIf you come to Caracas, you see lots of fancy shops and people buying Ferraris and things are cleaner and painted,\u201d he said. The Mexico talks and greater international engagement brought some hope of a peaceful, negotiated transition back towards democracy, even if nearly 300 political prisoners remained behind bars and the electoral authorities remained loyal to Maduro. Talk of a coup or foreign invasion had largely evaporated. Yet there was no guarantee negotiations would bring concrete progress towards democracy, or that Venezuela would not soon slip back towards economic and social disaster. \u201cWe are poised, at the moment,\u201d Gunson said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the arduous and lengthy process of negotiating a gradual transition in Venezuela could be about to start. But we could also be about to slide back into another cycle of repression and economic decline, discontent and mass migration \u2013 and much depends on what Maduro himself decides to do.\u201d Campo maintained that his country had finally turned the corner, having hit rock bottom in the decade since he fled to Brazil. \u201cVenezuela reached breaking point. There was talk of war,\u201d the preacher recalled, claiming divine forces had intervened to bring his country back from the brink by evicting Donald Trump from the White House in 2020. \u201cGod removed him because he didn\u2019t want Venezuela to be destroyed.\u201d In Boa Vista, there was no such hope. Eligio B\u00e1ez, a 38-year-old leader from Venezuela\u2019s Warao people, said families continued to arrive at the abandoned gymnasium where he and about 300 Indigenous people were squatting. \u201cThings are getting worse and worse [in Venezuela],\u201d he said. B\u00e1ez said two relatives had died last month back in Venezuela because of the lack of medical care. He has no desire to return. \u201cI\u2019ve taken the decision that my life will be better here,\u201d B\u00e1ez said, as two local anthropologists arrived to deliver food parcels to their dilapidated but now permanent home. \u201cIf we go back to Venezuela, we\u2019ll go back to square one.\u201d"

In Washington, lawmakers are digesting news that classified documents turned up at former vice president Mike Pence\u2019s residence in Indiana, as they have at properties linked to Biden and Trump. Will attorney general Merrick Garland appoint yet another special counsel to investigate the matter? Will documents be discovered in the hands of even more former White House occupants? It\u2019s too soon to say, but one thing\u2019s for sure: this story won\u2019t be going away anytime soon. Here\u2019s what else happened today: The United States is considering providing tanks to Ukraine, in a bid both to help its defense against Russia and to convince Germany to send its own armor. A Senate committee questioned Ticketmaster executives in a hearing announced after the sale of Taylor Swift tickets turned into a fiasco. Biden called for an assault weapons ban following another mass shooting in California. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said he backs an effort to look at overhauling the government\u2019s rules around classified material. With not one, but three former White House occupants in hot water for having stashes of classified documents that they should not have, some in Washington think it\u2019s time to take a look at how the government manages its secrets. That includes the Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, who said he supports a review of the government\u2019s classification system. Here are his brief comments, from CNN: There has been much reacting on Capitol Hill to news that Mike Pence had classified documents at his home. Republican lawmakers have generally defended Pence, saying they doubt he did anything wrong. Senator Lindsey Graham is among that group, but he also seemed to indicate that he believed Joe Biden made the same mistake with the secret materials found at his properties: Meanwhile, the Senate intelligence committee is planning to meet on Wednesday with director of national intelligence Avril Haines, and Republican senator Marco Rubio said the classified document scandal is sure to come up: Separately, attorney general Merrick Garland was asked about the affair, including whether he would name a special counsel to investigate the documents at Pence\u2019s house, as he did for those found at Biden and Donald Trump\u2019s properties. His answer was no surprise: As chair of the House oversight committee, James Comer is a leader of the Republican investigation campaign against the Biden administration \u2013 including the president\u2019s possession of classified documents. He has sent demands to multiple government agencies for more details about the documents found in the president\u2019s residence and former office, and who may have had access to them. But when news broke that Republican former vice president Mike Pence also had classified material in his home, Comer released a statement displaying a softer touch. Here\u2019s what he had to say: Former Vice President Mike Pence reached out today about classified documents found at his home in Indiana. He has agreed to fully cooperate with congressional oversight and any questions we have about the matter. Former Vice President Pence\u2019s transparency stands in stark contrast to Biden White House staff who continue to withhold information from Congress and the American people. A judge in Atlanta heard arguments over whether to release a special grand jury\u2019s report into Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s election win in the state three years ago, but made no decision. In Washington, lawmakers are digesting news that classified documents turned up at former vice president Mike Pence\u2019s residence in Indiana, as they have at properties linked to Biden and Trump. Will attorney general Merrick Garland appoint yet another special counsel to investigate the matter? Will documents be discovered in the hands of even more former White House occupants? It\u2019s too soon to say, but one thing\u2019s for sure: this story won\u2019t be going away anytime soon. Here\u2019s what else has been going on today: The United States is considering providing tanks to Ukraine, in a bid both to help its defense against Russia and to convince Germany to send its own armor. A Senate committee questioned Ticketmaster executives in a hearing announced after the sale of Taylor Swift tickets turned into a fiasco. Biden called for an assault weapons ban following another mass shooting in California. At the conclusion of a 90-minute hearing, an Atlanta judge did not rule on whether to release a special grand jury\u2019s report into the campaign from Donald Trump and his allies to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s election win in Georgia. \u201cThis is not simple. I think the fact that we had to discuss this for 90 minutes shows that it is somewhat extraordinary,\u201d Fulton county superior court judge Robert McBurney said. \u201cPartly what\u2019s extraordinary is what\u2019s at issue here, the alleged interference with a presidential election.\u201d \u201cMy proposal is that I think about this a little bit and then contact both groups, the district attorney\u2019s office and the intervenors, if I\u2019ve got specific questions for which I\u2019d like more input,\u201d McBurney said, adding that if he does decide to make the report public, he will give notice before doing so. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to wake up with the court having disclosed the report on the front page of the newspaper.\u201d Several media organizations had asked McBurney to release the document, which could lay out whether the jurors believe Trump and his allies committed crimes when they unsuccessfully pressured officials in Georgia to prevent Biden from winning the state\u2019s electoral votes in the 2020 election. Fani Willis, the Fulton county district attorney who began the investigation, argued against the report\u2019s release, saying, \u201cWe want to make sure that everyone is treated fairly, and we think for future defendants to be treated fairly, it is not appropriate at this time to have this report released.\u201d She also added that \u201cdecision are imminent\u201d on the report\u2019s findings. Just two weeks ago, Mike Pence told CBS news he was \u201cconfident\u201d no classified materials were taken when he left the White House in January 2021: CBS News reports Mike Pence discovered he had classified documents after an aide found the materials \u201cin recent weeks\u201d: Politico has obtained more details of the classified documents discovered at Mike Pence\u2019s residence in Indiana. According to a letter from Pence\u2019s attorney Greg Jacobs to the National Archives, the FBI sent agents to the former vice president\u2019s home on the night of 19 January to collect classified documents found in his safe. Pence wasn\u2019t in town at that time \u2013 he was in Washington DC for the anti-abortion March for Life. Jacobs also said he would turn over four boxes containing \u201ccopies of Administration papers\u201d to the Archives on 23 January for them to review for secret material: Back in Georgia, Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis told the court she does not want the special grand jury\u2019s report released. \u201cWe want to make sure that everyone is treated fairly and we think for future defendants to be treated fairly, it is not appropriate at this time to have this report released,\u201d Willis said in arguments before judge Robert McBurney. Willis is expected to use the report to decide whether to bring charges against Donald Trump\u2019s allies or perhaps the former president himself over the attempts to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s election win in Georgia. She told McBurney that \u201cdecisions are imminent.\u201d A lawyer for former vice-president Mike Pence found classified documents at his residence in Indiana, CNN reports. The discovery at Pence\u2019s Carmel, Indiana, home comes as the justice department investigates government secrets found at Joe Biden\u2019s former office in Washington DC and residence in Delaware, as well as Donald Trump\u2019s possession of similar material at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Attorney general Merrick Garland has appointed special counsels to handle both men\u2019s cases. Citing multiple sources, CNN reports that the attorney for Pence, who served as Trump\u2019s vice-president from 2017 to 2021, gave the documents found at his residence to the FBI. Judge Robert McBurney has convened the Fulton county superior court hearing that will decide whether to release the report of the special grand jury that investigated Trump\u2019s election meddling campaign in Georgia. Follow this blog for the latest, or you can watch the live feed embedded above. Republican senator Lindsey Graham was one of the witnesses called by the special grand jury investigating the election meddling effort in Georgia. Georgia\u2019s top election official Brad Raffensperger said that shortly after the 2020 election, the South Carolina lawmaker called him to ask if it was possible to throw out absentee ballots. Graham waged an unsuccessful court battle to avoid testifying before the special grand jury, before finally appearing in November. CNN reports he does not have much to say about the potential release of the panel\u2019s report: A judge in Atlanta will at 12 pm eastern time convene a hearing to determine whether to release a special grand jury\u2019s report into attempts by Donald Trump and his allies to meddle in the outcome of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. The jurors have recommended making the report public, and Fani Willis, the district attorney in Fulton county, which encompasses Georgia\u2019s capital, is using its findings to determine whether to bring charges in the investigation, which has centered on the attempts by top Trump allies like attorney Rudy Giuliani and senator Lindsey Graham to convince state officials to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the state. It\u2019s unclear if Willis is considering charges against Trump in the case. Attorneys for the former president said yesterday they will not attend the hearing, and that Trump has not committed any crimes. Follow this blog for the latest from the hearing. The United States is leaning towards sending its Abrams M1 tank to Ukraine, both in a bid to bolster its government\u2019s fight against Russia and to convince Germany to send its own Leopard 2 tanks, the Wall Street Journal reports. The weapons delivery represents an attempt by Washington to resolve the question of sending tanks to Ukraine, one of the few issues splitting the coalition of western countries that came to Kyiv\u2019s defense since Russia invaded last year. Despite pressure from its allies, Germany has yet to commit to send the Leopard 2, and so the Biden administration is considering sending the Abrams M1 tank in hopes of convincing them. The Pentagon has previously demurred on delivering the massive armored vehicle, arguing its needs for fuel and other logistics will hamper its effectiveness. Here\u2019s more from the Journal\u2019s report: The shift in the U.S. position follows a call on Jan. 17 between President Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in which Mr. Biden agreed to look into providing the Abrams tanks against the judgment of the Pentagon. A senior German official said that the issue had been the subject of intense negotiation between Washington and Berlin for more than a week and appeared to be on the way to resolution. Military officials have argued publicly that the Abrams tanks require a substantial amount of training and logistics support and therefore aren\u2019t appropriate for this moment in the conflict. In a contentious meeting last week at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, the U.S. and its allies failed to persuade Germany to allow other nations to send German-made tanks, exposing the first serious rift in the alliance that has supported Kyiv. Previously, the Pentagon had ruled out providing the tanks to Ukraine, saying they were too complicated for the Ukrainians to maintain and operate. But White House and State Department officials were described as being more open to providing Abrams to break the diplomatic logjam holding up Leopard deliveries. Live Nation\u2019s chief financial officer apologized for the Taylor Swift ticket fiasco, which he blamed on bots: Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar meanwhile cited her love for music as the reason she pushed for the hearing on the ticket companies\u2019 business practices: Free Britney America was formed to raise awareness about pop singer Britney Spears\u2019 battle with her now-ended conservatorship. The group now has a new target: Ticketmaster. Free Britney America will today be protesting outside the US Capitol as the Senate judiciary committee holds its hearing into Ticketmaster and its parents company Live Nation\u2019s business practices. \u201cBritney Spears regained her freedom on November 12, 2021, yet the question remained: how could one of the world\u2019s most famous artists be forced to perform for audiences of thousands of fans? Our research into Britney\u2019s conservatorship found that Live Nation was a central player in monetizing her abusive conservatorship. Furthermore, we assert that the inordinate power that Live Nation has across the music industry secures a culture of silence around the abuse of Britney Spears and other artists,\u201d the group said in a statement that announced today\u2019s \u201cFans Unite to Fight Ticketmaster\u201d protest. The Senate judiciary committee has begun a hearing on the live event ticketing industry, after Ticketmaster last year bungled sales of tickets to megastar Taylor Swfit\u2019s latest tour. \u201cThe issues within America\u2019s ticketing industry were made painfully obvious when Ticketmaster\u2019s website failed hundreds of thousands of fans hoping to purchase tickets for Taylor Swift\u2019s new tour, but these problems are not new,\u201d Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar said in a statement last week announcing the hearing. \u201cFor too long, consumers have faced high fees, long waits, and website failures, and Ticketmaster\u2019s dominant market position means the company faces inadequate pressure to innovate and improve.\u201d \u201cAmerican consumers deserve the benefit of competition in every market, from grocery chains to concert venues,\u201d her Republican counterpart senator Mike Lee said. When ticket's for Swift\u2019s first tour in five years went on sale in November, Ticketmaster\u2019s website crashed, leaving customers for \u201cpresale\u201d tickets stranded in line and forcing the cancellation of its public sale. The justice department is reportedly investigating the company in an inquiry that started before the problems with the Swift tour. Ticketmaster meanwhile spent nearly $1.3m on lobbying in 2021, targeting the justice department and Congress\u2019s efforts to regulate its business. You can watch the hearing live here. Donald Trump\u2019s foe today \u2013 and potentially for many months to come \u2013 is an Atlanta prosecutor with a history of taking on organized crime, the Guardian\u2019s Carlisa N. Johnson reports: An Atlanta prosecutor appears ready to use the same Georgia statute to prosecute Donald Trump that she used last year to charge dozens of gang members and well-known rappers who allegedly conspired to commit violent crime. Fani Willis was elected Fulton county district attorney just days before the conclusion of the 2020 presidential election. But as she celebrated her promotion, Trump and his allies set in motion a flurry of unfounded claims of voter fraud in Georgia, the state long hailed as a Republican stronghold for local and national elections. Willis assumed office on 1 January 2021, becoming the first Black woman in the position. The next day, according to reports, Trump called rad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, urging him to \u201cfind\u201d the nearly 12,000 votes he needed to secure a victory and overturn the election results. The following month, Willis launched an investigation into Trump\u2019s interference in the state\u2019s general election. Now, in a hearing on Tuesday, the special purpose grand jury and the presiding judge will decide whether to release to the public the final report and findings of the grand jury that was seated to investigate Trump and his allies. Today may be a big day for Donald Trump, and not in a good way, the Guardian\u2019s Chris McGreal reports: A judge in Atlanta will hear legal arguments today to determine if he should make public a Georgia grand jury\u2019s report into whether former president Donald Trump committed criminal offences when he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election in the state. Before the special purpose grand jury was dissolved two weeks ago after months of hearings, its members recommended releasing its findings while the Fulton county district attorney who launched the investigation, Fani Willis, decides whether to press charges against Trump. Legal scholars have said they believe Trump is \u201cat substantial risk of prosecution\u201d in Georgia over his attempts to strong-arm officials into fixing the election in his favour when it looked as if the state might decide the outcome of the presidential election. At least 18 other people have been told they also potentially face prosecution, including Trump\u2019s close ally and lawyer, the former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The Fulton county superior court judge who oversaw the grand jury, Robert McBurney, will hear from Willis but not lawyers for Trump, who said on Monday that they will not participate in the hearing. They said that Willis had not sought to interview the former president for the investigation. \u201cTherefore, we can assume that the grand jury did their job and looked at the facts and the law, as we have, and concluded there were no violations of the law by President Trump,\u201d the lawyers said in a statement. While mass shootings such as those that occurred over the past days in California may generate headlines and calls for action, the Guardian\u2019s Oliver Holmes reports gun violence is distressingly common in the United States: Two horrific killings separated by just a few days have shaken California, but such nightmarish mass shootings cannot be considered abnormal in the US. With a week still left in January, this year there have already been 39 mass shootings across the country, five of them in California. Reports from the Gun Violence Archive, a not-for-profit research group, show the predictability of American mass shootings. Nearly 70 people have been shot dead in them so far in 2023, according to their data \u2013 which classifies a mass shooting as any armed attack in which at least four people are injured or killed, not including the perpetrator. Broadened out to include all deaths from gun violence, not including suicides, 1,214 people have been killed before the end of the first month of this year, including 120 children. That is likely to increase to tens of thousands by the end of 2023 \u2013 the figure for 2022 is 20,200. In comparison, the latest data from the UK showed that in the course of an entire year ending in March 2022, 31 people were killed by firearms. The UK\u2019s population is 67 million to the US\u2019s 333 million. A familiar cycle occurs after American mass shootings, and by all appearances, it\u2019s happening again after the twin massacres in California. It goes something like this: multiple people are killed by a gunman, as happened in California\u2019s Monterey Park on Saturday and Half Moon Bay on Monday. Joe Biden calls for new restrictions on gun ownership, arguing they could have prevented the killer from getting their hands on a weapon. He\u2019s backed by most, if not all Democrats in Congress, but rejected by most, if not all, Republicans. The demand goes nowhere. The one exception to that came after last year\u2019s shootings at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, when Democrats managed to win enough Republican votes to get a package of modest gun control measures through Congress. But the legislation was not the ban on assault weapons Biden called on Congress pass, a demand he repeated in the months since, as mass shootings continued. With Republicans now controlling the House of Representatives, it seems even less likely such a measure will get approved. Good morning, US politics blog readers. Joe Biden has called for Congress to again pass a ban on assault weapons, after seven people were killed in a mass shooting on Monday on the outskirts of the California town of Half Moon Bay. That was just days after a separate shooter killed 11 people in Monterey Park, a suburb of Los Angeles. Congress passed an assault weapons ban in 1994 that expired 10 years later, and Biden has repeatedly called for renewing it, including after the massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas last year. But many Republicans in Congress oppose such a measure, and just as in the aftermath of previous mass shootings, it seems unlikely to pass. Here\u2019s what we can expect to happen today: A judge in Atlanta will at 12 pm eastern time convene a hearing to determine whether a special grand jury\u2019s report into Donald Trump\u2019s campaign to meddle in Georgia\u2019s 2020 election outcome will be made public, upping the legal stakes for the former president. Biden will hold a White House meeting with Democratic congressional leaders at 3 pm, and a reception for new lawmakers at 5:20 pm. White House press secretary Karine Jean Pierre will brief reporters at 1:30 pm, who will likely ask her questions abut the Biden classified document scandal that she will not answer."

            "content": "What do you get the tech fan who has everything? Perhaps a statue of Twitter\u2019s bright-blue logo, for a mere $100,000. That\u2019s what the priciest item went for at an auction of the company\u2019s office supplies, according to the BBC. The sale marks the latest episode in the continuing saga of Elon Musk\u2019s $44bn takeover of the company, which has generated seemingly endless chaos \u2013 from sudden policy changes to the elimination of thousands of jobs. Heritage Global Partners, which ran the auction, has not released sales figures, but the BBC and SFGate caught a few highlights: A 10ft tall neon Twitter sign, perhaps a nice companion piece to the statue, sold for a mere $40,000. A 6ft tall planter in the shape of the @ symbol \u2013 which is, of course, an icon of the platform \u2013 closed at $15,500, according to SFGate. A conference table made from reclaimed wood closed at nearly $10,500. A fancy espresso machine from La Marzocco went for about $13,500 \u2013 less than half its retail value \u2013 while an Eames chair apparently saw added value thanks to its Twitter associations. Normally, it would go for $1,195, but Twitter\u2019s chair went for at least $1,400, as a company engineer pointed out. Other items on sale included kegerators (AKA beer fridges), a rotisserie oven and a \u201chigh-performance task chair\u201d \u2013 in short, everything you need for a productive day in Silicon Valley. The sale comes after Musk himself warned of a \u201cmassive drop in revenue\u201d in November. Reports on Wednesday pointed to a 40% plunge year-over-year as advertisers pause spending. But that\u2019s not why the items are being auctioned, according to Heritage. A representative told Fortune in December that the auction \u201chas nothing to do with their financial position\u201d, adding: \u201cIf anyone genuinely thinks that the revenue from selling a couple computers and chairs will pay for the mountain there, then they\u2019re a moron.\u201d Then again, he didn\u2019t mention the statue."

            "date": "2023-01-31T21:49:49Z",
            "content": "The Arizona secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, asked the state attorney general Monday to investigate and potentially charge the losing Republican candidate for governor with a felony for sharing images of voters\u2019 signatures online. Fontes, a Democrat, said GOP gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake may have violated a state law that protects a voter\u2019s signature from being accessed or shared by anyone other than the voter or an \u201cauthorized government official in the scope of the official\u2019s duties\u201d. Violations of this law carry a class six felony charge, the lowest-level felony in Arizona. Lake posted the voters\u2019 signatures on Twitter on 23 January, claiming they were part of a \u201cbombshell\u201d that showed mismatching signatures that shouldn\u2019t have been counted, a frequently repeated claim after Republican losses in 2020 and 2022. The signatures she posted were from 2020 ballots. In his letter to the Democratic attorney general, Kris Mayes, Fontes asked that Mayes \u201cinvestigate and take appropriate enforcement action against Kari Lake\u201d. Mayes\u2019 office confirmed receipt of the referral but said it wouldn\u2019t have further comment on the matter at this time. Despite her loss, Lake has continued to fundraise based on the false premise that she actually won the governor\u2019s race and that the election results will be overturned. Lake\u2019s run for governor focused heavily on the false assertion that the 2020 election was stolen. She held a rally in Scottsdale on Sunday when Donald Trump appeared by phone and said Lake will be \u201cvictorious\u201d in her effort to overturn the 2022 election. Since Fontes\u2019 referral became public, Lake has retweeted several accounts who called Fontes\u2019 election into question and who have said the referral was proof that Lake was correct in her claims of a stolen election. Lake wasn\u2019t the first to share voters\u2019 signatures to make claims about their validity. The signatures have been shared by state lawmakers and election-denial groups in presentations at the state legislature, Votebeat\u2019s Jen Fifield pointed out on Twitter, though it\u2019s not clear how the confidentiality of the signatures was originally breached."

            "date": "2023-01-31T00:54:47Z",
            "content": "New Zealand\u2019s Labour party has seen a boost in its popularity after the resignation of Jacinda Ardern, according to two new polls, in some of the party\u2019s best results in a year. The polls, released on Monday night, are the first to be taken in the wake of Ardern\u2019s shock exit, and show a rise in support for both the party and the new prime minister Chris Hipkins, who assumed office last week and immediately faced catastrophic flooding in New Zealand\u2019s biggest city. In the 1 News Kantar poll, the Labour party gained five percentage points, polling at 38% \u2013 one point ahead of the centre-right National party, and Labour\u2019s best result since January 2022. Another poll, conducted by Newshub-Reid Research also showed Labour on 38%, up 5.7 points. The polls were conducted before the flooding in Auckland and therefore do not capture New Zealanders\u2019 assessment of the government handling of the crisis. A state of emergency remains in place in Auckland, where the flood waters have killed at least four people, displaced hundreds, and seen homes carried off their foundations or destroyed by landslides. A \u201choneymoon bump\u201d of a few points is reasonably common for new political leaders in New Zealand, and the news of Ardern\u2019s resignation and replacement guaranteed Hipkins high levels of media coverage and name recognition. The Newshub-Reid Research poll, however, indicated that Hipkins \u2013 known to New Zealanders as the face of the country\u2019s Covid response \u2013 has also won a level of trust that his opponent, ex-business executive Christopher Luxon, struggled to match. Asked whether they trusted both the major party leaders, 52.9% of voters said they trust Hipkins, while 26.9% didn\u2019t trust him. Just 36.9% said they trusted Luxon, compared with 43.8% who said they didn\u2019t. Kantar\u2019s poll also placed Hipkins ahead of his opponent on overall approval. The prime minister\u2019s approval rating was 46%, compared with disapproval rate of 10%. Luxon\u2019s approval rating was 43%, but he faced far higher disapproval, at 34%. Hipkins told Newshub that trust \u201cmatters an enormous amount to me\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to be upfront with New Zealanders and I\u2019ve always found a good level of support comes from that.\u201d Luxon said the result was \u201cnot unexpected \u2013 a new leader gets a bounce in the polls.\u201d \u201cMy job over the next year is to make sure people understand they can trust me,\u201d he said. Hipkins\u2019 promise to \u201crefocus\u201d the government on the economy and the cost of living crisis may also have moved the needle. While economic confidence remains low, voters were more optimistic about New Zealand\u2019s economic outlook than they were at the end of last year, with 28% saying they believed the economy would improve in the next 12 months, compared with 18% in late 2022. However, even with the most recent boost in polling, Labour would face a narrow pathway to re-election, and the latest results predict an extremely tight vote in October. With the right-wing libertarian Act party polling at about 10%, and the left Green party at 7-8%, the traditional right bloc would sit at about 47%, and the left at 46% \u2013 leaving the balance of power with the M\u0101ori party."

            "content": "Watching birds and hearing birdsong have a positive impact on wellbeing for more than nine in 10 people, according to a survey to mark the largest garden wildlife count in the world. People are being urged to boost their mental health and help scientists by spending an hour this weekend counting the birds in their garden or local park for the RSPB\u2019s Big Garden Birdwatch. Almost 700,000 people took part last year, counting more than 11 million birds, with the house sparrow the most commonly seen garden visitor, followed by the blue tit and starling. RSPB ornithologists fear the recent cold snap in Britain may affect this year\u2019s sightings, with harsh weather increasing the mortality of the smallest birds, such as long-tailed tits and wrens. Cold conditions may also encourage less frequent garden visitors to turn up at bird feeders, including redpolls and bramblings. A YouGov poll commissioned by the RSPB found that 88% of UK adults said spending time outdoors enjoying the natural world was important to them, with 53% stating it was very important, while 91% agreed that seeing birds and hearing birdsong had a positive impact on mental health and wellbeing. Spending time in woodlands, wetlands and other natural spaces has been shown by various studies to improve mental health and wellbeing. Dr Amir Khan, the president of the RSPB, said: \u201cWorking as a GP, I know just how important accessing green spaces is for our physical and mental wellbeing. Watching the blue tits and bullfinches enjoying the feeders in my garden is a constant source of comfort for me, and being on the frontline of the NHS I am very aware that comfort is something we all need now more than ever.\u201d Over four decades, Big Garden Birdwatch has alerted scientists to rises and falls in bird species. Last year\u2019s sightings data pointed to a revival for the disease-hit greenfinch, while over the decades the survey also first noted the precipitous decline in song thrushes, which are down 81% compared with the first Big Garden Birdwatch in 1979. It was 20th in the rankings last year, seen in just 8% of gardens. Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the RSPB, said: \u201cWhatever you see \u2013 one blackbird, 20 sparrows or no birds at all \u2013 it all counts. It helps us build that vital overall picture of how our garden birds are faring from one year to the next. With so much challenging our birds now, it\u2019s more important than ever to submit your results. Our garden birds are counting on you.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-26T21:48:53Z",
            "content": "The Conservatives must \u201crelentlessly focus\u201d on inflation and the NHS if they are to have a chance at the next election, cabinet ministers have been told. Rishi Sunak gathered ministers at his country retreat Chequers on Thursday for a midday political cabinet \u2013 where a number of ministers gave presentations on the government\u2019s key priorities and took a fresh look at the strategy for the next election. Sources said that ministers would be given a bleak picture about the party\u2019s unpopularity, but that there was some reason for optimism as polling showed the party was regaining confidence on the economy. Sunak said each minister would be focusing on ways they could deliver the five priorities he set out in January \u2013 halving inflation, boosting economic growth, cutting national debt, addressing the NHS backlog and stopping migrant boats crossing the Channel. He said delivering them would provide \u201cpeace of mind for people, immediate relief for families, but also that they can look forward to a better future for their children and grandchildren, filled with hope, optimism and pride in our country\u201d. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, health secretary, Steve Barclay, the work and pensions secretary, Mel Stride and the home secretary, Suella Braverman, spoke at the summit on the delivery of the priorities. Hunt told cabinet ministers that inflation was the key to everything, from strikes to infrastructure and voter misery on the cost of living. At the awayday, Sunak and Hunt said that inflation is only predicted to fall \u201cbecause of the tough decisions the government had taken at the autumn statement to stabilise the economy\u201d. But in a strong signal that the forthcoming budget will be restrained on both spending and tax cuts, Hunt said that it was necessary to maintain fiscal discipline. Barclay said the government was on course to meet some of its early targets for the NHS, including eliminating two-year waits, and that the next phases would be new reforms to improve emergency and primary care. Stride, who chaired the Treasury select committee, was expected to give a new update on ways to address economic inactivity, which Sunak sees as key to unlocking growth. There have been various possibilities floated about ways to get people back into work, including changes to income tax for the over-50s and an advertising campaign aimed at getting women back to work after having children, though both have come in for public criticism. Sources said Stride would speak on the work to identify the root causes particularly on hard-to-reach cohorts who are out of the workplace \u2013 over 50s, long-term sick and disabled people and carers. Ministers were also given a presentation on priorities, polling and battleground seats from elections chief Isaac Levido, brought back to the party by Sunak having previously masterminded Boris Johnson\u2019s 2019 victory. Nadhim Zahawi, the party chair, has been sidelined during the awayday amid the ongoing scandal surrounding his tax affairs. Party officials believe that although the polls showing a 20-point lead for Labour are a true reflection of the Conservatives\u2019 unpopularity, there is some sign that the Labour support is mostly a representation of anger at the government rather than enthusiasm for Keir Starmer. Ministers also said they expected to see what key dividing lines could be drawn with Labour, likely to include immigration and small boats crossing the Channel, as well as trans rights and gender issues. But a key public blow was dealt to the party by Sir Rod Stewart, who called into a live Sky News phone-in to say he was no longer backing the Conservatives because of the state of the NHS. \u201cI personally have been a Tory for a long time but I think this government should stand down now and give the Labour party a go, this is heartbreaking,\u201d he said. \u201cIn all my years in this country I\u2019ve never seen it so bad \u2026 change the bloody government.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-16T07:00:36Z",
            "content": "The cost of living crisis is damaging the mental health of nearly half of adults in Great Britain, with people in Wales the unhappiest of all, according to research. In Wales, 61% of adults said their current financial situation was damaging their mental health, compared with 48% of people in Scotland and 47% in England, according to YouGov research for Business in the Community (BITC), the Prince\u2019s Responsible Business network. Comparable research suggests that the mental health of working adults in Great Britain has plummeted since 2020, when only 35% of people in Wales and Scotland and 36% of people in England said their financial situation was having a negative impact on their mental health. Luke Young, an assistant director of Citizens Advice Cymru, said the cost of living crisis was having a profound impact on people across Wales. \u201cWe know that financial difficulty, combined with longstanding issues with poverty, can make people feel unsteady and unsettled,\u201d he said. \u201cNearly half of our debt clients in Wales are living on negative budgets, meaning they have nothing left after essential bills are paid. \u201cThis feels precarious for lots of people, and so the lack of financial stability, the lack of confidence in knowing how you\u2019re going to pay for the unexpected things that might pop up, has an effect on emotional wellbeing.\u201d Young said the Welsh government\u2019s Fuel Support Scheme was more generous than the offer from the UK government in England, but it was planning on ending the scheme next winter. \u201cThis is money that really helps people stay above water,\u201d he said, and urged people to contact the charity if they were struggling to cope. When the survey asked respondents across Great Britain if they were worried about paying bills in the next six months, 64% of adults in Wales agreed, while the figures for England and Scotland were 53% and 54% respectively. In England, people in the east Midlands (57%), Yorkshire and the Humber, and the south-west (56%) were the most worried about paying their bills, compared with 49% of adults in London. BITC has launched an action plan for businesses to help them mitigate the cost of living crisis, which includes paying the real living wage, allowing staff to work flexibly, assessing the needs of low-income customers and providing affordable products, sharing goods with low-income communities, and supporting supply chains. Mary Macleod, the chief executive of Business in the Community, said that while businesses were also being hit they could make a real difference to the UK\u2019s 30 million employees. \u201cOur cost of living action plan provides businesses with the guidance they need to support their most vulnerable employees, customers and the communities around them,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2023-01-25T02:18:57Z",
            "content": "Last year was an odd one for Australia\u2019s biggest music poll \u2013 believed to be the largest music poll in the world. A children\u2019s group who formed more than 30 years ago topped Triple J\u2019s chart with a cover of a decade-old song, while Olivia Rodrigo and Doja Cat made up 10% of the total list between them \u2013 despite neither being the fare we would expect from the alternative youth station. A song featuring Justin Bieber placed second, as the various campaigns to include/exclude Taylor Swift in/from the 2014 countdown faded fast from our collective memory. And, as if to draw a line in the sand, for the first time ever, a compilation CD didn\u2019t follow the countdown. So, who will top the 2022 Hottest 100? The latest earworm from Harry\u2019s House? The Hooley Dooleys covering Know Your Product? Perhaps it will be a more obvious summer banger, such as the 61-second classic Southern Brooding Gastric Frog \u2013 track 55 from this year\u2019s chart-topping Australian Frog Calls charity album, for the uninitiated. Either that or it will just be a popular song from a popular band. According to Warm Tunas \u2013 a prediction site with a sample size of more than 250,000 voters, and a good track record of triangulating the year\u2019s top tunes \u2013 the pointy end of the list will be populated by Australian artists. This year on the podium, skivvies will be optional. A familiar Top 10 A local song will inevitably top the countdown this year, according to the early numbers. Flume, Gang Of Youths, Ball Park Music and Spacey Jane will all battle it out for first place. If this particular local lineup is giving deja vu, you need only cast your mind back to the 2020 countdown, topped by UK band Glass Animals\u2019 song Heat Wave. Spacey Jane came in at No 2 (for Booster Seat), Flume at No 3 (The Difference), and Ball Park Music at No 4 (Cherub). Gang Of Youths didn\u2019t have a new release that year, but landed at No 6 the following year with The Angel Of 8th Ave. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Of the aforementioned frontrunners, Flume appears to be the slight favourite at this point, with his February single Say Nothing, featuring young Sydney artist Maya Cumming, likely to score the producer his second No 1. The producer certainly has form in the top five; in fact he has previously taken out every slot. Flume hit No 1 in 2016 with Never Be Like You, No 2 in 2019 with Rushing Back, No 3 with The Difference in 2020, No 4 with Holdin On in 2012, and No 5 with Drop The Game in 2013. Could this be the year he lands that feted No 6 spot? Fremantle foursome Spacey Jane are an outside chance at landing No 1 with the cracking Hardlight, but seem more likely to land somewhere lower within the Top 5. Sitting Up also has a fair chance of reaching the Top 10, both songs come from the band\u2019s second album Here Comes Everything. Spacey Jane have strong recent form, landing at No 3 in 2021 with Lots of Nothing (behind the skivvies and the Bieb) and No 12 with Lunchtime. The previous year, Booster Seat reached No 2, blocked by the aforementioned Heat Waves. Stars In My Eyes by Ball Park Music is also a strong chance for No 1. Their song Cherub\u2019s No 4 placing in 2020 remains their best showing, but the Brisbane five-piece have previously landed a whopping 12 entries in the chart \u2013 including last year\u2019s kaleidoscopic Sunscreen, which reached No 21. Gang of Youths to finally hit No 1? Evangelical rockers Gang Of Youths are looking likely to get the No 1 spot, with the tender In The Wake Of Your Leave: a dirge lamenting the passing of frontman David Le\u2019aupepe\u2019s father. The band completely swamped the 2017 countdown, landing No 2, No 5, and No 10 with Let Me Down Easy, The Deepest Sighs, The Frankest Shadows (can a shadow be frank?) and What Can I Do If The Fire Goes Out? Gang of Youths may have dominated in 2017, but Kendrick Lamar\u2019s not-so-humble Humble took out the top place that year by a wide margin. For a man who released 19 songs into the world in 2022, the rapper is conspicuously absent from this year\u2019s predictions, despite the five-year break between his last record (which had four songs in the 2017 Hottest 100) and this year\u2019s Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers. According to Warm Tunas, just one Kendrick song will enter the 200 \u2013 N95 \u2013 which is tipped to land in the mid-30s. Perhaps it\u2019s a matter of voting choices being spread too thin over a double album. Other tunes in with an outside chance of hitting No 1 include New Gold by Gorillaz, featuring Tame Impala and Bootie Brown; Delilah (Pull Me Out Of This) by Fred Again; and B.O.T.A. by Eliza Rose &amp; Interplanetary Criminal. If recent elections have taught us anything, it\u2019s that pre-polling is useful, but ultimately flawed. This year\u2019s Hottest 100 is anyone\u2019s for the taking. Triple J\u2019s Hottest 100 countdown kicks off 12pm AEDT on Saturday 28 January."

            "date": "2023-01-22T17:26:10Z",
            "content": "Boris Johnson made a surprise appearance in Ukraine on Sunday as he denied any conflict of interest over his role in appointing a new BBC chairman while in No 10. Labour has asked the watchdog for public appointments to examine the recruitment process after it was reported Richard Sharp helped Johnson with his personal finances during the interview process for the role at the corporation. The Sunday Times said Sharp, a former Goldman Sachs banker, was involved in helping to sort out a guarantee on a loan worth up to \u00a3800,000 for Johnson in late 2020. While the loan guarantee was itself given by Sam Blyth, a Canadian businessman and distant cousin of Johnson, the report said Sharp had helped with the arrangement, including having a conversation with Simon Case, the cabinet secretary. While Sharp has not commented, a spokesperson for Johnson rejected any wrongdoing. Johnson was visiting Ukraine on Sunday, holding talks in Kyiv with the country\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who Johnson said had invited him. He also visited the towns of Borodianka and Bucha. \u201cThe suffering of the people of Ukraine has gone on for too long,\u201d said Johnson, who as prime minister left domestic political turmoils to travel to Ukraine several times. \u201cThe only way to end this war is for Ukraine to win \u2013 and to win as fast as possible.\u201d Lucy Powell, the shadow culture secretary, has written to William Shawcross, the commissioner for public appointments, to request he examine how Sharp was appointed, saying it was \u201cvital\u201d for the public to know the process had been fair and transparent. Sharp\u2019s reported involvement in securing the loan guarantee was seemingly not declared to the culture department\u2019s appointment panel, to the BBC, or mentioned during a pre-appointment hearing before the culture, media and sport select committee, Powell wrote. \u201cThe BBC derives its public trust and national standing from its independence and impartiality, something we hear a lot about from the government about the BBC,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is vital that the public and parliament can have trust in this process and it is free from any real or perceived conflict of interest.\u201d A spokesperson for Johnson confirmed that the then-PM did have a dinner with Blyth and Sharp in November 2020, as reported by the Sunday Times, saying Johnson had known Sharp for almost 20 years. The spokesperson added: \u201cSo what? Big deal.\u201d Sharp had \u201cnever given any financial advice to Boris Johnson, nor has Mr Johnson sought any financial advice from him\u201d, the spokesperson said, saying all Johnson\u2019s financial arrangements \u201chave been properly declared and registered on the advice of officials.\u201d James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, the minister sent out for media interviews on Sunday, said he had not inquired about whether the Sunday Times\u2019 version of events was accurate. \u201cI\u2019ve not had a conversation with either of those parties about that,\u201d Cleverly said told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme. Asked why he had not sought to find out any information before appearing, Cleverly said: \u201cYou\u2019re the journalist, not me.\u201d In a subsequent interview on BBC One\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Cleverly said Sharp was an \u201cincredibly accomplished, incredibly successful individual who brings a wealth of experience with him\u201d, and that he had \u201cabsolutely no doubt he was appointed on merit\u201d. A government spokesperson said Sharp was appointed \u201cfollowing a rigorous appointments process including assessment by a panel of experts, constituted according to the public appointments code\u201d. They added: \u201cThe recruitment process is set out clearly and transparently in the governance code on public appointments and overseen by the commissioner for public appointments.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-11T16:17:14Z",
            "content": "Ukraine\u2019s military has denied that Russian forces have encircled and captured Soledar after claims by the head of the Wagner mercenary group that the eastern city had fallen. The claims about the status of the fighting on the eastern Donbas front were made by Yevgeny Prigozhin as Poland announced that it planned to transfer 10 German-made Leopard 2 main battle tanks to Ukraine, in a move with wide significance. Speaking on a visit to Lviv on Wednesday, the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, said: \u201cA company of Leopard tanks will be handed over as part of coalition building. We want it to be an international coalition.\u201d The transfer would require permission from Germany, which Kyiv has been pressing separately to supply Leopard 2s, perhaps suggesting a softening of Germany\u2019s stance on the transfer of main battle tanks after recent contacts between Warsaw and Berlin. However, a German government spokesperson said it was not aware of any requests from allies to send the tanks to Ukraine. Commenting on the fighting in Soledar, Serhiy Cherevatyi, the spokesperson for the eastern group of the Ukrainian armed forces, said: \u201cRussians say that it is under their control; it is not true.\u201d The Russian capture of Soledar and the city\u2019s saltmines would have symbolic, military and commercial value for Moscow. But the situation in and around Soledar appeared fluid and neither claim could be independently verified. Prigozhin had released a photo showing him with a group of his fighters and a tank, which he said was taken in one of the tunnels of a saltmine in the south-west of Soledar. He also said that only units of his paramilitary company \u2013 many of them convicts who had been offered a pardon if they fought for him \u2013 had been involved in fighting for the city. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, mocked Russian claims to have taken over parts of the city, and maintained that fighting was ongoing. \u201cThe terrorist state and its propagandists are trying to pretend that some part of our city of Soledar \u2026 is allegedly some kind of Russia\u2019s achievement,\u201d he said in his Wednesday evening address. \u201cThey will present \u2013 and are already presenting \u2013 this to their society in such a way as to support mobilisation and to give hope to those who support aggression. \u201cBut the fighting continues. The Donetsk direction is holding out.\u201d Footage posted from Soledar by a Ukrainian soldier from a drone unit \u2013 identified by the call sign Maygar at 10am on Wednesday \u2013 suggested heavy clashes were continuing but Ukrainian forces were still holding positions. \u201cThis is the sound of Soledar,\u201d he said to the background noise of constant artillery strikes. \u201cLocal fights are happening from time to time and artillery is working on both sides.\u201d Accounts from Ukrainian soldiers on that sector of the front suggested Russia had moved Wagner fighters from Bakhmut to focus solely on the battle for Soledar. Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said \u201chard battles are going on to keep Soledar\u201d. She added: \u201cThe enemy does not pay attention to the large losses of its personnel and continues to actively storm. The approaches to our positions are simply littered with the bodies of dead enemy fighters.\u201d However, the Ukrainian military\u2019s morning summary made only one mention of Soledar, listing it as one of several areas being shelled in the Donetsk region. A Ukrainian soldier who has been posting video updates from the Bakhmut area described the fighting in Soledar as fierce, with contested buildings changing hands multiple times and soldiers suffering frostbite. Russian forces have recently focused their efforts on the capture of Soledar as part of their ambition to take the nearby strategic city of Bakhmut and Ukraine\u2019s larger eastern Donbas region, leading to fierce battles in sub-zero temperatures over the past five days. Prigozhin claimed late on Tuesday to have taken the entire city, encircling Ukrainian forces in a \u201ccauldron\u201d in the centre. \u201cWagner units took control of the entire territory of Soledar. A cauldron has been formed in the centre in which urban fighting is going on. The number of prisoners will be announced tomorrow,\u201d he said, giving no further details. While western military analysts have geolocated Wagner units in the centre, where there has been heavy fighting for the main administrative building, Russian claims to have taken the south-west of the area \u2013 where Ukraine had recently been mounting a defence close to the saltmines \u2013 appeared more questionable. The British Ministry of Defence said earlier that Russian troops and Wagner fighters had probably taken control of most of Soledar after four days of advances. But Prigozhin\u2019s comment suggested Russian control was incomplete. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the military command did not mention control of Soledar on Tuesday evening. He repeated his call for more western weapons, saying Russia was gathering forces to intensify its campaign, but did not provide details. Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry tweeted late on Tuesday: \u201cEven after suffering colossal losses, Russia is still maniacally trying to seize Soledar \u2013 home to the largest saltmine in Europe.\u201d Ukraine said earlier that its forces were still holding on to positions in Soledar, withstanding assaults by wave after wave of Russian forces seeking their first battlefield victory for months. Some prominent Russian military bloggers have urged caution about the situation in Soledar and said intense combat in the centre and outskirts continued during the night. The Institute for the Study of War was also cautious over the Russian claims, noting that the fall of the city might prove to be of limited value in the fight for Bakhmut. \u201cEven taking the most generous Russian claims at face value, the capture of Soledar would not portend an immediate encirclement of Bakhmut. Control of Soledar will not necessarily allow Russian forces to exert control over critical Ukrainian ground lines of communication into Bakhmut,\u201d the US thinktank said. Seizing Soledar would, however, be Russia\u2019s most substantial gain since August, after a series of humiliating retreats in the second half of 2022. Russian forces have been fighting for months to capture Bakhmut. But any victory would come at a massive cost, with troops from both sides having taken heavy losses in some of the most intense combat since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly 11 months ago. The Kyiv government has released photos in recent days purporting to show scores of dead Russian soldiers in muddy fields. The issue of supplying tanks to Ukraine has become the centre of a frenzied round of recent diplomacy, as a number of countries have put pressure on the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to allow the supply of Leopard 2s.

            "date": "2023-01-28T10:03:04Z",
            "content": "Two Israelis have been shot in occupied East Jerusalem hours after a gunman killed seven people outside a synagogue, as the worst violence in years across Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories continues to escalate. Israel\u2019s ambulance service said a father and son, in their 50s and 20s, were badly hurt in the incident in a Jewish neighbourhood near the Old City on Saturday morning. Police said the assailant had been shot by an armed passerby. There were conflicting reports on his condition. Police identified the attacker as a 13-year-old boy and unconfirmed Arabic and Hebrew media reports said he was from the nearby Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan. Saturday\u2019s shooting came after a Palestinian gunman killed seven people, including children, near a synagogue on the outskirts of East Jerusalem as they were leaving Shabbat prayers on Friday night. The attack in the Israeli settlement of Neve Yaakov was the worst targeting Israelis in years. The 21-year-old suspect was shot and killed as he tried to flee, police said. Forty-two people, including members of the gunman\u2019s family, were arrested overnight in connection with the attack. Israeli police and the army have been put on high alert and extra troops have been posted to Jerusalem and the West Bank in anticipation of more violence. The Neve Yaakov attack, in turn, came a day after the deadliest Israeli army raid in the West Bank in two decades, in which nine Palestinians were killed, including two civilians. Thursday morning\u2019s operation targeted Islamic Jihad militants in the Jenin refugee camp in the north of the occupied West Bank, triggering tit-for-tat rocket fire between the Gaza Strip and Israel in the early hours of Friday and sparking fears of a conflagration in the decades-long conflict. The Palestinian Authority, which has limited control over parts of the West Bank, said it would suspend security cooperation with Israel in response to the Jenin raid. Last year was the bloodiest in Israel and the West Bank since 2004, with about 150 Palestinians and 30 Israelis killed. Another 49 Palestinians died in the Gaza Strip in a surprise three-day Israeli bombing campaign in August. Thirty-two Palestinians have been killed so far this month. Illustrating the potential for further escalation, the Palestinian health ministry said on Friday night that three Palestinians were taken to hospital after being shot by an Israeli settler in an incident near the northern West Bank city of Nablus. The US state department, along with the UN and other international mediators, has urged \u201cutmost restraint\u201d from both sides to de-escalate the situation. This week\u2019s bloodshed comes just after the re-election of the longtime Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is now at the helm of the most extremist government in Israeli history. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition of religious and far-right parties has vowed stricter policies towards the Palestinians, including loosening the rules of engagement for soldiers and police, and the acceleration of Jewish settlement building in the West Bank. Netanyahu vowed on Saturday evening to take forceful and timely measures after the two attacks. \u201cOur response will be strong, swift and accurate,\u201d he said before a meeting of the security cabinet. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeking an escalation but are prepared for any scenario.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-31T12:58:13Z",
            "content": "Australia has imposed sanctions on Iranian security officials and has targeted Myanmar\u2019s military ruler on the second anniversary of the military coup there. The Australian government revealed a range of new sanctions late on Tuesday, including Iranian figures linked to the suppression of protests and the export of drones for Russian use in the war against Ukraine. Australian travel bans and asset freezes will apply to 16 people and one entity linked to \u201cserious abuses of human rights in Iran\u201d, including the commander-in-chief of the army, Sayyed Abdolrahim Mousavi, and senior figures in the Basij resistance force. The Iranian sanctions were the third round of measures applied under Australia\u2019s new Magnitsky-style sanctions laws, which passed the parliament in late 2021. The move pre-empts the scheduled release on Wednesday of a parliamentary inquiry report about human rights in Iran, which was likely to increase pressure on the Australian government to take a tougher stand. \u201cThe [Iran] listings cover serious violations or serious abuses of the right to life and the right not to be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,\u201d the government said in an explanatory note published on Tuesday. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cThese relate to the oppression of women in enforcing the Islamic dress code and violent suppression of peaceful protests in Iran.\u201d In a separate sanctions instrument, Australia also listed four persons and four entities for targeted financial sanctions and travel bans under the Ukraine war criteria. These persons and entities \u201chave been involved in the supply of Iranian Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (\u2018UAVs\u2019) to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine\u201d, the government\u2019s sanctions notice said. The Australian government also revealed late on Tuesday that it was finally imposing sanctions on Myanmar military figures. The 16 people targeted include the commander in chief, Min Aung Hlaing, and his deputy, Soe Win. Human rights groups have long expressed frustration at the Australian government\u2019s reluctance to expand sanctions since the military seized power in Myanmar on 1 February 2021. The government\u2019s sanctions instrument \u2013 signed by the the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong \u2013 says the measures signal Australia\u2019s \u201congoing concerns about the situation in Myanmar\u201d. \u201cThese [Myanmar] sanctions allow a targeted response to Australia\u2019s concerns about serious violations of human rights committed by the military regime and ongoing efforts to suppress the rights of the civilian population through violence and coercion,\u201d the government\u2019s explanatory note said. The Myanmar sanctions also target two entities, the Myanmar Economic Corporation and Myanmar Economic Holdings Public Company Ltd."

            "date": "2023-01-18T10:00:02Z",
            "content": "The mob attack on Brazil\u2019s supreme court, congress and presidential palace earlier this month has focused attention on the country\u2019s military police, with calls for the force to be reformed growing amid what experts say could be a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d for President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Thousands of far-right radicals supportive of former president Jair Bolsonaro stormed the presidential palace, the congress building and the supreme court on 8 January. The intention, many political analysts believe, was to create a sense of chaos and disorder that would allow for far-right forces \u2013 possibly with the support of Brazil\u2019s armed forces \u2013 to depose Lula. During the assault, the capital\u2019s military police stood by, allowing the mob to ransack the seats of power, and it was only when Lula stripped them of their command several hours into the insurrection that federal forces regained control of the situation. \u201cI am convinced that the door to the [presidential] palace was opened so these people could get in because I didn\u2019t see the front door had been broken down,\u201d Lula told reporters last week. \u201cAnd that means that somebody facilitated their entry in here.\u201d Almost two-thirds of Brazilians believe the capital police did not do their duty, according to a poll by Datafolha. Both the governor and chief of police were removed from their posts and about 82% of those polled said Lula was right to order a federal intervention. Those numbers provide the leftist president, who beat Bolsonaro in an October election and took office on 1 January, with an opportunity to debate reforms, said Benedito Mariano, a former ombudsman for the S\u00e3o Paulo military police. Mariano said military police are poorly paid and do not feel valued. Their military codes and mindset mean they are more used to fighting enemies than protecting citizens. Working conditions are often rough and mental health is a serious issue. An overhaul is long overdue, he said. \u201cThis is an anachronic system built in an authoritarian era and reform has to be on the political agenda,\u201d he said. Policing in Brazil is shared by different bodies. The military police are in charge of prevention and the civil police oversee investigation. Both fall under the jurisdiction of Brazil\u2019s 27 state governors. Cooperation between the forces is not always exemplary. Because policing is a state responsibility, most presidents have been reluctant to interfere. Bolsonaro, though, is a former army captain who speaks the language of the barracks and packed his government with high-ranking officers. He also won support from those in uniform when he reformed the pension system to benefit officers in both the police and military. That helped lead to an increase in the number of pro-Bolsonaro radicals in police ranks. Almost half of all military police officers (48%) engaged with far-right groups or figures online, according to a study published last year by the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety. That number jumped by a fifth between 2020 and 2021. \u201cDeep down we have an institution that is permeated by Bolsonarista ideology that accepts a democratic rupture in the name of a far-right project,\u201d said the forum\u2019s president, Renato S\u00e9rgio de Lima. What Lula plans to do is still unclear but the insurrection means the issue is now front and centre, said Melina Risso, a research director at the Igarap\u00e9 Institute. In one promising sign, Lula reached out to Brazil\u2019s state governors immediately after the attack, prompting hopes a collaborative approach may prevail. \u201cThere is a window of opportunity, this is now on everybody\u2019s radar,\u201d Risso said. \u201cIt all depends on political will and their ability to negotiate with congress. Passing legislation to reform the police is no more difficult than passing legislation to reform the tax code. It\u2019s complicated but it is a question of priorities.\u201d"

            "title": "Washington is shrieking at the prospect of a defense budget cut. But would it really be so bad? | Ben Armbruster",
            "date": "2023-01-11T11:00:16Z",
            "content": "Many say that Washington is more divided than ever, but political quarrels in the nation\u2019s capital and beyond are easily cast aside to unify against even the mere suggestion that perhaps the defense department\u2019s budget might be a bit too high. That\u2019s what happened when reports emerged late last week that Representative Kevin McCarthy had secured a deal with rogue Republicans to become the next House speaker. In exchange for their votes, the Freedom Caucus \u2013 a group of more rightwing House GOP lawmakers \u2013 received assurances that the federal budget will freeze at FY2022 levels, which could effectively mean a cut to the Pentagon budget by anywhere from $75bn to $100bn. The shrieks from official Washington were almost immediate. Former GOP representative Liz Cheney, for example, accused McCarthy of \u201cweaken[ing] our national defense for his own personal gain\u201d, while the Democratic representative Abigail Spanberger said \u201ccutting our nation\u2019s defense spending is shortsighted and dangerous\u201d, adding that \u201cdoing it for speaker votes is unconscionable\u201d. Others went so far as to liken proponents of cutting the US military budget to being \u201cpro-Russia\u201d. Let\u2019s keep in mind that the reported deal in terms of defense spending would merely keep the DOD budget at its FY2022 level \u2013 the highest since the second wold war \u2013 one that both Cheney and Spanberger themselves supported with their votes authorizing it. But instead of seeing this proposal as a good opportunity to course-correct defense spending \u2013 which has been rife with waste, fraud and abuse for decades \u2013 the White House also came out swinging on Monday. \u201cThis push to defund our military in the name of politics is senseless and out of line with our national security needs,\u201d said the White House spokesperson Andrew Bates, who added that any military budget cuts that are part of McCarthy\u2019s speakership deal \u201cmak[e] us less capable of keeping the American people safe and advancing our national security interests\u201d. Of course no one has proposed to \u201cdefund\u201d the US military. Bates\u2019s statement is just clumsy posturing seemingly meant to boomerang blowback some Democrats received for their \u201cdefund the police\u201d rhetoric. And the irony is that the White House\u2019s response also represents the worst of Washington politics whereby one must vigorously oppose any proposal from a political opponent regardless of its merit. You also won\u2019t hear any specifics from the White House or hawks in Congress and the media as to why modestly reducing the Pentagon budget will be so devastating to US national security. Reflexively opposing defense department cuts and supporting throwing more money at the Pentagon will always be good politics, particularly for lawmakers, as the weapons industry has carefully located defense industry jobs in nearly every state and congressional district in the country. That explains why Congress gave the Pentagon $45bn more than it asked for in last year\u2019s defense authorization bill and barely anyone batted an eye. But while maintaining the military-industrial complex is good politics, the reality is that reforming the Pentagon budget is good policy. We can fix well-established boondoggles like the F-35. The amount defense industry firms and its CEOs receive from the American taxpayer is borderline criminal. And the fact that the Pentagon has no idea how it spends its money \u2013 it has yet to pass a financial audit \u2013 should outrage us all, particularly anyone living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to save. But also, as my colleague and defense spending expert William Hartung pointed out, a congressional budget office study last year found three ways Congress could responsibly reduce defense department spending and save $1tn over the next 10 years. \u201cA strategy that forswears sending large numbers of troops into regional wars,\u201d Hartung said, \u201ctakes a more realistic view of the military threats posed by Russia and China, relies more on allies, and rolls back the Pentagon\u2019s dangerous and unnecessary nuclear weapons buildup could save sums well beyond the $100 billion per year set out in the CBO\u2019s illustrative options\u201d. Indeed, experts from across the ideological spectrum have come to similar conclusions and have offered modest proposals to reduce the Pentagon\u2019s bloated budget over the years. It\u2019s a shame the White House jumped into this predictably disgraceful display of establishment Washington at its worst: blindly clearing a path for the endless flow of money into the Pentagon\u2019s coffers without regard for whether it\u2019s necessary or badly needed to be diverted elsewhere. In fact, if the Biden administration saw fit to \u2013 heaven forbid \u2013 find common cause in opposing throwing more money at an agency that doesn\u2019t need it, it may just find a more constructive way to score political points.

            "date": "2023-01-31T19:30:55Z",
            "content": "The number one movie on Netflix, You People, has mainstream critics cringing and Black Twitter talking back to the screen. The takeaway: they\u2019re not buying any of it \u2013 not the culture clash, not the casting and definitely not the chemistry between the two romantic leads. More reinterpretation than remake of the 1967 classic Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner, You People \u2013 Black-ish creator Kenya Barris\u2019s feature film directing debut - is a typical romcom by the numbers. But instead of two basic white people playing the will they, won\u2019t they game, writer Jonah Hill is Ezra, a white Jewish man trying to make it work with a Black Muslim woman called Amira, played by Lauren London, in spite of their hidebound families. And I liked it! - contrary to what seems like everyone else who watched it, Black Twitter included. It was fun, fast-paced and full of well-timed cameos I never saw coming \u2013 not least Mike Epps playing Eddie Murphy\u2019s younger brother. Overall, I found it funnier than promised but also winsome and earnest in a way that reminded me of another Netflix romcom I heartily enjoyed: Always Be My Maybe \u2013 likewise dinged by many for being too cliche. (Umm, it\u2019s a romcom?) You People was dismissed by Black Twitter early on, starting when it was first announced in summer 2021 as yet another manifestation of Barris\u2019s obsession with his own mixed-race heritage. Any excitement over the leading lady casting of Lauren London quickly gave way to grumbling about Nia Long being far too young and fine to play her mother. After its release, audiences also had a hard time believing Eddie Murphy as a militant Black father and husband who sees racism in everything. But I found him believable as he cracked wise about his kids having light skin and freaked out about his kufi hat, gifted from Louis Farrakhan, catching fire, I was right there with him, in stitches the whole time. By far the most searing skepticism was reserved for the relationship between Hill and London, with many flat-out recoiling that they could be romantically linked. The mental block comes down to London having been in a relationship with the rap legend Nipsey Hussle that ended with his tragic shooting death in 2019. Hill and London\u2019s first scene together is punctuated by Hussle\u2019s 2018 hit Last Time That I Checc\u2019d. In a recent interview, London said she\u2019d only \u201cjust started\u201d to heal from that immense loss. The idea that she could rebound with a guy like Hill was so beyond the pale. But that\u2019s just the thing. You People isn\u2019t supposed to be real. London is (checks notes) acting. But it wasn\u2019t just Black audiences piling on negative feedback. The Daily Beast roasted it for furthering Barris\u2019s \u201cobnoxious racial agenda\u201d. The Guardian gave it two two-star reviews. My colleague Lauren Mechling launched our takedown fest by pronouncing Hill and London\u2019s connection \u201ca romance without a beating heart\u201d. First, the idea that Hill couldn\u2019t actually woo London is absurd to me; audiences seemingly can\u2019t grasp that. He isn\u2019t the same pudgy geek who made his leading man debut opposite Michael Cera in Superbad. Never mind that he\u2019s slimmed down, slicked his hair back and stuck on a body load of tattoos. He\u2019s a rich and famous Academy Award nominee who runs with Leo DiCaprio, a renowned yachtsman. Hill slathered those dollops of his real-life charisma on to Ezra, a successful broker with a deep curiosity for Black culture and politics and thirst for authenticity \u2013 the latter clearly a byproduct of Hill\u2019s real-life hothouse sessions with Dr Phil Stutz. Ezra\u2019s proposal speech in particular felt like a declaration you\u2019d expect from someone who had read The Five Love Languages. Throw in the hip-hop-inspired fashion sense, the Black best friend (Sam Jay) and rapier wit, and Ezra starts looking quite like the kind of swaggy white ally you see all around Los Angeles \u2013 the guy who quotes Drake without irony, dominates pickup basketball games in Inglewood and cruises Melrose sneaker shops in a tie-dye tracksuit, walking on the sidewalk street side of his boo. Barris and Hill do the work of setting up Ezra and Amira\u2019s romance \u2013 Amira outright says she wants a man who\u2019ll be totally straight with her, while Ezra\u2019s own path to reconciling his anxious relationships and life choices begins with him totally relaxing with her. Too often London is framed as the Black girl nextdoor \u2013 in the music video for Pharrell and Jay-Z\u2019s Frontin\u2019 or on the cult soap The Game, for example. But in You People, she gets to serve lewks and play a whole woman who is not afraid to express her disappointment with a racist world, even if that means offending her white partner and Shelley, Ezra\u2019s Karen of a mother \u2013 which Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays with alacrity. At one point, Amira snaps \u201cI\u2019m not a toy\u201d at her potential mother-in-law, who can\u2019t seem to find any other ways to connect with the Howard grad than to compliment her on her acrylic nails and bamboo earrings. When Ezra tried to hook up Amira with a job connection after a busted interview, Amira tells him that she won\u2019t be a kept woman and explains why his help offer reeks of white privilege. Best of all, London gets to play a love interest whose romantic chemistry flows from witty repartee \u2013 a rarity for a Black leading lady. For me, the bond between Ezra and Amira was sealed that first night they spent under bed covers and in the bathroom the next morning brushing their teeth. Their whole vibe was like something out of a Nora Ephron film: kismet. And for it all to end (spoiler) with a surprise wedding at shoe palace, after they kicked off bonding over slides \u2013 well, what\u2019s more LA than a secret sneaker pop-up? Romcoms as a whole have been taking it on the chin lately \u2013 from Julia Roberts and George Clooney\u2019s straightforward Ticket to Paradise (too formulaic, said critics) to Billy Eichner and Luke Macfarlane\u2019s gay-themed Bros (a box office bomb). In the swipe-right age, perhaps we\u2019ve grown too cynical for the meet-cute. But that doesn\u2019t mean that You People was a failure. Sure, every joke in the film doesn\u2019t land as hard as David Duchovny\u2019s solo rendition of John Legend\u2019s Ordinary People. But I laughed. Plenty. As idle entertainment, You People does the job of providing a fun escape. Why is that so hard to buy?"

            "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s organization was fined $1.6m by a judge after being convicted of tax fraud charges, but the Manhattan district attorney hinted that\u2019s not the end of his investigation into the former president\u2019s businesses. Meanwhile in Washington, House Republicans demanded more information about the classified documents found at Joe Biden\u2019s home and former office, while the top Senate Democrat said special counsel Robert Hur should be allowed to look into the matter without interference. Here\u2019s what happened today: Biden doesn\u2019t trust his Secret Service detail, according to a new book about his presidency. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen warned the US government will soon hit its debt limit, and could run out of money by June. Special counsel Jack Smith wants to talk to two people hired by Trump\u2019s attorneys to look for any secret materials in his possession. Congress will convene for the annual State of the Union address on 7 February. Who is George Santos really? Two Daily Beast reporters try to get to the bottom of the fabulist congressman\u2019s saga in an interview with the Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly America podcast. Last week, the much-talked-about George Santos of New York was sworn into the House. The Democrats and even some Republicans think he should have resigned after he admitted to lying about a lot of things during his campaign. So who is the real George Santos? How likely is it that he\u2019ll see out his full term in office? And does his success tell us more about the state of US politics than it does an individual\u2019s misgivings? Jonathan Freedland and Will Bredderman of the Daily Beast discuss the man behind the lies on the Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly America podcast: Attorney general Merrick Garland has asked Robert Hur to handle the investigation into Biden\u2019s classified documents, putting a justice department veteran whose most recent government service was as a Donald Trump-appointed US attorney in a role that could upend his presidency. Semafor reports that Democrats remember his work as US attorney for Maryland fondly. \u201cHe handled himself with real professionalism when he was U.S. attorney in Maryland,\u201d the state\u2019s Democratic senator Ben Cardin said, while Jamie Raskin, a House Democrat from the state and noted Trump foe, said Hur had a \u201cgood reputation.\u201d Rod Rosenstein, who was deputy attorney general under Trump, said Hur was his \u201cpoint person\u201d for dealing with one of the men the former president liked least: Robert Mueller, the special counsel who led the investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election. The House armed services committee is also requesting details about the classified documents found in Joe Biden\u2019s possession. The committee\u2019s Republican chair Mike Rogers earlier this week wrote to two defense officials requesting details on what the documents contained, and how they had been handled. You can read the letter below: Needless to say, this is turning into a headache for Democrats in Congress. The party has been on a roll lately, doing much better in the November midterms than expected and then being gifted with Republican disarray in the House and a surprisingly quiet presidential campaign from Donald Trump. Now, they\u2019re back to playing defense after Joe Biden was found to be doing something similar to what has gotten Trump into so much trouble: possessing classified documents. There are substantial differences to the two cases, but party leaders nonetheless are being called upon to answer for their president. \u201cIt\u2019s much too early to tell,\u201d Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer today replied on CNN, when asked if he believes Biden broke the law. \u201cI think president Biden has handled this correctly. He\u2019s fully cooperated with the prosecutors \u2026 it\u2019s total contrast to president Trump, who stonewalled for a whole year.\u201d With special prosecutors looking into both men\u2019s cases, Schumer called for patience. \u201cWe should let it play out, we don\u2019t have to push them in any direction or try to influence them,\u201d he said. \u201cLet the special prosecutors do their job,\u201d Schumer said, adding that he supports the appointment of Robert Hur to that role in the Biden case. You can watch the full interview here: Republicans on the House judiciary committee have announced their own investigation of the classified documents found at Joe Biden\u2019s home and former office, sending a letter to the attorney general, Merrick Garland, demanding details of the inquiry. \u201cWe are conducting oversight of the Justice Department\u2019s actions with respect to former Vice President Biden\u2019s mishandling of classified documents, including the apparently unauthorized possession of classified material at a Washington, D.C. private office and in the garage of his Wilmington, Delaware residence. On January 12, 2023, you appointed Robert Hur as Special Counsel to investigate these matters. The circumstances of this appointment raise fundamental oversight questions that the Committee routinely examines. We expect your complete cooperation with our inquiry,\u201d the committee\u2019s chair Jim Jordan along with congressman Mike Johnson said in a letter. The letter notes that the documents were first discovered just before the midterm elections in November, and accuses the justice department of departing \u201cfrom how it acted in similar circumstances,\u201d notable the inquiry into government secrets found at Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort. The committee members demand Garland turn over an array of documents related to the Biden investigation by 27 January. The investigation is the second to be announced by the House GOP since reports of the documents\u2019 discovery first emerged this week. The other is being pursued by James Comer of the oversight committee, who is playing a major role in the Republicans\u2019 campaign of investigations against the White House. Joe Biden will make the annual State of the Union speech on 7 February, after the president accepted a formal invitation from House speaker Kevin McCarthy: In a statement confirming his attendance, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre struck a bipartisan tone. \u201cThe President is grateful for and accepts Speaker McCarthy\u2019s prompt invitation to address the peoples\u2019 representatives in Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cHe looks forward to speaking with Republicans, Democrats, and the country about how we can work together to continue building an economy that works from the bottom up and the middle out, keep boosting our competitiveness in the world, keep the American people safe, and bring the country together.\u201d Looping back to Donald Trump\u2019s legal troubles, here\u2019s a little more about the situation in New York and beyond. The Trump Organization\u2019s sentencing doesn\u2019t end Trump\u2019s battle with Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg, who said the sentencing \u201ccloses this important chapter of our ongoing investigation into the former president and his businesses. We now move on to the next chapter,\u201d the Associated Press writes. Bragg, in office for little more than a year, inherited the Trump Organization case and the investigation into the former president from his predecessor, Cyrus Vance Jr. At the same time, New York attorney general Letitia James is suing Trump and the Trump Organization, alleging they misled banks and others about the value of its many assets, including golf courses and skyscrapers \u2013 a practice she dubbed the \u201cart of the steal\u201d \u2013 a parody of Trump\u2019s long-ago bestselling ghostwritten book about getting rich The Art of the Deal. James, a Democrat, is asking a court to ban Trump and his three eldest children from running any New York-based company and is seeking to fine them at least $250 million. A judge has set an October trial date and appointed a monitor for the company while the case is pending. Trump faces several other legal challenges as he ramps up his presidential campaign. A special grand jury in Atlanta has investigated whether Trump and his allies committed any crimes while trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia. Last month, the House January 6 committee voted to make a criminal referral to the Justice Department for Trump\u2019s role in sparking the violent insurrection at the US Capitol. The FBI is also investigating Trump\u2019s storage of classified documents. During last year\u2019s Trump Org trial, assistant district attorney Joshua Steinglass told jurors that Trump himself had a role in the fraud scheme, showing them a lease that the Republican signed himself for now-convicted finance chief Allen Weisselberg\u2019s perk apartment that was kept off the tax books. \u201cMr Trump is explicitly sanctioning tax fraud,\u201d Steinglass argued. Joe Biden this weekend will become the first sitting US president to speak at a Sunday service at Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta, Georgia, where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr was a pastor. Biden is expected to address the ongoing struggle to protect voting rights in the US, despite his failure a year ago to persuade Congress to pass key related legislation, to the exasperation of activists and organizers, especially in Georgia and the south. At the White House press briefing ongoing now, former Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, now senior adviser for public engagement at the White House, talked of the importance of the president\u2019s visit this Sunday, ahead of Martin Luther King Day, the federal holiday that marks the birthday of the assassinated icon. She said that there was \u201cmore work to do\u201d to protect democracy and acknowledged that the Biden administration\u2019s two pieces of voting rights legislation have not made it through Congress. She noted that Biden has been invited to the church by Georgia\u2019s recently re-elected Democratic senator Raphael Warnock, who is a pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist church. The church was also regularly attended by the late congressman and lifelong civil rights activist John Lewis. Biden will meet members of King\u2019s family and leaders of the civil rights movement in Atlanta during his visit on Sunday and Monday. Lance Bottoms joined White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who pointed out that she and the former mayor are examples of \u201cBlack women who have broken barriers\u201d on the shoulders of the civil rights movement. Donald Trump\u2019s organization was fined $1.6m by a judge after being convicted of tax fraud charges, but the Manhattan district attorney hinted that\u2019s not the end of his investigation into the former president\u2019s businesses. Meanwhile in Washington, the Treasury secretary warned the US government will hit its legal borrowing limit on Thursday and could default in the summer, unless Congress acts to increase it. Republicans controlling the House have said they won\u2019t cooperate unless government spending is cut, ensuring this is going to turn into a big fight at some point. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: Joe Biden doesn\u2019t trust his Secret Service detail, according to a new book about his presidency. The top House Republican government watchdog is trying to link his investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings with the inquiry into classified documents found at the president\u2019s properties. Special counsel Jack Smith wants to talk to two people hired by Trump\u2019s attorneys to look for any secret materials in his possession. The US government will hit the legal limit on how much debt it can carry on 19 January, but it should have enough money to operate until at least early June, Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said Friday. \u201cI am writing to inform you that beginning on Thursday, January 19, 2023, the outstanding debt of the United States is projected to reach the statutory limit. Once the limit is reached, Treasury will need to start taking certain extraordinary measures to prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations,\u201d the secretary wrote in a letter to Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy. \u201cWhile Treasury is not currently able to provide an estimate of how long extraordinary measures will enable us to continue to pay the government\u2019s obligations, it is unlikely that cash and extraordinary measures will be exhausted before early June.\u201d Republicans in the House have signaled they won\u2019t agree to increase the debt ceiling unless the Biden administration and its Democratic allies in Congress agree to reduce spending, though it remains unclear what areas of the budget the GOP wants to cut. Raising the borrowing limit is one of the few pieces of leverage House Republicans have over the Democrats, but the strategy is not without risks. A failure to increase the ceiling could lead to the United States defaulting on its debt for the first time in its history, likely with serious consequences for the economy. The Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee is attempting to make two alleged scandals into one: the investigation of classified materials found at Joe Biden\u2019s properties, and their inquiry into his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business activities. The committee\u2019s chair James Comer has sent the White House a new demand for information about whether Hunter had access to the garage at Joe Biden\u2019s Delaware residence where it was revealed yesterday some classified material was found: Even before Biden took office, Republicans have been trying to find evidence of corruption in Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings, and of his father\u2019s involvement. They have had mixed results in doing that, but this week\u2019s revelations that classified materials were found at Biden\u2019s residence and an office he once used in Washington DC have given them new material to attack his administration. Yesterday, the justice department appointed a special counsel to look into the matter. The trial of members of the Proud Boys militia group over their involvement in the January 6 insurrection is continuing in Washington DC, today with testimony from a Capitol police officer. Thomas Loyd\u2019s testimony contains fresh reminders of the violence that day, as Politico reports: Joe Biden doesn\u2019t trust his Secret Service detail, fearing that some of them remain loyal to Donald Trump, Vox reports, citing a new book about his presidency. \u201cThe Fight of His Life\u201d by Chris Whipple chronicles the past two years of Biden\u2019s presidency from a positive perspective, according to Vox, and in particular shows the degree to which he loathes his predecessor. Biden, for instance, believes the White House\u2019s Resolute desk was \u201ctainted\u201d by Trump\u2019s use and unsuccessfully asked to swap it out for one used by Democratic icon Franklin D Roosevelt. When it comes to the Secret Service, he minds what he says around them, believing that agents harbor sympathies for the former president. He also thinks they lied about an incident where his dog Major bit an agent. Reached by Vox, the White House wouldn\u2019t comment directly on the book\u2019s content. Joe Biden\u2019s allies in Congress are calling on him to revoke the visa of Brazil\u2019s former president Jair Bolsonaro, after his supporters attacked the country\u2019s capital while he was in Florida: Dozens of Democratic lawmakers, including some of the top members of the House foreign affairs committee, sent a letter to Joe Biden on Thursday demanding former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s diplomatic visa be canceled in the wake of the rampage in Brazil\u2019s capital by his supporters. \u201cWe request that you reassess his status in the country to ascertain whether there is a legal basis for his stay and revoke any such diplomatic visa he may hold,\u201d said the letter. It continued: \u201cThe United States must not provide shelter for him, or any authoritarian who has inspired such violence against democratic institutions.\u201d The letter was led by Democrats Joaquin Castro of Texas, Gregory Meeks of New York, Ruben Gallego of Arizona, Chuy Garcia of Illinois and Susan Wild of Pennsylvania. The $1.6m fine the Trump Organization was ordered to pay is nothing compared to what rightwing groups are spending to support efforts to chill ballot box access, Brendan Fischer and Ed Pilkington report: The advocacy arm of the Heritage Foundation, the powerful conservative thinktank based in Washington, spent more than $5m on lobbying in 2021 as it worked to block federal voting rights legislation and advance an ambitious plan to spread its far-right agenda calling for aggressive voter suppression measures in battleground states. Previously unreported 2021 tax filings from Heritage Action for America, which operates as the foundation\u2019s activist wing, shows that it spent $5.1m on contracting outside lobbying services. The outlay comes on top of $560,000 the group invested in its own in-house federal lobbying efforts that year, as well as registered lobbying by Heritage Action staffers in at least 24 states. The 990 tax filing was obtained by the watchdog group Documented and shared with the Guardian. It points to the pivotal role that Heritage Action is increasingly playing in shaping the rules that govern US democracy. The verdict is actually slightly more complex than it appears. There were two companies belonging to the former president on trial: The Trump Corporation and The Trump Payroll Corp. The former was given the maximum fine of $810,000 after being convicted of nine felonies, while the latter was ordered to pay $800,000, also the maximum, for eight felony convictions. That adds up to the $1.6m total fine \u2013 not very much for such a big company, and one reason why Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg has called for the state to increase the maximum penalties for these sorts of crimes. In comments following the Trump Organization\u2019s sentencing, Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg hinted that Donald Trump has not heard the last from his prosecutors. The Daily Beast captured the moment: Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg has cheered the sentence against the Trump Organization, noting it was the first time Donald Trump\u2019s business had been convicted on criminal charges. \u201cToday, former President Trump\u2019s companies were sentenced to the maximum fines allowed by law following historic convictions for a total of 17 felony crimes,\u201d Bragg said in a statement. \u201cChief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg, The Trump Corporation, and The Trump Payroll Corp. conducted and benefitted from sweeping fraud for well over a decade. While corporations can\u2019t serve jail time, this consequential conviction and sentencing serves as a reminder to corporations and executives that you cannot defraud tax authorities and get away with it. It is also an important reminder that our state law must change so that we can impose more significant penalties and sanctions on corporations that commit crimes in New York.\u201d Bragg, who is also pursuing another investigation of the company\u2019s financial statements, noted the verdict \u201crepresents a significant chapter of our ongoing investigation into the former President and his businesses.\u201d A judge in New York has ordered Donald Trump\u2019s business to pay $1.6m after it was found guilty of tax charges: As we wait for the sentencing of the Trump Organization, CNN reports that special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s office wants to interview two people hired by the former president\u2019s legal team to search his properties for classified documents. The justice department has for months been trying to get to the bottom of Donald Trump\u2019s possession of classified material, which sparked the August search of his Mar-a-Lago resort. Since then, Trump\u2019s attorneys have been combing other properties for any government secrets that may be stored there. CNN reports that Smith, who attorney general Merrick Garland appointed in November to handle the inquiry into the Mar-a-Lago secrets and Trump\u2019s campaign to overturn the 2020 election, is demanding the unnamed people hired to carry out the search be interviewed. Here\u2019s more from CNN\u2019s report: Prosecutors from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s office and Trump\u2019s defense lawyers have gone back and forth several times in the past two months over whether Trump has fully complied with a subpoena issued last May for classified documents from his time in the White House. That has prompted Trump\u2019s lawyer Timothy Parlatore to twice certify in writing that Trump\u2019s team searched his homes and offices for more records. The new rounds of certifications haven\u2019t been reported previously. Some of Trump\u2019s properties, such as at his golf course in Scotland and his Las Vegas hotel, weren\u2019t searched, yet Trump\u2019s team believed they did a thorough job, looking everywhere they believed presidential records might have been, sources say. In a statement, Parlatore told CNN that the Justice Department has \u201crejected offers of cooperation in favor of heavy-handed tactics to create a false impression of noncompliance in the absence of evidence.\u201d Parlatore added: \u201cPresident Trump did nothing wrong and a proper investigation would have concluded months ago, amicably, without the significant waste of taxpayer resources.\u201d The Justice Department declined to comment. You may have heard Donald Trump is running for president again \u2013 but not much more than that. The former president\u2019s new bid for the White House hasn\u2019t quite had the vigor of his first, successful campaign in 2016, but as the Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell reports, he\u2019s looking to change that: Donald Trump is scheduled to venture out of his Mar-a-Lago resort and conduct a swing of presidential campaign events later this month, ramping up efforts to secure the Republican nomination after facing hefty criticism around the slow start to his 2024 White House bid, according to sources familiar with the matter. The former US president is expected to travel to a number of early voting states for the Republican nomination \u2013 the specific states have not been finalized \u2013 around the final weekend of January, the sources said, where he is slated to announce his state level teams. The move comes after a slow start to the campaign and an announcement speech at Mar-a-Lago that has been widely panned as \u201clow energy\u201d and inactive in terms of events, further knocking Trump\u2019s political image after key Senate candidates he endorsed in November\u2019s midterms faced embarrassing defeats. That has apparently given enough confidence for a host of Republicans to prepare their own White House runs and though Trump says he believes a wide field will be beneficial, he seems set to face possible candidates including Florida governor Ron DeSantis and ex-cabinet officials like Nikki Haley. In order to win their conviction against the Trump Organization, prosecutors in Manhattan first went after Allen Weisselberg, the company\u2019s former finance chief. Weisselberg agreed to plead guilty to 15 tax charges and cooperate with Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s prosecution of the former president\u2019s company. His testimony proved crucial to the guilty verdict a jury reached in December, and earlier this week, Weisselberg was given five months behind bars for accepting $1.7m in perks without paying taxes \u2013 a lenient penalty that came about only because of his cooperation. Today, the Trump Organization is expected to be sentenced to pay $1.6m, a relatively small sum. But Bragg isn\u2019t done with the former president. The Manhattan district attorney argued that Trump was well aware of the tax evasion going on at his organization, and is reportedly pursuing another investigation into his company, this one looking at the integrity of his financial statements. That\u2019s separate from New York attorney general Letitia James\u2019s lawsuit against Trump and his children alleging fraud, which is not to be confused with the federal investigations of the government secrets found at Mar-a-Lago, his plot to overturn the 2020 election and the January 6 insurrection. Those are being handled by special prosecutor Jack Smith. Good morning, US politics blog readers. We will direct your attention this morning away from Washington DC to New York City, where Donald Trump\u2019s business is at 9am eastern time scheduled to be sentenced on tax fraud charges. According to reports, the entity will probably be hit with fines totaling $1.6m, but that won\u2019t be the end of the story for Trump\u2019s legal troubles in the state. The New York attorney general, Letitia James, has a lawsuit against the former president and three of his children for inflating their net worth to get better loan terms, in what her office described as \u201cstaggering\u201d fraud. Here\u2019s what else is going on today: Joe Biden welcomes Japan\u2019s prime minister, Kishida Fumio, to the White House this morning, before departing for Delaware. The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, will hold her daily briefing at 12.30pm, where reporters will no doubt demand more details on the classified documents found at two properties linked to the president. The House and Senate will convene briefly, but no votes are expected."

            "date": "2023-01-19T19:41:01Z",
            "content": "Missile systems designed to intercept aircraft and incoming missiles appear to have been deployed on top of several defence and administrative buildings in downtown Moscow, signalling that the Kremlin is preparing for a potential, if unlikely, attack being directed on the Russian capital. Photographs published on social media on Thursday showed a Pantsir missile system had been installed on the roof of an eight-story building used by the Russian defence ministry along the Moskva River. Another video showed the air defence system being lifted on to the roof of an education building in Moscow\u2019s Taganka district, 1.5 miles south-east of the Kremlin. The short-to-medium-range systems are used to defend against aircraft, helicopters, and cruise missiles. The Russian military has also said they could be used against smaller targets, such as military and commercial drones, which have become ubiquitous on the battlefield since Vladimir Putin launched his wide-scale invasion in February. Images of the missile systems in Moscow emerged a day before western defence officials were set to meet at Ramstein airbase in Germany to agree on a new military aid package to Ukraine that could include the provision of heavy tanks. The US has already pledged nearly $2bn in further military aid to Ukraine, including a Patriot air sefence system meant to protect Ukrainian cities from Russian missiles. But Russian officials have issued warnings ahead of the meeting, attempting to dissuade Nato countries from providing more advanced weapons by claiming that these could potentially spark a nuclear conflict. \u201cThe defeat of a nuclear power in a conventional war can provoke the beginning of a nuclear war,\u201d wrote Dmitry Medvedev, the former president, who has become a leading hawk as deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s security council. Russian military officials did not immediately confirm the installation of the missile systems. However, several Russian media outlets have also reported on the deployment of long-range S-400 missile systems in Moscow in recent weeks. The S-400 and Pantsir-S1 systems are often used in tandem. The missile systems have appeared in the wake of a Russian bombing campaign that has used missiles and drones to target Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, leading to scores of deaths across the country. A Russian X-22 anti-ship ballistic missile hit an apartment block in the city of Dnipro last week, killing 45. Pro-Kremlin bloggers on Thursday said that the appearance of the missile systems in Moscow showed that the Russian military leadership was concerned now about attacks on their own cities. \u201cIt means that [the leadership] perfectly understand all the risks and understand that strikes against Moscow and the regions are just a question of time,\u201d wrote Alexander Kots, a prominent Russian journalist who supports the Russian war in Ukraine. \u201cIt\u2019s good to begin planning in advance instead of after the first strikes.\u201d The appearance of the defensive missile systems highlights Russia\u2019s lack of success in the war. Mysterious explosions have taken place at military sites in Crimea, and at several airbases used by Russian strategic bombers last month deep inside Russian territory. Ukrainian officials have also said they have begun testing long-range drones that can travel up to 1,000 km (621 miles), potentially putting Moscow in striking distance. \u201cRussia has long given a very high priority to maintaining advanced ground-based air defences, but it is increasingly clear that it is struggling to counter air threats deep inside Russia,\u201d the UK defence ministry wrote last year, a day after the explosions at Russia\u2019s Engels airbase."

            "date": "2023-01-03T22:03:58Z",
            "content": "No goals and a litany of niggle, but the beginning of a modern-day title rivalry? Perhaps that is going too far and, after all, back in August few would have given credence to the suggestion of Arsenal and Newcastle fighting it out at the top. But the sight of Mikel Arteta being dragged away from confronting Eddie Howe after full time spoke of the needle that took little time to rear its head here; Howe had got exactly what he came for and it was not hard, for different reasons, to see why these teams have lost only a game apiece all season. Arteta had been raging when Jacob Murphy was not penalised after a last-gasp handball appeal, a decision that left him simmering almost an hour later. A different call would have given Arsenal a penalty and, in all likelihood, helped them move 10 points clear; they had attempted to turn the screw late on and, given the number of balls that flew into and across Newcastle\u2019s area, there was always the suspicion something might fall their way. They will come up against few defences as expertly drilled as this, though, and the outcome ultimately goes down as a masterclass in frustration and organisation from the visitors. After weathering the now familiar early storm from Arteta\u2019s side, Newcastle dug in and ensured proceedings were rarely allowed to flow. Eddie Nketiah will wonder whether he could have caught a late chance, repelled by an alert Nick Pope, more cleanly and half-chances were spurned in those opening exchanges but it was telling that Arteta was reduced to complaining about unawarded spot kicks. He also felt an incident midway through the second half, when Dan Burn appeared to get hold of Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es\u2019 shirt at a set piece, should have been punished but really this was a rare occasion on which Arsenal did not quite do enough. No opponent had taken as much as a point from the Emirates all season and that said plenty for Newcastle\u2019s achievement. It was not pretty and Howe did not pretend as much afterwards: a purist would have shuddered at the number of stoppages, bitty fouls and broken-up passages of play. But they were entitled to approach the task this way: Arsenal blow you away if you let them, as sides with more celebrated names have discovered, and after finding a foothold you must ensure you retain it. That manifested itself in a succession of fouls from the opening period\u2019s midway point, which essentially ended the first 45 minutes as a spectacle. Martin \u00d8degaard had volleyed over in the third minute and Bukayo Saka, scorching around Burn but unable to beat Pope from an angle, appeared to have his opposite number on toast. Granit Xhaka had also sought an opener after a break by Saka but was soon enough shown a yellow card by Andrew Madley for a messy foul on Fabian Sch\u00e4r, which typified the way Arsenal had been dragged into a scrap of Newcastle\u2019s making. Sights of goal were few in a one-sided but mucky second half, although Gabriel Martinelli flashed a header wide shortly before Nketiah\u2019s glimpse. Martinelli was otherwise quieter than at any time this season, policed expertly by Kieran Trippier, while Joelinton put in a phenomenal shift supporting Burn in smothering Saka. Perhaps the already booked Joelinton was fortunate when his arm later caught Saka\u2019s face but, as defensive performances from a forward go, this was exemplary. Opportunities at the other end were vanishingly few, although a scatty minute\u2019s play from Arsenal soon after the restart brought a hashed kick from Aaron Ramsdale and a cross flashed across goal from Miguel Almir\u00f3n. On the half-time whistle Joelinton had stretched and missed a header from close in after a corner had been flicked on; there was the occasional bout of head tennis inside Arsenal\u2019s box later but little to yield realistic hope of an away win. The fear was that Murphy, a substitute, had thrown it all away when Xhaka\u2019s cross struck him at close quarters but it would have been harsh in the extreme to pull him up. Arteta\u2019s reaction on the touchline was explosive; it felt a bit much, as his team had not played badly and are still superbly placed at the summit. Drawing with grace should be possible given the scintillating fare they have come to produce most weeks. Newcastle nullified it and remain embedded in the top four, although a challenge for first place is probably far fetched. That may come in time and the seeds were sown here for a longstanding tussle."

            "title": "How the US far right and progressives ended up agreeing on military spending cuts",
            "date": "2023-01-23T10:00:03Z",
            "content": "Progressives have recently found themselves in an unfamiliar position: in agreement with members of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. Some of the latter caucus\u2019s members have recently called for re-examining the amount of money spent by the US military, echoing demands that progressives have issued for years. Although progressives are clear-eyed about their ideological differences with \u201cAmerica first\u201d Republicans on foreign policy, they encourage a renewed debate over the Pentagon\u2019s budget. \u201cThe idea that effective American foreign policy requires this [level of spending], I think, is not only wrong,\u201d said Matt Duss, a former foreign policy adviser to progressive senator Bernie Sanders, \u201cit\u2019s just absurd and unsustainable.\u201d The Freedom Caucus reportedly pushed for spending cuts as part of their negotiations with Kevin McCarthy, who offered concessions to fellow Republicans to secure the House speakership earlier this month. One of those concessions involved a promise to cap fiscal year 2024 discretionary spending at fiscal year 2022 levels, after Republicans expressed outrage over the $1.76tn omnibus funding bill that Joe Biden signed into law last month. If such a fiscal policy were evenly applied to all federal agencies, the department of defense would see its budget cut by $75bn compared with this fiscal year. That possibility has simultaneously sowed division among House Republicans and attracted the interest of progressives. They hope the latest dust-up over the Pentagon\u2019s budget will spark what they consider to be an overdue conversation over US defense spending, which will hit a record high of $858bn this fiscal year. Among House Republicans, the proposal to cut the Pentagon\u2019s budget has won some support from far-right members who have embraced Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to foreign policy. Speaking to Fox News this month, Congressman Matt Gaetz, one of the Republican holdouts in the speakership battle, partly blamed the Pentagon\u2019s large budget on America\u2019s financial assistance to Ukraine amid its war against Russia. \u201cWe can defend this country and project power more efficiently and more effectively than we do,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cHow about we start with Ukraine?\u201d McCarthy himself previously promised that Republicans would not provide a \u201cblank check\u201d to Ukraine if they won back the House. But aid to Ukraine has continued to win bipartisan support in Congress. \u201cI do not see that money getting taken away from us,\u201d Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said earlier this month. \u201cIt is there. It is rock solid through nearly all or all of 2023.\u201d McCarthy has expressed openness to examining the Pentagon\u2019s budget, but the proposal has stoked outrage among many of the more hawkish members of his conference. Republican congressman Tony Gonzales of Texas cited the potential cuts to explain his opposition to the House rules package, saying he thought the proposal was a \u201chorrible idea\u201d. \u201cHow am I going to look at our allies in the eye and say, I need you to increase your defense budget, but yet America is going to decrease ours?\u201d Gonzales told CBS News. While a number of House Democrats have joined Gonzales in rejecting the idea of defense spending cuts, the idea of reconsidering the Pentagon\u2019s budget has long held sway with progressives. When Biden called for an increase in funding for the defense department last year, leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus attacked the proposal as \u201csimply unacceptable\u201d. Progressive activists and their congressional allies note that the US military has a larger budget than the next nine largest militaries combined and urged lawmakers to reallocate some of that funding to other needs, such as healthcare or education. \u201cFor far too long, we have blindly and excessively pumped money into the Pentagon, which \u2013 despite its massive budget \u2013 has yet to pass an audit,\u201d said the progressive congresswoman Barbara Lee, who has long championed fiscal reform at the defense department. \u201cImagine what we could do with even a fraction of [the Pentagon\u2019s funding]. We need to rethink our foreign policy priorities and invest in diplomacy first and defense second.\u201d Ro Khanna, a progressive congressman from California, said he would welcome a bipartisan conversation about the Pentagon\u2019s budget, but he rejected Republicans\u2019 efforts to tie spending cuts to the looming fight over the debt ceiling. The US hit its debt limit this month, and the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has warned that the government is at risk of defaulting this summer if Congress does not increase its borrowing capacity \u2013 a move that would have catastrophic effects on the US economy. Democrats fear that House Republicans will attempt to extract concessions on government spending in exchange for helping to raise the debt ceiling. \u201cI do not support any debate on spending demands that threaten a debt-ceiling showdown. If Republicans want to have conversations about future defense cuts that are strategic, then I am open to that,\u201d Khanna told the Guardian. \u201cWhile I support the funding for Ukraine\u2019s defense, we need to take ourselves off the path to a trillion-dollar Pentagon budget.\u201d Progressive advocates similarly rejected the notion that the US must choose between cutting the Pentagon\u2019s budget and supporting Ukraine. Stephen Miles, president of the progressive group Win Without War, blamed the Pentagon\u2019s ballooning budget on ineffective weapons systems and excessive contracts to private companies, which have accounted for as much as half of US defense spending in recent years. \u201cThe spending on Ukraine is not what\u2019s driving the Pentagon\u2019s growth,\u201d Miles said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about major weapon systems procurement; we\u2019re talking about private service contracting. We\u2019re talking about a lot of things that aren\u2019t being driven by Ukraine.\u201d Duss, now a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the war in Ukraine should not prevent any debate over defense spending. He noted that politicians like Sanders and Lee have demanded reductions in the Pentagon\u2019s budget for years, long before the war in Ukraine began. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be some crisis of the moment that prevents us from thinking about how to spend less on defense,\u201d Duss said. \u201cBut this is a conversation that we absolutely have to have.\u201d As of now, the prospects for enacting Pentagon budget cuts appear bleak. Even some of the House Republicans who, like Gaetz, initially opposed McCarthy\u2019s speakership bid have downplayed the possibility. Congressman Chip Roy of Texas, a key negotiator in the talks between McCarthy and his Republican detractors, claimed that \u201ccuts to defense were NEVER DISCUSSED\u201d during the speakership fight. \u201cIn fact, there was broad agreement spending cuts should focus on NON-DEFENSE discretionary spending,\u201d Roy\u2019s office said on Twitter. A funding bill that solely cut non-defense discretionary spending would almost certainly be rejected by Democrats, who still control the Senate and the White House. In addition to the procedural hurdles of Roy\u2019s proposal, Miles mocked the idea of excluding defense spending from potential cuts as utterly unrealistic. \u201cYou can\u2019t look at the level of spending that the US government is doing and say we\u2019re going to exempt more than half of discretionary spending,\u201d Miles said. \u201cWhen you have the Pentagon taking up as much money as it is now, there\u2019s no way to look at cutting government spending without it.\u201d Even if Congress could somehow reach an agreement on the need to reduce the Pentagon\u2019s budget, conservatives would inevitably clash with progressives over what programs to cut and how to reallocate that funding. \u201cThe reason Matt Gaetz wants to cut defense spending is not the reason why I would,\u201d Duss acknowledged. Still, Duss argued that progressives and some lawmakers on the right have a \u201cshared interest\u201d in starting a reinvigorated conversation over defense spending. That communal goal could work to progressives\u2019 advantage. \u201cIf Republicans want to prize this open and look inside this budget \u2026 that\u2019s a debate I think everyone should welcome,\u201d Duss said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s quite telling who\u2019s not welcoming it.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-11T16:17:14Z",
            "content": "Ukraine\u2019s military has denied that Russian forces have encircled and captured Soledar after claims by the head of the Wagner mercenary group that the eastern city had fallen. The claims about the status of the fighting on the eastern Donbas front were made by Yevgeny Prigozhin as Poland announced that it planned to transfer 10 German-made Leopard 2 main battle tanks to Ukraine, in a move with wide significance. Speaking on a visit to Lviv on Wednesday, the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, said: \u201cA company of Leopard tanks will be handed over as part of coalition building. We want it to be an international coalition.\u201d The transfer would require permission from Germany, which Kyiv has been pressing separately to supply Leopard 2s, perhaps suggesting a softening of Germany\u2019s stance on the transfer of main battle tanks after recent contacts between Warsaw and Berlin. However, a German government spokesperson said it was not aware of any requests from allies to send the tanks to Ukraine. Commenting on the fighting in Soledar, Serhiy Cherevatyi, the spokesperson for the eastern group of the Ukrainian armed forces, said: \u201cRussians say that it is under their control; it is not true.\u201d The Russian capture of Soledar and the city\u2019s saltmines would have symbolic, military and commercial value for Moscow. But the situation in and around Soledar appeared fluid and neither claim could be independently verified. Prigozhin had released a photo showing him with a group of his fighters and a tank, which he said was taken in one of the tunnels of a saltmine in the south-west of Soledar. He also said that only units of his paramilitary company \u2013 many of them convicts who had been offered a pardon if they fought for him \u2013 had been involved in fighting for the city. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, mocked Russian claims to have taken over parts of the city, and maintained that fighting was ongoing. \u201cThe terrorist state and its propagandists are trying to pretend that some part of our city of Soledar \u2026 is allegedly some kind of Russia\u2019s achievement,\u201d he said in his Wednesday evening address. \u201cThey will present \u2013 and are already presenting \u2013 this to their society in such a way as to support mobilisation and to give hope to those who support aggression. \u201cBut the fighting continues. The Donetsk direction is holding out.\u201d Footage posted from Soledar by a Ukrainian soldier from a drone unit \u2013 identified by the call sign Maygar at 10am on Wednesday \u2013 suggested heavy clashes were continuing but Ukrainian forces were still holding positions. \u201cThis is the sound of Soledar,\u201d he said to the background noise of constant artillery strikes. \u201cLocal fights are happening from time to time and artillery is working on both sides.\u201d Accounts from Ukrainian soldiers on that sector of the front suggested Russia had moved Wagner fighters from Bakhmut to focus solely on the battle for Soledar. Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said \u201chard battles are going on to keep Soledar\u201d. She added: \u201cThe enemy does not pay attention to the large losses of its personnel and continues to actively storm. The approaches to our positions are simply littered with the bodies of dead enemy fighters.\u201d However, the Ukrainian military\u2019s morning summary made only one mention of Soledar, listing it as one of several areas being shelled in the Donetsk region. A Ukrainian soldier who has been posting video updates from the Bakhmut area described the fighting in Soledar as fierce, with contested buildings changing hands multiple times and soldiers suffering frostbite. Russian forces have recently focused their efforts on the capture of Soledar as part of their ambition to take the nearby strategic city of Bakhmut and Ukraine\u2019s larger eastern Donbas region, leading to fierce battles in sub-zero temperatures over the past five days. Prigozhin claimed late on Tuesday to have taken the entire city, encircling Ukrainian forces in a \u201ccauldron\u201d in the centre. \u201cWagner units took control of the entire territory of Soledar. A cauldron has been formed in the centre in which urban fighting is going on. The number of prisoners will be announced tomorrow,\u201d he said, giving no further details. While western military analysts have geolocated Wagner units in the centre, where there has been heavy fighting for the main administrative building, Russian claims to have taken the south-west of the area \u2013 where Ukraine had recently been mounting a defence close to the saltmines \u2013 appeared more questionable. The British Ministry of Defence said earlier that Russian troops and Wagner fighters had probably taken control of most of Soledar after four days of advances. But Prigozhin\u2019s comment suggested Russian control was incomplete. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the military command did not mention control of Soledar on Tuesday evening. He repeated his call for more western weapons, saying Russia was gathering forces to intensify its campaign, but did not provide details. Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry tweeted late on Tuesday: \u201cEven after suffering colossal losses, Russia is still maniacally trying to seize Soledar \u2013 home to the largest saltmine in Europe.\u201d Ukraine said earlier that its forces were still holding on to positions in Soledar, withstanding assaults by wave after wave of Russian forces seeking their first battlefield victory for months. Some prominent Russian military bloggers have urged caution about the situation in Soledar and said intense combat in the centre and outskirts continued during the night. The Institute for the Study of War was also cautious over the Russian claims, noting that the fall of the city might prove to be of limited value in the fight for Bakhmut. \u201cEven taking the most generous Russian claims at face value, the capture of Soledar would not portend an immediate encirclement of Bakhmut. Control of Soledar will not necessarily allow Russian forces to exert control over critical Ukrainian ground lines of communication into Bakhmut,\u201d the US thinktank said. Seizing Soledar would, however, be Russia\u2019s most substantial gain since August, after a series of humiliating retreats in the second half of 2022. Russian forces have been fighting for months to capture Bakhmut. But any victory would come at a massive cost, with troops from both sides having taken heavy losses in some of the most intense combat since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly 11 months ago. The Kyiv government has released photos in recent days purporting to show scores of dead Russian soldiers in muddy fields. The issue of supplying tanks to Ukraine has become the centre of a frenzied round of recent diplomacy, as a number of countries have put pressure on the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to allow the supply of Leopard 2s.

            "date": "2023-01-31T12:58:13Z",
            "content": "Australia has imposed sanctions on Iranian security officials and has targeted Myanmar\u2019s military ruler on the second anniversary of the military coup there. The Australian government revealed a range of new sanctions late on Tuesday, including Iranian figures linked to the suppression of protests and the export of drones for Russian use in the war against Ukraine. Australian travel bans and asset freezes will apply to 16 people and one entity linked to \u201cserious abuses of human rights in Iran\u201d, including the commander-in-chief of the army, Sayyed Abdolrahim Mousavi, and senior figures in the Basij resistance force. The Iranian sanctions were the third round of measures applied under Australia\u2019s new Magnitsky-style sanctions laws, which passed the parliament in late 2021. The move pre-empts the scheduled release on Wednesday of a parliamentary inquiry report about human rights in Iran, which was likely to increase pressure on the Australian government to take a tougher stand. \u201cThe [Iran] listings cover serious violations or serious abuses of the right to life and the right not to be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,\u201d the government said in an explanatory note published on Tuesday. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cThese relate to the oppression of women in enforcing the Islamic dress code and violent suppression of peaceful protests in Iran.\u201d In a separate sanctions instrument, Australia also listed four persons and four entities for targeted financial sanctions and travel bans under the Ukraine war criteria. These persons and entities \u201chave been involved in the supply of Iranian Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (\u2018UAVs\u2019) to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine\u201d, the government\u2019s sanctions notice said. The Australian government also revealed late on Tuesday that it was finally imposing sanctions on Myanmar military figures. The 16 people targeted include the commander in chief, Min Aung Hlaing, and his deputy, Soe Win. Human rights groups have long expressed frustration at the Australian government\u2019s reluctance to expand sanctions since the military seized power in Myanmar on 1 February 2021. The government\u2019s sanctions instrument \u2013 signed by the the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong \u2013 says the measures signal Australia\u2019s \u201congoing concerns about the situation in Myanmar\u201d. \u201cThese [Myanmar] sanctions allow a targeted response to Australia\u2019s concerns about serious violations of human rights committed by the military regime and ongoing efforts to suppress the rights of the civilian population through violence and coercion,\u201d the government\u2019s explanatory note said. The Myanmar sanctions also target two entities, the Myanmar Economic Corporation and Myanmar Economic Holdings Public Company Ltd."

            "date": "2023-01-18T10:00:02Z",
            "content": "The mob attack on Brazil\u2019s supreme court, congress and presidential palace earlier this month has focused attention on the country\u2019s military police, with calls for the force to be reformed growing amid what experts say could be a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d for President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Thousands of far-right radicals supportive of former president Jair Bolsonaro stormed the presidential palace, the congress building and the supreme court on 8 January. The intention, many political analysts believe, was to create a sense of chaos and disorder that would allow for far-right forces \u2013 possibly with the support of Brazil\u2019s armed forces \u2013 to depose Lula. During the assault, the capital\u2019s military police stood by, allowing the mob to ransack the seats of power, and it was only when Lula stripped them of their command several hours into the insurrection that federal forces regained control of the situation. \u201cI am convinced that the door to the [presidential] palace was opened so these people could get in because I didn\u2019t see the front door had been broken down,\u201d Lula told reporters last week. \u201cAnd that means that somebody facilitated their entry in here.\u201d Almost two-thirds of Brazilians believe the capital police did not do their duty, according to a poll by Datafolha. Both the governor and chief of police were removed from their posts and about 82% of those polled said Lula was right to order a federal intervention. Those numbers provide the leftist president, who beat Bolsonaro in an October election and took office on 1 January, with an opportunity to debate reforms, said Benedito Mariano, a former ombudsman for the S\u00e3o Paulo military police. Mariano said military police are poorly paid and do not feel valued. Their military codes and mindset mean they are more used to fighting enemies than protecting citizens. Working conditions are often rough and mental health is a serious issue. An overhaul is long overdue, he said. \u201cThis is an anachronic system built in an authoritarian era and reform has to be on the political agenda,\u201d he said. Policing in Brazil is shared by different bodies. The military police are in charge of prevention and the civil police oversee investigation. Both fall under the jurisdiction of Brazil\u2019s 27 state governors. Cooperation between the forces is not always exemplary. Because policing is a state responsibility, most presidents have been reluctant to interfere. Bolsonaro, though, is a former army captain who speaks the language of the barracks and packed his government with high-ranking officers. He also won support from those in uniform when he reformed the pension system to benefit officers in both the police and military. That helped lead to an increase in the number of pro-Bolsonaro radicals in police ranks. Almost half of all military police officers (48%) engaged with far-right groups or figures online, according to a study published last year by the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety. That number jumped by a fifth between 2020 and 2021. \u201cDeep down we have an institution that is permeated by Bolsonarista ideology that accepts a democratic rupture in the name of a far-right project,\u201d said the forum\u2019s president, Renato S\u00e9rgio de Lima. What Lula plans to do is still unclear but the insurrection means the issue is now front and centre, said Melina Risso, a research director at the Igarap\u00e9 Institute. In one promising sign, Lula reached out to Brazil\u2019s state governors immediately after the attack, prompting hopes a collaborative approach may prevail. \u201cThere is a window of opportunity, this is now on everybody\u2019s radar,\u201d Risso said. \u201cIt all depends on political will and their ability to negotiate with congress. Passing legislation to reform the police is no more difficult than passing legislation to reform the tax code. It\u2019s complicated but it is a question of priorities.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-11T21:48:26Z",
            "content": "Gun control advocates were boosted on Wednesday following Illinois lawmakers\u2019 decision to ban military-style weapons in the state, as well as the US supreme court\u2019s decision to allow New York to continue enforcing a new gun law that bans guns from \u201csensitive places\u201d. Illinois governor JB Pritzker signed the Protect Illinois Communities Act, which places an immediate ban on assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and switches, on Tuesday evening. \u201cI\u2019m tired of living in a world where a mass shooting needs a title so you know which one we\u2019re referring to,\u201d Pritzker said in a statement. \u201cWe will keep fighting to ensure that future generations only hear about massacres like Highland Park, Sandy Hook and Uvalde in their textbooks,\u201d referring to two mass shootings in elementary schools \u2013 one in 2012 and the other last year. The ban comes six months after a mass shooting at a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park, Illinois, which left seven people dead and over 30 injured. The suspect was able to legally purchase multiple guns \u2013 including the murder weapon \u2013 despite being previously known to police due to prior threatening behavior. In the wake of the shooting, state representative Bob Morgan, a Democrat, introduced the wide-ranging gun control bill in December. \u201cI am in awe of the countless victims and survivors and family members who sat with us, told us their stories, and refused to give up until they got the change we all needed,\u201d Morgan tweeted on Tuesday as the bill was passed. In addition to banning military-style weapons, the law will limit long guns to 10 rounds a magazine and no more than 15 rounds for handguns. It also prohibits the possession and use of rapid-fire devices that help increase the firing rate of semi-automatic weapons. The new law requires individuals who already own guns to register their weapons with the Illinois state police. And it will expedite universal background checks. Despite the success of the bill, Republican lawmakers and pro-gun groups have voiced their opposition. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know that the actions that you are taking right now are tyrannous,\u201d a state senator, Darren Bailey, said during Monday\u2019s debate. \u201cYou also must know that I and millions of other gun owners in this state will not comply.\u201d The Illinois State Rifle Association (ISRA) has also condemned the bill. \u201cMagazine bans have been sent back,\u201d Richard Pearson, executive director of the ISRA, said, CBS reported. \u201cWe have firearm registration. We have the common use provisions. So we have all kinds of things in that bill, you know, that will incur constitutional challenges.\u201d Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the supreme court justices turned away a plea by gun owners who wanted the court to reject a lower court\u2019s decision to allow a new gun law in New York, which bans the weapons from \u201csensitive places\u201d including schools and playgrounds, to be enforced. New York lawmakers rewrote state handgun laws over the summer after a June supreme court ruling invalidated the old system for granting permits to carry handguns outside the home. The ruling said Americans have a right to carry firearms in public for self-defense, invalidating the New York law, which required people to show a specific need to get a license to carry a gun outside the home. The new law New York passed in the wake of the ruling broadly expanded who can get a license to carry a handgun but increased training requirements and required applicants to provide more information including a list of their social media accounts. The law also included a long list of \u201csensitive places\u201d where firearms are banned, including schools, playgrounds, places of worship, entertainment venues, places that serve alcohol and Times Square in New York City. A US district judge, Glenn Suddaby, declared portions of the law unconstitutional and issued a preliminary injunction barring certain provisions\u2019 enforcement. The US court of appeals for the second circuit put that ruling on hold. Challengers to the law asked the supreme court to step in and allow Suddaby\u2019s ruling to go into effect while the case continues. The appeals court has not finished its review of the case, a circumstance under which supreme court justices are often reluctant to weigh in. In a two-paragraph statement that accompanied the court\u2019s order, conservative justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas said the New York law at issue \u201cpresents novel and serious questions\u201d. But they said they understood the decision not to intervene now, \u201cto reflect respect\u201d for the appeals court\u2019s \u201cprocedures in managing its own docket, rather than expressing any view on the merits of the case\u201d."

            "date": "2023-01-31T21:56:44Z",
            "content": "The United States has accused Russia of violating the New Start treaty, the last major pillar of post-cold war nuclear arms control between the two countries, saying Moscow was refusing to allow inspection activities on its territory. The treaty came into force in 2011 and was extended in 2021 for five more years. It caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads that the United States and Russia can deploy, and the deployment of land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them. The two countries, which during the cold war were constrained by a tangle of arms control agreements, still account together for about 90% of the world\u2019s nuclear warheads. Washington has been keen to preserve the treaty but ties with Moscow are the worst in decades over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, an element that could complicate attempts by Joe Biden\u2019s administration to maintain and reach a follow-on agreement. \u201cRussia\u2019s refusal to facilitate inspection activities prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of US-Russian nuclear arms control,\u201d a state department spokesperson said in emailed comments. Moscow in August suspended cooperation with inspections under the treaty, blaming travel restrictions imposed by Washington and its allies after Russian forces invaded neighbor Ukraine in February last year, but said it was still committed to complying with the provisions of the treaty. The state department spokesperson added that Russia had a \u201cclear path\u201d for returning to compliance by allowing inspection activities, and that Washington remains ready to work with Russia to fully implement the treaty. \u201cThe New Start treaty remains in the national security interests of the United States,\u201d the spokesperson said. Talks between Moscow and Washington on resuming inspections under New Start were due to take place in November in Egypt, but Russia postponed them, accusing the United States of \u201ctoxicity and animosity\u201d, and neither side has set a new date. On Monday, Russia told the United States that the treaty could expire in 2026 without a replacement because it said Washington was trying to inflict \u201cstrategic defeat\u201d on Moscow in Ukraine. Asked if Moscow could envisage there being no nuclear arms control treaty after 2026, deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov told the RIA state new agency: \u201cThis is quite a possible scenario.\u201d The United States has supplied more than $27bn in security assistance to Ukraine since the invasion, including more than 1,600 Stinger anti-aircraft rocket systems, 8,500 Javelin anti-tank missile systems and 1m 155mm artillery rounds. Russian president Vladimir Putin has issued thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, reviving cold war era fears of an apocalyptic war. Shortly after taking office, Biden extended New Start by five years until 2026, giving time to negotiate while preserving what the Democratic administration sees as an important existing treaty. The previous administration of Donald Trump had ripped up previous arms control agreements and had been hesitant to preserve New Start in its current form, saying that any nuclear treaty must also include China, whose arsenal is rapidly growing but still significantly below those of Russia and the United States."

            "content": "Spain\u2019s prized jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico bellota is under threat from the climate crisis as rising temperatures and low rainfall imperil a key ingredient of the pigs\u2019 diet \u2013 acorns. In a country where pigs are as populous as people, there are many varieties of ham but none is so revered as jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico bellota, which retails at upwards of \u20ac100 (\u00a388) a kilo. It is produced exclusively from blackfoot pigs, which must spend the last month of their lives gorging on acorns (bellotas) in the dehesa, a type of oak forest peculiar to the west and north-west of Spain. The problem is that, as a result of unusually hot and dry summers, the oaks are producing fewer acorns. This, plus a drop in the market price, led to a 20% reduction in the jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico produced last year in Extremadura, one of only four small regions that enjoy the official denominaci\u00f3n de origen. Last year was the hottest on record in Spain and the third driest. Rainfall in Extremadura has fallen by about 35% over the past 50 years. \u201cThe dehesa is made up of holm oaks that are native to damp climates so it\u2019s a relic of when the climate here was different from now,\u201d said Francisco Esp\u00e1rrago, the president of Se\u00f1orio de Montanera, which produces top quality jam\u00f3n. \u201cThe trees struggle to survive the long, hot and dry summers we\u2019re having now.\u201d Even if this summer is not as extreme as 2022, Esp\u00e1rrago is not optimistic. \u201cI expect that this year, having survived the drought of last summer and a winter with little rain, will be worst in the 40 years I\u2019ve been working in the dehesa,\u201d he said. Under the regulations, ham producers are allowed to import acorns from elsewhere but Esp\u00e1rrago is not keen on the idea. \u201cThe main source is Morocco and Algeria, where of course they don\u2019t rear pigs, but I worry that importing acorns may introduce new diseases as happened when we imported palm trees from Egypt,\u201d he said. The red palm weevil was introduced into Spain via Egypt in 1993 and subsequently destroyed tens of thousands of palms. The finest jam\u00f3n is produced in some of Spain\u2019s poorest regions and is a vital component of their local economies, accounting for thousands of jobs in areas that are among Europe\u2019s unemployment black spots. \u201cIt\u2019s not just pigs,\u201d says Esp\u00e1rrago, who complains about the lack of funding to replant trees. \u201cIf the dehesa doesn\u2019t survive, there will be nowhere to graze cattle either.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-06T11:00:47Z",
            "content": "A coastal town in Cornwall where rising sea levels threaten to wipe out homes, beaches and businesses in a few decades\u2019 time has been awarded \u00a32m to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. The money awarded to the popular tourist destination of Bude, in north Cornwall, and 11 surrounding parishes, from the National Lottery\u2019s climate action fund, comes as the area faces an existential threat from the heating planet. The whole Cornish coast is judged by the Environment Agency to be highly sensitive to sea-level rise, but Bude is considered to be the most sensitive of all. A map of climate risks produced by NGO Climate Central shows the town and surrounding area under serious threat from sea level rises by 2050. The lottery grant is among the biggest to be awarded by the climate action fund, and the area is the smallest community to receive such a significant financial input. Nick Gardner, head of climate action at the National Lottery community fund, said the grant reflected the threat the community was under and the ambition of their plans to make their area more resilient. The United Nations environmental programme says the sustainability of coastal tourism destinations depends on their ability to adapt. \u201cIt is the degree to which people are prepared for disasters that determines how vulnerable or resilient their community will be,\u201d the UNEP says. Robert Uhlig, the founder and programme director of the Bude Climate Partnership, said the money would be transformational in terms of building long-term economic, social and environmental resilience in the small coastal community. \u201cIn effect, we\u2019re the UK\u2019s Maldives: idyllic and beautiful, but facing an existential and imminent threat to our way of life due to climate change. We\u2019re highly exposed to the physical impacts of climate change like few other places in the UK \u2013 record temperatures in the summer; destruction of our community assets by winter storms. \u201cOur vulnerability is exacerbated by social and economic challenges as the most isolated community in Cornwall. \u201cWe need to make sure we are helping businesses and people see where they are vulnerable and what they need to do. Building resilience is about getting everyone to work together, so that it is not just people doing their own thing, but all of us pulling together which will make sure we have much greater resilience to the threat.\u201d Three-quarters of a million pounds is being targeted at making tourism more sustainable within Bude, where more than 70% of local businesses and 40% of jobs are dependent on the holiday industry. Floods, droughts and extreme heat as well as the impact on the natural environment, are all a risk to the business of tourism, and show the vulnerability of the area\u2019s social and economic future, a report from the Bude Climate Partnership says. Tourism\u2019s reliance on the quality of the natural environment means there is an overwhelming imperative to take action, says Uhlig. Bude is already facing climate change impacts on its wellbeing and way of life, from the intense heat this summer to flooding, and tidal changes. Bude\u2019s 186-year-old storm tower, which sits on the edge of a crumbling coastline, is one of the first structures in the UK that is being moved because of the impacts of climate change. Uhlig said the area\u2019s vulnerability was greater because it was an area of high socio-economic deprivation, with significantly older, less energy-efficient homes than the national average, and some of the lowest access to public services and highest rates of rural child poverty in Cornwall. As well as being at risk of climate impacts, the tourism industry is a contributor to carbon emissions. More than a million visitor nights are spent in the Bude area each year, with most tourists arriving by car. Bude Climate Partnership estimates the industry contributes 50% of the community\u2019s carbon emissions. The tourism project, which starts this month and will run for five years, aims to cascade knowledge and resilience down from one tourism business to another, and involve visitors. It aims to halve the carbon footprints of at least 50 businesses in five areas. Manda Brookman, who runs a social enterprise, said: \u201cBude is on the frontline \u2026 its existential presence is under threat. \u201cMost people know that there is something wrong, but don\u2019t know what it is, how big it is and what they can do about it, which is really a political and structural failure. Active hope means not sitting on your arse on the sofa clutching a lottery ticket, it is an axe you use to break down the door during an emergency. So active hope is building net resilience for now, and for tomorrow.\u201d The funding from National Lottery is part of a wider movement that is distributing \u00a3100m over 10 years across the UK to local climate action groups. Gardner said Bude\u2019s ambition could become an examplar for other coastal areas. \u201cWe want to help with systemic change,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are lots of coastal areas in Cornwall that are under threat but Bude has the unwelcome mandate of being the most vulnerable community to sea level rises.\u201d Gardner said communities in areas particularly threatened by global heating were ready to take action locally and knew what they wanted to do to adapt. \u201cThere is no shortage of ideas but there is a shortage of funding. We are trying to help people in their own communities take steps to make their lives and their communities more resilient and to take steps to reduce their emissions. And once they see themselves as actors in that, they are more likely to make demands of politicians to support policies that tackle climate change. It is grassroots up.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-02T14:21:08Z",
            "content": "In his letter (22 December), Tom Smith describes the problems of storing the radioactive waste that is being produced by the UK nuclear reactors, and says that we need more honesty about these issues. The latter is also true of other problems with \u201cnew nuclear build\u201d. Take, for example, the proposed Sizewell C reactor on the east coast. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that extreme \u201csea level events\u201d could occur \u201cat least once per year at many locations by 2050\u201d. Sizewell C will be built near the sea on marshland. One engineer has estimated that the land where the reactor would be built will turn into a promontory encircled by the sea. Clearly the reactor site could be flooded. Then there is the problem of obtaining uranium, which is currently the fuel for the nuclear reactors. The UK has to import uranium from across the world. It is mainly mined on the land of Indigenous people \u2013 in the US, in Canada, in Australia and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The miners and their families have suffered years of ill health and even death from proximity to uranium. At the same time, having to import uranium means that this is not an independent source of energy for the UK. The government and the opposition have completely ignored all warnings; they go doggedly on, supporting the construction of the new nuclear reactor at Sizewell and considering plans to build others. But nuclear is not the answer to the UK\u2019s energy requirements. Apart from anything else, it is vastly expensive. The money it swallows should be put into developing genuine sustainable energy: tidal, wind and solar. Rae Street Littleborough, Greater Manchester"

            "date": "2023-01-02T00:01:00Z",
            "content": "A \u00a350m nuclear fuel fund to bolster production in the UK and support development of alternatives to Russian supply opens for applications on Monday, the business department has announced. The fund forms part of a nuclear fuel investment package of up to \u00a375m, of which up to \u00a313m has already been awarded to the nuclear fuel fabricators Westinghouse in Preston, helping the company develop conversion capability for reprocessed uranium and freshly mined uranium. Uranium conversion is an important stage in the nuclear fuel cycle. The funding is designed to create capability to convert recycled uranium in the UK that is not currently available outside Russia. As well as strengthening UK energy security, ministers hope it will also open up new export opportunities. G7 leaders agreed in June to take collective action to reduce reliance on civil nuclear and related goods from Russia, including diversifying their supplies of uranium and nuclear fuel production capability. Russia owns about 20% of global uranium conversion capacity and 40% of enrichment capacity. Graham Stuart, the energy and climate minister, said: \u201cRecord high global gas prices, caused by Putin\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine, have highlighted the need for more homegrown renewable energy, but also UK-generated nuclear power \u2013 building more plants, and developing domestic fuel capability. \u201cThis investment package will strengthen the UK\u2019s energy security, by ensuring access to a safe and secure supply of UK-produced fuel to power the UK nuclear fleet of today and tomorrow \u2013 squeezing out Russian influence, while creating more UK jobs and export opportunities.\u201d Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: \u201cHaving the sovereign capability to manufacture next-generation nuclear fuels for advanced reactors of the future is vital for energy security and net zero.\u201d The \u00a350m fund will support projects such as fuel supply options for light water reactors, including future small modular reactors. It will also look to support projects producing new fuel types that will be needed to supply advanced modular reactors, likely to be in operation from the 2030s, such as high-assay low-enriched uranium. The news comes after the government confirmed in late November that the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk will go ahead, backing the scheme with an investment of nearly \u00a3700m that will end China\u2019s controversial involvement."

            "date": "2023-01-11T11:30:16Z",
            "content": "When Allison Holthoff entered a crowded Nova Scotia hospital at the end of December, the intense pain in her abdomen worsened with each hour she spent waiting for treatment. With the emergency room under renovations, overwhelmed staff triaged a stream of incoming patients in a makeshift treatment area. \u201c\u2018I feel like I\u2019m dying. They\u2019re going to let me die here,\u2019\u201d Holthoff told her husband, Gunther. After more than seven hours of waiting, she went into cardiac arrest. She was resuscitated three times by health professionals, who spotted internal bleeding on an X-ray, but staff determined her organs had sustained too much damage and it was unlikely she would survive. \u201cIt was a terrible situation for my wife, for my kids and a lot of people in the community,\u201d Gunther Holthoff told reporters earlier this week at a press conference, saying his wife had been \u201cneglected\u201d as her condition deteriorated. \u201cI\u2019m just lost.\u201d While no cause of death has yet been identified, the case has nonetheless prompted calls by local politicians for an investigation into the Canadian province\u2019s emergency room backlog. But Holthoff\u2019s death is also the latest fatality to expose a mounting crisis in the country\u2019s hospitals, which have been worn down by waves of respiratory viruses and exacerbated by a chronic staffing shortage. Last summer, many emergency rooms in rural communities shut down. In larger cities, people waited dozens of hours for emergency care. At Canada\u2019s largest children\u2019s hospital, SickKids, a four-year-old child was separated from his family and flown more than 350km (217 miles) for treatment of a near-fatal sepsis infection amid overcrowding. \u201cEmergency rooms are the barometer for our healthcare system,\u201d said David Carr, a physician and professor of emergency medicine at the University of Toronto. \u201cWe\u2019re facing the \u2018perfect storm\u2019 \u2013 we\u2019ve been thrown a virus that is crippled our healthcare system and while we\u2019ve managed to get ahold of it in many ways, what we have not [is] coming to grips with is the sheer attrition of nurses and healthcare team members.\u201d While the winter months are typically the worst times for emergency rooms as respiratory viruses take hold, Canada\u2019s shortage of health professionals \u2013 and the rising rate of burnout \u2013 is making a bad problem worse. \u201cClearly the cracks have been exposed,\u201d said Carr, pointing out that colleagues in other provinces often share \u201cfrightening numbers\u201d that lay bare the overflowing waiting rooms and a struggle to allocate limited beds. Further compounding the staffing shortage, healthcare systems across the country are experiencing a \u201cgeriatric tsunami\u201d of ageing patients whose care requires a growing share of healthcare budgets and efforts. In recent months, these crises have brought healthcare systems to a breaking point. As medicine falls under provincial jurisdiction \u2013 but is funded by the federal government \u2013 political leaders at various levels of government have feuded over fixes to a languishing system. Amid a shortage of family doctors, more cases that should be addressed earlier are ending up in the country\u2019s emergency rooms. \u201cSometimes you will hear stories of terrible outcomes happening in emergency department waiting times. But what often isn\u2019t seen is the effect of those delays,\u201d said Carr. \u201cThe press picks up on these terrible catastrophes that happened in the waiting room. But they missed out on the morbidity of conditions that happen as a result of delay of care, of people not being able to assess a primary care physician.\u201d Making the shortage worse, Canadian medical students who study abroad are often unable to practice medicine when they return home due to arduous licensing requirements. \u201cI tell parents of prospective medical students, if you send your kid away, there\u2019s a reasonable chance that he or she will never come back if they train abroad, even if it\u2019s in the United States,\u201d said Carr. Provincial premiers recently floated a proposal that would make it easier for foreign-trained nurses and doctors to earn Canadian credentials. But experts warn the move cannot be made quickly and requires more resources than simply rubber-stamping paperwork. Without a single factor alone breaking the emergency rooms, Carr fears no quick solution is possible \u2013 and worries political leaders remain unable to fix a crisis that healthcare workers have long warned was looming. \u201cI feel like for years, our complaints have fallen on deaf ears,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now I worry that we\u2019re facing a pandemic of significant mental health challenges in our healthcare community. We have a compounding threat that needs to be addressed today, not tomorrow.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-09T11:00:15Z",
            "content": "I am proud to be assuming the chairmanship of the US Senate\u2019s health, education, labor and pensions committee (Help), a committee with wide jurisdiction over some of the most important issues facing the American people. As I move into that position I\u2019m thinking about how we can best address some of the serious challenges facing my fellow Vermonters and working families all across the country. Today, in terms of health, we have a dysfunctional healthcare system in which we spend the astronomical and unsustainable sum of nearly $13,000 for every man, woman and child, twice as much as most developed countries and almost 20% of our GDP. Yet, despite that huge expenditure, 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured and we have worse health outcomes and lower life expectancy than many other nations. While the insurance companies make huge profits, over 500,000 people declare bankruptcy each year from medically related debt, and over 68,000 die because they can\u2019t afford the care they need. Our complicated and fragmented system is so broken that it cannot even produce the number of doctors, nurses, dentists and mental health personnel that we desperately need. As a nation, we must focus on the reality that the function of a rational healthcare system is to provide quality care for all, not simply huge profits for the insurance industry. Today, as we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, the pharmaceutical industry is making record-breaking profits and more than a few executives in drug companies are becoming billionaires. Meanwhile, despite billions in government investment in prescription drug research and development, nearly one out of four Americans are unable to afford the medicine their doctors prescribe and too many seniors are splitting their lifesaving pills in half because they can\u2019t afford them. And because Medicare doesn\u2019t cover dental, hearing and vision, there are millions of seniors who are trying to survive without these basic healthcare needs. But it\u2019s not just our healthcare \u201csystem\u201d which needs a major overhaul. In terms of education, we need to take a hard look at how we are educating our kids \u2013 from childcare to graduate school. While psychologists tell us that the first four years of life are the most important in terms of human intellectual and emotional growth, it\u2019s hard to deny that our childcare system is in disarray. The cost is unaffordable for many working parents, there are not enough slots available, the quality is spotty and the pay and benefits childcare workers receive is unconscionably low. This is not how we should be treating our children, the future of America. The situation in K-12 education is not much better. For a variety of reasons \u2013 lack of respect, low pay, the stress of Covid and the politicization of school boards \u2013 thousands of gifted and dedicated teachers are quitting the profession, leaving students unprepared for the challenges they face as they enter the adult world. The future of this country depends upon the quality of education we provide our kids, and there is no reason why we cannot create the best public educational system in the world. In terms of higher education, we face the absurd situation of hundreds of thousands of bright young people who have the desire and ability to get a college education but cannot do so because their families lack the money. How many great doctors, scientists, and teachers are we losing as a result? There are also millions of young people who need training in order to become skilled mechanics, carpenters, welders, and electricians who are not getting the post-high school training they need. Further, 45 million Americans are struggling with student debt \u2013 sometimes in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. In terms of labor and our economy, we must recognize that we live in a period of more income and wealth inequality than at any time in the last hundred years. While the very rich become richer and three people now own more wealth than the bottom half of American society, 60% of American workers live paycheck to paycheck and millions are trying to exist on starvation wages. Meanwhile, we have a pathetic federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour which has not been raised since 2009. As more and more workers try to improve their standard of living by forming unions, they are facing fierce and illegal union busting from such employers as Starbucks, Amazon, McDonalds and other major employers. There is a lot of discussion in the media about how \u201cdivided\u201d our nation is and, on many issues, that is absolutely true. But what we don\u2019t appreciate is that on some of the most important issues facing our country the American people \u2013 Democrats, Republicans, independents \u2013 are quite united. The American people know we are being ripped off by the drug companies and they want lower prescription drugs prices. The American people know that our healthcare system is outrageously expensive and they want universal and lower cost health care. The American people know that education is essential to our lives and the future of this country and they want high quality and affordable education from childcare to graduate school. The American people know that no one can survive on a $7.25-an-hour minimum wage, and they want to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. The American people know that workers have a constitutional right to form unions and that corporations that engage in illegal union busting activities must be held accountable. And these are just a few of the issues within the jurisdiction of the Help committee that a strong majority of the American people want us to address. At a time when too many Americans are giving up on democracy, now is the time to attempt to restore faith in our government. Now is the time for Congress to have the courage to take on the lobbyists and powerful special interests and show the American people that our government can work for them, and not just the 1%. Let\u2019s do it. Bernie Sanders is a US senator, and the ranking member of the Senate budget committee. He represents the state of Vermont, and is the longest-serving independent in the history of Congress"

            "date": "2023-01-23T06:00:15Z",
            "content": "Ideas such as Sajid Javid\u2019s suggestion that patients should be charged for visiting GPs or hospital emergency departments show the Conservatives are \u201ctesting the water for a different kind of NHS\u201d, Gordon Brown has said. Writing in the Guardian, the former Labour prime minister says payment for services will end up with people missing early diagnoses and undermine the entire basis of the NHS. Javid, the Conservative former health secretary, told the Times on Friday that the NHS could not \u201csurvive much longer\u201d without radical change, including regarding some fee payments. Javid, who will stand down as a Tory MP at the next election, cited as possible examples the fee of about \u00a320 required of patients to see a GP in Norway or Sweden, and Ireland\u2019s charge of \u20ac75 for people who arrive at a hospital A&amp;E without a referral. Javid\u2019s intervention was, Brown wrote, \u201cno accident\u201d, noting that Rishi Sunak used the services of private healthcare and, when, campaigning to become prime minister, had proposed a charge for people who missed GP appointments. \u201cAnd so once again, as they did in opposition at the turn of this century, with alternative prescriptions [a 2002 Tory document on ways to finance the NHS], Conservatives are testing the water for a different kind of NHS. Today\u2019s Conservatives may have clapped [for] NHS nurses and health workers at the height of the pandemic; yet they are not only opposing decent remuneration for them but also contemplating a more privately financed healthcare system,\u201d Brown wrote. A move to payments would create \u201ca two-tier healthcare system\u201d in which better-off people took out private cover, Brown argued. It would be \u201cnot only morally concerning, it would also be most costly and economically wasteful\u201d. He wrote: \u201cAs the overseas experience of billing and means-testing shows, charges not only mean higher administration and collection costs, they also discourage the sick from seeking treatment until too late \u2013 when more severe problems require not only more intensive, but more costly, interventions.\u201d An ageing population and growing numbers of people with chronic or long-term diseases did mean that change was required, Brown said, but he said this should be focused instead on resolving issues around social care and the drain this placed on NHS hospital beds, plus on tackling underlying factors. Conservatives \u201cseem to find more joy in one person joining Bupa than 60 million people using the NHS\u201d, Brown said, adding: \u201cBut what we know of the rising pressures from health inequalities, from the path-breaking work of Michael Marmot, should turn the focus of our attention from this ideological sideshow of charging and private insurance to tackling entrenched poverty and the other social determinants of ill health. It is by attacking and eradicating the causes of ill health that we will do most to reduce waiting lists and pressures on the hospital sector.\u201d"

            "content": "State and territory leaders will push the commonwealth to restore 50-50 hospital funding and increase the Medicare rebate while New South Wales will champion changes to expose doctors to greater competition. The premiers\u2019 wishlists come before a national cabinet meeting on Friday to consider the Strengthening Medicare taskforce report, which aims to improve the commonwealth-funded primary care system to take stress off state-funded hospitals. But the federal health minister, Mark Butler, has all but ruled out changes to the Medicare rebate. He has foreshadowed major changes to primary care, which will include funding to encourage \u201cblended\u201d services, such as medical centres offering access to nurses, physiotherapists and other allied health professionals instead of just general practitioners. The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, wants a NSW trial for pharmacists to prescribe antibiotics for urinary tract infections, treatments for skin conditions and infections and birth control to be extended nationwide, ending doctors\u2019 effective monopoly on prescriptions. Perrottet has brushed aside doctors\u2019 resistance to the plan, telling the Sydney Morning Herald he believes they are wrong to oppose it. \u201cChange is always difficult, and there will always be different opinions and I completely respect that,\u201d he reportedly said. The South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, praised the Albanese government for acknowledging the primary care problem and welcomed the direction of the Strengthening Medicare report, which will be released on Friday. Malinauskas told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe status quo is not satisfactory when it comes to the performance of the health system \u2013 particularly the primary health system and the effect it\u2019s having on the hospital system.\u201d He said states were contributing funding to the healthcare system at an unsustainable pace and the primary care changes needed to translate into substantial action. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cAt some point we have to accept the fact that so many of the levers that inform the number of people that present at emergency departments is directly informed by the performance of the primary healthcare system for which the commonwealth is responsible.\u201d The Tasmanian premier, Jeremy Rockliff, said he hoped the Strengthening Medicare taskforce would address \u201cthe viability issue so many practices are facing due to the low value of Medicare rebates\u201d. \u201cWe know that access to timely, affordable primary health care is critical, and despite the best efforts of hard-working GPs \u2013 we are seeing falling bulk billing rates and Tasmanians are having more difficulty accessing GP appointments. \u201cAlthough primary healthcare is the responsibility of the federal government, the Tasmanian government is increasingly stepping in, and investing in primary care to enhance access across the state.\u201d The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, was re-elected in November on a pledge of a 12-month pilot project from the middle of 2023 to expand the role of community pharmacists to treat minor health conditions. Andrews said Medicare \u201cshould be fast, free and local and we\u2019re looking forward to discussing this issue\u201d at national cabinet. \u201cDespite primary care being a Commonwealth responsibility, the Victorian government has been stepping in with our priority primary care centres, which are free clinics hosting salaried GPs that see hundreds of patients each week, reducing pressure on busy emergency departments and giving patients access to the care they need before they become acute,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know what the solutions to Australia\u2019s broken primary care system are \u2013 we urgently need to pay GPs more, increase university places to get a pipeline of new doctors across the nation, attract GPs from overseas to Australia faster \u2013 and break down the barriers between primary care and our hospital system.\u201d Since ending the temporary 50-50 hospital funding split agreed during the first two years of the Covid pandemic, the federal government has not been keen to revisit the national health reform agreement, which runs until 2025. On Tuesday Butler continued to play down the possibility that primary care could be funded beyond Labor\u2019s $750m Strengthening Medicare fund, saying: \u201cSimply putting more money into the existing structures is not going to deliver the type of care modern Australia needs.\u201d Butler said the government would establish 50 urgent care clinics and the taskforce would identify \u201cthe best ways to boost affordability, improve access, and deliver better support for patients with ongoing and chronic illness\u201d."

            "date": "2023-01-17T11:00:31Z",
            "content": "Horror as a genre is especially well suited to stories about isolated people in claustrophobic spaces. So it was kind of inevitable there would be a glut of features along those lines made during the most locked-down periods of the Covid-19 pandemic, when safety measures restricted cast and crew sizes as well as location use. And yet few of the resulting movies even mention Covid, let alone address the abundant anxieties and fears surrounding it all. Writer-director Andy Mitton\u2019s simply executed feature \u2013 apparently shot in 2021 but set in the more dangerous, pre-vaccine months of 2020 \u2013 inventively mashes up pandemic panic and supernatural danger to make a potent, truly creepy horror package, garnished with naturalism and sly, strategic moments of humour. There are flaws, sure, and logical lacunae here and there, but it lingers in the memory long after the final credits roll. Protagonist Mo (Gabby Beans, terrific) is snugly set up in a bubble with her father (Myles Walker) and brother (Ray Anthony Thomas) in a snow-lapped corner of upstate New York while the pandemic rages in the cities beyond. Out of the blue she gets a call from an old college friend, Mavis (Emily Davis, also excellent), who has no one else to turn to for help. Mavis is suffering from horrific nightmares which she struggles to wake up from even though she knows she\u2019s dreaming and tries to self-harm to break the spell. Mo feels she owes Mavis a solid because of a good deed she did Mo years ago, so Mo risks travelling to Queens to stay with Mavis in an apartment block where every cough heard through the walls and ambulance heard in the distance foretells doom. In fact, the ghostly figure that is haunting Mavis, who takes the form of a medieval plague doctor with a long, bird-shaped mask, calls himself the Harbinger. That\u2019s according to the demonologist the women consult via a Zoom call hoping for a solution once Mo also starts having nightmares featuring the Harbinger. Incidentally, this scene showcases a genius bit of black comedy: the demonologist insists they all talk in cheery voices throughout their conversation, no matter how terrifying the subject matter is, because her young children are in the room and they\u2019re tuned more into tone of voice rather than what\u2019s being said. In the end, the Harbinger isn\u2019t that notable a bogeyman, the gore level is minimal, and the jumps and twists are pretty predictable. What adds potency is the ominous conceit that the Harbinger doesn\u2019t just steal people away in their sleep: he wipes the memory of them away from other people, leaving only tiny traces behind. That meshes nicely with the sudden absences when people started dying in big numbers, the \u201cbrain fog\u201d survivors experienced, and the general paranoia of those times \u2013 amazingly, only a couple of years ago. \u2022 The Harbinger is released on 23 January on digital platforms."

Zients departed his pandemic-related White House role last April, but had been back since fall, assisting Klain ahead of and after November\u2019s midterm elections, and will now take over the top job, the Washington Post reported on Sunday. This would be the biggest change to Biden\u2019s inner circle of advisers since he took office two years ago, amid relative stability in his White House team and his cabinet of department heads, in sharp contrast to his predecessor, Donald Trump, who had a swift turnover of top aides and administration leaders via resignations and firings during his chaotic single term as president. Klain will announce his departure in the coming weeks, according to the New York Times on Saturday. \u201cTwo hard years,\u201d Klain tweeted on Friday, marking the second anniversary of Biden\u2019s inauguration. \u201cSo much to be done. But so much progress.\u201d The impending exit of Klain follows a period where the chief of staff worked to secure Biden\u2019s legislative priorities, including the bipartisan infrastructure bill and last year\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which was achieved following 18 months of often torturous negotiations between the White House and lawmakers, most notably Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia. More recently, Biden has come under scrutiny for alleged improper handling of federal documents, as well as fresh pressure from Republicans in their new majority in the House of Representatives. The new chief of staff is expected to have to mount a defense of Biden\u2019s victories so far, as well as oversee the lead-up to a likely reelection bid by the 80-year-old president. Klain, who is 61, has a long record in Democratic political circles, working for Bill Clinton, Al Gore and Barack Obama before the Biden presidency. Zients entered Washington politics during the Obama administration and had previously mainly worked in the private sector."

Randon, known as Sister Andr\u00e9, was born in southern France on 11 February 1904, when the first world war was still a decade away. She died in her sleep at her nursing home in Toulon, spokesperson David Tavella said on Tuesday. \u201cThere is great sadness but \u2026 it was her desire to join her beloved brother. For her, it\u2019s a liberation,\u201d Tavella, of the Sainte-Catherine-Labour\u00e9 nursing home, told AFP. The sister was long feted as the oldest European, before the death of Japan\u2019s Kane Tanaka aged 119 last year left her the longest-lived person on Earth. Randon was born in the year New York opened its first subway and when the Tour de France had only been staged once. She worked as a governess and tutor before entering a convent in 1944, aged 40. She had been in nursing homes since 1979 and in the Toulon home since 2009. In 2021, she survived a bout of Covid-19 after the virus swept through the nursing home where she lived, killing 10 other residents. At the time, she told Var-Matin newspaper: \u201cI didn\u2019t even realise I had it.\u201d Tavella told the newspaper that the nun had shown no fear of the virus. \u201cShe didn\u2019t ask me about her health but about her routine. She wanted to know for example if the meal and bed times were going to change. She showed no fear of the illness, in fact she was more worried about the other residents,\u201d Tavella said. Asked if she was scared to have Covid, the nun told France\u2019s BFM television: \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t scared because I wasn\u2019t scared to die \u2026 I\u2019m happy to be with you, but I would wish to be somewhere else \u2013 join my big brother and my grandfather and my grandmother.\u201d In 2020, Randon told French radio she had no idea how she had lived so long. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea what the secret is. Only God can answer that question,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had plenty of unhappiness in life and during the 1914-1918 war when I was a child, I suffered like everyone else.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 18 January 2023 to correct the spelling of Sister Andr\u00e9\u2019s name. An earlier version said that she worked as a governor, this should have been governess."

            "content": "That is probably all from us from Davos today, unless there are some late developments. Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s action: Goodnight. GW German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has declared he is convinced that Europe\u2019s largest economy would not fall into a recession. Scholz, who gives a special address to the World Economic Forum tomorrow, added he was optimistic Berlin could reach an agreement with Washington to avoid a trade war over new U.S. green subsidies (within the Inflation Reduction Act). Scholz told Bloomberg TV: \u201cWe are now discussing with the government and with all the political people in the United States that it should not happen that local content regulations are against European partners. \u201cAnd I\u2019m quite optimistic that we will reach an agreement in this field.\u201d On the Ukraine war, Henry Kissinger argued that the US should continue to \u201csupport and if necessary\u201d intensify its military support for Ukraine until a ceasefire line is reached, or accepted, at some preliminary discussions with Moscow. Kissinger tells Davos via videolink that peace talks should begin once Ukrainian forces had reclaimed the territories occupied by Russia since the invasion. He argues that this would prevent the war from becoming a war against Russia itself, and would give Russia an opportunity to rejoin an international system. \u201cThis may seem very hollow to nations that have been under Russian pressure, for much of the post-war period\u201d, Kissinger concedes. He favous dialogue with Russia while the war continues, pointing out that there are over 15,000 nuclear weapons on its territory. Kissinger argues that sanctions and other measures would continue to put pressure on Russia during peace talks. And he expresses his admiration for the president of Ukraine and the \u201cheroic conduct\u201d of the Ukrainian people. Kissinger says that before the war began, he was opposed to Ukraine joining NATO, fearing it would start the sort of conflict we have seen in the last year. In the current situation, \u201cthe idea of a neutral Ukraine is no longer meaningful\u201d, he explains. At the end of the process of peace talk process that Kissinger invisinges, Ukraine should be given guarantees by Nato. Kissinger says: I believe Ukrainian membership in Nato would be an appropriate outcome. There was quite the queue to listen to Henry Kissinger \u2018in person\u2019 (on a video-link screen). Henry Kissinger, former US Secretary of State and National Security Advisor, is now speaking at Davos via videolink. He\u2019s asked about China \u2013 the country he normalised US relations with while working with President Nixon. Kissinger explains that when Nixon and chairman Mao began to move to make progress in relations, there had been 152 negotiations about Taiwan. Each time those negotations closed down quickly, as each sides\u2019 position was unacceptable to the other. The Taiwan issue was placed under arrangements where Taiwan could develop economically without the affirmation of the US of a separate China, he Process has been under pressure recently, Kissinger points out. But, the presidents of China and US have recently met (in November) to arrest the move towards conflict, and created a basis for dialogue. Kissinger says: I am delighted to see that my friend of two decades, Liu He, has expressed a vision at this meeting which outlined ways by which this process can be implemented. [as covered earlier, China\u2019s Vice-Premier Liu He told Davos that China welcomed foreign investment and was open to the world] There needs to be a deep conviction on both sides to resolve the issue of Taiwan\u2019s status, Kissinger explains, citing the potential dangers of two countries with expertise in artificial intelligence and nuclear weapons capabilities being in conflict. Sanna Marin also explains how the Ukraine was has led the Finnish public to support NATO membership. After the Ukraine invasion, she tells the WEF annual meeting, the Finnish people began to ask what border Russia would not cross \u2013 the answer being the border with NATO, Finland\u2019s PM explains. Sweden\u2019s foreign minister, Tobias Billstrom, has said that Turkey\u2019s parliament should begin ratifying Sweden and Finland\u2019s NATO membership bids, as the two Nordic countries have met the commitments they had agreed to with Turkey. Billstrom told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum today: \u201cWe believe we have now reached a point where Sweden and Finland have done what we committed ourselves to in this (trilateral) memorandum and it is time for the Turkish parliament to begin the ratification process,\u201d \u201cWe believe very strongly that we have done what was being asked and we do not see any reason for the ratification not to start.\u201d Finland\u2019s prime minister, Sanna Marin, says that a legal way to use frozen Russian assets to fund the reconstrution of Ukraine should be found. She\u2019s now speaking on a panel on War in Europe: Year 2, and points to the large amounts of frozen assets from the Russian central bank, and from oligarchs, since the invasion of February 2022. We need to find solutions to how to use these funds to rebuild Ukraine, Marin says, adding: It could affect the war more than we think, as there are many interests behind this money. We need t0 find the legal framework to use these assets to help Ukraine, she insists. Qatar\u2019s foreign minister has told delegates at Davos that recent measures taken by Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban-led administration were \u201cvery disappointing\u201d. However, Doha would continue engaging as the only way forward to achieve change on the ground, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani says. Al-Thani said Doha was also consulting with other Muslim countries to establish a dialogue with Taliban officials in Kandahar, and while it would \u201cnot be an easy job\u201d it was important to keep trying. Afghanistan\u2019s Islamist Taliban-led administration has recently ordered all local and foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to stop female employees from coming to work, and also imposed bans on women attending universities and high school. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, prime minister of Spain, is giving a special address now, pledging that Spain will step up to tackle the challenges facing the global economy. S\u00e1nchez says Spain will continue to donate Covid-19 vaccines until the global south has the same access as the global north. And it will will continue to support Ukraine, until Putin withdraws his troops and Ukraine returns to being a successful, prosperous country again. S\u00e1nchez says: President Zelenskiy, we have your back. Gabriel Zucman, Director of the EU Tax Observatory, is demanding that participants at the World Economic Forum make multinational companies pay more in taxes. In a video, Zucman explains: Multinationals must pay their fair share of taxes and contribute more to public finances. They are the big winners of globalization, yet their tax rates have collapsed. Paying their fair share of taxes is in their very interest, because it will ensure the economic and political sustainability of the globalization. Manchester United\u2019s former goalkeeping great, Peter Schmeichel, has defended the club\u2019s decision to set up a luxury lounge at the World Economic Forum here in Davos this week. The appearance of a Manchester United lounge in the Swiss ski resort, where global tech firms, banks and consultancies have set up stall, has sparked speculation that it is being used to market the team to potential buyers. Schmeichel, who is acting as an ambassador for the club, told AFP: \u201cIf you look at what we say about ourselves -- we say that we are one of the biggest sporting brands in the world -- then I think you have to back it up by having a presence in places like this,\u201d \u201cOf course, our football club is not just about the commercial side, making money. The lounge includes a bar, multiple seating areas and screens showing club heroes, giving Manchester United a place to meet present and future corporate partners and sponsors, said Ellie Norman, a club spokeswoman. In November, the Glazer family who own the club announced they were \u201ccommencing a process to explore strategic alternatives\u201d for the club. Norman says the review \u201cis not connected to why we\u2019re back in Davos,\u201d she adding, stating that Manchester United had been a partner of the World Economic Forum since 2019. Sanna Marin, Finland\u2019s prime minister, says she is concerned about the debt levels of some European neighbours. She\u2019s taking part in a \u2018conversation\u2019 at Davos now, and explains that she really worries about the situation in Europe now. Some countries have a lot of debt and a lot of costs because of that, she says, pointing out that Finland is \u2018in the middle\u2019 of the table when it comes to debt/GDP levels. It is \u201ca serious matter for all of us\u201d, as European countries are in the same economy and many are in the eurozone, she explains. Marin is then asked whether being a very young woman leader \u2013 something she is not happy about being raised \u2013 has helped her create a legacy or further certain issues. Marin points out that we don\u2019t have to raise the issue\u2026. \u2026 before pointing out that most of her time since becoming PM aged 34 has been spent on major crisis, which woud have been the same if a older, or male leader was in charge. My gender and age has not affected that, Marin points out, adding that gender equality is very important in Finland as a small nation. With 5.5m people, Finland couldn\u2019t cope if it didn\u2019t use the resources of its people. Outside the security cordon in Davos, an exhibition called UKRAINE IS YOU is showcasing how Ukrainians have been defending freedom in the face of Russian aggression in the last 11 months. Victor Pinchuk, the Ukrainian businessman and oligarch whose foundation is supporting the project, hopes it will encourage leaders in Davos of the need to support Ukraine with more weaponry. Opening the UKRAINE IS YOU project, Pinchuk told attendees: \u201cWhat happened in Ukraine can happen to you, that\u2019s why we invite you to be Ukrainian for a moment here. Join Ukrainians in the moment of liberation, in the empowering moment of restoring freedom, in the moment of the liberation of Kherson, for example. But also join Ukrainians in their moments of suffering, because it\u2019s happening every day and every hour.\u201d \u201cThis war has many fronts. Of course, the main one is the military front, where our heroes risk their lives and fight. But the cultural front is also very important, and I believe that art has potential to be a very efficient weapon. Maybe, it will convince decision makers to send necessary weapons much faster.\u201d Credit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann has warned employees they should brace for bonus cuts as it launches a painful and costly turnaround after a \u201cpoor year\u201d. Lehmann told Bloomberg TV that: \u201cIt was a horrifying year for Credit Suisse,\u201d So I think people will have realistic expectations that it will not look great [for bonuses].\u201d Raghuram Rajan also expects a China recovery this year, maybe as soon as from March or April. Chinese families are risk-averse still, he explains, but there will be a pumping up of demand. That will help recovery \u2013 the question is how inflationary will it be. But while it could be a \u2018mixed bag\u2019 in terms of price pressures, it will boost world economic demand. Senior economists are warning that 2023 will be a tough year, as central bankers continue to tighten interest rates to fight inflation. Speaking on a panel here, finance professor Raghuram Rajan of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business warns that central banks may have to tighten policy more than they\u2019d like this year, to squeeze out inflation. Rajan explains that central bankers are looking at labour markets and trying to see some signs of slack, so they can pause their tightening programmes. But every time there\u2019s a hint they may pause, the financial markets take off. So some central banks are saying \u2018we can\u2019t stop until they see clear signs of labour market slack\u2019, so they may overtighten, he fears. That means there is a danger of a cliff-edge effect. At this point, central bankers will probably go a little further than they\u2019d like to, because they can\u2019t see the impact of what they\u2019ve done so far, Rajan explains. The markets are betting on not just a pause, but a cut this year \u2013 that\u2019s overly optimistic, he argues. House prices, he says, may start to drop once people start losing their jobs and are forced to fell, Rajan argues. He also warns that weaker companies were not able to push out their debt maturities, so they may hit trouble due to rising borrowing costs. Gilles Mo\u00ebc, AXA group chief economist, says he expects a \u201cvery shallow\u201d recession this year. He explains that in 2022, the world economy took a massive inflation hit, but companies were able to push those costs onto consumers. This year, that will be harder, so cost-cutting will become a priority for many companies. He also warns that companies face a jump in borrowing costs when they refinance \u2013 that, and the diminished ability of consumers to swallow price rises, will squeeze companies this year. Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, explains that labour markets has been resilient in the face of higher inflation and interest rates. She predicts wages remain relatively robust, but may not keep up with inflation (meaning falling real wages). It\u2019s a race, she says, to whether wages or inflation moderate first. In US and many advanced economies, it\u2019s a dead heat, a tie. But other countries, workers will lose out, Richardson warns. The Covid situation in China \u201cis steady\u201d, Liu He tells delegates at Davos. Asked about the situation in the pandemic since Beijing lifted its restrictions, the vice-premier says that China has passed the infection peak, and people are returning to normal life. But, Liu explains, there is a short spell of time between the infection peak and returning to normal, which somehow is \u201cbeyond our expectations\u201d. But he says that dining out, consumption and tourism are returning to normal levels. Now the priority remains the elderly and those with underlying conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure. As things stand, supplies of hospital beds, doctors and medicines are available, he says. And Liu reminds the audience that foreign visitors are now free to visit China, and welcome. They only need a negative PCR test taken 48 hours previously, with no quarantine or additional requests. He adds that he met friends yesterday who plan to visit China to attend events this year \u2013 another sign of life returning to normal. China has reported 60,000 Covid-related deaths in just over a month, but Beijing has been accused of underreporting coronavirus deaths, despite reports of hospitals and crematoriums being overrun. On global issues, Liu He says the world economy must be opened up. China continues to oppose unilateralism, he says, and looks forward to working with other countries to enhance global cooperation. He touches on inflation, warning that the measures taken by some countries to fight inflation (ie interest rate rises) mean they risk a \u201chike, recession, recovery loop.\u201d More attention should be paid to the risk of spillover effects from the rate hikes by advanced economies on developing and emerging markets, he says. And he says there must be a global response to climate change, adding that most countries are keenly aware of need for common actions. [reminder. China is now the world\u2019s biggest carbon emitter, contributing almost a third of the world\u2019s greenhouse gases in 2020 \u2013 but is also most exposed to the damaging impact of climate change \u2013 more here] On China\u2019s property crisis last year, Liu He says liquidity in the sector has been greatly enhanced. This has led to a \u201cnoticeable improvement\u201d in supply and demand in China\u2019s real estate market, Liu adds. China will support the future healthy development of the property market, the vice-premier pledges. Next up on stage here in Davos is China\u2019s vice-premier, Liu He. Liu begins by reminding the audience that China\u2019s GDP grew by 3% last year (as today\u2019s economic report shows). Liu says China\u2019s focus in 2023 is on expanding domestic demand, keeping industrial and supply chains smooth, supporting the healthy development of the private sector, deepening the reforms of state owned enterprises, attracting foreign investment and defusing financial risks If we work hard enough we are confident that in 2023, China\u2019s growth will most likely return to its normal trend, he says. Liu He points out that over the last decade, China\u2019s economy has grown from 54trn yuan to 121bn yuan in 2022. Life expectancy has risen, from 74.8 years to 78.2 years Liu says this improvement was due to five priorities pushed by China. First, economic development must be the primary and central task, with a goal of \u2018high quality economic devleopment.\u2019 Second, making the establishment of a socialist market economy a goal of reform. The market must be allowed to play its role in resource allocation, He insists, adding \u201cIt is by no means possible to go for a state-planned economy.\u201d China want to promote fair competition, oppose monopoly and promote entrepeneurship, he pledges [an interesting point, given Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s comments a few minutes earlier]. Third, policies must always support the opening up of the economy, which can be a catalyst of reform in China and a key driver of economic progress. China\u2019s door to the world can only open wider, Liu says. Fourth, complying with the rule of law \u2013 both government and market activities must stay within the law. And finally, promoting \u201cinnovation-driven development\u201d. That means growing human capital faster, and boosting productivity. Von de Leyen tells Davos attendees that Ukraine needs \u201cevery helping hand on board\u201d to help with its reconstruction. Knowledge, as well as money, is needed to move forward in the relief, repair and reconstruction process, she says. The Ukraine people \u201creally deserve it\u201d. We had expected Ursula von der Leyen to launch a more stinging attack on the US over its Inflation Reduction Act\u2026 but instead, she singles out China as a concern. She says China is targeting foreign companies, trying to persude them to move their manufacturing operations to China with the promise of cheaper energy. She also points to the heavy subsidies which Chinese firms benefit from. Europe must \u2018derisk\u2019 its relations with China, she insists, saying: We still need to trade and work with China, so we need to refocus our approach on derisking rather than decoupling. This means using all tools available to deal with unfair practices. \u201cWe will not hesitate to open investigations\u201d if Europe thinks its procurement processes or markets are being disrupted by subsidies, Von der Leyen adds. Fighting the climate crisis must have a fair appraoch and a level playing field, Von der Leyen adds. And she believes that the story of the clean tech economy wil be written in Europe. Turning to trade, Ursula von der Leyen says Europe is \u201ctrying hard to resolve\u201d its differences with the United Kingdom. The European Union will prepare a law to make life easier for its green industry and back it up with state aid and a European Sovereignty Fund to keep firms from moving to the United States, von der Leyen continues. She says the plan is part of the EU\u2019s Green Deal industrial plan, which aims to make Europe the home of clean technology and industrial innovation in the push for net-zero. Von der Leyen tells delegates here in Davos: \u201cTo help make this happen, we will put forward a new Net-Zero Industry Act \u201cThe aim will be to focus investment on strategic projects along the entire supply chain. We will especially look at how to simplify and fast-track permitting for new clean tech production sites,\u201d she said. The aim is to keep European industries in Europe, rather than seeing them move to the United States to take advantage of its $369bn scheme to subsidise green production. Von der Leyen explains. \u201cTo keep European industry attractive, there is a need to be competitive with the offers and incentives that are currently available outside the EU. Ursula von der Leyen turns to Europe\u2019s concern\u2019s over the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). She says that together, European countries and the United States are are putting forward almost a trillion euros to accelerate the clean energy economy This has the potential to massively boost the path to climate neutrality, she says. But, she says, it is \u201cno secret\u201d that some parts of the IRA raise a number of concerns, with regard to incentives for companies. She says Europe is working with the US on the issue: We are working with \u201cour United States friends\u201d to find solutions, so that European-made components and cars can also benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, she says. The aim is to avoid restructions in TransAltantic trade and investment, von der Leyen, But we should ensure that our respective packages are \u201cfair\u201d. Von der Leyen explains that setting out joint standards would allow Europe and the US to jointly benefit from the spending that is being made. Competition and trade are the key to speeding up climate neutrality, she says, adding: We Europeans need to get better at nurturing our clean tech industry. European commissioner Ursula von der Leyen now takes the stage, and begins by hailing Ukraine\u2019s courage since Russia\u2019s invasion last year. Back in February, she says, many predicted Keiv would fall in a matter of days. But those predictions did not account for the \u201cmorale and physical courage\u201d of the Ukraine people, von der Leyen says. They have pushed back against the aggressor against all odds, von der Leyen says, adding that \u201cnot even Russia\u2019s relentless attacks on civilisans, or the spectre of a brutal winter\u201d, have shaken that resolve. Addressing Olena Zelenska in the audience, she says that \u201cin the last year your country has moved the world and inspired Europe.\u201d Von der Leyen adds: Europe will always stand with you. She points out that Ukraine is now a candidate country to join the European Union, and that European countries have provided \u201cmore and more critical weapons\u201d and are hosting four million Ukrainians. [however, arms manufacturer Rheinmetall warned yesterday that the battle tanks from German industrial reserves wanted by Ukraine will not be ready to be delivered until 2024] Von der Leyen declares: There will be no impunity for these Russian crimes. And she insist Europe will stand with Ukraine: We are in it for as long as it takes, and stand by our Ukranian friends. Nothing is off limits for Russia, Zelenska warns. She cites the use of an anti-aircraft missile on apartments in Dnipro. The world must unite for peace, Zelenska says, saying she has handed letters from her husband to several leaders here in Davos, including China\u2019s vice-premier Liu He. We must not allow another Chernobyl to happen, Olena Zelenska continues. And turning to Russia\u2019s weaponisation of Ukraine\u2019s food supplies, she says that everyone has a right to food. It is an insult to have mass starvation in 21st century, bcasue of the targeted aggression of one country, Zelenska says. No child in the world should do homework by candlelight, and doctors should not be performing surgery by flashlights, she adds. Olena Zelenska takes the stage here in Davos, to warm applause. Speaking in Ukranian, she tells delegates at WEF that they have significant influence. But, she says, \u201cnot all of you are using this influence, or you use it in a way that divides even more\u201d. Global cooperation is needed, Zelenska says, as Russia\u2019s aggression in Europe is creating a major crisis. We face the collapse of the world as we know it, Zelenska warns. She questions what world we have, where tanks are allowed to strike at nuclear power stations What happens to inflation when state borders start to collapse, Zelenska says. And what happens to the cost of living when tens of millions are forced to flee starvation and become refugees. And she insists that the crisis will worsen, unless Russia loses the Ukraine war: This war can go further and make the crisis larger, unless the aggressor loses. Olena Zelenska has discussed the situation in Ukraine with WEF president Klaus Schwab today, she tweets. She hopes that global business will listend and respond to the need for reconstruction at cities across Ukraine. Olena Zelenska, the First Lady of Ukraine, is to give a special address to Davos shortly (as her husband Volodymyr Zelenskiy did by video call at last May\u2019s annual meeting). She\u2019s attracted a big turnout in the large Congress hall here in Davos \u2013 it\u2019s packed. There is heavy security for Zelenska, with extra bag checks at the door before attendees are allowed in (we\u2019ve already gone through airport-style security scans to get into the WEF congress building). Alain Berset, president of the Swiss Confederation, is speaking now, saying Switzerland will make \u201cevery effort to strenthen international law\u201d following the Ukraine war. Berset warns that the rule of law under threat, even in some democratic states, which is undermining the international system. Speaking at Davos, North Macedonia\u2019s president has described the Western Balkans as a soft spot in Europe\u2019s security architecture having been targeted by influence campaigns by Russia. President Stevo Pendarovski told an event at the World Economic Forum that Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime had, for years, tried to provoke the people in the region. In the past year or so, Russian fake news, propaganda and \u2018hybrid threats\u2019 has not intensified, Pendarovski explained, because Russis was fully preoccupied with countering the Western alliance, due to the war in Ukraine. But instead, local actors \u2013 some who are \u2018not quite happy\u2019 with the peace agreements reached in the 90s \u2013 are doing that work instead. Pendarovski says his judgement is that if Russia tries to deflect the West\u2019s attention from Ukraine, then the Western Balkan region is more prone to that risk than the Baltic countries. Pendarovski adds: It seems to me that the so-called soft spot in the whole pan-European security architecture right now, apart from Ukraine of course, from that danger from the Kremlin is the Western Balkans.\u201d Pendarovski added that he believed the United States should pay more attention to the situation in the region. At a panel on China, Kevin Rudd, the former prime minister of Australia, said the world\u2019s second biggest economy was likely to bounce back now that it had abandoned its zero-Covid policy. While there was likely to be a surge in infections, Rudd said the December u-turn was inevitable. China had no choice because zero-Covid was not working for the economy. Growth was now likely to recover from around 3% in 2022 to 5% this year as consumers spent some of the 2tn dollars of savings accumulated during lockdowns. Rudd, who will soon be taking up the post of Australia\u2019s ambassador to the US, added: I am expecting a solid growth number for 2023. That\u2019s good for China but in a world where growth is challenged it will underpin global growth in the year to come. Economic data released early today showed that China grew by 3% in 2022, better than the 2.8% forecast in a Reuters poll. A leading European industry minister has warned the United States\u2019 $369bn Inflation Reduction Act risks fuelling a subsidy race and likened it to doping in sport. Jozef Sikela, the Czech Republic\u2019s minister of industry and trade, told a panel on energy at the World Economic Forum that Joe Biden\u2019s landmark policy is in danger of luring companies away from Europe to the US with the promise of cheap energy. \u201cWhen it comes to subsidies, as a former banker we should be careful because subsidy is something like doping in sport,\u201d Sikela said, adding: \u201cIf you then have to live without subsidies it is difficult to turn back to a normal life. \u201cSometimes we see that the entrepreneurs are not thinking about what is good for the people but where I can get subsidies.\u201d European governments and some of the continent\u2019s biggest companies are increasingly warning about the risks from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offers big subsidies for technologies that will be crucial to the transition away from fossil fuels, including electric cars, batteries, and renewable energy technologies such as solar panels and wind turbines. \u201cI understand the importance of the Inflation Reduction Act from the US perspective but on the side of Europe it is seen as much more controversial,\u201d said Sikela. \u201cIt is saying to European investors \u2018Go to the US because it is more profitable to you because they will give you much cheaper energy that you can get in Europe\u2019.\u201d But Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, said the IRA is the \u201cmost important climate action after the Paris 2015 agreement\u201d. Speaking at the same panel as John Kerry, former Bank of England governor Mark Carney said philanthropy could leverage huge amounts of capital into the fight against climate change. Carney, the co-chair of the global coalition for net zero, said \u201cwe need layers of capital to catalyse the investment that needs to happen to prevent the wanton destruction of our ecosystem. \u201cWe need a just transition,\u201d Carney added. Borge Brende, managing director of the World Economic Forum, said currently only 2 per cent of philanthropic funding went to climate change and nature projects. At a panel here on how philanthropy can help in the fight against global heating John Kerry, Joe Biden\u2019s climate envoy, criticised big business and some US politicians for failing to back action. Kerry warned that time was running out for the world to tackle climate change, saying: \u201cHow is it the case that adults, human beings, CEOs, senators want to ignore science, mathematics and physics and can\u2019t bring themselves to do what we have to do\u201d. Kerry said a \u201cdestructive process of growth, a robber baron growth\" was killing species, adding: \u201cWe have to find a way to get really serious about bringing the corporate world on board around the world.\u201d Kerry said many companies had committed themselves to becoming net zero by 2050 but \u201cdidn\u2019t have a clue how to get there.\u201d Pledges had been made but the world was not delivering on its promises, he warned. \u201cI am convinced we will get to a low carbon / no carbon economy because we have to. I am not sure we\u2019re going to get there before we have the worst consequences of the crisis.\u201d Kerry said 17 of the worst affected countries from the climate emergency were in Africa and it was vital to build a global consensus for action. Actor Idris Elba and his wife Sabrina Dhowre Elba are in Davos this week, urging attendees to support small scale farmers in the developing world. Last night, they were handed a WEF \u2018Crystal Award\u2019 in recogition of \u201ctheir leadership in addressing food security, climate change and environmental conservation\u201d. And they warned Davos delegates that people hit by food scarcity and climate change need more support. The couple, who are Goodwill Ambassadors for the United Nations\u2019 International Fund for Agricultural Development, urged businesses to continue investing in mitigating climate change, and to invest in small farms and the small and medium-sized businesses they support. Idris Elba argues that with greater access to finance, to markets, to resources, to technology, to knowledge and to people \u201cwe can define a different future.\u201d Elba told delegates: Let\u2019s be frank, it\u2019s taken decades for corporates, for governments to understand that for economies to be build to last we need to empoyer the youth, we need social equity, we need to protect our environment. He added: The poor of this world are not just looking for aid and handouts. They are looking for investment. Investment in people, in nature, in innovation, in partnership. Sabrina Dhowre Elba explained to reporters last night that her mother grew up in a rural community in Somalia. She is pushing for more support for small farmers, who she says produce 80% of the food in parts of Asia and Africa, and a third of the food on the planet. She explained: Small farmers are at the heart of the sustainable food systems. They are incredibly efficient. They are not a major source of greenhouse emissions and they do not depend heavily on fresh water for crops. They preserve biodiversity instead of depleting it. She warned delegates at the crystal awards ceremony that Somalia was on the brink of famine, and that millions of Yemeni children were acutely malnourished. Afghanistan, the Central African Repubic, DRC, Haiti, Sudan and South Sudan all face \u201dcatastrophic levels of hunger\u201d, she said. Sabrina Dhowre Elba pointed out: Hundreds of millions of people are being forced to flee their homes because of conflict, becuase of climate change, and in some cases both. And by attending WEF this week, she hopes to highlight those who are not being heard. We are here at Davos to highlight the people and countries who are not making the headlines as much as my husband. People\u2019s hopes for their financial futures suffered a \u201cmassive collapse\u201d worldwide over the past year, the latest annual survey from global communications firm Edelman has found. Edelman\u2019s 2023 Trust Barometer has found a year-over-year double-digit decline in the belief that their families will be better off in five years\u2019 time, in half the countries surveyed. In a sign of global pessimism over the state of the world, the report found: Further, not one developed nation has over 36% of its people confident that their family will be better off in five years, and 24 of the 28 countries surveyed dropped to all-time lows in optimism, including the US (36%), the UK (23%), Germany (15%) and Japan (9%). The report also found that business is the only global institution seen as competent and ethical. Business now holds \u201ca staggering \u201c53-point lead over government in competence and is 30 points ahead on ethics, Edelman reports. Edelman argues that \u201cTrust is the ultimate currency\u201d, with founder Richard Edelman insisting that businesses must continue to lead on societal issues. However, as writer Adam Lowenstein points out here, critics question whether the company follow its own advice about the importance of trust. Adam points out: The firm\u2019s clients have ranged from ExxonMobil to the Saudi government and members of the Sackler family, the former owners of the opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma. Good morning from Davos, where world leaders, business chiefs and policymakers are gathered for the World Economic Forum. Fears of a global downturn, the cost of living crisis, the threat of natural disasters and extreme weather events and the Ukraine war all loom over WEF. Two-thirds of chief economists surveyed by WEF believe there is likely to be a global recession in 2023, with nearly one in five saying it is extremely likely to occur. More than half expect inflation to be high in Europe this year, while there was unanimity that European growth will be weak in 2023. Over 90% of chief economists predicted economic growth in the United States would be weak. Corporate leaders are also anxious, with 73% of CEOs around the world believe global economic growth will decline over the next 12-months. That\u2019s the most pessimistic outlook since consultancy PwC started asking the question 12 years ago. Bob Moritz, global chairman, PwC, pointed out last night that many CEOs have not managed in an era of high interest rates, with inflation, macroeconomic volatility and geopolitical conflict all major concerns for bosses. Moritz says: A volatile economy, decades-high inflation, and geopolitical conflict have contributed to a level of CEO pessimism not seen in over a decade. But happily, CEOs are still looking to retain staff as the wrestle with a labour and skills shortages. The theme of this year\u2019s Annual Meeting is Cooperation in a Fragmented World, recognising the massive shifts since WEF\u2019s last January meeting in 2020 (2022\u2019s meeting took place in May). The European Commission\u2019s president, Ursula von der Leyen, will address Davos this morning, at 11.15am local time, and may touch on Europe\u2019s concerns over the US Inflation Reduction Act. Europe is worried that the IRA, a sweeping tax, health and climate bill, could breach trade rules by, for example, providing tax credits for electric cars made in North America. Von der Leyen will be followed by Chinese vice-premier Liu He, in his first appearance at the forum since 2018. The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, is scheduled to meet with Liu He in Switzerland tomorrow to discuss economic ties between the countries; a sign that Washington and Beijing are keen to improve ties. The agenda 8.30am Davos / 7.30am UK: Panel on Philanthropy: a catalyst for protecting our planet, with John F Kerry, special presidential envoy for climate of the United States of America; Mark Carney, United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance 8.30am Davos / 7.30am GMT: Mastering New Energy Economics session including Fatih Birol, executive director, International Energy Agency 11:15am Davos / 10.15am GMT: Special address by Ursula Von Der Leyen, president of the European Commission 11:45am Davos / 10.45am GMT: Special address by Liu He, vice-premier of China 1.15pm Davos / 12.15pm GMT: Media briefing: 2023 Explained: chief economist briefing on state of world economy, with Gilles Mo\u00ebc, chief economist, AXA; Raghuram G Rajan, Katherine Dusak Miller, distinguished service professor of finance, University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Nela Richardson, senior vice-president &amp; chief economist, automatic data processing 5.30pm Davos / 4.30pm GMT: A Conversation with Henry Kissinger: Historical Perspectives on War 6.45pm Davos / 5.45pm UK: Press conference with Mykhailo Fedorov, vice-prime minister of Ukraine"

            "content": "Nineteen people were killed and 20 injured in a road traffic accident in eastern China\u2019s Jiangxi province on Sunday, state media reported. The injured had been sent to the hospital, state broadcaster CCTV reported, citing local authorities. The accident took place just before 1am (1700 GMT) in Nanchang County, it reported, and the cause was \u201cunder in-depth investigation\u201d. Local news outlet Jimu, affiliated with the state-owned Hubei Daily Media Group, reported the accident took place when a truck hit a funeral procession. People had been carrying out a roadside offering to the dead before planning to head to the crematorium on Sunday morning, a local woman surnamed Deng told the outlet. They were hit by a truck, the report said, with most of the dead and injured being funeral attenders. Another local man, surnamed Gong, told the outlet his wife had been killed in the accident and that they had been attending the funeral. The truck had suddenly crashed into the back of the line, tearing through the group before finally reaching the hearse, he said. The accident occurred as China began the 40-day period of lunar new year travel, in which millions of people are expected to be on the move, and lifted Covid quarantine requirements for inbound travellers. This lunar new year public holiday, which officially runs from 21 January, will be the first since 2020 without domestic travel restrictions. About an hour after news of the road accident emerged, Nanchang County traffic police issued travel tips to drivers saying the area was experiencing \u201cfoggy weather\u201d. \u201cDriving visibility is poor, there is low visibility, which can easily cause traffic accidents,\u201d it said. \u201cPlease pay attention to fog lights \u2026 Slow down, drive carefully, keep a safe distance from the car in front, avoid pedestrians, do not change lanes and overtake,\u201d it added. Road accidents are common in China due to a lack of strict safety controls. Last month, one person died during a highway pile-up in central China that involved hundreds of vehicles and was caused by low visibility in fog. And in September, 27 passengers died after a bus transporting them to quarantine facilities in south-western Guizhou province flipped over on a motorway.

            "date": "2023-01-29T19:00:03Z",
            "content": "Young people have been \u201cdisastrously\u201d affected by the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, according to two pieces of research that show happiness and confidence has plunged to an all-time low. Both studies detail the wide-ranging ways in which young people continue to suffer. The hardships include poorer mental and physical health, as well as extensive learning loss that experts say will undoubtedly affect their futures. \u201cWhile many see the pandemic as being over, the after-effects are far from over for our country\u2019s youngsters, particularly those from less well-off households,\u201d said Sir Peter Lampl, the founder and chair of the Sutton Trust, which co-led one of the research projects with University College London that involved 13,000 respondents. \u201cIt\u2019s abundantly clear that the pandemic is continuing to deeply affect the lives of young people,\u201d he added. The findings echo the concerns expressed in the second part of the Guardian\u2019s the Covid generation series, published on Sunday, in which young people analyse how the pandemic is still affecting their lives and their plans for the future 18 months on from the end of the third national lockdown. Jonathan Townsend, the UK chief executive of the Prince\u2019s Trust, which spoke to 2,025 young people aged 16 to 25, said: \u201cThe pandemic is still having a debilitating impact on young people\u2019s plans, confidence and hopes for a positive future. \u201cThe significant disruption to their education during this period has left these young people worried about their skills and qualifications, and lacking confidence in their ability to secure a job or achieve their future career goals.\u201d Its research found that almost half of the young people questioned felt hopeless about the future. It was the lowest outcome in the 14 years the trust has been running its NatWest youth index, including in its launch during the global financial crisis. Half of the young people questioned said they were worried they had been left with permanent knowledge and skill gaps that would prevent them from getting jobs in the future. The trust\u2019s research echoes data from the Covid Social Mobility and Opportunities (Cosmo) study by the Sutton Trust and UCL. The Cosmo study found that almost half of young people said they had not caught up with learning they had missed during the pandemic, ranging from 43% of those who had not had Covid to 59% who had long Covid. Almost one in five young people, including those who had not been infected, said their GCSE grades were worse than they expected, rising to one-third of those who had long Covid. The pandemic sapped young people of their motivation to study, the research found, with half of those who had not had Covid saying they felt less motivated, rising to 57% of those with long Covid. Concern for the future was acute, with 40% of those questioned saying the pandemic had left them unprepared to take their next steps in education and training. This figure was higher for those who had had severe long Covid, with half saying they felt unprepared. As a result of the learning and confidence they had lost because of the pandemic, two-thirds of those questioned in the Cosmo survey said they had changed their education and career plans for the future. This finding was echoed by the Prince\u2019s Trust research, which found that more than a quarter of respondents from poorer backgrounds were planning to finish their education early so they could start earning money, compared with 15% of young people overall. Olly Parker, the head of external affairs at the charity YoungMinds, said the research was a \u201cshocking yet sadly familiar snapshot of how the pandemic has fundamentally altered the lives of so many young people and questioned their hopes and confidence in the future\u201d. Ndidi Okezie, the chief executive of the charity UK Youth, agreed. \u201cToday\u2019s young people are facing a series of immense challenges that cannot be underestimated,\u201d she said. \u201cThe lingering effects of the pandemic and the cost of living crisis are having a profound impact on young people\u2019s education, mental wellbeing, their financial security and indeed their confidence in the future.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-19T11:00:07Z",
            "content": "In Tim Parks\u2019s essay Why Finish Books? he admits to abandoning reading novels halfway through, eager to start something new. \u201cMight it be,\u201d he asks, \u201cthat, in showing a willingness not to pursue even an excellent book to the death, you are actually doing the writer a favour, exonerating him or her from the near-impossible task of getting out of the plot gracefully?\u201d It\u2019s tempting to obey this impulse reading Parks\u2019s new novel, the story of 75-year-old Frank Marriot\u2019s incarceration in a Milan hotel as Covid sends Italy into its first lockdown. Though the prose is as smooth as the cabernet Frank sips, dining alone while the world disintegrates around him, one can\u2019t see how the dramatic situation can be resolved without resorting to inelegant contrivances or a crashing deus ex machina. After all, when it comes to Covid, one has the benefit of three harrowing years of hindsight. A veteran journalist and founder of the slightly opaque Institute of Plain Speech, Frank flies from London to Milan for the funeral of his old friend and love rival, renowned literary editor Dan Sandow. This \u201cElder Statesman of American Intelligentsia\u201d seems loosely based on both the late Robert B Silvers, editor of the New York Review of Books, and George Plimpton, founder of the Paris Review. A man of prodigious appetites, Sandow slept with Frank\u2019s ex-wife, Connie, the mother of his son. Frank hopes keenly for rapprochement with her at the funeral. When this doesn\u2019t occur, he finds the vivifying throb of a northern Italian city compensation enough. Complacent and self-regarding, Frank lounges in his five-star hotel room, watching opera and sipping Veuve Clicquot, musing on Arthurian legends and the ageing process. But his equilibrium is short-lived when he realises he\u2019s landed in the epicentre of viral transmission. Very quickly, all flights out of Lombardy are cancelled. The hotel is reduced to a skeleton staff, with restricted access to the outside world; the hospitals are overflowing. Frank\u2019s room becomes his \u201cluxury cell\u201d. Parks is excellent on the terror of these first days, with their ominous sirens and desolate streets. Initially a news refusenik, Frank finds himself glued to CNN, forced like everyone to learn the new jargon. \u201cAsymptomatic. Super spreader.\u201d However, apart from experiencing a single wave of panic, Frank seems relatively unperturbed. He embodies the sadly familiar libertarian stance that sees face masks as a form of \u201ccontrol\u201d. Given the circumstances, this seems suicidal. It\u2019s at this point in the narrative that we feel Parks won\u2019t, to use his own phrase, get out of his plot gracefully: Frank\u2019s head-in-the-sand hubris seems bound to lead to his downfall. Yet it\u2019s here that the novel veers off into much more interesting territory. A mysterious thumping on the roof is revealed to be caused by an Egyptian family, holed up illegally: a mother, her young son and a father-in-law critically ill with Covid. For the first time, Frank faces a real moral dilemma. Can he transcend a lifelong habit of self-interest and come to their aid? And how much will it cost him if he does? Moreover, might these migrants have something to teach him about living? \u201cWho could tell what experiences such people were coming from? What journeys they had made.\u201d The answer to these urgent questions, and Frank\u2019s seemingly impossible predicament once he moves the family into his room, grip the reader to the final page. Surprised by the urge to do \u201csomething noble\u201d, he wonders if he has ever done anything serious in his life. The shade of Dan Sandow visits him in a dream, intoning, like Marley\u2019s ghost: \u201cThe world is changing, Frank, and you must change with it.\u201d Despite these novelistic strengths, it\u2019s hard to assess how we are to respond to Frank, who thinks and speaks a little too frankly \u2013 or plainly, as his institute would have it. Frank is the type of entitled male narrator long absent from contemporary fiction, complete with uninhibited male gaze. Are we to find pathos or offence in a septuagenarian noticing a fellow guest\u2019s \u201ccoltish\u201d legs? Is Frank\u2019s late-life altruism merely white saviour syndrome? How much of this is satire? Yet Frank\u2019s slow education in the world\u2019s interconnectedness more than makes up for any authorial fence-sitting. The book\u2019s message, in its quietly devastating final scene, is, to quote Larkin, that we should be kind to each other while there\u2019s still time. While recent pandemic novels such as Sarah Hall\u2019s Burntcoat and Sarah Moss\u2019s The Fell gave us the claustrophobia and forced intimacy of the pandemic, Hotel Milano comes closest to evoking what it was really like to watch the world be redrawn in real time. \u2022 Jude Cook\u2019s latest novel is Jacob\u2019s Advice. Hotel Milano by Tim Parks is published by Harvill Secker (\u00a318.99). To support the Guardian and the Observer buy a copy at guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply."

            "date": "2023-01-22T06:00:29Z",
            "content": "The Big Issue narrowly avoided going bust during the pandemic, its founder has said, as sales continue to be hit by the cost of living crisis. For the first time in the magazine\u2019s over 30-year history, Covid meant that people who are homeless or long-term unemployed were not able to sell it on the streets, and its leadership had to rapidly rethink the model of the social business. John Bird, who is also editor-in-chief of the magazine and a crossbench peer in the House of Lords, said the magazine has had to undergo \u201cenormous transformation\u201d in recent years to survive. \u201cWe almost went out of business,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cWe had to do things like get subscriptions from people, and we had to raise money and use every means possible to support our vendors.\u201d He added: \u201cWe were a social business that went through the crisis but we had to be businesslike with it, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re telling everybody to take a subscription at this time of the year because half the money still goes to supporting the vendors.\u201d As well as starting subscriptions, the Big Issue Group provided sellers with direct financial support, supermarket vouchers and PPE, brought in more card readers so sellers could go cashless and started a subsidy scheme to increase sellers\u2019 earnings from magazines. Now sales are being further affected by the cost of living crisis as millions across the UK struggle to afford essentials. \u201cWe\u2019re having to look at the fact that many of our vendors are having problems and they need support and help, and we\u2019re doing our best to do that,\u201d Bird said. \u201cGetting people to subscribe and buy the paper is a great way of doing that.\u201d Bird, who experienced homelessness as a child, said the convergence of Brexit, Covid and war in Ukraine, as well as last year\u2019s Conservative leadership crisis, had led to \u201ca kind of shitstorm all coming together\u201d. The situation, he said, reminds him of the \u201cseries of storms that engulfed Britain in the 70s\u201d. \u201cBut the difference now is they\u2019re coming together all at once,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd there is not anybody who\u2019s out there to rescue us.\u201d Calling for consensus in British politics, Bird said the UK was in a \u201cwar situation\u201d as a result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which is hitting the poor of the UK, Europe and the US. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any kind of grownup thinking, and that\u2019s what is my biggest concern.\u201d He called for the government to take action to stop households who cannot pay their rent from being evicted, warning of a surge in homelessness. The number of homeless households is expected to rise to 300,000 a night this year, the charity Crisis predicts, a 32% rise on 2020. As well as providing more financial support to people struggling to pay for food and energy, the government should be assisting landlords financially to avoid rent rises and cut evictions, said Bird. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I am not concerned about people who can\u2019t feed themselves or heat themselves, but the worst possible thing to add to that is if hundreds of thousands of people are made homeless \u2026 then it completely goes off the Richter scale,\u201d he said. \u2022 The headline and subheading of this article were amended on 24 January 2023. An earlier version suggested Lord Bird had said the Big Issue was \u201cstruggling to stay afloat\u201d; as the article made clear, he explained how the group almost folded during the Covid pandemic but had recovered; the struggle now was for vendors to sell copies of the magazine amid the cost of living crisis."

            "date": "2023-01-13T17:30:45Z",
            "content": "Headteachers and school leaders are becoming increasingly worried that a \u201ccultural shift\u201d in attitudes is causing a crisis in attendance, with more pupils absent than before the Covid pandemic. Teachers say parents are now more reluctant to send children to school and more resistant to efforts to encourage attendance, with school leaders in England warning it may take years to repair national attendance figures. Specialists who spoke to the Guardian said fears around illness had been heightened since the pandemic, and are being driven by worsening support for mental health as well as the strain experienced by the NHS and the cost of living crisis. Their fears are supported by figures from the Department for Education (DfE) showing a sustained increase in authorised and unauthorised absences in state schools across England. Secondary schools appear worst affected, with pupils missing more than 9% of classroom time in the first term of the latest academic year, compared with an average of about 5.4% in the five years between 2014 and 2019. While illnesses accounted for a steep rise in children staying away during December, when many parents were concerned about strep A and scarlet fever outbreaks, the rate of unauthorised absences reported also rose by 70%. Sheila Mouna, the headteacher at St Anne\u2019s and Guardian Angels Catholic primary school in east London, said while parents had become more anxious about their children going to school, others were more willing to let them stay home since the pandemic. \u201cI think there\u2019s been a cultural shift with people working at home, and some people \u2013 not all \u2013 seem to think their kids did OK at home, so things like that have become ingrained in some parents\u2019 mind. \u201cBut children need to be out and about, to be with their friends and learn to socialise. It\u2019s not just academic,\u201d Mouna said. Stuart Lock, the chief executive of the Advantage Schools academy trust in Bedfordshire, said pupil attendance was a matter of concern for all school leaders. \u201cI thought it was a blip. I now think that this is an established crisis that is going to get worse and take years to solve,\u201d Lock said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019ll fix this \u2013 it feels like there has been a shift, and it isn\u2019t dissimilar to the early 2000s when it was very hard to get a significant number of pupils to attend school regularly.\u201d Lock said the DfE was aware of the national problem and was looking at policies to improve attendance, but added: \u201cI think this is going to be a big challenge for all of us this year.\u201d Stephen Aravena, the attendance and welfare adviser at St Anne\u2019s, said there were pupils who normally have \u201cvery good\u201d attendance who were now spending days out of school, with the mental health and resilience of parents as well as children under strain. \u201cThe landscape has changed. Pressures like the cost of living, all these things are impacting on families, so that\u2019s brought a whole range of new problems that we need to deal with. We need to find new ways of responding to that,\u201d Aravena said. MPs on parliament\u2019s education select committee are to hold an inquiry next month into the growing rates of persistent absence, questioning education leaders on possible causes including economic disadvantage as well as Covid. Robin Walker, the Conservative MP who chairs the education committee, said: \u201cMissing school can seriously undermine a child\u2019s education and future life chances. It is imperative that we take a nuanced and sympathetic look at the reasons why absence has become a growing problem.\u201d Stephen Morgan, the shadow schools minister, said the absence rates \u201cshould set alarm bells ringing\u201d. \u201cThe failures of the government\u2019s Covid recovery scheme, plummeting pupil wellbeing and the growing epidemic of mental ill health in our schools is driving non-attendance, which will lead to lower attainment and lower life chances for children and young people,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2023-01-12T07:00:06Z",
            "content": "Multiple waves of avian influenza have left a trail of devastation across the globe, leading to the deaths and culling of more than 300 million chickens, ducks and geese and an unknown number of wild birds between 2005 and 2021. Today, with parts of Europe and North America in the midst of the worst outbreak on record, a global cohort of researchers is keeping cautious watch amid concerns about the impact the disease could have on humans. \u201cThere is concern about it having pandemic potential,\u201d says Wendy Blay Puryear, a molecular virologist at Tufts University. \u201cBefore Covid was on anybody\u2019s radar, this was the one that we were all watching very closely.\u201d The virus is currently considered a low risk to humans, she says. \u201cBut anything that has the ability to replicate and evolve rapidly, and anything that has that ability to infect a lot of different hosts is kind of on borrowed time.\u201d Much of the focus of experts is on H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza that has fuelled, in part, the surge in cases around the world. First identified at a goose farm in Guangdong, China in 1996, the virus has turned up in at least 63 species of wild birds and has shown itself capable of infecting mammals such as bobcats, harbour seals and bears. The more the virus spreads, the greater the chances are that it may spill over into humans, says Thijs Kuiken, a professor in the department of viroscience at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam. Once the virus infects humans, the concern is that it could further adapt to allow human-to-human transmission. \u201cThe chance of this happening is very small, but the impact \u2013 if it does happen \u2013 is very big, because it means that we then have a new influenza pandemic,\u201d he says, pointing to the 1918 flu, believed to have killed as many as 50 million people, as an example of a pandemic that has been linked to an avian influenza and originating in birds. As H5N1 crisscrosses the globe, its impact on humans has set off alarms; between 2003 and October 2022, the virus turned up in 865 humans in 21 countries, resulting in 456 deaths. While the cases \u2013 most of them in Africa and Asia \u2013 were linked to the handling of infected live poultry rather than human-to-human transmission, the figures suggest the virus \u201chas a high case fatality rate in people who become infected\u201d, says Kuiken. Public health officials are taking few chances. In the UK, where a duck breeder tested positive for the virus in late 2021 after handling infected poultry, the Health Security Agency has been working to develop an \u201coff the shelf exercise\u201d to prepare for an outbreak of avian flu among humans, the UKHSA told the Guardian in an email. In the Canadian province of British Columbia, public health officials recently warned doctors to watch out for avian flu infections among patients, after a spike in cases among poultry at local farms. The virus would probably require more than one or two changes to enable human-to-human transmission, says Ian Barr, the deputy director of the WHO\u2019s Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne. \u201cWe never really know with these viruses \u2026 but they\u2019ve been with us for 18 years in various forms and they haven\u2019t yet gained that function of being easily transmissible to man,\u201d says Barr. \u201cSo, hopefully the virus finds that a difficult thing to do, but it\u2019s something which we\u2019re not entirely knowledgable about.\u201d He described it as a game of numbers. \u201cThe more viruses that are out there, the more species that they infect, the longer they hang around for, then the more chance there is for something to mutate or go awry or reassort with an unwanted consequence.\u201d Efforts to halt the spread of this strain of virus have been complicated by its prevalence in wild birds, says Rebecca Poulson of the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Georgia. \u201cWe know birds move incredibly long distances,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if these birds are infected and are shedding these viruses as they move across the landscape, they can disseminate it quite far and wide in a really short amount of time.\u201d The presence of the virus in wild birds and farmed poultry has allowed it to ping-pong between populations and amplify its spread, says Nichola J Hill, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts in Boston. \u201cI think we used to cling to this idea that we can control the virus in poultry, we\u2019re set, no problem,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re facing a new era because if it has become established in wild birds, that\u2019s a far more complex situation in terms of figuring out how to control it and predict where it will go next.\u201d What is clear, however, is the role our food system has played in getting us to this point, she says, citing the high densities of poultry seen in commercial farming and the genetic similarity of most of the animals. \u201cAll of these amount to a situation which is ripe for the virus to get a foothold and then evolve towards virulence.\u201d"

As well as being unethical and offensive, his comments are potentially harmful to public health and public trust in vaccines. It is well established that Covid vaccines are safe and effective, and that the vast benefits outweigh any small potential risks. Many of Mr Bridgen\u2019s tweets on Covid vaccines, including the one that resulted in him losing the whip, cite spurious sources, including far-right libertarian blogs and discredited scientists infamous for espousing misinformation. It is concerning that such misinformation is being amplified by a sitting MP, and all parties should work together to ensure that such misinformation is not held, or spread, more widely by others. Public health still depends upon high booster uptake of Covid and flu vaccines in the future, and so we can ill afford to be complacent; the fewer anti-vax messages from people in positions of power the better.

            "content": "Trials of personalised cancer vaccines in England are to be speeded up after a government deal with a firm behind one of the major Covid jabs. The UK health secretary, Steve Barclay, is to sign a memorandum of understanding with BioNTech on Friday to \u201censure the best possible treatments are available as soon as possible\u201d for cancer. The agreement means cancer patients in England will get early access to trials exploring mRNA therapies, such as cancer vaccines, possibly from as early as autumn. MRNA treatments are tailor-made for the individual and provide immune systems with genetic code from the specific cancer so it can attack only the tumour, whereas chemotherapy targets lots of different cells as well as the cancer. BioNTech worked with Pfizer to develop the widely used mRNA vaccination against Covid, and its partnership with the UK government could deliver 10,000 doses of personalised therapies to UK patients by 2030 through a new research and development hub. Barclay said: \u201cOnce cancer is detected, we need to ensure the best possible treatments are available as soon as possible, including for breast, lung and pancreatic cancer. \u201cBioNTech helped lead the world on a Covid-19 vaccine and they share our commitment to scientific advancement, innovation and cutting-edge scientific technology, making them perfect partners for a deal to work together on cancer vaccines.\u201d He added: \u201cThis partnership will mean that, from as early as September, our patients will be among the first to participate in trials and tests to provide targeted, personalised and precision treatments using transformative new therapies to both treat the existing cancer and help stop it returning.\u201d Prof U\u011fur \u015eahin, the chief executive and co-founder of BioNTech, said: \u201cThe UK successfully delivered Covid-19 vaccines so quickly because the National Health Service, academia, the regulator and the private sector worked together in an exemplary way. \u201cThis agreement is a result of the lessons learned from the Covid-19 pandemic. Drug development can be accelerated without cutting corners if everyone works seamlessly together towards the same goal. Today\u2019s agreement shows we are committed to do the same for cancer patients.\u201d \u015eahin added: \u201cOur goal is to accelerate the development of immunotherapies and vaccines using technologies we have been researching for over 20 years. The collaboration will cover various cancer types and infectious diseases affecting collectively hundreds of millions of people worldwide. \u201cIf successful, this collaboration has the potential to improve outcomes for patients and provide early access to our suite of cancer immunotherapies as well as to innovative vaccines against infectious diseases \u2013 in the UK and worldwide.\u201d"

            "content": "The world\u2019s first vaccine for honeybees has been approved for use by the US government, raising hopes of a new weapon against diseases that routinely ravage colonies that are relied upon for food pollination. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has granted a conditional license for a vaccine created by Dalan Animal Health, a US biotech company, to help protect honeybees from American foulbrood disease. \u201cOur vaccine is a breakthrough in protecting honeybees,\u201d said Annette Kleiser, chief executive of Dalan Animal Health. \u201cWe are ready to change how we care for insects, impacting food production on a global scale.\u201d The vaccine, which will initially be available to commercial beekeepers, aims to curb foulbrood, a serious disease caused by the bacterium Paenibacillus larvae that can weaken and kill hives. There is currently no cure for the disease, which in parts of the US has been found in a quarter of hives, requiring beekeepers to destroy and burn any infected colonies and administer antibiotics to prevent further spread. \u201cIt\u2019s something that beekeepers can easily recognize because it reduces the larvae to this brown goo that has a rancid stink to it,\u201d said Keith Delaplane, an entomologist at the University of Georgia, which has partnered with Dalan for the vaccine\u2019s development. The vaccine works by incorporating some of the bacteria into the royal jelly fed by worker bees to the queen, which then ingests it and gains some of the vaccine in the ovaries. The developing bee larvae then have immunity to foulbrood as they hatch, with studies by Dalan suggesting this will reduce death rates from the disease. \u201cIn a perfect scenario, the queens could be fed a cocktail within a queen candy \u2013 the soft, pasty sugar that queen bees eat while in transit,\u201d Delaplane said. \u201cQueen breeders could advertise \u2018fully vaccinated queens.\u2019\u201d American foulbrood originated in the US, and has since spread around the world. Dalan said the breakthrough could be used to find vaccines for other bee-related diseases, such as the European version of foulbrood. As they have been commercialized, transported and pressed into agricultural service, honeybees have been exposed to a cocktail of different diseases that typically lay waste to large numbers of colonies and require major interventions by beekeepers to keep numbers up. The US is unusually dependent upon managed honeybee colonies to prop up its food pollination, with hives routinely trucked across the country to propagate everything from almonds to blueberries. This is because many wild bee species are in alarming decline, due to habitat loss, pesticide use and the climate crisis, fueling concerns around a global crisis in insect numbers that threatens ecosystems and human food security and health. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 January 2023 to say American foulbrood has spread worldwide. An earlier version stated it was found only in the US and Canada."

            "content": "The Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen has lost the party whip, probably permanently, after he provoked widespread fury among colleagues and elsewhere by comparing the use of Covid vaccines to the Holocaust. The tweet from the North West Leicestershire backbencher came after weeks of him sending increasingly anti-vaccine social media posts, as well as messages to journalists, many of which openly backed conspiracy theories. The message on Wednesday morning linked to an article from Zero Hedge, a libertarian and conspiracy theory website, which purported to show the health risks from Covid vaccines. Bridgen wrote: \u201cAs one consultant cardiologist said to me this is the biggest crime against humanity since the holocaust.\u201d The message brought immediate outrage and calls for Bridgen, an MP since 2010, to be stripped of the Conservative whip, with Labour questioning why this had not been done before, given his views on vaccines. About two hours after Bridgen\u2019s tweet, which was subsequently deleted, Simon Hart, the Conservative chief whip, announced that he would lose the whip. \u201cAndrew Bridgen has crossed a line, causing great offence in the process,\u201d Hart said. \u201cAs a nation we should be very proud of what has been achieved through the vaccine programme. \u201cThe vaccine is the best defence against Covid that we have. Misinformation about the vaccine causes harm and costs lives. I am therefore removing the whip from Andrew Bridgen with immediate effect, pending a formal investigation.\u201d On Wednesday, anti-vaccine protesters at Westminster tube station held up a sign they had also displayed earlier in the week saying: \u201cThank you Andrew Bridgen.\u201d Karen Pollock, the chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said Bridgen\u2019s tweet was \u201chighly irresponsible, wholly inappropriate and an elected politician should know better\u201d. Anneliese Dodds, the Labour chair, said: \u201cAndrew Bridgen has been spreading dangerous misinformation on Covid vaccines for some time now. He could have been disciplined weeks ago. \u201cTo invoke the Holocaust, as he did today, is utterly shameful, but it should never have reached this point.\u201d Andrew Percy, a Conservative MP who is vice-chair of the all-party group against antisemitism, called the comment \u201cdisgusting\u201d. Asked by Times Radio if Bridgen should be allowed to stand again, Percy said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody who believes this kind of crap should, but that\u2019s a matter for the whips not for me.\u201d John Mann, the former Labour MP who is now a non-affiliated peer and the government\u2019s independent adviser on antisemitism, said Bridgen should not be a Tory candidate again. \u201cThere is no possibility that Bridgen can be allowed to stand at the next election,\u201d he said. \u201cHe cannot claim that he didn\u2019t realise the level of offence that his remarks cause.\u201d Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrat health spokesperson, said: \u201cThis is truly revolting. \u201cThis is dangerous misinformation that should not be spouted by a member of parliament. Wild conspiracy theories and incredibly offensive comparisons to the Holocaust have no place in British society, let alone parliament. Andrew Bridgen must apologise for this disgusting remark.\u201d A long-term Brexit supporter on the right of the party, Bridgen is known as a serial rebel, having submitted letters of no confidence in David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson \u2013 twice in the case of Johnson \u2013 and Liz Truss. His loss of the whip means there are now 15 \u201cindependent\u201d MPs in the Commons who have lost their respective parties\u2019 whip, one more than the number of Liberal Democrat MPs. Six are former Tories, seven were Labour, and one each from the SNP and Plaid Cymru. If Bridgen does not regain the whip he would be very likely to lose his seat. He would have to stand as an independent, and the constituency, while formerly held by Labour, had a 20,000-plus Conservative majority in the 2019 election. Bridgen is already serving a five-day suspension from the Commons over a separate issue. He was found to have breached rules on paid lobbying and declaring interests. A cross-party committee found Bridgen had repeatedly broken the MPs\u2019 code of conduct. The committee endorsed findings from Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards. Bridgen was unsuccessful in an attempt to overturn the recommendation in December and parliament approved a motion on Monday. Bridgen was contacted for comment."

Bridgen was widely condemned for making the comments, by MPs and campaigners from all parties. The MP for North West Leicestershire threatened to take legal action against Hancock if he did not publicly apologise within three days. He said in a tweet posted on 13 January that Hancock had \u201cstill not removed his defamatory tweet falsely alleging that I am antisemitic. I will allow Matt three days to apologise publicly for calling me an antisemite and racist or he will be contacted by my legal team.\u201d He tweeted on Thursday: \u201cI can confirm that Matt Hancock had a legal letter before action from Bad Law team on my behalf regarding defamation on Monday.\u201d The legal action is being supported by the Reclaim party and the Bad Law Project. The project, which is linked to the Reclaim party leader, Laurence Fox, claims to oppose \u201cpolitical ideology disguised as law\u201d.

But that was nothing compared to what he was like when he turned 16. A relationship breakdown saw him become suicidal. He stopped wanting to interact with anyone, to the point that he would react badly if I even asked him about his day. His school knew he was very depressed and advised him to phone the GP. That was the first kick in the teeth for him. The GP in effect said \u201chere are some leaflets and some helplines\u201d. He felt even more alone then since he\u2019d sought help and basically been turned away. At one point he went missing. I then realised that he had begun to express suicidal thoughts, and when he disappeared he had left very worrying messages with a few people about how he intended to slit his throat. The day he disappeared I got a message to say that he hadn\u2019t turned up at school. He wouldn\u2019t answer the phone to me or anyone else. He\u2019d gone off with his girlfriend and neither would say where they were. I was so worried because he\u2019d taken a knife from our kitchen. I spent the morning looking all round the town for him. After two hours, the police found him hiding behind the boundary fence of our local cricket ground. He was in a bad way and the police kindly drove us both to A&amp;E. He did have an assessment with someone from the child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) team. However, the A&amp;E doctor made clear that there was nothing more the hospital could do for my son that day and that we should go home. He had had a Camhs assessment and that service would be in touch. They wouldn\u2019t tell me what was making him so distressed, because he had asked them not to. That meant I had no real guidance about how to keep my child safe at home. They did say that I should lock away all the knives, as he had taken a knife before, and the very strong pain medicine I take. When we went to A&amp;E I hoped he would be admitted because I felt that I couldn\u2019t make him better and that I was unprepared and inadequate. I felt very alone. I was out of my depth and petrified that I was going to lose my child. I just wanted someone to take him off me and look after him and make him better. I was very confused when the A&amp;E doctor said we had to go home. I assumed they would keep my son in, given how distressed and vulnerable he was. I just thought: what state do you need to be in to be kept in? I was in a complete state of shock. I still have no idea what state you would need to be in to actually be admitted, because my son was in a very bad state and admission wasn\u2019t even discussed. It wasn\u2019t a \u201cshall we, shan\u2019t we\u201d thing, it was just \u201cgo home\u201d. I think that young people having a mental health crisis are just dismissed. I\u2019ve spoken to other parents and the story is the same. Young people can have eating disorders, they can have clear plans for suicide, and Camhs will say they aren\u2019t severe enough for inpatient care. It leaves me with no faith that a young person who presents at a GP surgery or A&amp;E will get the help they need. Camhs were eventually very good for my son. They did everything they were meant to do. But it all came too late. He is coping really well now. He has a girlfriend and is more aware of his mental health. I just hope that we never have to go through a crisis like that again. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "date": "2023-01-17T06:00:06Z",
            "content": "Visits to parks, community gardens and other urban green spaces may lower city dwellers\u2019 use of drugs for anxiety, insomnia, depression, high blood pressure, and asthma, research has found. Researchers in Finland found that visiting such areas three to four times a week cuts people\u2019s chances of turning to drugs for mental health problems or high blood pressure by a third, and for asthma by about a quarter. Moreover, the positive effects of visiting green spaces were stronger among those reporting the lowest annual household income, the researchers found. The findings correlate with a growing body of evidence that a lack of access to green spaces is linked to a range of health problems. Access tends to be unequal, with poorer communities having fewer opportunities to be in nature. To investigate the link, researchers from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare drew on the responses of 16,000 randomly selected residents of Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa \u2013 three cities that make up the largest urban area in Finland \u2013 to the Helsinki capital region environmental health survey in 2015-16. The survey gathered information on how city dwellers aged at least 25 experienced residential green and blue spaces within a 1km (0.62-mile) radius of their homes. Green areas included forests, gardens, parks, castle parks, cemeteries, zoos, natural grasslands, moors and wetlands; and blue areas included sea, lakes, and rivers. Respondents were asked to report their use of prescribed drugs for anxiety, insomnia and depression, and for high blood pressure and asthma. They were then asked how often they spent time or exercised outdoors in green spaces, during May and September, with options ranging from never to five or more times a week. The researchers chose prescription drugs as a proxy for ill health. They picked those for anxiety, insomnia and depression, and high blood pressure and asthma in particular because they are used to treat common but potentially serious health issues. They found a strong correlation between visits to green spaces and lower odds of using such drugs. Compared with less than one weekly visit, visiting three to four times weekly was associated with 33% lower odds of using mental health drugs, 36% lower odds of using blood pressure drugs, and 26% lower odds of using asthma drugs. Curiously, however, those who visited green spaces at least five times a week were only 22% less likely to be using mental health drugs, and 24% less likely to be using asthma medications. Increased frequency did however correlate to lower odds of needing blood pressure drugs, with 41% lower probability than someone visiting less than once a week. \u201cMounting scientific evidence supporting the health benefits of nature exposure is likely to increase the supply of high-quality green spaces in urban environments and promote their active use,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cThis might be one way to improve health and welfare in cities.\u201d Their research is published online in the journal Occupational &amp; Environmental Medicine."

            "content": "At her lowest point, Karen Arthur came within a hair\u2019s breadth of killing herself. Having been signed off from her teaching job with anxiety, which she had not then connected with going through the menopause, the 51-year-old had booked a few days away from home to try to clear her head. A long walk in the country brought her to a spot notorious for suicide attempts. At that stage, she says, she had not considered how she might kill herself, but she had put her affairs in order for her two daughters, who were away at university. \u201cI did think it would be easier if I wasn\u2019t here. The kids would get the house, the mortgage paid off.\u201d This moment, she says, was her turning point. \u201cI remember thinking how desperate you have to be \u2026 And thinking very lucidly: \u2018I don\u2019t want to die, I don\u2019t want to kill myself, that\u2019s too real for me.\u2019\u201d Instead, she walked to the nearest pub, ordered chips and a hot chocolate with rum. Then \u201cI took my journal out and decided that I wanted to live. I started to write about the things I wanted to do. That was the lowest point but also the highest point \u2013 it brought me back from the brink.\u201d Arthur quit teaching, started therapy, embarked on a new career in fashion design, and six years later \u2013 in the emotionally charged aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder, amid the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement \u2013 created the positive ageing podcast Menopause Whilst Black, after finding woefully few resources catering specifically for black women. Research suggests they enter menopause earlier on average than white women, and are more likely to experience some symptoms, including depression. When she first saw her GP about her anxiety, she mentioned she was having hot flushes, but, she says, she wasn\u2019t offered hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and, at the time, thought being menopausal was the least of her worries. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that anxiety and depression could be linked to menopause. Everything I know about my journey, I know in retrospect.\u201d Midlife mood swings, rage and forgetfulness may be the stuff of jokey Instagram memes. But, as Arthur found out, for many women in perimenopause (the transition stage leading up to periods stopping) and menopause (defined as having gone a year without a period), they are anything but funny. A survey of 2,000 women commissioned by the House of Commons women and equalities select committee inquiry into menopause at work last year found 75% reported problems with memory or concentration and 69% reported feeling anxious or depressed \u2013 not necessarily to clinical levels, but often enough to reduce concentration and confidence at work. And in rarer cases, those mood swings can be extreme. Last month, the actor Kathy Burke told the Observer that she had experienced \u201cpretty dark, suicidal thoughts\u201d in her early 50s, which she linked to menopause. Unable to take HRT because of other medication she was on, Burke said she had struggled for years. Meg Mathews, the menopause campaigner and former wife of Oasis star Noel Gallagher, has similarly described such anxiety in her late 40s: \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave the house for three months.\u201d Yet mental health in menopause remains surprisingly ill-explored, the waters muddied by the way it coincides with what is often a time of wider upheaval in women\u2019s lives. These are the emotionally turbulent years of children leaving home, elderly parents getting sick, midlife divorces and transitions at work that can make it harder to disentangle cause from effect. Do you feel mentally unwell because your life is in flux? Or is your life in flux, at least partly, because your hormones are? Dr Louise Newson, a GP and menopause specialist, has recently worked with the Royal College of Psychiatrists to train its members on the mental health implications of menopause. Most of the patients she sees at her private clinic in Stratford-upon-Avon cite mental as well as physical menopause symptoms and many, she says, are desperate; some have tried everything from electric shock therapy to spending thousands of pounds on experimental treatments. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen people who have been on ketamine, clinics that have been giving ketamine \u2013 that really scares me,\u201d she says. (Ketamine is a licensed anaesthetic, sometimes used illegally as a party drug and sometimes prescribed \u201coff-label\u201d to treat depression.) \u201cWe see a lot of women who are suicidal.\u201d Research into mental health during menopause is still \u201cnot as good as you would want,\u201d Newson says, but it is now well established that the hormones oestrogen and testosterone, which decline in midlife, play important roles in brain function. \u201cWe know that anxiety and memory problems, low mood and reduced motivation are very common in menopause. Whether it\u2019s the actual level of hormones or fluctuations of hormones \u2013 anything that\u2019s changing in the brain has a knock-on effect.\u201d She says women who have previously had episodes of depression \u2013 as Burke had \u2013 or postnatal depression may be at particular risk of deteriorating mental health in menopause; so might women who suffered severe premenstrual syndrome or its more intense cousin premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) around the time of their periods. Not all mental health problems in middle-aged women are hormone-related, Newson stresses, and HRT isn\u2019t a magic cure for everyone. \u201cOften I will optimise hormones and then see what the patient\u2019s mental health is doing. Some women do need antidepressants.\u201d But the link between menopause and depression is now sufficiently recognised that the NHS prescribing watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, recommends HRT as a first line of treatment for low mood or anxiety in menopausal women. Yet still, Newson says, she sees women who have been sent away by GPs with nothing but antidepressants. One reason she created Balance, her free app which helps women recognise and log menopause symptoms, is to help doctors and patients to join the dots. \u201cFor so long we have been told that menopause is about hot flushes and vaginal dryness. We haven\u2019t been told it can affect your mood or energy or concentration,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen get told to put up and shut up the whole time.\u201d That resonates with Kate Duffy, who was a 44-year-old single mother of children aged four and two when she went to her GP complaining of anxiety, insomnia and severe mood swings along with more puzzling physical symptoms, including hair loss. Her doctor diagnosed depression, but Duffy was convinced it was more complicated. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m not depressed, but I think it\u2019s related to menopause\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI kept going back and saying that, but they wouldn\u2019t listen. I was banging my head on a brick wall for a year, it was so frustrating. I\u2019d be Googling and there would be lots of women like me, up in the middle of the night trying to find out what was wrong with them, saying: \u2018My marriage is over, I can\u2019t do the job I\u2019ve done for 30 years, I can\u2019t think straight, I feel suicidal \u2026\u2019\u201d It was only after her first hot flush, she says, that the GP \u2013 who had thought her too young to be perimenopausal \u2013 ordered the blood tests that confirmed her hunch. Even then, says Duffy, she had to fight for HRT; and only when another woman tipped her off about a specialist menopause clinic in her home city of Oxford was she diagnosed retrospectively with PMDD, explaining a long previous history of severe mood swings around her periods. \u201cIt made sense of the past 30 years of my life, where I was up and down like a yo-yo, going in and out of the GPs, saying, \u2018I feel like killing myself \u2026 oh no I don\u2019t, I\u2019m fine now.\u2019 It was completely cyclical.\u201d Duffy now serves as a \u201cpatient tutor\u201d, sharing her experiences with trainee doctors to help counter what she sees as \u201cthe lack of awareness, the lack of training in women\u2019s healthcare \u2013 it\u2019s an absolute disgrace. It\u2019s like we\u2019re not worth the research.\u201d At 55, her moods are now far more stable, but the experience has left its mark. Having felt unable to return to her old office job, she now makes a more flexible living painting and upcycling furniture. Shockingly, a survey of 4,000 women commissioned for the recent Channel 4 documentary Davina McCall: Sex, Mind and the Menopause found one in 10 had quit their jobs because of menopause symptoms \u2013 either mental or physical \u2013 while 14% had reduced their working hours. \u201cI know of women signing non-disclosure agreements and being performance managed out of jobs at quite a high level [because of menopause symptoms],\u201d says Kate Muir, the author of Everything You Need to Know About the Menopause, who produced the Channel 4 documentary. Muir, who herself had such chronic \u201cbrain fog\u201d in her late 40s that she feared she was getting Alzheimer\u2019s, says her memory improved dramatically within a week of starting the right HRT. But she remains intrigued by the relationship between mental health and the chronic insomnia middle-aged women often experience, sometimes without realising that it can be a menopause symptom. \u201cOne of the markers for future dementia is lack of sleep. It really matters, and it\u2019s a marker for depression, too,\u201d she points out. For many working mothers, there is a particularly cruel irony to battling through the sleepless fog of early motherhood, only to be sideswiped professionally by broken nights again just as their children are finally grown up. Lauren Chiren, 54, was in her early 40s and working as a senior executive in financial services when she found herself struggling to remember things. It wasn\u2019t just forgetting the odd name, she says: one night she came home from work, greeted her son and his nanny, and then picked up her bags again to go out to work. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten I\u2019d left for the day. I was losing the plot.\u201d Her confidence plummeted, and she began to avoid speaking up in meetings for fear of revealing the gaps in her memory. Convinced she must have early onset dementia, and terrified about how she would cope as the single parent of a child with lifelong medical needs, Chiren negotiated an exit deal and resigned. \u201cI left work because I genuinely felt I was running out of time, and I would have to find someone else to look after my son,\u201d she says. When blood tests carried out by her doctor confirmed she had been through early menopause, she was flabbergasted: \u201cI thought that was something that happened to older women, and it would be the occasional hot flush.\u201d Chiren now runs a coaching business, Women of a Certain Stage, providing awareness training for employers to support staff through menopause, plus personal coaching for women to keep their careers on track. She helps her clients to recognise and track their symptoms, seek out what she calls \u201csmall adjustments\u201d at work that can help them cope, and consider lifestyle changes such as taking up exercise and improving their diet. (Not everyone can take HRT, she points out, and some actively don\u2019t want to.) Her first event in the City of London was so packed that it was standing room only, but she realised several of those attending had blacked out their diaries for the day \u201cso that people didn\u2019t know they were there\u201d. It is still hard, says Chiren, for some women in competitive environments to talk about menopause at work. \u201cOften they\u2019ve worked hard to get where they are. They don\u2019t want anything to single them out as weak or vulnerable.\u201d Women who coast through this period relatively easily, meanwhile, may be reluctant to advertise the existence of midlife anxiety and forgetfulness, worried that it will become just another excuse for writing off older women. Yet as Arthur points out, the embarrassed silence that can shroud mental health problems in menopause leaves many women woefully ill-prepared to recognise the symptoms. When it happened to her, she says, she felt utterly alone. \u201cMy thinking now is that the more of us who speak, the less we will feel alone.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "content": "It has never been more important to talk about our mental health. The fight to normalise these conversations and eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health is an ongoing battle, one in which we all have a role to play. From the current cost of living crisis to the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, we know that people are struggling. Research from the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute tells us that people with mental health problems are nearly twice as likely to say they are unable to cope due to the rising cost of living. A staggering 46% of us have reduced the number of meals we eat every day, and one in five (19%) say they\u2019ve missed an appointment for their own mental health. What these statistics clearly reveal is that we must act now to create a space to talk about it. Since becoming president of Mind in 2011, I have made it my mission to promote better conversations around mental wellbeing. I know myself that talking about a diagnosis can be scary, but it\u2019s vital \u2013 and we all know that talking can help us feel less alone, more able to cope and encourage us to seek the support we need. That\u2019s why I am so proud to support the nation\u2019s biggest conversation about mental health, Time to Talk Day. This year, it is on Thursday 2 February. Last year, we had nearly 2 million conversations. This year, with your help, I know we can surpass that number. I am asking readers to make space on that day for a conversation about mental health. It could be that you simply send a text to a friend, or perhaps you lend a listening ear to a colleague who you know has been a bit down. Or maybe you would like to share some issues or problems that have been concerning you. Even better, think about hosting an event in your community to raise awareness. And don\u2019t worry \u2013 those lovely people at the charities organising Time to Talk Day have plenty of tips and resources on their websites to help. Above all, though, this is a chance for all of us to talk, to listen and to change lives. So, from me, in advance, a giant \u201cthank\u201d and a whopping \u201cyou\u201d for anything you can do to help. Stephen Fry President, Mind"

            "date": "2023-01-18T06:00:37Z",
            "content": "Young people in the midst of a mental health crisis need to have attempted suicide several times before they get a bed in an inpatient unit in England, a report has revealed. Admission criteria for beds in child and adolescent mental health units are now so tight that even very vulnerable under-18s who pose a clear risk to themselves cannot get one. The practice \u2013 caused by the NHS\u2019s lack of mental health beds \u2013 leaves young people at risk of further harm, their parents confused, exhausted and worried, and the police and ambulance services potentially having to step in. The high thresholds for admission to a child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) unit are detailed in a report on NHS mental health care for under-18s in England based on interviews with patients, their parents and specialist staff who look after them. The report says a young person has to \u201chave attempted suicide multiple times to be offered inpatient support\u201d. It was commissioned by Look Ahead Care, a charity that provides mental health services in 40 areas of England, and is being launched on Wednesday in the House of Lords. \u201cFor many mental health professionals, this threshold level was deeply frustrating,\u201d the report says. \u201cFor parents and service users, it provoked strong emotional responses: they reported feeling angry and abandoned.\u201d The parent of one child quoted in the report said: \u201cIt was very clear from what the doctor had written that he has suicidal intentions and was planning for it. It kind of felt that at that time Camhs were only interested if he attempted it, which obviously we didn\u2019t want him to do.\u201d One Camhs nurse quoted said: \u201cThe parents were like: \u2018What do you mean? What do you mean I\u2019m taking her home?\u2019 It was quite difficult for them, which I get because the parents were coming to us crying for help.\u201d The report, funded by the Wates Family Enterprise Trust, also highlights how: Under-18s are seeking help at A&amp;E for serious mental health problems because mental health crisis services are inadequate, even though emergency departments are not set up to deal with that. Private operators now provide most of the mental health inpatient care for children and young people who are deemed unwell enough to need a bed, but these cost up to \u00a34,200 a week \u2013 far more than on the NHS. Some under-18s who have taken an overdose or self-harmed end up being looked after in children\u2019s wards of acute hospitals while they wait to undergo a mental health assessment, and then wait \u201cfor days or weeks\u201d for a bed in a Camhs unit. Olly Parker, the head of external affairs at the charity Young Minds, said: \u201cIt is shameful that children and young people are reaching crisis point before they get any support for their mental health. We know from our own research that thousands have waited so long for mental health support or treatment that they have attempted to take their own life. \u201cThose who end up in A&amp;E are often there because they don\u2019t know where else to turn. But A&amp;E can be a crowded and stressful environment, and is usually not the best place to get appropriate help.\u201d A survey of 13,887 young people last year found that more than one in four had tried to take their own life because they had had to wait to receive mental health help. Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 health spokesperson, said: \u201cThe findings of this research are devastating and should serve as a wake-up call for the government on young people\u2019s mental health. \u201cThe harrowing interviews in this report lay bare just how desperate young people and their families are for treatment, and that there is nowhere to turn unless they have reached crisis point, sometimes many times.\u201d An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cIt is untrue that private providers offer most hospitalised mental health care for young people and actually the latest data shows that over 701,000 children and young people were supported by NHS mental health services in the year up to October 2022. \u201cThe NHS has expanded mental health teams in schools to cover 2.4 million pupils along with rolling out 24/7 crisis lines supporting those in a crisis without them needing to attend hospital, so anybody who thinks they might need care should come forward as soon as possible.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "date": "2023-01-03T06:30:36Z",
            "content": "At the forest\u2019s edge, a scientist is giving a lesson on the mushrooms that grow here in the damp ground around the trees of Toui-Kilibo reserve in Benin. Olyvia Fadeyi is a mycologist \u2013 she studies fungi \u2013 and is teaching the women from the village of Yaoui how best to harness the economic value of this strangest of crops. Mushrooms can be cultivated year round, in back gardens, on vertically stacked shelves, rather than waiting for the naturally abundant ones in the rainy season. \u201cThere are 40 species, of which only 2% are currently harvested,\u201d says Fadeyi. \u201cI want to empower these women and help them break free from the pressures of society.\u201d The mushroom could be important if it can bring in money to rural communities where the pressures are many: from climate crisis and gender inequalities to the potential spread of the jihadist attacks in the far north. Since late 2021 there have been 28 attacks in Benin by extremist Islamist groups involved in the conflict across the borders with Burkina Faso and Niger. Most have occurred in Pendjari national park, known for its lions and hippos but now patrolled by Benin\u2019s military and a no-go area for civilians. The spread of conflict in the Sahel region depends on the recruitment of disaffected men who have few economic options. Women having livelihoods and income is an important alternative for husbands or male family members who might be otherwise be drawn to groups such as the al-Qaida-affiliated Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen. Benin is a country developing in real-time. President Patrice Talon is using investment from raised taxes and international development organisations to build roads, put in place street lighting and create a cultural tourism project with new museums and galleries celebrating Benin\u2019s history. But opportunities for women in areas away from the urban hubs are few. Just 13% of women in Benin own land and 30% marry before the age of 18, according to a UN report. Fadeyi is offering an intriguing alternative. Grown indoors, in high concentration, mushrooms can mitigate a little of the damage done by slash-and-burn deforestation, which farmers carry out to clear plantations for crops such as cashews. \u201cWomen are expected to work and earn money,\u201d says Fadeyi. \u201cBut what they earn from farming is not enough, and the money they do earn they are expected to give to their husbands.\u201d Albertine Doussoumon and her mother, Rosaline Chabi, are two of 180 women from three villages taking part in Fadeyi\u2019s pilot project, overseen by the University of Parakou. \u201cWe women make money from gathering firewood and collecting sand for the construction companies,\u201d says Doussoumon, in Nago, a dialect similar to the Yoruba spoken on the Nigerian side of the forest. \u201cWe use that to buy clothes for the children.\u201d Doussoumon\u2019s daily routine is working the plot of land owned by her husband where they grow maize, cassava, yams and rice. In the rainy season she picks mushrooms to eat with pounded yam and sell at the market. \u201cIt rained a lot in the past, but not so much now,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the intensity of the harmattan has reduced.\u201d The harmattan is the dry wind that blows from the Sahara across the Sahel, cooling coastal west Africa in the winter. The climate crisis has increased desertification and temperatures are rising 1.5 times faster than the global average. On the road to Yaoui\u2019s nearest city, Parakou, where the university academics monitor mushroom plots, trucks carry loads of cotton south to the port of Cotonou. Most of Benin\u2019s cotton gets exported, but recently textile manufacturing has started in newly built industrial parks. Talon made his money in cotton and he has plans for the economy. While taking a hard line on political dissent, he has also made efforts to tackle corruption by doubling the salaries of politicians and civil servants. He hopes to encourage the kind of technocracy lacking in Benin\u2019s ruling classes, but which has facilitated progress in countries such as Nigeria and Ivory Coast. Benin \u2013 a Marxist state from 1975 until 1990 \u2013 is still remote from global capitalism: no multinationals operate here and there is an informal economy. Petrol, for example, which is extracted across west Africa by corporations such as Shell and Total, is mostly bought and sold in glass bottles at roadsides, and illegally shipped in from Nigeria. Agriculture is a big part of Benin\u2019s development plan \u2013 and makes up 30% of GDP \u2013 but cotton and cashews have few sustainable benefits for the largely female workforce. There is space for a mushroom industry and women\u2019s development could be pivotal in the fight against jihadism. While military reinforcement is critical \u2013 Talon is negotiating weapons and personnel deals with Rwanda, Turkey and China \u2013 it is at community level that militancy must be tackled. In border villages, the recruitment strategy of the jihadist groups relies on economic coercion, not religious radicalisation. \u201cThe extremist gangs come and give bags of rice or farming tools to struggling families,\u201d says a former official, who asked not to be named. \u201cLater, they come back and give them a gun and say, \u2018Remember that rice we gave you, now we need you to do this for us.\u2019\u201d \u201cWe are aware of the situation in Burkina, and we pray it does not come to our doorstep,\u201d says Doussoumon. Fadeyi, who recently received \u20ac10,000 to fund her mushroom-growing initiative from a science-funding foundation and is asking for additional support from the Beninese authorities, is focused more on empowering rural women than tackling the security issues. \u201cBusiness mentoring will help them assert themselves in a commercial, entrepreneurial way,\u201d she says. \u201cNext, we will check the quality of fresh mushroom production and give refresher courses. After that the women will be left to their own devices, as they will have the necessary skills and will no longer need us. They will be completely autonomous.\u201d"

Speaking at the closing session of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Kristalina Georgieva said growth prospects had picked up in recent months but warned against overoptimism. \u201cMy message is that it is less bad than we feared a couple of months ago but that doesn\u2019t mean good. What has improved is that inflation seems to be leaning in the right direction \u2013 that is down.\u201d Georgieva\u2019s remarks followed recent falls in annual inflation rates in the US, the eurozone and the UK. The IMF will release updated forecasts for the global economy at the end of the month and the IMF managing director hinted there would be a small upgrade to her organisation\u2019s current forecast of 2.7% growth for 2023. The prospects for China had brightened since the abandonment of the zero-Covid strategy, while strong labour markets had boosted consumer spending. But Georgieva added: \u201cDon\u2019t go from being too pessimistic to being too optimistic.\u201d Given the IMF\u2019s current growth projections, it would still be a painful year for people around the world, and there was a risk stronger growth in China would boost energy prices and make the fight against inflation harder. Larry Summers, a former US treasury secretary, said it would be a tragedy if central banks \u201clurched away\u201d from their focus on achieving price stability and ended up having to fight the same battle twice. \u201cIf inflation was allowed to surge back, that would put not just price stability and standards of living for low-income people at risk, but also pose substantial risks to cyclical stability,\u201d Summers, now a Harvard professor, said. Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, said her institution would \u201cstay the course\u201d in the fight against inflation and cautioned Europe\u2019s finance ministries not to make the fight harder by cutting taxes or raising spending to counter slower growth. \u201cWe will do what\u2019s necessary.

            "content": "Pope Francis has condemned \u201ceconomic colonialism\u201d in Africa, denouncing the \u201cpoison of greed\u201d for mineral resources as he began a visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Tens of thousands of people cheered, chanted and waved flags as he travelled from the airport into the capital, Kinshasa, in his popemobile. But the mood changed when the pope gave a speech to dignitaries at the presidential palace, condemning \u201cterrible forms of exploitation, unworthy of humanity\u201d in Congo, where vast mineral wealth has fuelled war, displacement and hunger. In the speech, Francis said the DRC\u2019s history had been hobbled by conflict and a history of foreign domination. \u201cPolitical exploitation gave way to an economic colonialism that was equally enslaving,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, this country, massively plundered, has not benefited adequately from its immense resources,\u201d he told an audience of Congolese politicians and other dignitaries, speaking in Italian. \u201cIt is a tragedy that these lands, and more generally the whole African continent, continue to endure various forms of exploitation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe poison of greed has smeared its diamonds with blood,\u201d he said, referring to Congo specifically. \u201cHands off the Democratic Republic of the Congo! Hands off Africa! Stop choking Africa: it is not a mine to be stripped or a terrain to be plundered,\u201d he said, to applause. The 86-year-old is the first pontiff to visit Congo since John Paul II in 1985, when it was still known as Zaire. About half of Congo\u2019s population of 90 million are Roman Catholics. His message will resonate well in the DRC, a vast central African nation of about 100 million people, which won independence from Belgium in 1960. Despite its vast reserves of minerals, timber and freshwater, the DRC remains one of the poorest countries in the world. About two-thirds of the population lives on less than $2.15 a day, according to the World Bank. Conflict also ravages the east of the country, where M23 rebels have captured swathes of territory since late 2021. The violence in the east is connected to the long and complex fallout from the 1994 genocide in neighbouring Rwanda. An estimated 5.7 million people are internally displaced in Congo and 26 million face severe hunger, largely because of the impact of armed conflict, according to the United Nations. Francis, in his speech, encouraged ongoing regional peace efforts and said that \u201cwe cannot grow accustomed to the bloodshed that has marked this country for decades\u201d. The pope criticised rich countries for closing their eyes and ears to the tragedies unfolding in Congo and elsewhere in Africa. \u201cOne has the impression that the international community has practically resigned itself to the violence devouring it [Congo]. We cannot grow accustomed to the bloodshed that has marked this country for decades, causing millions of deaths,\u201d he said. Francis will stay in Kinshasa until Friday morning, when he will fly to South Sudan, another country grappling with conflict and poverty. In a first, he will be accompanied for that leg of his journey by the archbishop of Canterbury, leader of the global Anglican communion, and by the Church of Scotland moderator. The religious leaders have described their joint visit as a \u201cpilgrimage of peace\u201d."

Soaring levels of poverty, a health service in crisis, a social security system no longer fit for purpose, poor work conditions, restrictions on the right to strike, discrimination at work and school, and in healthcare and housing, are all human rights issues under international law.

The successive shockwaves of austerity, Covid-19 and the cost of living crisis have left us with deepening levels of inequality, with the government\u2019s actions consistently worsening rather than improving the situation. Far from protecting our essential rights, the government is failing people across the board. What is the solution? Greater human rights protections. More than 45 years after the UK signed an international treaty agreeing to uphold economic, social and cultural rights, they\u2019re still not part of domestic law, meaning the government can break its obligations without consequence.

            "content": "More workers will be forced to accept lower quality and poorly paid jobs this year as a result of the global economic slowdown, according to a report from the International Labour Organization (ILO). In its latest assessment of the state of the labour market, the Geneva-based ILO warned that \u201chigh and persistent\u201d uncertainty over the state of the global economy was depressing business investment, eroding real wages and pushing workers back into informal employment, which can involve street vending, housekeeping or picking through landfills. Overall, the organisation is forecasting that global employment will grow at only half the rate seen in 2022, at just 1% for 2023. The slowdown will not only impact further progress towards reducing poverty levels, but also stall the previous rise in living standards for global workers who will have fewer opportunities available to them. \u201cThe current slowdown means that many workers will have to accept lower quality jobs, often at very low pay, sometimes with insufficient hours\u201d, the ILO\u2019s 2023 World Employment and Social Outlook Trends report warned. Economies the world over are suffering as result of geopolitical tensions, including the war in Ukraine, as well as supply chain bottlenecks, and the uneven recovery from the Covid crisis. Together, those conditions have sparked a period of stagflation \u2013 in which an economy suffers high price inflation and low growth \u2013 for the first time since the 1970s. The resulting cost of living crisis, in which incomes have failed to keep up with rising inflation, is also pushing people into absolute or relative poverty across the world, the ILO explained. Price inflation was reducing demand for goods and services from low and middle income countries, threatening employment and quality jobs before they have even recovered fully from the economic effects of the Covid pandemic. The ILO said the ongoing shortage of better job opportunities, which started during the Covid crisis when lower income workers were disproportantely disadvantaged, was likely to worsen with the projected slowdown, \u201cpushing workers into jobs of worse quality and depriving others of adequate social protection\u201d. \u201cProgress in poverty reduction achieved over the previous decade has largely faltered and convergence in living standards and work quality is coming to a halt as productivity growth slows worldwide,\u201d the report said. The ILO said it does not expect the drop off in employment growth experienced during the Covid crisis to be recovered until at least 2025, and raised further concerns over a projected slowdown in productivity, which it said was \u201cessential for addressing the interlinked crises we face in purchasing power, ecological sustainability and human wellbeing\u201d."

            "date": "2023-01-13T12:09:22Z",
            "content": "Prince Harry\u2019s tell-all autobiography has become the UK\u2019s fastest-selling nonfiction book ever. The memoir has been controversial, with Harry making claims that Prince William physically attacked him and accusing his father of putting his own interests first. The Guardian asked readers \u2013 some of whom had already begun reading the book \u2013 for their views on the memoir and the publicity around it. Many said their views on the royal family had been changed, while others said it strengthened existing positions. Other readers also made the point that the book was more balanced than had been presented by parts of the media. Here, eight readers discuss how Spare has changed their opinions on the family rift \u2013 as well as the future of the royals as an institution. \u2018I was raised a royalist but now see royal family as out of touch\u2019 I was brought up a royalist and really just accepted their role without much question. I viewed the late queen respectfully and admired what I saw as her sense of duty and public service. However, I do now sympathise much more with Harry and consider the treatment of him and Meghan by much of the press to be reprehensible and negatively biased. I found the comments by Jeremy Clarkson absolutely repugnant \u2013 I complained to Ipso. I thought that [Harry and Meghan\u2019s] relationship might herald in a changing of times. I am now really leaning to a view that a hereditary monarchy is out of touch and stands for inequality of opportunity in our country. Jane Popplewell, 60, east Yorkshire, works in adult social care \u2018Harry now seems as entitled as the others\u2019 My view of the royal family was negative before \u2013 I don\u2019t think the UK should be a monarchy. Before the recent publicity I was sympathetic to Harry and Meghan but now I am less so as I think he shows the same level of entitlement as the other Windsors. His remarks about Africa are patronising, and I don\u2019t think the taxpayer should pay for his security while he is living in the US. I feel sorry for Meghan and even Camilla, I think they get unfairly blamed for breaking up the family. Maybe because they are women and \u201coutsiders\u201d. The monarchy is becoming a laughing stock and I don\u2019t see how it contributes to a positive image of the UK. Rachael, 34, Oxford, copywriter \u2018It has humanised the royal family\u2019 The revelations in Harry\u2019s book have humanised the royal family, demonstrating that even those amongst the highest realms of society are affected by family drama and mental health challenges. I viewed them as perfect and prestigious before, but now that I think about it, they\u2019re just a family with ordinary problems. We benefit by seeing a more realistic portrayal. I\u2019ve read most of the book - I think this is the first time William has had a stain on his reputation, but we haven\u2019t heard his perspective. I fear that Prince Harry and Meghan\u2019s mental health will only deteriorate further. They claim they don\u2019t want media attention, but this memoir will only serve them to be subject to public scrutiny for years to come. Habib Syed, 22, London, student \u2018The royals come across better than the media presents\u2019 I am a monarchist \u2013 I\u2019d rather maintain the hereditary system with a royal figurehead than go down the route of republicanism. I preordered the book when a publishing date was announced and began reading in the early hours of 10 January whilst on work breaks. Despite the press hysteria, his father, King Charles, and wider family actually come across in far better terms via this narrative than you might get in the media generally. [Its focus has been] on the sensationalist \u201cconflict\u201d between the brothers, said to have been brought about by Harry\u2019s \u201cresentment\u201d against being the \u201cspare\u201d younger sibling [despite] 411 pages containing anecdotes of his overall life. I think what has also been missing from much of the media is that the book sales are in support of charity. David, 51, Hereford, industrial cleaner \u2018I was neutral before, but now I think the royals have to go\u2019 I had no view of the royal family before. The news I\u2019ve heard about Spare (I have not read it myself) seems to have confirmed what in retrospect should be obvious: telling a specific family that they were chosen by God to rule over the rest of us is completely insane. It is madness to me that the royal family is as popular as it is among the English public. I was neutral on the issue of republicanism before, but now it\u2019s quite clear: the royal family has got to go. Anyone defending this disaster status quo between the tabloids and the royals is looking increasingly delusional and out of touch. Pratik Samant, 29, Oxford, NHS radiotherapy physicist \u2018I no longer support the royals \u2013 but Harry has also revealed too much\u2019 I used to be a staunch royalist, loved Diana and the queen, but since seeing Harry and Meghan\u2019s Netflix series and also following the death of our beloved queen, I no longer support them. I found Meghan\u2019s mother really engaging and believable \u2013 she made it quite obvious what Meghan has gone through. Also, seeing media stories compared side by side with Kate. I\u2019m sad for Harry, he seems to be quite lost in the past and still carrying such anger. I\u2019m partway through his book and sadly it does feel like he\u2019s revealed far too many personal issues and I find it hard to defend him any more. There is no way back for him now. I only hope he can enjoy his life in America. Francesca, 56, Hampshire, project administrator \u2018Their privileged life comes at a great cost\u2019 I\u2019ve long been in favour of abolishing the monarchy. There are many reasons why this would be a good idea, but the one that has come to the fore recently is how much damage has been done to the members of the Windsor family. What sometimes appears to be a privileged existence for members of the royal family comes only at the cost of their mental health. Three of the marriages of the queen\u2019s four children have broken up. The minute details of the lives of the royal family are under constant scrutiny and it is very difficult for members of the royal family to express their own feelings. They\u2019re trapped \u2013 they\u2019re under the cosh from those who want a monarchy but don\u2019t care about the people, I consider it to be like an abusive relationship. Peter Gray, 62, Chesterfield, retired \u2018My view of Camilla has changed\u2019 I don\u2019t think I ever looked at the royal family as a family, more a collection of characters. But what you\u2019re looking at is a family and this stuff goes on all the time. Having two boys myself, I know that the dynamic of a hierarchy is very common. The second son often feels aggrieved that they didn\u2019t get the attention that the first one got. I was never a royalist but I was a Meghan fan from watching her in Suits. I really don\u2019t know how she has coped with the constant barrage of negativity, falsehoods and vitriol. The recent publicity has changed my view of Camilla \u2013 she seemed like a decent person, but when she had that lunch with Piers Morgan \u2013 that was such a slap in the face. That for me was when I thought, \u2018I don\u2019t trust them\u2019. Pauline Killen, 55, Belfast, IT project manager"

            "title": "Tesla trial: did Musk\u2019s tweet affect the firm\u2019s stock price? Experts weigh in",
            "date": "2023-01-29T06:00:40Z",
            "content": "After Elon Musk tapped the tweet button at 12.48 pm on 7 August 2018, a bunch of Tesla investors were about to be taken on a wild ride. \u201cAm considering taking Tesla private at $420. Financing secured,\u201d read the tweet that has since stirred up more than four years of securities fraud litigation focused on the rampant tweeting habits of the electric automaker\u2019s billionaire CEO. Within one minute, the price of Tesla\u2019s stock shot up by $8 a share and, by the end of that afternoon, the stock had climbed by more than $20 \u2013 a 6% \u2013 only to tank 10 days later when it became clear the $72bn deal was not on the horizon at all. This timeline, laid out by an expert witness in a 372-page filing in the case, is likely to be a crucial piece of evidence in the jury trial going on in a San Francisco courtroom, where Musk testified this week that his tweets may not have caused Tesla\u2019s stock price jumps. \u201cJust because I tweet something does not mean people believe it or will act accordingly,\u201d Musk told the jury in a San Francisco federal court Friday. Legal and finance experts observing the case say Tesla\u2019s attorneys face an \u201cuphill battle\u201d to make the claim that his tweet didn\u2019t materially affect the price of the stock, which they say seems to be a key argument in the company\u2019s defense against the shareholders\u2019 charge that Musk cost them \u201cbillions\u201d by misleadingly pumping up the stock price. \u201cThis seems like a weak defense,\u201d based on the timeline evidence entered into the court record by expert witness Michael L Hartzmark, said Josh White, an assistant professor of finance at Vanderbilt University, who is a former financial economist for the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cGiven how quickly Tesla\u2019s stock price responded to the \u2018funding secured\u2019 Tweet, it seems that many investors believed this tweet to be a signal of Musk\u2019s true intention to take the company private at a premium, which had a positive, immediate and sustained impact on the stock price.\u201d Proving that Musk\u2019s tweets were \u201cmaterial\u201d in causing investors to lose money on Tesla stock is one of three key legal points that attorneys for the investors must make to prove that what happened constituted securities fraud, legal experts said. But, even before the trial began, the judge had already ruled that Musk\u2019s tweets were both \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d, checking off two of those points in the investors\u2019 favor. Still, the investors\u2019 attorneys must prove that shareholders were harmed by the tweets and then shed light on the question of whether Musk knew he was acting wrongly, which Loyola law professor Jessica Levinson said can be difficult to show. \u201cThose are real questions and not necessarily a slam dunk for the plaintiffs,\u201d said Levinson, who nonetheless believes Tesla could face huge damages. \u201cIt\u2019s a class action lawsuit and there are a lot of different shareholders who claim they lost money,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, if they can tie specific losses to those tweets, I think it could add up to potentially billions of dollars.\u201d \u2018Delete, don\u2019t tweet\u2019 After three days of sometimes combative testimony from Musk, the trial on Wednesday dove into how Tesla insiders had urged Musk to exercise control of his tweeting habits. Weeks before Musk got into trouble after tweeting about his plans to take Tesla private, company investors had urged him to clamp down on his usage of Twitter, fearing that the comments he was posting were damaging the automaker\u2019s brand as well as the company\u2019s stock price, according to testimony presented Wednesday. \u201cIf something really upsets you, go for a walk around the factory,\u201d Ron Baron, a major Tesla shareholder, told Musk in a 15 July 2018 email that was displayed as evidence during Wednesday\u2019s trial. \u201cGet an ice cream cone. Just don\u2019t use Twitter.\u201d Joseph Fath, a T Rowe Price portfolio manager, said he had warned Musk that his tweets were starting to do more harm than good for Tesla, following up with an email imploring him to \u201cremember the golden rule. Delete. Don\u2019t Tweet.\u201d Less than three weeks later, Fath said he was \u201cshocked and surprised\u201d to hear about Musk\u2019s buyout tweet during a vacation he was taking in the Caribbean with his family. \u201cIt blew up my entire vacation,\u201d Fath said. In other testimony Wednesday, Antonio Gracias, who was the lead director on Tesla\u2019s board in 2018, painted Musk\u2019s tweets as a way of meeting \u201cfull disclosure\u201d regulations, requiring that all shareholders be given inside company information at the same time. But UC Berkeley law professor Robert Bartlett said Musk\u2019s way of disseminating corporate news is so far out of the norm that it\u2019s hard to see his tweets as not being very intentional. \u201cMusk plays by a different rulebook,\u201d said Bartlett. \u201cThe standard practice in corporate acquisitions is you sit tight, you don\u2019t make an announcement until (the deal) has been vetted. And then you do so through standard norms of making announcements of mergers such as through an investor relations office. You don\u2019t go around parcelling out information in dribs and drabs.\u201d Levinson said, in a way, what\u2019s on trial here is Musk\u2019s management style of running his company by sending out thousands of quick, off-the-cuff and sometimes joking tweets. \u201cThere\u2019s a weird parallel to the way the former president (Trump) tweeted,\u201d she said. \u201cRight, \u2018Oh, I just kind of tweet things really quickly and don\u2019t take it too literally\u2019.\u201d She added that the jury would have to think about \u201chow much is it fair to punish somebody for a quick tweet\u201d. Citing the timeline showing how quickly Tesla\u2019s stock price jumped following Musk\u2019s tweets, Levinson added \u201cnow in this case, that quick tweet did have a very real impact on people\u201d. San Francisco securities attorney Ramzi Abadou said in the end, the jury may weigh in on whether Musk is executing responsible management with his tweeting. \u201cThe question is not whether or not people are going to believe his tweets, it is the question of him overlooking the fact that he\u2019s got fiduciary duties to his investors,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it just goes back to his juvenile kind of approach to communicating over social media. I\u2019m sure it drives his attorneys crazy.\u201d Companies only rarely take the risk of letting securities fraud cases go all the way to a trial. Normally, they are settled out of court. But Musk is essentially doubling down on his risk from the tweet. He and Tesla already agreed to pay a $40m fine in settling a case over the same tweets with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018, denying wrongdoing. Musk also surrendered the Tesla chairman position and agreed to let a company lawyer vet some of his tweets, as a result of that action. But he has appealed, saying he agreed to the settlement provisions under duress. Since the current case is civil, Musk and Tesla can only face financial penalties. Even if damages are awarded, it\u2019s hard to see them having much of an impact on Musk, who is one of the world\u2019s richest men. Any penalties might be delayed for years by appeals. White said the biggest risk Musk faces might be damage to his reputation, which has already been sullied by his failed attempt to get out of a deal to buy Twitter and his subsequent gutting of that company. Musk\u2019s ownership of Twitter has proved unpopular with Tesla shareholders who worry about him being distracted. Tesla\u2019s stock has lost about one-third of its value since Musk took over Twitter in October. \u201cIf he loses this case, it adds to the reputation hit,\u201d White said."

            "title": "Tesla stock has only plunged to a less ludicrous level as competitors catch up | Nils Pratley",
            "date": "2023-01-04T18:20:30Z",
            "content": "Only part of the plunge in Tesla\u2019s stock market value can be pinned on Elon Musk\u2019s misadventure with Twitter. Yes, selling a few tens of billions of dollars-worth of Tesla stock \u2013 far more than he signalled at the outset \u2013 to fund the purchase was bound to dampen the mood among investors in the back seat. And, yes, the distraction factor is serious; Tesla\u2019s non-executive directors should be screaming at the boss to get back to the day job. But the main cause of Tesla\u2019s decline from a $1.2tn valuation to today\u2019s \u00a3350bn is surely very simple: the stock was ludicrously overpriced in the first place. Investors were required to believe that revenues could keep rocketing for years and competitors\u2019 attempts to catch up with electric vehicles would barely affect Tesla\u2019s profit margins. If such a plotline seemed unlikely, Jeremy Grantham, British co-founder of Boston-based fund manager GMO and a student of stock market bubbles, offered a recent historical perspective a year ago to explain exactly how far-fetched it was. Tesla was being valued at \u201cmany multiples\u201d of the price-to-sales ratios that had been achieved by members of the big-tech Faang club at the same stage of their corporate development, he pointed out. The market was assuming Musk\u2019s creation would not only be as brilliantly successful as the likes of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2013 \u201csome of the greatest companies in the history of capitalism\u201d \u2013 its success would put theirs in the shade. \u201cThis is a big ask,\u201d Grantham said drily. You bet. Thus the stock market\u2019s savage reaction this week to a miss by Tesla to its revenue targets makes perfect sense. The shortfall in sales wasn\u2019t enormous and a growth rate of 40% for 2022 is still slick but, if 50% until eternity had been previously been assumed, the difference matters. It is evidence that competitors are already more than a minor irritant. The day was bound to arrive. It was always absurd to ignore the well-funded efforts of Ford, Honda, BMW, Toyota, Volkswagen et al. One should now assume the competitive field has changed permanently. As it is, Tesla seems to have had to work hard with discounts to keep sales roughly in step with its production schedule in the final quarter of 2022. None of which deflects from Tesla\u2019s status as a great 21st-century company that has redefined its industry; it deserves its place in the tech pantheon. But, now the valuation bubble has burst and investors have learned that the price isn\u2019t going to the moon, one can start to talk about a fair valuation. At the new level, Tesla is still valued at about 29 times projected earnings this year \u2013 earnings that some analysts, note, think will go sideways in 2023. In an automotive sector where the post-pandemic boom is fading, that is still a premium rating \u2013 just not an insane one. Musk still has a job to do to maintain it. Centrica is right to talk about credit balances Annoyed by how your energy supplier is sitting on hundreds of pounds of your cash as a credit balance? So you should be. As the outside world discovered a year ago when some of the smaller suppliers (plus Bulb, a bigger one) started going bust, the practice of using customers\u2019 money as working capital is widespread, and widely abused. Ofgem, awakening from its regulatory slumbers last summer, seemed minded to do something about it. Companies had been using credit balances \u201clike an interest-free company credit card\u201d, declared chief executive Jonathan Brearley, threatening to insist that the cash should be ringfenced. In the autumn, however, he performed a U-turn. Ringfencing would only be insisted upon if a company is deemed over-reliant on deposits or doesn\u2019t get its act together to meet tougher \u2013 we hope \u2013 financial resilience rules, Ofgem decided. That is the context of the appeal by Centrica, owner of British Gas, to Citizens Advice to join its campaign for suppliers to be obliged to disclose prominently to customers whether their credit balances would be fully protected in the event of corporate failure. Since Centrica adopted ringfencing voluntarily, one could say it has a vested interest here. But it is also right to keep banging the drum about credit balances. Energy suppliers should not be sitting on the equivalent of months-worth of bill payments in some cases. Let them find their own working capital, which is how life works in virtually every other industry. Ofgem\u2019s lenience on this issue remains baffling."

            "title": "Bed Bath & Beyond sees \u2018meme-stock\u2019 surge \u2013 but is it too little, too late?",
            "date": "2023-01-14T11:00:06Z",
            "content": "Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, the pioneering home goods retailer, appears to be heading for bankruptcy. But you wouldn\u2019t necessarily know it from visiting its flagship store in New York\u2019s Chelsea neighbourhood \u2013 or by looking at its share price this week. Last year Bed Bath &amp; Beyond was one of the so-called \u201cmeme stocks\u201d, including Gamestop, an ailing video games retailer, and cinema chain AMC, whose share prices were driven to dizzying heights by a new generation of online traders. This week, BB&amp;B was foaming again, with its share price more than doubling over the week amid speculation on online stock forums, including Reddit, that it might be a potential acquisition target. The company\u2019s Chelsea store appears to be faring better than most, busy with shoppers browsing the aisles but with many items heavily discounted. Still, some shoppers were unsure about the company\u2019s future. \u201cIt\u2019s a great store, but at other locations, there\u2019s almost no products on the shelves,\u201d said Chintan Patel. He said he\u2019d followed Bed Bath &amp; Beyond through its existential crisis. \u201cIt was one hundred per cent a pump-and-dump started by the management,\u201d Patel said. Another shopper said the company had \u201ckind of screwed themselves\u201d. Indeed, it does seem unlikely that Chelsea\u2019s shoppers, or meme stock traders, can save Bed Bath &amp; Beyond now. The company said last week it could enter chapter 11 bankruptcy within weeks, and has doubts it can stay in business after a quarter of deep losses and declining sales, causing its stock to drop more than 30%. Even this week\u2019s rally \u2013 which took its shares to close to $5 \u2013 leaves its share price down 68% over the year. On Tuesday, the company reported losses of nearly $400m. In October, more than 40% of the retailer\u2019s products were out of stock, twice the level in the first half of the year, as suppliers walked away. \u201cA third of revenue has vanished, plunging an already beleaguered company into the depths of chaos,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData. The Bed Bath &amp; Beyond story, though, is a strange tale of the power and destruction of the internet. While Wall Street analysts believed Amazon, Walmart and others would eat the retailer\u2019s business, the company\u2019s stock soared on a wave of enthusiasm last year after billionaire Ryan Cohen, the founder of online pet food company Chewy, bought more than 7m shares in the company. Online investors following the r/wallstreetbets forum on Reddit crowned Cohen as \u201cthe meme king who will reign for 1,000 years\u201d and piled in. Whether or not investors actually thought Bed Bath &amp; Beyond was a solid business, or just saw an opportunity to pump up the price and then sell, is an open question. Other headline meme stocks that online traders used to punish hedge funds and other investors that were betting against them have also crashed to earth. Shares in GameStop have fallen 70% since January 2022, and AMC shares down down 82% over the same period. Last August, the party came to an end when Cohen announced plans to sell off his 9.8% stake in the company, making him $178m, and triggering a selloff among meme stock followers and allegations of a pump-and-dump scheme. A month later, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond\u2019s former chief financial officer, Gustavo Arnal, died after jumping from a luxury skyscraper in Manhattan. By then, the retailer\u2019s stock had lost more than 70% of its value in the year, and the company said it was looking to turn things around with a strong holiday season. But attempts to streamline its product line were complicated by pandemic bottlenecks, a lack of online investment, and frustrated consumers who had abruptly returned to in-person shopping only to find selections lacking. Unlike many retailers, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had not been typical of retailers collapsing under competition from online retailers like Amazon. At its peak in 2013, BB&amp;B was valued at $17bn. A company that had not added debt to its balance sheet in two decades, took on $1.5bn in debt as shoppers moved online. In August, the company took on more debt, after post-pandemic shoppers failed to materialize. This week, the retailer\u2019s value was close to $550m. \u201cMultiple paths are being explored, and we are determining our next steps thoroughly, and in a timely manner,\u201d the chief executive, Susan Gove, who four months ago launched a turnaround plan, said in a statement. But if, or when, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond seeks bankruptcy protection, many will rue its demise. The chain was founded in 1971 by Leonard Feinstein and Warren Eisenberg, who opened the first store in Springfield, New Jersey, as Bed n\u2019 Bath. By 1987, as the fashion for big-box stores exploded, Bed n\u2019 Bath expanded beyond the state, added more products and the \u201cBeyond\u201d label to its name, and became a classic category killer. It went public in 1992, and crossed $1bn in sales six years later. As shoppers perused the aisles on Tuesday, many speculated that their days of shopping in-store were numbered. Standing on Sixth Avenue, Michael Fekete said he hadn\u2019t bought into Bed Bath &amp; Beyond\u2019s stock surge of 2021 and he wasn\u2019t buying it now. \u201cI don\u2019t think the market is necessarily going to allow these mega stores to continue to exist,\u201d he said. \u201cMy guess is they go online only. We\u2019ve seen a lot of the other department-store retailers go that way.\u201d"

From high-end luxury sedans, to modest hatchbacks, off-road vehicles and transit vans, here\u2019s a sample of 10 electric vehicles expected to be hitting the Australian market in 2023. Fiat 500e The Fiat 500 was introduced in 1957, produced until 1975 and then revived in 2007. Now the popular hatchback is going electric. With a relatively limited range and a price yet to be determined, this small EV is aimed at inner-city drivers. Subaru Solterra The Solterra is Subaru\u2019s first run at a mass-market electric car that is similar in principle to Toyota\u2019s bZ4X.

The main difference between the two cars is largely aesthetic, with the ID.4 expected to be priced in the mid-$60,000 range, featuring a 77kWh battery capable of driving 530km between charges. It\u2019s due for delivery in late 2023. Skoda Enyaq Europeans love the Skoda Enyaq \u2013 now the question is whether Australians will follow when the company starts taking orders in late 2023. The Czech brand\u2019s all-electric family model offers a 77kWh battery and up to 529km of range \u2013 though the price has yet to be announced. Hyundai Ioniq 6 If you\u2019re looking for SUV specs in a sedan body type, the Ioniq 6 gives you the best of both worlds. The Ioniq 6 is a reskin of the Ioniq 5 and promises a range of 610km with quick acceleration. It also happens to be one of the most aero-efficient cars ever to be mass produced. MG4 It\u2019s possible the MG4 may end up one of the most affordable EV models on the Australian market, with a pricetag below $45,000. The small hatchback is being launched to compete with the Nissan Leaf, BYD Atto3 and the Cupra Born. It promises up to 600km of range from a smaller 64kWh battery. Kia EV9 With its EV9, Kia is making a run for the territory traditionally occupied by the Toyota LandCruiser and Nissan Patrol \u2013 just without the petrol. The EV9 is a large SUV designed for off-roading, though the final production design, specs and price are yet to be confirmed. Word on the street is that it will sell for about $100,000. Volvo EX90 The Australian government may be shy on the phasing out of petrol engines, but Volvo has plans to go all-electric by 2026 \u2013 and it hopes the EX90 will take them there. The flagship SUV will come with Twin Motor, which offers a total power output of 300kW or Twin Motor Performance, which offers 380kW. Both options offer a range of around 600km, though it is slightly lower for performance. The EX90 is vehicle-to-grid capable, meaning it can be used as a mobile battery to power a household or even other EVs."

            "date": "2023-01-18T07:30:12Z",
            "content": "On a north London industrial estate, the smell of freshly baked bread cuts through the cold January air outside Warburtons\u2019 bakery. More than 2m loaves are made here each day, from production line to supermarket shelf by 8am each morning, in a process where costs have soared at every stage. Food prices are still rising at the fastest annual rate since 1977, according to official figures released on Wednesday, and a peek inside this bakery in Enfield shows why. For the family-owned company, soaring costs for wheat, water and yeast \u2013 as well as for powering its gas-fired ovens at 11 UK factories \u2013 have led the firm to put up the price of its bestselling loaf by a quarter in only nine months. With inflation at the highest rate in decades, shoppers are feeling the pinch. \u201cConstantly going back to customers asking for a price increase is bloody hard work,\u201d says Jonathan Warburton, the chair of the company. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t enhance the relationship with us, it causes friction.\u201d Annual costs at the fifth-generation family business, started in a Bolton grocery shop in 1870, have ballooned by \u00a3118m in the past year for the several tonnes of flour it needs each week, as well as to keep its ovens fired close to 300C every day of the year except Christmas. Warburton says he has little choice but to put up his prices, highlighting how sky-high energy costs are rippling through the British economy \u2013 from manufacturers to the supermarket shelf \u2013 as Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine pumps up global gas prices. \u201cI think people are understanding about these price rises if you\u2019re clear and straightforward with them about what\u2019s happening. It isn\u2019t my fault that bloody idiot went into Ukraine, quite frankly,\u201d Warburton says. \u201cPutin doing what he\u2019s doing in eastern Europe, on the back of Covid, is the major trigger. It has sent shock waves through the food industry.\u201d Across Britain, households are under pressure from the rising cost of the weekly shop, with food and drink inflation at the highest rate since September 1977. It has been especially tough for poorer families, who suffer more from the rising price of basic essentials than wealthy households because they spend a higher proportion of their income on food. Official figures show bread prices have soared by 20.5% in a year, almost twice the 10.5% rate of general inflation. Even Rishi Sunak has noticed. Challenged to name a food that had gone up most in price during a TV interview while he was still Boris Johnson\u2019s chancellor, he cited the humble loaf and told the BBC his family had a \u201cwhole range of breads\u201d at home. The clip went viral amid criticism the now prime minister \u2013 with a family fortune of about \u00a3730m \u2013 was out of touch with ordinary people. At Warburtons, the baker has increased the shelf price of its 800g Toastie loaf from \u00a31 to \u00a31.25 in only nine months \u2013 a move the chair says is entirely driven by higher costs. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is recover our costs. We\u2019re not trying to profit \u2026 we\u2019re just trying to stay neutral by ultimately passing it on to the consumer. We can\u2019t carry \u00a3118m-worth of extra cost. The business would be bankrupt and there would be 5,000 people out of work.\u201d Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, has said food is the latest of three major inflationary \u201cshocks\u201d sweeping Britain \u2013 after the fallout from the Covid pandemic, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Karen Betts, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, expects the inflation rate for her sector to peak later this year. Even then, the rate of price growth will only slow; prices won\u2019t return to what they were a year ago, meaning pressure will remain on living costs for some time to come. \u201cMost of our companies have got their heads in their hands. They\u2019re trying to work out how they pay increased bills without passing it on to consumers,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough year. Clearly it will be a tough year for consumers, and within that for vulnerable households, and for our companies making ends meet in a difficult economic environment.\u201d Marched through in batches of 10 (the baker\u2019s dozen is long gone in the world of mass production), Warburtons\u2019 vast Enfield factory churns out almost 9,000 loaves of bread an hour. More than 5m crumpets are made each week, emerging line after line from a hotplate that is rarely turned off. This much baking means more than four tonnes of flour an hour are drained from the vast silos outside, seven days a week, 364 days a year. Alongside higher energy costs, the war in Ukraine \u2013 known as the breadbasket of Europe \u2013 has disrupted the global supply of flour, fertiliser and sunflower oil used in food production the world over. Russia and its neighbour are the first and fifth largest exporters of wheat in the world, accounting for almost a third of exports. Although British bakeries source very little from the region \u2013 preferring homegrown supplies and imports from the US and Canada \u2013 war hitting such important producers has pushed up prices everywhere. Warburton says his business is the largest user of Canadian wheat in Europe, preferring to mix the premium crop grown on the prairies of North America with English produce. It\u2019s a big contributor to his higher costs, with reduced supply pushing prices up globally. \u201cIt affects the world market. You\u2019re just affected by that. And you buy in US dollars and we do our best to forward cover and smooth it out,\u201d he says. The baker says a higher wage bill to pay for the company\u2019s 5,000-strong workforce pales in comparison with the 85% increase in gas and electricity bills. In addition to the vast steel ovens he needs to heat, Warburtons has been hit by rising diesel prices to ensure its 1,200 trucks can maintain daily bread deliveries. The cost pressures facing the company come after a period when bread prices had generally been falling for the past decade, thanks to overcapacity in the industry and red-hot competition among supermarkets. Warburton says the price of a Toastie remains good value, compared with a cup of coffee and other everyday staples. Still, with Britain\u2019s economy facing a potentially prolonged recession this year, and consumers expected to sharply rein in their spending, he is hoping there are no more cost increases waiting round the corner. Barring, he says, any further black swan moments. The term is used in economics to describe events that are, like the bird not known in the west until the discovery of Australia, unpredictable or unforeseen. \u201cThere can be external shocks. And you know how many black swan events there have been in the last three years? I thought you only had one every 25 years. But there\u2019s a whole flock of swans at the moment.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-13T16:50:33Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 share index approached a record high on Friday, as European markets were lifted by hopes that the inflation shock from energy prices is easing. The blue-chip stock index, which includes the 100 largest companies listed in London, hit its highest level in more than four years. It touched 7,864.95 points, less than 1% away from the record intraday high of 7,903 points set in May 2018, before closing at 7844.07. Global shares have been lifted this year by optimism that central banks will slow interest rate increases, due to signs that inflation is cooling. China\u2019s relaxation of its Covid-19 restrictions could also help global growth this year. That has pushed up commodity prices, and lifted shares in mining companies listed on the London stock market. The FTSE 100 has gained about 5% so far this month, after rising about 1% in a turbulent 2022. Sophie Lund-Yates, the lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the news that the UK economy grew unexpectedly in November, by 0.1%, helped the market to rally. \u201cThe FTSE 100 is closing in on record highs as the UK\u2019s unexpected GDP growth caused a welcome swell for the market,\u201d Lund-Yates said. The weaker pound has helped push the index higher, said Neil Wilson of Markets.com, adding that \u201cin dollar terms we are a long way off the all-time high\u201d. \u201cA belief the Fed [US Federal Reserve] is almost done with rate hikes as inflation peaks, and hopes that China\u2019s reopening will drive the commodity and energy sectors\u201d also pushed the FTSE 100 towards its record high, Wilson added. BofA Global Research reported that investors had poured money into equity and bond funds in the past week, cheered by recent economic reports. It said you \u201cdon\u2019t get more Goldilocks\u201d than Thursday\u2019s US inflation report, showing a 0.1% drop in prices during December. New US unemployment claims remained low last week, too, at just 205,000, which indicated America\u2019s jobs market was robust. The annual US inflation rate fell to 6.5%, from 7.1% in November, its lowest level in over a year. This may encourage the Federal Reserve to slow its interest rate rises. A drop in wholesale energy prices in the last few weeks has cheered European markets, with wholesale gas prices below their levels just before Russia invaded Ukraine last February. \u201cTentative optimism has crept back into the European outlook over recent weeks as energy prices have continued to tumble and gas storage levels appear unseasonally healthy,\u201d said James Smith, a developed market economist at ING . \u201cThat\u2019s also good news for the UK, which is one of Europe\u2019s heaviest gas users as a proportion of total energy consumption.\u201d European markets hit their higher level in nine months on Friday, and were on track for their second week of gains. Optimism was lifted by data showing that Germany\u2019s economy grew by 1.9% last year and probably stagnated in the last quarter of 2022, meaning Europe\u2019s largest economy may dodge a winter recession. US stocks were headed for a winning week, with the tech-focused Nasdaq index and the broader S&amp;P 500 on track for their best weekly performance since November. The Nasdaq posted a five-day winning streak on Thursday, its longest rally since July. Wall Street opened lower on Friday, after JP Morgan said a mild recession is now the central case in its macroeconomic outlook. But an afternoon recovery helped the S&amp;P 500 index to close 0.4% higher at 3999 points."

            "title": "Students face \u00a31,500 inflation shortfall in maintenance loans, universities warn",
            "date": "2023-01-09T13:03:28Z",
            "content": "Hard-up students in England, who are struggling to pay their rent and bills as the cost of living soars, will lose out on as much as \u00a31,500 a year if maintenance loans fail to keep up with inflation, university leaders have said. The warning from the Russell Group of universities came as the government prepared to announce loan increases for 2023-24, amid fears that growing numbers of students will drop out because they cannot afford to stay in higher education. Maintenance loans are taken out by students, in addition to loans for tuition fees, to cover their living costs while they study, though many take on part-time work alongside their degree to supplement their loans. The reason for the shortfall, the Russell Group says, is that the Department for Education (DfE) calculates annual increases to maintenance loans using out-of-date projections, which do not take into account sudden increases in inflation from factors such as the pandemic and war in Ukraine. University leaders say government forecasts have been inaccurate in each year since 2020-21 and with no mechanism in place to correct for inflation, it means a \u201csignificant real-terms cut\u201d has been baked into the system. According to Russell Group calculations, if the DfE increases loans in line with the most recent projection for inflation for the first quarter of 2024 \u2013 for example 2.8% \u2013 a full-time student living away from home outside London will receive \u00a39,978, which is \u00a31,523 short of the \u00a311,501 the loan would be had it increased by the actual rate of inflation. Prof Charlie Jeffery, the vice-chancellor of the University of York, said universities have been providing additional support to help students through grants, emergency loans and other financial packages. \u201cNow it is time for the government to step up through Covid-style hardship payments and a meaningful increase to maintenance loans. \u201cFor some students, this is going to mean the difference between going to university or not, between continuing their studies or not. If we don\u2019t see this support from the government, we fear more and more students will have to make significant sacrifices in their studies, compromising their education and impacting on their mental health.\u201d Sultan Chaudhury, the union development officer at the University of Nottingham students\u2019 union, said financial hardship was not just confined to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. \u201cStudents from middle-income households, with limited access to bursaries or scholarships, have also become increasingly vulnerable as parents are now unable to compensate for the growing gap between maintenance loan value and real living costs. As a result, we have seen an increase in students undertaking additional work alongside their studies.\u201d The Russell Group is calling on the government to increase maintenance loans so they reflect actual inflation and to make the change in-year to help students who are struggling with the rising cost of living. University leaders also suggested a review of the parental earnings threshold, which has been frozen at \u00a325,000 since 2008, which means fewer students are entitled to the maximum level of support each year. Many would also like to see the reintroduction of maintenance grants for those in most need. The Russell Group chief executive, Dr Tim Bradshaw, said: \u201cStudents are struggling with the rising cost of living and while our members are doing what they can to help, including investing millions of pounds in hardship support, we are concerned about the impact on students\u2019 wellbeing and their studies. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly frustrating to see those challenges exacerbated by the use of a model that means students are set to be \u00a31,500 worse off next year, especially when it can be so easily fixed and it relates to a loan that is paid back by the student.\u201d A DfE spokesperson said the government increased the amount students can access through loans and grants for living and other costs every year, and universities could draw from a \u00a3261m fund for students facing hardship, which is available this academic year through the Office for Students."

            "title": "Inflation-driven higher education debt increases to hit millions of Australians",
            "date": "2023-01-27T23:00:03Z",
            "content": "Millions of Australians with Higher Education Loan Program (Help) loans could face thousands of dollars in extra debt this year as soaring inflation hits the education sector. Independent modelling provided to Guardian Australia suggests Australians with an average Help debt of $24,770.75 will face an increase of at least $1,700 when it is next indexed on 1 June, assuming, as is likely, that living costs remain high. The Higher Education Loan Program \u2013 previously the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (Hecs) - is tied to inflation, increasing proportionately in line with the consumer price index (CPI). Inflation is currently growing at 7.8% \u2013 the fastest pace since just before the 1990s recession. Indexation of debts occurs annually on 1 June. With inflation at its current rate, they\u2019re forecast to be indexed by at least 7%. A calculator developed by the Parliamentary Library for Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi shows a number of possible scenarios. Under the first scenario, in which the March 2023 quarterly growth rate is the average of the previous three-quarters (1.82%), the indexation rate would be 7.19%, meaning an average Hecs-Help debt would increase by $1,781.15. For the 585,000 people with debts in excess of $40,000 or more in 2021-2022, their debt would increase by $2,876.21. The second scenario places the March rate on par with the December quarter, which was slightly higher at 1.87%. In this instance, the indexation would be 7.20%, meaning an average Hecs-Help debt would increase by $1,784.50. Under the most conservative scenario where the growth rate is the same as the December quarter 2021 (1.34%), indexation would rise by 7.06%. This would cost students with an average debt an increase of $1,748.99. The Greens are calling for indexation on higher education debts to be scrapped, and for the minimum repayment income amount to be lifted in order to alleviate cost-of-living pressures on students and graduates. The compulsory Help repayment threshold currently sits at $48,361, with the amount required to be repaid adjusted upwards as income increases. The average Australian wage is currently $52,338. The Greens spokesperson for education, senator Mehreen Faruqi, said student debt had \u201cexploded\u201d over the past decade, while more graduates were bearing the burden of paying off loans. About 2.9 million Australians currently owe a share of more than $68.7bn under the Help. Data from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) shows that over the past two decades, the proportion of debts worth over $10,000 has steadily increased. In 2005, the percentage of Help debtors who owed more than $10,000 was 47.51%. It is now more than 72%. \u201cWe have to tackle this urgently,\u201d Faruqi said. \u201cThe government can\u2019t just shrug their shoulders and allow this to happen. We need swift intervention to address the student debt crisis impacting so many people.\u201d Faruqi introduced a private senator\u2019s bill into parliament in November that would abolish indexation on higher education debts and raise the minimum repayment income to the median wage. Before parliament rose in December, a Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee inquiry was established, with submissions closing on 24 February. \u201cAbolishing indexation on student debt and raising the minimum repayment threshold would be a good start, and provide much needed money in people\u2019s pockets at a time when they are struggling to make ends meet or pay rent,\u201d Faruqi said. \u201cUltimately, we have to treat education as a right, not a privilege, and make Tafe and university fee-free.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department of Education said the Job Ready Graduates Scheme, which sets out university funding, would be reviewed as part of the federal government\u2019s upcoming universities accord. \u201cHelp reduces the upfront cost barriers to education by providing income contingent loans allowing people to find better employment and increased wages,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe Help scheme does not require a person to make a repayment until they are earning above the minimum repayment threshold. \u201cPeople experiencing hardship are able to apply to the ATO to defer their repayments.\u201d"

            "title": "Australia\u2019s annual inflation hits 7.8% driven partly by surging electricity prices",
            "date": "2023-01-25T02:35:19Z",
            "content": "Inflation in Australia reached 7.8% in the year to December, in what economists and the federal government hope will be the peak for runaway prices. The consumer price index rose by 1.9% in the December quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed on Wednesday, driven by surging electricity prices and the cost of holiday travel and accommodation. The 7.8% annual rise is up on the September figure of 7.3% inflation, but just shy of the Reserve Bank\u2019s estimate that inflation would peak at 8%. It marks the highest inflation since 1990 despite hopes that a lower than expected figure in the month of October in part driven by easing shipping costs could mean inflation had peaked. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said inflation is \u201cunacceptably high\u201d and \u201cvery high by historical standards\u201d. Chalmers told reporters in Canberra this was \u201clikely the peak in inflation but we won\u2019t know that for sure until we get the numbers for this March quarter\u201d. The ABS said the past year had seen \u201cstrong quarterly rises off the back of higher prices for food, automotive fuel and new dwelling construction\u201d. The trimmed mean annual inflation, the measure of underlying inflation that excludes large price rises and falls, increased to 6.9%. Rising prices \u2013 especially energy and food prices \u2013 have prompted a series of eight consecutive interest rate rises from May 2022, as the RBA lifts the cash rate out of emergency levels to push inflation back towards its 2-3% target band. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Despite slowing inflation, economists at ANZ are tipping that the RBA will likely have three more 25 basis-point increases by May to bring the interest rate to 3.85% before the hikes end. In the year to December the most significant price rises were domestic and international holiday travel and accommodation, up 13.3% and 7.6% respectively; electricity, up 8.6%; services, up 5.5%, the highest rise since 2008; and new dwelling purchases by owner occupiers, up 1.7%. Chalmers noted the Australian Energy Market Operator had found that projected electricity prices \u201cfell steeply\u201d after the Albanese government\u2019s $1.5bn energy price relief package temporarily capped gas and thermal coal prices. Chalmers said this \u201cdirect link\u201d to Labor\u2019s policy showed the market intervention would \u201ctake some of the sting out of energy price rises anticipated in 2023\u201d. He said the direct benefit of the $1.5bn of consumer rebates will be passed on \u201cnot too much longer\u201d after the May budget. The ABS also reported \u201cstrong\u201d price rises in most food and non-food grocery products, although fruit and vegetable prices fell by 7.3% compared with the previous quarter. Rental price growth in Sydney and Melbourne continued to increase this quarter, with both cities recording their strongest annual rises since 2014 and 2015, the ABS said. Chalmers confirmed that rent assistance, along with jobseeker and single parent payments, remain under \u201cconstant review\u201d ahead of the May budget. In a statement on Wednesday, Chalmers said the figures \u201cdemonstrate the pressure on the budgets of Australian families brought about by the war in Ukraine, lingering pressures on global supply chains, and other challenges ignored for too long\u201d. \u201cOur economic plan will continue to focus on the inflation challenge, as well as growing the economy the right way in 2023,\u201d he said. \u201cWe understand Australians are doing it tough. That\u2019s why we will keep working hard to provide responsible cost-of-living relief, deliver the essential services people rely on, and build a stronger and more resilient economy for the future.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-02T11:12:13Z",
            "content": "Ever since a notorious chart showing that fewer people are having sex than ever before first made the rounds, there\u2019s been increased interest in the state of America\u2019s social health. Polling has demonstrated a marked decline in all spheres of social life, including close friendships, intimate relationships, trust, labor participation and community involvement. The continuing shift has been called the \u201cfriendship recession\u201d or the \u201csocial recession\u201d \u2013 and, although it will take years before this is clearly established, it was almost certainly worsened by the pandemic. The decline comes alongside a documented rise in mental illness, diseases of despair and poor health more generally. In August 2022, the CDC announced that US life expectancy had fallen to where it was in 1996. Contrast this to western Europe, where life expectancy has largely rebounded to pre-pandemic numbers. Even before the pandemic, the years 2015-2017 saw the longest sustained decline in US life expectancy since 1915-18, when the US was grappling with the 1918 flu and the first world war. The topic has directly or indirectly produced a whole genre of commentary from many different perspectives. Many of them touch on the fact that the internet is not being built with pro-social ends in mind. Increasingly monopolized across a few key entities, online life and its data have become the most sought-after commodity. The everyday person\u2019s attention has thus become the scarcest resource to be extracted. Other perspectives, often on the left, stress economic precarity and the decline of public spaces as causes of our rising anomie. Some of these same criticisms have been adopted by the new right, who additionally indict the culture at large for undermining traditions of sociality, be it gender norms or the family. Believing it disproportionately affects men, this position has produced many lifestylist spinoffs: Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW), trad-life nostalgia, inceldom, masculinist groups and hustle culture with a focus on \u201cbeating the rat race\u201d. All of these subcultures are symptoms of the social recession in some way, for better or worse. Pundits, politicians, bureaucrats and the like have generally fixated on the social recession\u2019s potential to incubate political extremism. Entire institutes have been set up to study, monitor and surveil the internet\u2019s radicalizing tendencies buoyed by anti-social loneliness. The new buzzword often used in this sphere is \u201cstochastic terrorism\u201d \u2013 meaning acts of violence indirectly motivated by messages of hate spread through mass communication \u2013 and much of this discussion has focused on the need to contain some unknown, dangerous element taking hold of the dispirited online. The goal here is not to solve a pernicious problem, but instead to pacify its most flagrant outbursts. We have no clear, comparative basis on which to judge what will emerge from the growing number of people who feel lost, lonely or invisible. The closest comparison comes from the early 20th century when, for the first time, millions of provincial people moved to major cities to pursue their dreams. Many uprooted themselves only to be poor and unfulfilled. In The Sleepwalkers (1930), the Austrian novelist Hermann Broch rooted his panorama of the first world war in \u201cthe loneliness of I\u201d. Likewise, nobody cares for Gregor Samsa in Franz Kafka\u2019s The Metamorphosis (1915), and poor Samsa is compelled to go to work despite not even recognizing himself any longer. In WH Auden\u2019s poem The Age of Anxiety (1948), he described the alienated product of mass industrial society: \u201cmiserable wicked me / how interesting I am\u201d. While data and polling have their limits, they are a useful starting point for concretely discussing the social recession and whether it\u2019s here to stay. The political scientist Robert D Putnam published his study Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community in 2000 to much praise for its breadth of research. The book documents the decline of sociability in the US since the 1950s by tracing the dwindling number of Americans frequenting religious and civic organizations, volunteer work, sports clubs, hobbyist groups and so on. The book was one of the first to quantitatively determine that, yes, the traditional American community was on the decline. It remains a staple in political science courses. Yet many of the metrics used in the study are today a bit dated. Even the title does not evoke the relevance it once did, since not even bowling has been spared the decline of social activities. Moreover, in the year 2000, it was far easier to see the trend as \u201cfixable\u201d because it was not overwhelmingly determined by any one factor. Putnam\u2019s work is an assessment of social life before the complete mass adoption of the internet. That world is clearly never coming back. If we take one metric commonly cited in the book, church membership, the decline Putnam describes is exceptionally mild compared to what came after. In 1999, according to Gallup, 70% of Americans reported belonging to a church, synagogue or mosque; by 2020 \u2013 two decades after Putnam\u2019s book \u2013 it was already down to 47%. It\u2019s also worth considering a simple metric: screen time, a proxy for time spent not doing community activities in person. Rather than bowling alone, Americans are instead browsing alone \u2013 over seven hours daily, on average, with the number rising every year. As of 2021, 31% of Americans claimed to be online \u201calmost constantly\u201d. If we are browsing alone rather than bowling alone, the real metric to look at is friendships themselves. The past few decades have recorded a steep decline in people\u2019s reported number of friends. The number of Americans who claim to have \u201cno close friends at all\u201d across all age groups now stands at around 12%, according to the Survey Center on American Life. By comparison, only 2% of Americans said they had no close friends in 2003, according to Gallup. Friendlessness is more common for men, but it is nonetheless affecting everyone. Although studies of the subject tend to be general estimates of the entire population, it looks worse when we focus on generations who grew up with the internet. When polling exclusively American millennials, a pre-pandemic 2019 YouGov poll found that 22% have \u201czero friends\u201d and 30% \u201cno best friends\u201d. For those born between 1997 and 2012 (Generation Z), there has been no widespread, credible study done yet on this question \u2013 but if you\u2019re adjacent to internet spaces, you already intuitively grasp that these same online catalysts are deepening for the next generation. Another concerning trend is so-called \u201clate adulthood\u201d, which has been particularly common among those born from the 1990s onward. The term refers to a delaying of traditional milestones of adulthood such as getting a driver\u2019s license, moving out, dating, starting work and so on. The trend became obvious starting in the 2010s. In 2019, it was compiled in a comprehensive study titled The Decline in Adult Activities Among US Adolescents, 1976-2016. The same paper found a similar decline in how often high schoolers went out without their parents. Some of this is not necessarily \u201cbad\u201d, and it\u2019s more symptomatic than anything else. For example, delayed adulthood is linked to less of a desire to engage in risky behavior like delinquency or excess drinking. While risk avoidance can be positive, however, it also tracks the decline in sociability and is therefore bundled with other personal costs. Mental health among people native to the internet continues to worsen amid an increase in so-called diseases of despair \u2013 substance abuse, suicidal ideation, etc \u2013 in the US more generally. These were the leading causes of the drop in life expectancy before the pandemic. Then there is the rapid increase in people who have had no sexual relations since they turned 18, in a time of unprecedented sex positivity no less. The writer Katherine Dee has flipped this common understanding, arguing that we\u2019re seeing a wave of disembodied \u201csexual negativity\u201d rather than free love. The results of that inversion are not unexpected. Although popular culture often paints a picture of hedonistic young people awash in app-aided sex and dating, the reality is that a disembodied and heavily online life produces less physical intimacy. Missing from all of this is the building block of society: trust. The past 50 years have seen America\u2019s transformation from a high-trust to a low-trust society, accompanied by a collapse of authority across all levels: social, political and institutional. In 2022, trust dropped to a new average low \u2013 a development that has been the trend since the 1970s. Americans do perceive that trust has diminished among the general population, according to Pew Research. The vast majority are \u201cworried about the declining level of trust in each other\u201d. Many also feel that they no longer recognize their own country, although that recording is probably caught up somewhat in political partisanship. The erosion of trust in the US began decades ago, after Watergate and the \u201ccrisis of confidence\u201d during the 1970s, but it binds our current time to a more familiar past cynicism. Skepticism toward the state has evolved into more generalized distrust of society at large, constantly amplified by the internet. From all this data we can sketch a new individual, a growing minority in our society: people who are plugged in, dispirited and often feel invisible. Carl Jung wrote that personal meaning comes \u201cwhen people feel they are living the symbolic life, that they are actors in the divine drama\u201d. In our increasingly frayed sociality, what often enters instead is nostalgia, exaggerated hatred and the desire to be saved. Right now, the dispirited are only beginning to agitate the political establishment, which is led mostly by people of an older generation socialized in a different way. The current US government has been called a gerontocracy and the \u201coldest government in [US] history\u201d. As of 2022, over 23% of members of Congress are over 70 years old, and the median age is 61.5. American political power has so far only sporadically felt the effects of the new individual at the ballot box, while at the same time chastising the public for it. The politics of the social recession have therefore only really just started. In his book The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium (2013), the media and political theorist Martin Gurri argues that the digital public lacks a coherent program and is motivated by negation and a desire to tear down idols and authority. We cannot expect the new individual to simply be contained to just his or her own alienation, pacified and alone. That alienation will inform beliefs on how society should be organized and will be the substance of some future worldview, whatever it may be. This process cannot be easily reverted. Nor can we expect political management from above to contain these asocial sentiments. The healthier alternative involves rethinking internet infrastructure to pro-social ends, with platforms owned by the people using them and designed with community prerogatives in mind. I\u2019m not going to pretend to know what that will look like, since much of it has to happen organically. While the trends described here may be a \u201cnew normal\u201d in the sense that they cannot be reversed, I still think another, more positive kind of online community is imaginable. The internet does not need to be joined at the hip to a permanent social recession. Anton Cebalo is a writer and historian.

            "title": "Global economy risks second recession within three years, warns World Bank",
            "date": "2023-01-10T14:30:13Z",
            "content": "Any fresh setback to a global economy already rapidly weakening as a result of high inflation, interest rates and war could result in a second recession within three years in 2023, the World Bank has warned. In its half-yearly health check, the Washington-based institution said it had cut its 2023 growth forecast from 2.9% to 1.7% after the risks it identified six months ago all materialised. The Bank\u2019s global economic prospects report said the tougher than anticipated anti-inflationary measures, persistently high energy prices and continued lockdowns in China had led to a much weaker outlook for this year than it had expected last summer. Almost every advanced country and nearly 70% of emerging and developing countries have had their growth forecasts cut. Given the fragility of the global economy, the World Bank said any new adverse development \u2013 such as higher than expected inflation, abrupt rises in interest rates to contain it, a resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic or escalating geopolitical tensions \u2013 could push the global economy into recession. Not since the 1930s have two global recessions occurred in the same decade. The World Bank\u2019s mission is to reduce poverty and its president, David Malpass, said the deterioration in the global economic outlook meant the crisis facing development was intensifying. \u201cEmerging and developing countries are facing a multi-year period of slow growth driven by heavy debt burdens and weak investment as global capital is absorbed by advanced economies faced with extremely high government debt levels and rising interest rates,\u201d he said. \u201cWeakness in growth and business investment will compound the already-devastating reversals in education, health, poverty, and infrastructure and the increasing demands from climate change.\u201d Malpass said the Bank\u2019s latest forecasts pointed to a sharp, long-lasting slowdown, with 2023 likely to be third-weakest year for global growth in the past three decades, overshadowed only by the recessions of 2009 and 2020. \u201cThe deterioration is broad based: in virtually all regions of the world, per capita income growth will be slower than it was during the decade before Covid-19. The setback to global prosperity will likely persist,\u201d the World Bank president added. Growth in the more prosperous advanced economies is projected to slow from 2.5% in 2022 to 0.5% in 2023, the World Bank said, adding that in the past two decades slowdowns on a similar scale had resulted in global recession. In the US, growth is forecast to fall to 0.5% in 2023 \u2013 1.9 percentage points below previous forecasts and the weakest performance outside official recessions since 1970. The eurozone is expected to have no growth in 2023 after a 1.9 percentage point cut, while China\u2019s growth forecast has been reduced by 0.9 points to 4.3%. Excluding China, growth in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) is expected to decelerate from 3.8% in 2022 to 2.7% in 2023. The Bank said that in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 which accounts for about 60% of the world\u2019s extreme poor \u2013 growth in per capita income over 2023-24 is expected to average just 1.2%, a rate that could cause poverty rates to rise, not fall. In fragile and conflict-affected countries, per capita incomes are expected to decline by 2024. Malpass said investment growth in EMDEs was predicted to be 3.5% a year between 2022 and 2024 \u2013 half the average rate of increase seen in the previous two decades. Much-needed capital was being diverted to richer countries, he added. \u201cTotal debt among EMDEs is at a 50-year high, and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has added major new costs. This leaves no room for fiscal support at a time when people are still suffering from Covid-related setbacks in health, education and nutrition,\u201d Malpass said."

            "title": "Impending UK recession could be twice as bad as anticipated, say analysts",
            "date": "2023-01-23T00:01:07Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s impending recession could be twice as bad as previously thought, according to leading economic forecasters at the business consultancy EY. Reduced government support, higher taxes and an overall worsening outlook have all led the firm\u2019s analysts to conclude that the next three years could be worse than they anticipated three months ago. In October, EY\u2019s Item Club had predicted a 0.3% contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) this year, followed by 2.4% growth next year and a 2.3% rise in 2025. But in an updated forecast released on Monday, it said GDP would drop 0.7% this year, followed by growth of 1.9% and 2.2% over the next two years. The downgrade is at odds with recently published economic data and the sentiment coming out of the World Economic Forum in Davos, which suggested the global outlook was not quite as grim as first feared. In recent weeks the FTSE 100 has neared its highest level ever. \u201cThe UK\u2019s economic outlook has become gloomier than forecast in the autumn, and the UK may already be in what has been one of the mostly widely anticipated recessions in living memory,\u201d said EY\u2019s UK chair, Hywel Ball. Ball said that while the recession could cut deeper than previously thought, it would not necessarily last longer than earlier forecasts noted. EY said it was still unclear if the country was already in recession \u2013 as defined by two quarters of consecutive GDP contraction. While the economy shrank in the third quarter of last year, GDP figures released this month showed that the economy grew unexpectedly in November by 0.1%, leading some economists to think the fourth quarter might be positive. Despite this EY said the UK was still expected to hit recession this year, shrinking during the first half of 2023, before returning to growth during the summer. The recession would probably also prove less damaging for the economy than the recessions of the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, it added. \u201cThe one silver lining is that, despite being a deeper recession than previously forecast, it won\u2019t necessarily be a longer one,\u201d Ball said. \u201cThe economy is still expected to return to growth during the second half of 2023 and has been spared any significant new external shocks in the last three months from energy prices, Covid-19 or geopolitics. Meanwhile, the chief headwind to activity over the last year \u2013 high and rising inflation \u2013 may be starting to retreat, while energy prices are falling too.\u201d The economists forecast that inflation would hit 7.2% this year on average, including a big jump when the government\u2019s energy support scheme becomes \u00a3500 a year less generous for the typical household from the start of April."

            "date": "2023-01-02T04:22:14Z",
            "content": "For much of the global economy, 2023 is going to be a tough year as the main engines of global growth \u2013 the US, Europe and China \u2013 all experience weakening activity, the head of the International Monetary Fund has warned. The new year is going to be \u201ctougher than the year we leave behind,\u201d IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said on the CBS Sunday morning news program Face the Nation on Sunday. \u201cWhy? Because the three big economies \u2013 the US, EU and China \u2013 are all slowing down simultaneously,\u201d she said. \u201cWe expect one-third of the world economy to be in recession. Even countries that are not in recession, it would feel like recession for hundreds of millions of people,\u201d she added. In October, the IMF cut its outlook for global economic growth in 2023, reflecting the continuing drag from the war in Ukraine as well as inflation pressures and the high interest rates engineered by central banks like the US Federal Reserve aimed at bringing those price pressures to heel. Georgieva said that China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, is likely to grow at or below global growth for the first time in 40 years as Covid-19 cases surge following the dismantling of its ultra-strict zero-Covid policy. \u201cFor the first time in 40 years, China\u2019s growth in 2022 is likely to be at or below global growth,\u201d Georgieva said. Moreover, a \u201cbushfire\u201d of expected Covid infections there in the months ahead are likely to further hit its economy and drag on both regional and global growth, said Georgieva, who traveled to China on IMF business late last month. \u201cFor the next couple of months, it would be tough for China, and the impact on Chinese growth would be negative, the impact on the region will be negative, the impact on global growth will be negative,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, Georgieva said, the US economy is standing apart and may avoid the outright contraction that is likely to afflict as much as a third of the world\u2019s economies. The \u201cUS is most resilient,\u201d she said, and it \u201cmay avoid recession. We see the labour market remaining quite strong.\u201d \u201cThis is \u2026 a mixed blessing because if the labour market is very strong, the Fed may have to keep interest rates tighter for longer to bring inflation down,\u201d Georgieva said. The US job market will be a central focus for Federal Reserve officials who would like to see demand for labour slacken to help undercut price pressures. The first week of the new year brings a raft of key data on the employment front, including Friday\u2019s monthly nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show the US economy minted another 200,000 jobs in December and the jobless rate remained at 3.7% \u2013 near the lowest since the 1960s.

            "content": "Time to wrap up, after a busy day in which the UK economy showed a little more strength than expected. A shame we can\u2019t have the World Cup every month. Here are today\u2019s stories, first on the November GDP report: Goodnight, and have a lovely weekend. Back next week, when it\u2019s the World Economic Forum in Davos\u2026 GW It\u2019s been a busy week for retail news, with a flurry of updates from major shopping chains and supermarket giants. Several did better than expected, despite the squeeze on incomes, while online specialists suffered from postal strikes and shortages of van drivers My colleague Sarah Butler has looked at the things we\u2019ve learned, here. As well as predicting a \u2018mild recession\u2019, JP Morgan has also slashed bonuses for investment bankers by 30% after a slump in takeover deals. Wall Street\u2019s largest lender reported a 22% drop in full-year profits to $38bn (\u00a331bn) on Friday, having suffered the ripple effects of the economic slowdown linked to the war in Ukraine, my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff writes. Some of its largest losses for 2022 were recorded in its investment bank, with a 58% drop in fees from dealmaking in the fourth quarter alone, contributing to a 29% decline in the division\u2019s annual profits to $15bn. JP Morgan\u2019s chair and chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said investment banking fees were \u201cdown significantly in a challenging environment\u201d. More here. The UK recession is delayed, not cancelled, fears Paul Dales of Capital Economics. Following the better-than-expected 0.1% growth in November, Dales says: It\u2019s starting to feel like a recession will never happen, but it will. Admittedly, the government may be absorbing more of the hit to national income from the surge in the cost of energy imports than we expected. The total reduction in national income may be smaller than we previously thought too. But we know that the surge in inflation and rise in interest rates will eventually hurt households and businesses. As such, we still think there will be a recession. It\u2019s just starting later than we thought and may be a bit smaller. In the markets, the UK FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares touched its highest level since May 2018 this morning. The FTSE 100 traded as high as 7847, nearing the record high of 7,903 set on 22nd May 2018, led by healthcare, financials, industrials and basic materials stocks. Hopes that the global inflation shock has peaked have lifted global markets this week. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says: \u201cA decent showing on Wall Street following news that US consumer prices dropped in December helped to lift investor sentiment in Asia and Europe on Friday. Investors are desperate for inflation to ease back so that central banks no longer have a reason to keep putting up interest rates Smashing through the alltime high would give overseas investors another reason to start looking more seriously at UK stocks, Mould explains: \u201cAfter the Brexit vote, UK stocks were off the menu for many international investors and valuations plummeted. This remained the case for some time until some canny players realised the opportunities to be had, leading to a wave of takeovers \u2013 decent businesses picked up on the cheap. Wall Street isn\u2019t making such a decent showing today, alas, after JP Morgan said it now expects a mild recession. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has just fallen by 250 points, or 0.7%, at the open to 33939 points, with the broader S&amp;P 500 share index down 0.77%. Wall Street bank JP Morgan has revealed that a \u2018mild recession\u2019 is now the central case in its macroeconomic outlook. Announcing its latest financial results, JP Morgan says it has set aside another $1.4bn to cover credit losses. It says: The net reserve build in the current quarter included $1.0 billion in Consumer and $343 million in Wholesale, driven by a modest deterioration in the Firm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook, now reflecting a mild recession in the central case. CEO Jamie Dimon said the US economy currently remains strong with consumers still spending excess cash and businesses healthy. But he warned that the economy faces headwinds, including from inflation and the Ukraine war: However, we still do not know the ultimate effect of the headwinds coming from geopolitical tensions including the war in Ukraine, the vulnerable state of energy and food supplies, persistent inflation that is eroding purchasing power and has pushed interest rates higher, and the unprecedented quantitative tightening. We remain vigilant and are prepared for whatever happens, so we can serve our customers, clients and communities around the world across a broad range of economic environments The UK economy is still under \u201cimmense strain\u201d, despite the pick-up in growth in November, says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for UK &amp; EMEA at trading firm OANDA. He fears the recession is only \u2018delayed\u2019 by the pick-up in activity in November. The optimists may put to some of the recent data as an indication of some resilience in the economy but I\u2019m not convinced. Take the UK, for example. It may not be in a technical recession afterall, with spending around the World Cup enabling a better performance in November, delivering growth of 0.1% after a 0.5% gain in October. Aside from the fact that December could be worse as a result, or some of those gains could be revised out, those numbers don\u2019t change the reality of the cost-of-living crisis and if accurate, it more likely reflects shifted spending patterns as opposed to a more willing consumer. A recession may be delayed but the economy is still under immense strain. The Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, is expected to have his pay cut by almost 50% this year to about $49m (\u00a340m) after the billionaire boss asked the company to \u201cadjust his compensation\u201d in the light of feedback from shareholders disappointed at the fall in the company\u2019s share price. Cook, 62, who became CEO after the death of the co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011, was paid $99.4m in 2022 and $98.8m in 2021. But the company said in a regulatory filing late on Thursday night that it had set a \u201ctarget compensation\u201d of $49m for 2023. \u201cThe compensation committee balanced shareholder feedback, Apple\u2019s exceptional performance, and a recommendation from Mr Cook to adjust his compensation in light of the feedback received,\u201d Apple said in the filing. Cook\u2019s annual base salary and bonus will remain unchanged at $3m and $6m respectively. But the \u201ctargeted\u201d amount he will be given in share-based bonuses will fall from $75m last year to $40m this coming year. The amount given in share bonuses will also be more dependent on Apple\u2019s share price performance than it was last year. Now 75% of the share bonus is dependent on Apple\u2019s stock market performance, up from 50% last year. Apple\u2019s shares have fallen by 23% over the past 12 months to $133.41 at the close on Thursday, raising concerns among some shareholders. More here. In another encouraging economic sign this morning, Eurozone industrial production rose more than expected in November. Industrial production jumped by 1.0% in the euro area, statistics body Eurostat reports, which is twice as fast as economists predicted. With Germany possibly avoiding a recession this winter (see earlier post), this could indicate Europe\u2019s economy ended 2022 a little stronger than feared. Separate data this morning shows that the eurozone\u2019s trade deficit in goods narrowed month-on-month in November, as energy prices fell. Ken Wattret, head of European analysis and insights at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says it\u2019s now a close call whether the eurozone can avoid recession. Activity data, surveys and nowcasts all suggest it\u2019s a close call. However, whether GDP is slightly up or slightly down is not so important. The key point, thankfully, is that the risk of a severe recession, and its numerous knock-on effects, has markedly diminished. Today\u2019s UK GDP figures once again underline the importance of hospitality in driving economic growth and recovery, says UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. Nicholls adds: \u201cThe World Cup provided a significant boost in November, with pubs and bars reporting sales up 30-40% on matchdays. This once again shows the power of big sporting events, even in the winter, and the important role our venues play in bringing communities together. \u201cHowever, the figures also highlight the impact strike action had on the sector and the cost of lost sales is likely to be set out more starkly in next month\u2019s figures. The UK outlook \u201cundoubtedly looks bad\u201d, but ING\u2019s developed markets economist James Smith cautions against \u201coverdoing the pessimism\u201d. Smith predicts that the economy may be flat in the last quarter of 2022 \u2013 avoiding a technical recession. But, he forecasts a decline in growth in the first quarter of 2023, with a \u2018mild recession\u2019 likely. Smith writes: Growth of 0.1% in November means that overall fourth-quarter GDP will most likely come in flat, though this says more about distortions and extra Bank Holidays than economic outperformance. First-quarter data is likely to show a more meaningful decline in output. \u201cPredicting the depth of any recession is difficult \u2013 not least because so-called \u2018non-linearities\u2019 tend to kick in when past excesses are exposed or job cuts begin to spread across industries. But for now, we agree with those looking for a mild recession by historical standards. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a peak-to-trough fall in GDP of a little more than 1.5%, which would match closest with the early 1990s recession in terms of scale, if not the surrounding circumstances. And despite the UK\u2019s many woes, particularly in the jobs market, we aren\u2019t convinced Britain will be a serious outlier from the rest of Europe on the hit to GDP this year, even if it probably does sit in the bottom half of the pack. \u201cOur forecasts show the UK is likely to be towards the bottom of the pack this year when it comes to growth, for many of the reasons discussed here. But we\u2019d emphasise that it doesn\u2019t look like an extreme outlier either. Our growth projections for later in 2023 \u2013 measured by 3Q23/3Q22 year-on-year growth \u2013 show Britain (-1.4%) underperforming the eurozone as a whole (-0.7%) but with a lower hit than Germany (-1.8%).\u201d Jeremy Hunt\u2019s response (see here) to this morning\u2019s GDP data suggests the chancellor is not getting carried away by the performance of the economy in November, and wisely so, our economics editor Larry Elliott writes: As the Treasury pointed out, the International Monetary Fund is predicting that a third of the world economy will be in recession this year and the UK could clearly be one of the countries affected. Even if the economy has so far avoided recession \u2013 and that remains touch and go \u2013 it doesn\u2019t mean it will necessarily continue to do so in the face of rising interest rates and higher taxes over the coming months. There is also the little matter of the brutal squeeze on living standards caused by wages rising less quickly than prices. The Resolution Foundation thinktank says typical household disposable incomes are on course to drop by 7% \u2013 or \u00a32,100 \u2013 this year. So even if the economy is not actually in recession, for many people it will still feel like it. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s analysis: The UK government\u2019s most senior economic adviser has been hired by the OECD as its chief economist, in the first time a British person has held the role for 30 years. Clare Lombardelli, the chief economic adviser to the Treasury, will take the position at the Paris-based club of wealthy nations after the Spring budget. Representing 38 of the world\u2019s leading economies, the OECD acts as a powerful forum for developing economic policy and setting international standards, including efforts to combat tax evasion and agreeing a global minimum corporation tax. Lombardelli will lead the OECD\u2019s economic work, replacing France\u2019s Laurence Boone, who left the organisation last summer to join Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government as Europe minister after four years in the role. Her appointment comes as many of the world\u2019s leading economies slump into recession amid sky-high inflation fuelled by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the fallout from the Covid pandemic, including in Britain. Taking the role will come with delicate subjects for the outgoing top civil servant to handle, with the OECD among leading international bodies to highlight the self-inflicted economic damage of Brexit and Britain\u2019s lacklustre growth performance on the world stage in recent months. She also departs the Treasury after a period of intense political pressure, as a focal point for criticism of under Liz Truss\u2019 brief premiership, before the disaster of the mini budget. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said Lombardelli was an \u201cexceptional civil servant\u201d who provided clear and level-headed advice. Hunt said: \u201cI congratulate Clare on her well-deserved appointment. It\u2019s great to have a Brit in the role and look forward to working with her in the future.\u201d A former Bank of England economist, Lombardelli has worked in government since 2005, including as principal private secretary to the chancellor, to the prime minister, and budget director. She has also worked as a technical adviser to the International Monetary Fund. Strike action will have hit UK GDP in December, points out Sam Miley, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. Miley also flags that manufacturing contracted (by 0.5%) in November, while construction stalled. \u201cThe UK economy unexpectedly grew in November, driven by an expansion in the services sector. Beneath the headline growth, there remains evidence of various headwinds impacting the economy, with a sharp monthly decline in manufacturing output being accompanied by a flatlining construction sector. Despite monthly growth in both October and November, a quarterly contraction in Q4 is still a possibility. In addition to continuing consumer and business pressures, the wave of industrial action witnessed at the end of 2022 will also have a downward effect on December\u2019s GDP figures.\u201d NIESR, the economic thinktank, predict the UK economy shrank slightly in December, but not by enough to pull the economy into a recession. We also have new economic data from Germany, showing that Europe\u2019s largest economy probably stalled in the last quarter of 2022. The German economy likely stagnated in the final quarter of last year and grew by 1.9% over the full-year 2022, the Federal Statistics Office said on Friday. That suggest Europe\u2019s largest economy may just escape a recession over the winter, despite the economic pain from higher energy prices. The 1.9% rise in Germany\u2019s GDP in 2022 is slightly above forecasts \u2013 a Reuters poll of economists predicted 1.8% growth last year. In the City, the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 share index has hit its highest level since May 2018. The blue-chip share index has hit 7847 points, up 0.7% this morning, approaching the alltime intraday record high of 7903 set on 22 May 2018. Industrial technology firm Rolls-Royce are the top riser, up 2.4%. Banks and mining companies are also in the top risers, European equities are also rallying, after data yesterday showed that US inflation had cooled last month. US CPI fell to 6.5% in the year to December, down from 7.1% in November, bolstering hopes that the Federal Reserve will slow the pace of interest-rate hikes. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says markets are beneiftting from China\u2019s relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions, which may spur demand for energy and commodities. A fresh all-time high for the index in this kind of macro environment probably reflects a bit of defensiveness among global investors, a hunt for yield, relative cheapness and a weaker pound (in dollar terms we are a long way off the all-time high), a belief the Fed is almost done with rate hikes as inflation peaks, and hopes that China\u2019s reopening will drive the commodity and energy sectors. Investors have also trimmed their forecasts for how high UK interest rates will rise this year. They are now seen peaking below 4.5%, up from 3.5% at present. A lower peak would support economic growth. So far this year, the FTSE 100 has already gained over 5%. In 2022 it gained almost 1%, while global markets tumbled around 20%. The UK is likely to have avoided a 2022 recession thanks to the \u201csurprise economic growth\u201d of 0.1% in November, says the Resolution Foundation. But they also warn that \u201cthe risk of recession still looms large\u201d as the Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility both forecast the economy will shrink in the first half of 2023. Resolution also points out that family incomes are still shrinking, with typical household disposable incomes on track to fall by 7% \u2013 equivalent to \u00a32,100 per household \u2013 over this financial year and the next one. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, explains: \u201cSurprise economic growth in November \u2013 driven by the UK\u2019s dominant services sector \u2013 means Britain has likely avoided a rapid return to recession in 2022. \u201cBut while GDP may not have been shrinking, household incomes certainly were \u2013 and are \u2013 as families experience a deep living standards downturn.\u201d The UK economy grew by 0.1% in November as consumers headed to the shops in the run-up to Christmas and pubs and bars enjoyed a boost from the World Cup. It was a slowdown compared with 0.5% growth in October, when the economy rebounded from a weak September, when many businesses closed for the Queen\u2019s funeral. It was, however, better than forecasts, with City economists predicting the economy would shrink by 0.2 % in November. The onset of a recession in the manufacturing sector limited the strength of the economy and meant that over the three months to November the economy contracted by 0.3%, according to the Office for National Statistics. The ONS said mining and construction also offset the effect of the decline in manufacturing. The Bank of England has warned that the UK is probably set for a long recession, as defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction. The economy shrank by 0.3% in the third quarter between July and September, and figures for the October to December period will be published next month, confirming whether or not the economy entered recession at that point. Thomas Pugh, economist at audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK, says the UK\u2019s recession has been delayed, not cancelled. And he points out that a 0.1% rise in GDP doesn\u2019t feel much different than a fall of 0.1%: \u2018The surprise 0.1% m/m rise in GDP in November (consensus -0.3% m/m) means there is now a chance that overall growth in Q4 might be positive if GDP falls by less than 0.4% m/m in December. That would mean the official definition of a recession of two consecutive quarters of negative growth might not be met until Q2 of this year. \u2018Of course, that doesn\u2019t change much on the ground. For businesses operating in the real economy a rise in GDP of 0.1% doesn\u2019t feel much different to a drop in GDP of 0.1%. But a milder recession would mean that unemployment rises more slowly, wage growth stays strong and domestically generated inflation falls more slowly than expected. This could result in the Bank of England (BoE) raising rates by more than expected. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is concerned that growth was \u2018on the floor\u2019 in the three months to November, with GDP falling by 0.3% during the period. That contraction was partly caused by the bank holiday in September for Queen Elizabeth\u2019s state funeral. GDP fell by 0.8% in September. Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, thinks the Bank of England could be spurred to raise interest rates again next month by the surprise growth in November. Ussher says: \u201cThis is stronger activity than was expected for November and so will further contribute to the improvement in market sentiment we have seen in the last few weeks. Given we know the economy also grew in October \u2013 albeit driven by a rebound from the period of state mourning \u2013 it is no longer certain that the economy will meet the technical definition of a recession when the final data for 2022 is in. \u201cToday\u2019s better-than-expected data will be encouraging for businesses, but may also cause a cautious Bank of England to continue raising rates unnecessarily when they meet in early February. The risk now is that rates will rise too far if inflation is already on a downward path due to changes in global energy prices.\u201d A drop in Covid-19 vaccinations weighed on UK economic growth in November. The ONS reports that NHS Test and Trace and COVID-19 vaccination programme activity fell by 63% in November 2022, following increases in September and October. This was driven by a fall in vaccine activity as the autumn booster programme slowed down. It began in early September. Overall, NHS Test and Trace and the COVID-19 vaccination programme contributed an estimated negative 0.2 percentage points to monthly GDP growth, the ONS explains. Economist Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at financial services giant Allianz, tweets there are three key messages from the UK GDP report. Namely, growth was higher than expected; the services sector is driving it; and the jobs market looks relatively tight: The surprising rise in GDP in November suggests that the economy is proving more resilient than many had feared, says Suren Thiru, economics director at ICAEW (the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales): But, Thiru fears November\u2019s growth will only delay the recession, saying: A strong boost to consumer activity from the World Cup helped lift overall activity. The positive November outturn delays rather than diminishes the prospect of recession with soaring inflation, higher unemployment, rising interest rates and taxes likely to suffocate activity for much of this year.\u201d Capital Economics\u2019 senior UK economist, Ruth Gregory, says the UK may avoid a recession in 2022, thanks to the \u201cundeniably encouraging\u201d news that the economy grew slightly in November. The small 0.1% month-on-month gain in real GDP in November suggests the economy \u201cwas not as weak in Q4 as we had previously thought\u201d, Gregory says. But 2023 will still be tough, she adds: But even if the economy does a bit better than expected in Q4, it is at best stagnating. And it is too soon to conclude the economy will be able to get through this period of high interest rates and high inflation largely unscathed. We still think a recession is on its way in the first half of 2023. Does the unexpected growth in November mean the UK could have avoided falling into recession at the end of last year? It all depends on how the economy fared in December. ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan has told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that if GDP falls by 0.6% or more in December, that would mean the economy contracted in the fourth quarter of 2022. That would be the second quarterly contraction in a row \u2013 a technical recession. Morgan says: If all else is equal, so no revisions to earlier months, for quarter four to be negative the economy has to fall by at least 0.6% [in December]. The ONS will release GDP data for December, and for the fourth-quarter of 2022, on February 10th, Morgan adds. Growth at telecommunications and computer programming companies helped the UK economy to expand, just 0.1%, in November, says ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan. Pubs and bars also did well as people went out to watch World Cup games, he explains, with England and Wales both playing in Qatar. But this was \u201cpartially offset\u201d by further falls in some manufacturing industries, including the pharmaceutical industry (where output can be erratic). Strikes also hit the transport and postal sectors, Morgan says, adding: \u201cOver the last three months, however, the economy still shrank \u2013 mainly due to the impact of the extra bank holiday for the funeral of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth in September.\u201d Jeremy Hunt, Chancellor of the Exchequer, says: \u201cWe have a clear plan to halve inflation this year - an insidious hidden tax which has led to hikes in interest rates and mortgage costs, holding back growth here and around the world. \u201cTo support families through this tough patch, we will provide an average of \u00a33,500 support for every household over this year and next - but the most important help we can give is to stick to the plan to halve inflation this year so we get the economy growing again.\u201d The UK\u2019s services sector grew by 0.2% during November, with the men\u2019s World Cup in Qatar providing a boost to pubs and bars, as supporters gathered to watch games. But manufacturing continued to struggle, with its output falling by 0.5%. The construction sector stagnated. Here\u2019s the details of how the UK economy performed in November, from the Office for National Statistics: The services sector grew by 0.2% in November 2022, after growth of 0.7% (revised up from a growth 0.6% in our previous publication) in October 2022; the largest contributions came from administrative and support service activities and information and communication. Output in consumer-facing services grew by 0.4% in November 2022, following growth of 1.5% (revised up from a growth of 1.2% in our previous publication) in October 2022; the largest contribution to growth came from food and beverage service activities in a month where the FIFA World Cup started. Production output decreased by 0.2% in November 2022, after a fall of 0.1% (revised down from flat in our previous publication) in October 2022; manufacturing was the main driver of negative production growth in November 2022, partially offset by a positive contribution from mining and quarrying. The construction sector was flat in November 2022 after growth of 0.4% (revised down from growth of 0.8% in our previous publication) in October 2022. Monthly GDP is now estimated to be 0.3% below its pre-Covid-19 levels in February 2020, the ONS says. Breaking: the UK economy grew slightly in November, better than City economists expected [they had forecast a 0.2% contraction]. The Office for National Statistics reports that UK GDP rose by 0.1% in November, a slowdown on the 0.5% growth recorded in October. But \u201clooking at the broader picture\u201d, the ONS adds, GDP fell by 0.3% in the three months to November 2022. Here\u2019s Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, on the UK GDP data due in around 10 minutes\u2026 This morning we get the latest November GDP numbers for the UK economy, which are expected to point to the UK economy already being in a modest recession. With the economy contracting in Q3, it is quite likely we might see a further contraction in Q4. Monthly GDP in October rose by 0.5%, although on a rolling 3-month basis the economy contracted by -0.3%. This rolling 3-month figure isn\u2019t expected to change in this morning\u2019s November numbers with another figure of -0.3%, while the monthly number is expected to decline by -0.2%. All sectors of the economy are forecast to show a contraction in November, manufacturing and industrial production are expected to slow by -0.2%, construction output by -0.3% and index of services of -0.1%. This is perhaps why the pound has underperformed in recent days, in that markets feel the Bank of England doesn\u2019t have as much scope to raise rates given how fragile the UK economy appears to be, with both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank considered to have more headroom. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. We\u2019re about to learn how well, or badly, the UK economy fared in November, as the recession looms. The Office for National Statistics is due to release its GDP monthly estimate for November at 7am. Economists predict the UK economy shrank by around 0.2% in November, after better-than-expected growth of 0.5% in October. A fall in GDP in November wouldn\u2019t officially put the UK into a technical recession \u2013 defined as shrinking for two consecutive quarters \u2013 but it could signal that one is close. UK GDP did fall in the third quarter of 2022, by 0.3%, so a contraction in the October-December quarter would mean a recession (we\u2019ll get Q4 data in a month\u2019s time). Soaring energy prices have hit the economy, weakening consumer spending as the cost of living crisis left consumers with less to spend. Alvin Tan of RBC Capital Markets told clients: We expect that GDP contracted again in November. Retail sales have provided a good guide to the pattern of activity of late, and they fell by 0.4% m/m in November. Analysts at investment bank Nomura also predicted a month-on-month contraction in November, saying: \u201cWe think that GDP is due a fall bearing in mind the weaker surveys and higher inflation, and as such forecast a 0.3 per cent m-o-m drop in November.\u201d UK housebuilders have warned this week that demand slowed last autumn, as the turmoil following the mini-budget.

            "date": "2023-01-22T16:32:15Z",
            "content": "A new search of Joe Biden\u2019s home in Wilmington, Delaware, by the US justice department found six more items, including documents with classification markings, a lawyer for the president said in a statement on Saturday night. Some of the classified documents and \u201csurrounding materials\u201d dated from Biden\u2019s tenure in the Senate, where he represented Delaware from 1973 to 2009, according to his lawyer, Bob Bauer. Other documents were from his tenure as vice-president in the Obama administration, from 2009 through 2017, Bauer said. The justice department, which conducted a search on Friday that lasted more than 12 hours, also took some notes that Biden had personally handwritten as vice-president, according to the lawyer. The president offered access \u201cto his home to allow DoJ [Department of Justice] to conduct a search of the entire premises for potential vice-presidential records and potential classified material\u201d, Bauer said. Neither Biden nor his wife were present during the search, the attorney said. Biden is in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, for the weekend. Justice department investigators coordinated the search with Biden\u2019s lawyers ahead of time, Bauer said, and the president\u2019s personal and White House lawyers were present at the time. Other classified government records were discovered this month at Biden\u2019s Wilmington residence, and in November at a private office he maintained at a Washington DC thinktank after ending his tenure as vice-president in the Obama administration in 2017. On Saturday, Bauer did not make clear in his statement where in the Wilmington home the documents were found. The previous classified documents were found in the home\u2019s garage and in a nearby storage space. The search shows federal investigators are swiftly moving forward with the investigation into classified documents found in Biden\u2019s possession. This month, the attorney general, Merrick Garland, named a special counsel to investigate the matter. That special counsel, Robert Hur, is investigating how the president and his team handled Obama-era classified documents that were recently found in Biden\u2019s private possession. Biden\u2019s lawyers found all the documents discovered before Friday\u2019s search by the justice department, according to the White House. The latest search was the first time federal law enforcement authorities have conducted a search for government documents at Biden\u2019s private addresses, according to information released publicly. Republicans have compared the investigation to the ongoing inquiry into how former president Donald Trump handled classified documents after his presidency. The White House has noted that Biden\u2019s team has cooperated with authorities in their investigation and had turned over those documents. Trump resisted doing so until an FBI search in August at his Florida resort. The search escalates the legal and political stakes for the president, who has insisted that the previous discovery of classified material at his home and former office would eventually be deemed inconsequential. Biden said on Thursday he had \u201cno regrets\u201d about not publicly disclosing before the midterm elections the discovery of classified documents at his former office and he believed the matter would be resolved. \u201cThere is no there, there,\u201d Biden told reporters during a trip to California on Thursday. Since the discovery of Biden\u2019s documents, Trump has complained that justice department investigators were treating his successor differently. \u201cWhen is the FBI going to raid the many homes of Joe Biden, perhaps even the White House?\u201d Trump said in a social media post earlier this month. At last Friday afternoon\u2019s White House press briefing, reporters asked if the fact that Biden was going to his beach house rather than his main Delaware house that afternoon, for the weekend, was related to the classified documents situation, and the press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, declined to comment, deflecting all questions to the justice department or the office of the White House counsel. With the timeline now emerging, it appears that officials would have been at his Wilmington, Delaware, house at that time, with a 12-hour search under way, with the president\u2019s permission to enter the house. Last August, the FBI raided Donald Trump\u2019s residence in Mar-a-Lago complex after having not been given agreement by the former president to search the premises, and they found boxes of top secret documents that are now part of a criminal investigation. Biden voluntarily allowed the FBI into his home, but the lack of a search warrant did not dim the extraordinary nature of the search. The Senate majority whip, Dick Durbin, on Sunday called the withholding of any classified documents by a president or a former president \u201coutrageous\u201d. In relation to the Biden-related discovery, Durbin told CNN\u2019s State of the Union politics show: \u201cTo think that any of them [classified documents] ended up in boxes in storage is unacceptable.\u201d But he added that Biden \u201cshowed total cooperation in this effort, in sharp contrast to Donald Trump\u201d. The South Carolina congresswoman Nancy Mace, a moderate Republican, lamented that Biden had been in possession of the documents for five years, after he vacated the vice-presidency alongside then president Barack Obama as they left the White House and handed it over to the administration of Donald Trump in 2017. \u201cFor five years the [Biden] documents were hidden and no one knew about it,\u201d Mace told NBC\u2019s Meet The Press show on Sunday morning, adding that their presence emerged in November but it took another two months for the Biden White House to acknowledge the documents to the public. She argued that the authorities knew that Trump had classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd pointed out, however, that Trump had defied subpoenas to hand over the documents and it took a criminal warrant and a raid for the authorities to get hold of them. \u201cI want to see the current and former president treated equally, with transparency and accountability,\u201d Mace said."

            "date": "2023-01-02T11:12:13Z",
            "content": "Ever since a notorious chart showing that fewer people are having sex than ever before first made the rounds, there\u2019s been increased interest in the state of America\u2019s social health. Polling has demonstrated a marked decline in all spheres of social life, including close friendships, intimate relationships, trust, labor participation and community involvement. The continuing shift has been called the \u201cfriendship recession\u201d or the \u201csocial recession\u201d \u2013 and, although it will take years before this is clearly established, it was almost certainly worsened by the pandemic. The decline comes alongside a documented rise in mental illness, diseases of despair and poor health more generally. In August 2022, the CDC announced that US life expectancy had fallen to where it was in 1996. Contrast this to western Europe, where life expectancy has largely rebounded to pre-pandemic numbers. Even before the pandemic, the years 2015-2017 saw the longest sustained decline in US life expectancy since 1915-18, when the US was grappling with the 1918 flu and the first world war. The topic has directly or indirectly produced a whole genre of commentary from many different perspectives. Many of them touch on the fact that the internet is not being built with pro-social ends in mind. Increasingly monopolized across a few key entities, online life and its data have become the most sought-after commodity. The everyday person\u2019s attention has thus become the scarcest resource to be extracted. Other perspectives, often on the left, stress economic precarity and the decline of public spaces as causes of our rising anomie. Some of these same criticisms have been adopted by the new right, who additionally indict the culture at large for undermining traditions of sociality, be it gender norms or the family. Believing it disproportionately affects men, this position has produced many lifestylist spinoffs: Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW), trad-life nostalgia, inceldom, masculinist groups and hustle culture with a focus on \u201cbeating the rat race\u201d. All of these subcultures are symptoms of the social recession in some way, for better or worse. Pundits, politicians, bureaucrats and the like have generally fixated on the social recession\u2019s potential to incubate political extremism. Entire institutes have been set up to study, monitor and surveil the internet\u2019s radicalizing tendencies buoyed by anti-social loneliness. The new buzzword often used in this sphere is \u201cstochastic terrorism\u201d \u2013 meaning acts of violence indirectly motivated by messages of hate spread through mass communication \u2013 and much of this discussion has focused on the need to contain some unknown, dangerous element taking hold of the dispirited online. The goal here is not to solve a pernicious problem, but instead to pacify its most flagrant outbursts. We have no clear, comparative basis on which to judge what will emerge from the growing number of people who feel lost, lonely or invisible. The closest comparison comes from the early 20th century when, for the first time, millions of provincial people moved to major cities to pursue their dreams. Many uprooted themselves only to be poor and unfulfilled. In The Sleepwalkers (1930), the Austrian novelist Hermann Broch rooted his panorama of the first world war in \u201cthe loneliness of I\u201d. Likewise, nobody cares for Gregor Samsa in Franz Kafka\u2019s The Metamorphosis (1915), and poor Samsa is compelled to go to work despite not even recognizing himself any longer. In WH Auden\u2019s poem The Age of Anxiety (1948), he described the alienated product of mass industrial society: \u201cmiserable wicked me / how interesting I am\u201d. While data and polling have their limits, they are a useful starting point for concretely discussing the social recession and whether it\u2019s here to stay. The political scientist Robert D Putnam published his study Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community in 2000 to much praise for its breadth of research. The book documents the decline of sociability in the US since the 1950s by tracing the dwindling number of Americans frequenting religious and civic organizations, volunteer work, sports clubs, hobbyist groups and so on. The book was one of the first to quantitatively determine that, yes, the traditional American community was on the decline. It remains a staple in political science courses. Yet many of the metrics used in the study are today a bit dated. Even the title does not evoke the relevance it once did, since not even bowling has been spared the decline of social activities. Moreover, in the year 2000, it was far easier to see the trend as \u201cfixable\u201d because it was not overwhelmingly determined by any one factor. Putnam\u2019s work is an assessment of social life before the complete mass adoption of the internet. That world is clearly never coming back. If we take one metric commonly cited in the book, church membership, the decline Putnam describes is exceptionally mild compared to what came after. In 1999, according to Gallup, 70% of Americans reported belonging to a church, synagogue or mosque; by 2020 \u2013 two decades after Putnam\u2019s book \u2013 it was already down to 47%. It\u2019s also worth considering a simple metric: screen time, a proxy for time spent not doing community activities in person. Rather than bowling alone, Americans are instead browsing alone \u2013 over seven hours daily, on average, with the number rising every year. As of 2021, 31% of Americans claimed to be online \u201calmost constantly\u201d. If we are browsing alone rather than bowling alone, the real metric to look at is friendships themselves. The past few decades have recorded a steep decline in people\u2019s reported number of friends. The number of Americans who claim to have \u201cno close friends at all\u201d across all age groups now stands at around 12%, according to the Survey Center on American Life. By comparison, only 2% of Americans said they had no close friends in 2003, according to Gallup. Friendlessness is more common for men, but it is nonetheless affecting everyone. Although studies of the subject tend to be general estimates of the entire population, it looks worse when we focus on generations who grew up with the internet. When polling exclusively American millennials, a pre-pandemic 2019 YouGov poll found that 22% have \u201czero friends\u201d and 30% \u201cno best friends\u201d. For those born between 1997 and 2012 (Generation Z), there has been no widespread, credible study done yet on this question \u2013 but if you\u2019re adjacent to internet spaces, you already intuitively grasp that these same online catalysts are deepening for the next generation. Another concerning trend is so-called \u201clate adulthood\u201d, which has been particularly common among those born from the 1990s onward. The term refers to a delaying of traditional milestones of adulthood such as getting a driver\u2019s license, moving out, dating, starting work and so on. The trend became obvious starting in the 2010s. In 2019, it was compiled in a comprehensive study titled The Decline in Adult Activities Among US Adolescents, 1976-2016. The same paper found a similar decline in how often high schoolers went out without their parents. Some of this is not necessarily \u201cbad\u201d, and it\u2019s more symptomatic than anything else. For example, delayed adulthood is linked to less of a desire to engage in risky behavior like delinquency or excess drinking. While risk avoidance can be positive, however, it also tracks the decline in sociability and is therefore bundled with other personal costs. Mental health among people native to the internet continues to worsen amid an increase in so-called diseases of despair \u2013 substance abuse, suicidal ideation, etc \u2013 in the US more generally. These were the leading causes of the drop in life expectancy before the pandemic. Then there is the rapid increase in people who have had no sexual relations since they turned 18, in a time of unprecedented sex positivity no less. The writer Katherine Dee has flipped this common understanding, arguing that we\u2019re seeing a wave of disembodied \u201csexual negativity\u201d rather than free love. The results of that inversion are not unexpected. Although popular culture often paints a picture of hedonistic young people awash in app-aided sex and dating, the reality is that a disembodied and heavily online life produces less physical intimacy. Missing from all of this is the building block of society: trust. The past 50 years have seen America\u2019s transformation from a high-trust to a low-trust society, accompanied by a collapse of authority across all levels: social, political and institutional. In 2022, trust dropped to a new average low \u2013 a development that has been the trend since the 1970s. Americans do perceive that trust has diminished among the general population, according to Pew Research. The vast majority are \u201cworried about the declining level of trust in each other\u201d. Many also feel that they no longer recognize their own country, although that recording is probably caught up somewhat in political partisanship. The erosion of trust in the US began decades ago, after Watergate and the \u201ccrisis of confidence\u201d during the 1970s, but it binds our current time to a more familiar past cynicism. Skepticism toward the state has evolved into more generalized distrust of society at large, constantly amplified by the internet. From all this data we can sketch a new individual, a growing minority in our society: people who are plugged in, dispirited and often feel invisible. Carl Jung wrote that personal meaning comes \u201cwhen people feel they are living the symbolic life, that they are actors in the divine drama\u201d. In our increasingly frayed sociality, what often enters instead is nostalgia, exaggerated hatred and the desire to be saved. Right now, the dispirited are only beginning to agitate the political establishment, which is led mostly by people of an older generation socialized in a different way. The current US government has been called a gerontocracy and the \u201coldest government in [US] history\u201d. As of 2022, over 23% of members of Congress are over 70 years old, and the median age is 61.5. American political power has so far only sporadically felt the effects of the new individual at the ballot box, while at the same time chastising the public for it. The politics of the social recession have therefore only really just started. In his book The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium (2013), the media and political theorist Martin Gurri argues that the digital public lacks a coherent program and is motivated by negation and a desire to tear down idols and authority. We cannot expect the new individual to simply be contained to just his or her own alienation, pacified and alone. That alienation will inform beliefs on how society should be organized and will be the substance of some future worldview, whatever it may be. This process cannot be easily reverted. Nor can we expect political management from above to contain these asocial sentiments. The healthier alternative involves rethinking internet infrastructure to pro-social ends, with platforms owned by the people using them and designed with community prerogatives in mind. I\u2019m not going to pretend to know what that will look like, since much of it has to happen organically. While the trends described here may be a \u201cnew normal\u201d in the sense that they cannot be reversed, I still think another, more positive kind of online community is imaginable. The internet does not need to be joined at the hip to a permanent social recession. Anton Cebalo is a writer and historian.

            "title": "Environmental justice targets needed to cut global inequality, say researchers",
            "date": "2023-01-18T19:24:47Z",
            "content": "Countries, companies and cities need to establish environmental justice targets to counter the impact of the climate and other crises on global inequality, according to the authors of the most comprehensive study of the issue to date. From floods in Pakistan to air pollution in India, the Earth Commission researchers say the poorest parts of the world are being disproportionately harmed by environmental problems, which is adding to global injustice and threatening social stability. To counter this, they propose the creation of environmental justice targets similar to those submitted by governments on reaching the Paris agreement goal of limiting global heating to between 1.5C and 2C. Their plan, which was outlined at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, is billed as the first attempt to factor justice into an assessment of the state of the planet. It is based on a three-year Earth Commission study that brings together dozens of the world\u2019s leading nature scientists and social scientists to understand Earth\u2019s capacity to sustain life, and the role humans play as guardians. Their findings and recommendations will be published over the coming months. \u201cPlanetary stability is not possible without a justice approach,\u201d said Joyeeta Gupta, a professor of environment and development at the University of Amsterdam, who is one of the lead authors. \u201cIt took a long time to persuade the nature scientists.\u201d She said the concept of justice needed to be applied between generations and species, as well as within the current human population. It should minimise harm and define minimum levels of access to food, water, energy and infrastructure. Her co-chair of the study, Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, said the inclusion of social science was the next step in his work to define a safe operating space for humanity. Previously, he led teams that defined a range of planetary boundaries, including for climate, land system change, freshwater use, chemical pollution, ocean acidification and biodiversity. With the new study, he is collaborating with social scientists to map where just boundaries are different from safe boundaries. The initial papers are expected to launch a debate about the fairest as well as the safest way to use the planet\u2019s remaining space for development. Or in the cases where boundaries have already been crossed, to minimise impacts. Some of the proposed measures can be applied immediately, the authors said, such as ensuring every square kilometre in cities has a minimum area of green space. In future, the Earth Commission will examine whether there are social tipping points that can lead to rapid collapse. \u201cThis is an area of active research right now,\u201d Rockstr\u00f6m said. \u201cWe need to ask what is the point when social systems break rather than continuously coping. My personal assessment is the first social system that is breaking may be small-scale farming. We\u2019ve already see signs of that among farmers in Tanzania who have abandoned cultivating because the rains are so delayed. It is not gradual, they just give up and abandon the whole operation.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-10T16:52:32Z",
            "content": "The US justice department is investigating a number of documents bearing highly sensitive classified markings stored at Joe Biden\u2019s former institute in Washington from his time as vice-president in the Obama administration, the White House acknowledged in a statement on Monday. The documents were found by Biden\u2019s personal lawyers at the start of November when they closed out office space at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Biden Center for Diplomacy, a thinktank where he was an honorary professor until 2019. Biden\u2019s personal lawyers sent the documents to the National Archives, which referred the matter to the justice department because of their sensitive nature, with some classified at the Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information level, a source familiar with the matter said. Merrick Garland, the attorney general, has since assigned the Trump-appointed US attorney in Chicago John Lausch to oversee the investigation alongside the FBI, a second person said. A spokesperson for the justice department declined to comment on the ongoing investigation. \u201cThe White House is cooperating with the National Archives and the Department of Justice regarding the discovery of what appear to be Obama-Biden admin records, including a small number of documents with classified markings,\u201d the White House counsel\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cOn the day of this discovery, 2 November 2022, the White House counsel\u2019s office notified the National Archives. The Archives took possession of the materials the following morning,\u201d the statement added. \u201cThe discovery of these documents was made by the president\u2019s attorneys.\u201d The new inquiry comes as the justice department is investigating Donald Trump\u2019s unauthorized retention of national security materials and obstruction of justice after the FBI seized hundreds of records marked classified at his Mar-a-Lago resort in August. Conservatives immediately seized on the news of the discovery. Mike Pence, the vice-president under Donald Trump, argued that the situation parallels the investigation into the deliberate attempt by Trump to hold on to classified documents taken from the White House, which eventually led to the FBI searching his properties after months of resistance from Trump\u2019s team. \u201cWhen the home of a former president of the United States \u2026 was raided by FBI agents, I was deeply troubled by that action at the time. And this double standard is just as troubling,\u201d Pence told a conservative radio host. Trump himself, as earlier reported by CBS News, wrote on his social media website Truth Social: \u201cWhen is the FBI going to raid the many houses of Joe Biden, perhaps even the White House? These documents were definitely not declassified.\u201d The last part of the former president\u2019s post appeared to draw a parallel between the two cases, referencing his disputed claim that the documents at Mar-a-Lago had been declassified, though no such evidence has publicly emerged and his lawyers have not repeated that in court. But the circumstances of the Biden documents are also markedly different compared with the materials seized from Trump: Biden does not appear to have personally and willfully retained classified materials nor did he resist returning them to the government. Trump was initially asked by the National Archives in 2021 to return documents it determined were missing, but put off the request for months. He then relented in December 2021, and agreed to return 15 boxes of materials to the government, which included a number of classified materials. The presence of highly sensitive documents prompted the National Archives to make a referral to the justice department, which developed evidence that Trump had not fully complied with a grand jury subpoena from May demanding the return of any documents with classified markings. That led to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, with the search warrant affidavit indicating that Trump was under criminal investigation for possible violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalizes the willful retention of national security materials, and potentially attempting to conceal classified documents. But regardless of the strength of the legal case, the discovery of the documents at the Biden UPenn center will probably change the political optics for the justice department as it considers whether to charge Trump over mishandling classified materials. The incoming Republican chair of the House oversight committee, James Comer, told reporters on Capitol Hill on Monday that he will launch an inquiry into what documents were kept and whether a double standard was being applied to Biden compared with Trump. \u201cHow ironic,\u201d Comer said. \u201cPresident Biden was quick to criticize President Trump for having classified documents. I wonder if the National Archives is going to ask the FBI to raid the White House tonight?\u201d House Democrats defended Biden, with Representative Pete Aguilar saying there was no comparison between the documents found at Biden\u2019s old office and the ones unearthed by the FBI after searching Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort. Aguilar noted that Biden\u2019s personal lawyers immediately turned over the documents they had found, calling the conservative outcry \u201cRepublican hypocrisy at its finest\u201d. \u201cWhat President Biden did is \u2026 exactly the way that should handle this,\u201d Aguilar told reporters, noting that Biden\u2019s team followed \u201cestablished protocol\u201d and that the president is \u201chandling this the way that he should\u201d. Biden, who is in Mexico City for a summit with the leaders of Mexico and Canada, did not respond to questions shouted by reporters, including one asking about the classified documents. Meanwhile, the Ohio representative Mike Turner, the top Republican of the House permanent select committee on intelligence, sent a letter to the director of national intelligence requesting an immediate investigation into Biden over the documents. Lausch, the US attorney, is one of two Trump-appointed US attorneys that Garland kept on after the end of the previous administration in part because at the time, he was engaged in a high-profile bribery investigation into former Democratic Illinois House speaker Michael Madigan, the source said."

            "date": "2023-01-20T14:00:41Z",
            "content": "The Queensland attorney general, Shannon Fentiman, is \u201cactively\u201d pursuing reforms that would expand redress options for people who have been wrongfully convicted, including the possibility of allowing a second appeal in cases where new evidence emerges. On Thursday, Guardian Australia wrote about the Aboriginal man Terry Irving\u2019s 25-year pursuit of justice. Irving was wrongfully convicted of a bank robbery in Cairns in 1993. He was released from prison in 1997 after the high court said it had \u201cthe gravest misgivings about the circumstances of the case\u201d. Under Queensland law, which is similar to other Australian jurisdictions except the ACT, there is no statutory legal remedy for a person wrongfully convicted or imprisoned, even in circumstances where they have clearly been mistreated. Since 1983, Australia has declined to ratify the relevant UN treaty provision \u2013 it is the only democracy in the world that refuses to do so. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Irving was forced to sue for malicious prosecution and last year \u2013 almost two decades after his arrest \u2013 a ruling in his favour was confirmed by the high court, which refused an appeal by the Queensland government. Asked about the case, Fentiman said: \u201cany miscarriage of justice is distressing\u201d. The attorney general said she had written to the peak bodies for the legal profession in Queensland \u2013 the Law Society and the Bar Association \u2013 seeking their views \u201con reforms that would expand the current avenues of redress open to convicted persons\u201d. \u201cI am actively seeking improved solutions,\u201d she said. \u201cThese could include making available a second appeal \u2026 where further evidence has arisen that justifies overturning a person\u2019s conviction, or other alternative or supplementary means of correcting miscarriages of justice.\u201d A spokesperson for Irving welcomed Fentiman\u2019s steps to seek community and professional input. \u201cThe government has a deadline to review the Queensland Human Rights Act on 1 July this year,\u201d Irving\u2019s spokesperson said. \u201cMr Irving has already written to the Queensland human rights commissioner asking that the commission use its statutory authority to advise the government on suggested reforms to human rights legislation, including providing compensation for exonerees.\u201d A 2017 study by Civil Liberties Australia, which compared wrongful conviction rates in similar countries, estimated 7% of people in Australian prisons had been wrongfully convicted. Lawyers and some experts say this figure should be treated with caution, but that there remains a considerable number of cases where the justice system has failed. Michael O\u2019Keeffe, a retired lawyer who represented Irving, said First Nations Australians were \u201cfar more likely\u201d to be wrongly convicted than non-Indigenous Australians. O\u2019Keeffe, who wrote a paper on wrongful convictions, said Queensland had refused several applications from people for ex-gratia payments, forcing them to take legal action. The process of suing is notoriously difficult and requires people to prove their prosecution had been malicious and unreasonable, even in cases where they have been clearly wronged. \u201cNoted Australian and overseas academics \u2026 point to the experience of mature western democracies in dealing with miscarriages of justice, which has led to reforms in those countries which adopt a range of necessary laws and processes to protect the human rights of exonerees,\u201d O\u2019Keeffe wrote in his paper. \u201cExisting laws and policies in Australia, and in particular the absence of redress to exonerees, cause wrongful convictions to become extended miscarriages of justice. \u201cOne of the weaknesses of the Australian criminal justice system is that with many of the most significant miscarriages of justice \u2026 the judicial system did not recognise a fundamental mistake and a serious injustice. \u201cIt was too used to mild correctives, and minor criticisms, but not to declarations that the system had failed.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-18T10:00:02Z",
            "content": "The mob attack on Brazil\u2019s supreme court, congress and presidential palace earlier this month has focused attention on the country\u2019s military police, with calls for the force to be reformed growing amid what experts say could be a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d for President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Thousands of far-right radicals supportive of former president Jair Bolsonaro stormed the presidential palace, the congress building and the supreme court on 8 January. The intention, many political analysts believe, was to create a sense of chaos and disorder that would allow for far-right forces \u2013 possibly with the support of Brazil\u2019s armed forces \u2013 to depose Lula. During the assault, the capital\u2019s military police stood by, allowing the mob to ransack the seats of power, and it was only when Lula stripped them of their command several hours into the insurrection that federal forces regained control of the situation. \u201cI am convinced that the door to the [presidential] palace was opened so these people could get in because I didn\u2019t see the front door had been broken down,\u201d Lula told reporters last week. \u201cAnd that means that somebody facilitated their entry in here.\u201d Almost two-thirds of Brazilians believe the capital police did not do their duty, according to a poll by Datafolha. Both the governor and chief of police were removed from their posts and about 82% of those polled said Lula was right to order a federal intervention. Those numbers provide the leftist president, who beat Bolsonaro in an October election and took office on 1 January, with an opportunity to debate reforms, said Benedito Mariano, a former ombudsman for the S\u00e3o Paulo military police. Mariano said military police are poorly paid and do not feel valued. Their military codes and mindset mean they are more used to fighting enemies than protecting citizens. Working conditions are often rough and mental health is a serious issue. An overhaul is long overdue, he said. \u201cThis is an anachronic system built in an authoritarian era and reform has to be on the political agenda,\u201d he said. Policing in Brazil is shared by different bodies. The military police are in charge of prevention and the civil police oversee investigation. Both fall under the jurisdiction of Brazil\u2019s 27 state governors. Cooperation between the forces is not always exemplary. Because policing is a state responsibility, most presidents have been reluctant to interfere. Bolsonaro, though, is a former army captain who speaks the language of the barracks and packed his government with high-ranking officers. He also won support from those in uniform when he reformed the pension system to benefit officers in both the police and military. That helped lead to an increase in the number of pro-Bolsonaro radicals in police ranks. Almost half of all military police officers (48%) engaged with far-right groups or figures online, according to a study published last year by the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety. That number jumped by a fifth between 2020 and 2021. \u201cDeep down we have an institution that is permeated by Bolsonarista ideology that accepts a democratic rupture in the name of a far-right project,\u201d said the forum\u2019s president, Renato S\u00e9rgio de Lima. What Lula plans to do is still unclear but the insurrection means the issue is now front and centre, said Melina Risso, a research director at the Igarap\u00e9 Institute. In one promising sign, Lula reached out to Brazil\u2019s state governors immediately after the attack, prompting hopes a collaborative approach may prevail. \u201cThere is a window of opportunity, this is now on everybody\u2019s radar,\u201d Risso said. \u201cIt all depends on political will and their ability to negotiate with congress. Passing legislation to reform the police is no more difficult than passing legislation to reform the tax code. It\u2019s complicated but it is a question of priorities.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-29T07:00:44Z",
            "content": "Legal experts and civil rights advocates have said the harrowing video footage that showed a group of Memphis police officers delivering blow after blow to Tyre Nichols underscores the need for broad reforms of policing in the US. Experts interviewed by the Guardian pointed out that body-worn and surveillance footage was integral in revealing what unfolded \u2013 but are not a panacea. \u201cAt the end of the day, that final video shows someone being beaten and abused like he\u2019s in a pinball game. It\u2019s like the ball is just being knocked from one end to the other,\u201d said Randolph McLaughlin, professor at the Elisabeth Haub School of Law and co-chair of the Newman Ferrara civil rights practice. \u201cWhat\u2019s most shocking about it all is the brutality and then at the end, the complete dehumanization of this man. He\u2019s not even human to them \u2013 he\u2019s not even a person,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cIt\u2019s as if they just went and played a baseball game and they talked about what happened afterward. There\u2019s absolutely no excuse for this.\u201d Nichols, 29, was beaten by police after a traffic stop on 7 January and died three days later. Footage of the beating was released on Friday. McLaughlin said that in many police shooting cases, officers will make the argument that it \u201cis a rapidly evolving situation, a split-second decision had to be made, it was my life or his\u201d but the Memphis officers could not make any such claim. \u201cThat man was defenseless. Defenseless.\u201d The actions of the officers, McLaughlin said, underscored the need for a far broader approach to reform. \u201cThis man wasn\u2019t a criminal. He was just trying to get home to his mother. That\u2019s all he was trying to do. If he can\u2019t do that, none of us are safe,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cIt shows we need a national standard.\u201d \u201cThe police chief in Memphis has taken a very aggressive stance. There\u2019s no question that she\u2019s taking this seriously,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cThe problem is, what\u2019s happening in Mississippi, what\u2019s happening in New York City, every city, every state.\u201d \u201cThese are not crimes that are being committed in isolation,\u201d McLaughlin also said. \u201cBlack and brown men, and poor people, are being treated in this fashion.\u201d The video provided shows a cohort of officers deliver numerous blows against Nichols, 29, as he languishes against the pavement, crying out for his mother. Nichols is punched, kicked, and struck with a baton. When the officers who beat Nichols drag him to a police car, and prop him against the side, his grave physical condition deteriorates for more than 20 minutes before an ambulance arrives on scene. Nichols, the father of a four-year-old boy, died on 10 January. Five officers involved in the incident, who are Black, were fired last week. They have been charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression in the death of Nichols. The Memphis Police Department chief CJ Davis announced on Saturday that she was disbanding the unit whose officers fatally beat Nichols. They were part of what was called the Scorpion unit, which had several teams of approximately 30 street officers who pursued violent offenders in areas with high crime rates, the Associated Press said. \u201cIt is in the best interest of all to permanently deactivate the Scorpion unit,\u201d Davis reportedly said, saying the decision was made after listening to Nichols\u2019 family, community members, and officers who were not in the unit. Other police in the unit who were not involved in the incident \u201cagree unreservedly\u201d with the decision, Davis said. Earlier, New York City\u2019s Legal Aid Society said in a statement the footage \u201cunderscores the epidemic of police violence that continues to plague communities of color nationwide\u201d. \u201cThis is indeed a systemic crisis, overwhelmingly impacting Black men, and each of these tragedies deepens the wounds of racial trauma that all Black people are forced to shoulder,\u201d the office said in a statement. \u201cWe must continue to question the police\u2019s role in society, as these incidents frequently recur, and many more happen all the time without being captured on body-worn cameras.\u201d Sanford Rubenstein, the veteran New York City civil rights attorney who represented Abner Louima and the family of Sean Bell, said \u201cthe extensive video is pictures of the truth\u201d which will be used to prosecute these officers. \u201cYou don\u2019t have one bad apple\u2014 you have five officers engage in a horrific beatdown which resulted in death,\u201d Rubenstein said, later adding, \u201cIf you try to look into the minds of [these] police, they obviously believed they could do what they did with impunity.\u201d Rubenstein also pointed out that Nichols\u2019 death has retraumatized those who have endured police violence. \u201cOne of the elements in this tragedy is the effect that it\u2019s had on many victims of police brutality,\u201d Rubenstein said. \u201cThis now brings back [memories] to their families, especially the families of those who died - they relive them, as they see the video and all the news coverage of this video.\u201d"

            "content": "Wes Streeting turns 40 this weekend, so he has been steering clear of the debate on whether cake should be allowed in the workplace. \u201cYou\u2019ve caught me red-handed,\u201d the shadow health secretary laughs. \u201cTom in my office has brought in shortbread for my birthday.\u201d Instead, he has spent much of the week defending plans for change in the NHS, with many on the left concerned they will lead to more privatisation. \u201cKeir Starmer has joined the right in calling for \u2018reform\u2019 of the NHS,\u201d the veteran leftwinger Diane Abbott tweeted. \u201cWe all know what that means.\u201d But Streeting is unflinching. \u201cThe left surrenders the word \u2018reform\u2019 to the Conservatives at our peril,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy was the Labour party set up more than 100 years ago? It wasn\u2019t to defend the status quo. It was to reform the way our society works, the way our economy works, to build public services that work, to change things. \u201cReform is not a Conservative word. In recent elections, the left has given a lot of people the impression the answer to everything is to pour more money in. Of course investment is needed in the NHS, but ask any patient about their miserable experiences and it\u2019s partly about culture and systems. That\u2019s got to change too.\u201d Streeting denies that reform automatically means more privatisation. \u201cNot at all. My mission is to make sure the NHS Labour built 75 years ago, publicly funded, free at the point of need, survives the next 75 with those core principles intact.\u201d He maintains that Labour\u2019s plan to use the private sector to help tackle NHS waiting lists is a short-term measure that it will use \u201cbegrudgingly\u201d to get through the current crisis. Longer-term, he wants the NHS to be \u201cso good that people never have to go private\u201d. The only role he wants the private sector to play in it is developing life sciences and technology. Yet Streeting is relaxed about senior politicians opting out of the NHS, after the row over Rishi Sunak going private. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m not going to attack them for their own private healthcare. I am going to attack them for the way they have buggered up everybody else\u2019s healthcare,\u201d he says. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m angry with Rishi Sunak is that he seems to settle for lower standards for other families that he would never tolerate for his own.\u201d Streeting has admitted to using private healthcare, to which he had access as a student working for Comet. His treatment for kidney cancer over the last few years has shown him the true value of the NHS. He had a follow-up scan last month and was given the all-clear. While Labour\u2019s plans for a dramatic expansion of the NHS workforce, paid for by abolishing non-dom tax status, have been broadly welcomed, its proposal for reforming GP services, in particular self-referrals, has provoked criticism from doctors. \u201cSelf-referral wouldn\u2019t be appropriate in the majority of cases for the majority of conditions,\u201d Streeting says. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to create more front doors in the NHS so that patients can get seen faster and reduce pressure on GPs.\u201d He wants to stop patients \u201cbouncing around the system\u201d, wasting their time and taxpayers\u2019 money, so in areas where it is \u201cclinically appropriate\u201d, such as gynaecology, ophthalmology and physiotherapy, they should be able to self-refer. \u201cThis is part of my frustration sometimes with the conversation around reform,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are some people in the medical profession who threw up their arms in opposition immediately on hearing the idea mentioned. But it already happens in some cases.\u201d Labour has announced plans to overhaul routes back into work for sick and long-term unemployed people, and the NHS will play a key role in getting patients treated and off waiting lists. \u201cThat\u2019s 3.5 million people being held back from living their lives to the full. That is the cost of an NHS that is not delivering the standards of care patients deserve.\u201d Starmer has put prevention at the heart of his plans for the NHS. But is Streeting worried about being accused of nanny-statism? \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the finger-wagging, pious people in the corner or become the fun police,\u201d he says. \u201cI do think we need to take more responsibility about our own diets, our own exercise, and the government\u2019s got to help create the conditions in which people can do that. But we\u2019ve also got to be careful as politicians that we don\u2019t veer too far into the realms of banning people from doing nice things that they enjoy.\u201d However, Labour plans to look at a \u201cwhole range\u201d of public health measures this year, including consulting on phasing out smoking for young people, as in New Zealand. Other areas under consideration include minimum alcohol pricing, and the soft drink and junk food industries. Assisted dying is another contentious issue that could end up on his desk, with Scotland and France on their way to passing right-to-die laws and New Zealand and Canada among countries that already have them. Streeting voted in favour of the assisted dying bill in parliament. \u201cThis will always be a conscience issue. As an Anglican, I still feel conflicted about it, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been persuaded through talking to families affected that people should have the choice and dignity through dying. As long as we can have the right safeguards in place.\u201d But the most immediate issue is strikes. He is frustrated by what he sees as government intransigence, urging ministers to break the deadlock before the NHS faces more disruption. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be this way. They\u2019re still refusing to have serious pay talks,\u201d he says, with the Department of Health and the Treasury locked in disagreement over which funds a one-off payment for this year that insiders believe is inevitable. Streeting backs the unions for refusing to engage with next year\u2019s pay process until this year\u2019s is settled. The next Labour government would review the public pay review bodies that set salaries for workers, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things we would be prepared to look at. How do we build confidence in the independence of the pay review body process? Clearly it\u2019s not working.\u201d He would work with unions to establish whether ministers should appoint members, set its remit and ultimately decide whether to accept recommendations. He warns that failure to reach agreement with the unions will further damage the NHS. \u201cThe risk isn\u2019t simply that nurses walk out for a day, it\u2019s that they walk out completely. The government has got to see these pay negotiations as [being as] much about retention as about cost of living pressures.\u201d Streeting believes the extra money should come from the Treasury. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how Steve Barclay will find money within existing NHS budgets which are already under pressure,\u201d he says. \u201cIt does feel like a lot of this is about government positioning and Jeremy Hunt wanting to present himself as an iron chancellor. Why should NHS staff expect to be treated unfairly because the Conservatives have a credibility problem on the economy?\u201d"

            "title": "Talking Horses: Racing awaits impact of white paper on gambling reform",
            "date": "2023-01-30T17:31:23Z",
            "content": "For centuries, sailors dreaded the Doldrums, the equatorial waters where a ship could be becalmed for weeks while its crew were slowly driven out of their minds by boredom and frustration. The extended wait for the government\u2019s white paper on reforms to gambling legislation \u2013 originally due to be published in late 2021 \u2013 could be having a similar effect. There seems little doubt the proposed reforms will include some form of \u201caffordability\u201d checks on punters whose activity raises concerns about potential problem gambling. The detail about what form these checks would take, however, or the level or type of activity that would trigger an intervention, is still unknown. But there is a growing body of anecdotal evidence that some gambling firms have decided to jump the gun. The Racing Post has been reporting for several weeks that increasing numbers of online punters have been asked to supply financial details, including bank statements, payslips and P60s, in order to continue placing bets with some companies. There is evidence too of the same practice extending to betting shops. In turn, the Post suggests, some gamblers are being pushed towards the black market, which has grim implications for their own welfare and racing\u2019s long-term finances. Closer to hand, there is a suggestion the annual upturn in betting turnover before and during the Cheltenham Festival in March could bring an equivalent spike in the number of punters being swept up in the checks. Ultimate responsibility for this situation appears to lie, in the Post\u2019s opinion, with the Gambling Commission, created by the 2005 Gambling Act to ensure gambling is \u201copen and fair\u201d. The Commission, it claims, has been putting increasing pressure on gambling businesses to impose the checks or face significant fines for failure to comply with the terms of their licences. The possibility that a losing first day at Cheltenham could mean you are blocked for the final three is a difficult one for any punter to contemplate. What\u2019s more, since a block on an account pending affordability checks is likely to be imposed by an algorithm, there is an obvious potential for chaos if it is triggered at a relatively low level of activity. My own feeling \u2013 and while the wait for the white paper goes on, a feeling is all it can be \u2013 is that the short-term concerns are a little overblown. The Gambling Commission is a deeply deficient body in many ways \u2013 as the Football Index collapse in 2021 clearly showed \u2013 and its understanding of punters and betting is slim to nonexistent. But it would be a greater folly still to allow the betting industry to grind to a halt in the biggest week of the racing year. In the longer term, some form of affordability checking, imposed on at least some gamblers, seems inevitable. A study in 2019 showed that a relatively small fraction of customers are responsible for most deposits with online gambling firms \u2013 83% of deposits were from 2% of customers in one case \u2013 and while some, perhaps many, of those are high net-worth individuals who can afford it, some will be in the grip of a gambling addiction. The overall problem gambling rate among Britain\u2019s gamblers is about 0.3%, and betting on racing and other sports is a relatively safe form of gambling when compared with casino and gaming products such as online slots. However, if betting and gaming are treated as one and the same for affordability checks, the implications for the sport could indeed be significant and, to some extent at least, of its own making. Racing looked the other way for years as major firms ruthlessly exploited the wholesale inadequacies of Labour\u2019s deregulation in 2005, via \u00a3100-a-spin gaming machines on every high street. The Racing Post \u2013 under a previous editor \u2013 gave Fred Done a double-page spread to warn he would close most of his betting shops if the stake limit was cut to \u00a32 [narrator: \u201cwhen it was, he didn\u2019t\u201d]. A handful of voices warned at the time that gaming \u2013 online and on the high street \u2013 was being allowed to poison the well for betting, that having sown the wind, the gambling industry would reap the whirlwind in time. Now, that time has nearly arrived and the white paper will reveal the full extent to which racing will also pay the price."

            "title": "What hopes for gun reform now Republicans have House control?",
            "date": "2023-01-15T09:00:08Z",
            "content": "The Illinois capitol was a site of celebration on Tuesday, as state legislators passed a ban on military-style firearms. The legislation made Illinois the ninth US state to enact a ban on such weapons, which have been used in many of the country\u2019s most devastating mass shootings. \u201cIllinois now officially prohibits the sale and distribution of these mass killing machines and rapid-fire devices,\u201d the Democratic governor JB Pritzker said as he signed the bill. He added: \u201cWe must keep fighting, voting and protesting to ensure that future generations will only have to read about massacres.\u201d In recent years, the US has seen a flurry of activity at the state level to combat gun violence, which the American Public Health Associations has classified as an epidemic. According to the Gun Violence Archive, guns claimed the lives of more than 44,000 Americans in 2022, including 24,000 who died by suicide. Gun safety groups say passing new laws like the Illinois assault weapons ban will become even more crucial in the coming months to address this issue: with Republicans now in control of the House of Representatives, the prospects for enacting additional federal gun legislation in the near future appear bleak. Republicans regained their majority in the House this month on the heels of one of the most successful years for the gun safety movement in decades. Last June, Joe Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which expanded background checks for the youngest gun buyers and provided funding for mental health and violence intervention programs, among other initiatives. The passage of the BSCA marked the first time in nearly 30 years that the US Congress approved a major gun safety bill. \u201cThat\u2019s just the beginning, and we\u2019re just scratching the surface there,\u201d said Zeenat Yahya, director of policy for the gun safety group March For Our Lives. \u201cThat\u2019s not the end all, be all, but it was really exciting to see that progress.\u201d Despite gun safety advocates\u2019 demands for more action at the federal level, including a nationwide assault weapons ban, such reform will be difficult to achieve. Even if Senate Democrats manage to pass additional gun regulations, the newly elected House speaker, Republican Kevin McCarthy, will be able to block those bills from receiving a vote in the lower chamber. While acknowledging the challenges posed by a divided Congress, Yahya dismissed suggestions that Republicans\u2019 House majority eliminates the possibility of new federal laws. Biden could still issue executive orders on gun safety, and the passage of the BSCA demonstrated the possibility for bipartisan cooperation on the issue, she argued. \u201cI do believe that there\u2019s still opportunity regardless of the fact that obviously the House is under Republican control now,\u201d Yahya said. \u201cWe want to be able to make sure that gun violence prevention is still at the forefront of a conversation, and we\u2019re playing an active role at the federal level.\u201d Still, Yahya agreed that reform at the state level has become \u201ceven more important with the Republican control of the House\u201d. In the past year, states have already enacted a number of new gun laws championed by groups like March For Our Lives. According to the group Everytown for Gun Safety, at least 51 new laws aimed at reducing gun violence were passed in 2022, while dozens of bills backed by the gun lobby were defeated. New York\u2019s legislative progress was a particular point of pride for gun safety advocates last year. The state passed a slate of gun proposals in the wake of the massacre at a supermarket in Buffalo, where a white supremacist fatally shot 10 Black shoppers and workers last May. In response, New York legislators raised the age requirement to purchase a long gun from 18 to 21. Lawmakers also established a code of conduct for gun dealers and closed a legal loophole regarding the ownership of high-capacity magazines. But New York\u2019s efforts to reform its laws simultaneously underscored the significant challenges that the gun safety movement faces. Last June, the conservative-leaning supreme court struck down a New York law that placed strict regulations on carrying a firearm in public. In response to the court\u2019s ruling, New York legislators enacted a new law that included an extensive list of sensitive places where guns would be prohibited \u2013 such as schools, medical facilities and government buildings. The new policy is now facing legal challenges, although the supreme court ruled Wednesday that the law can remain in effect for the time being. Gun safety advocates highlight New York\u2019s legislative response to the supreme court\u2019s ruling as a key example of how states can proactively address gun violence, even as federal legislation remains stalled. \u201cThis year, we\u2019ll be doubling down on our efforts to go statehouse by statehouse to continue to pass life-saving laws,\u201d said Monisha Henley, managing director of state government affairs at Everytown. \u201cThat is happening no matter what\u2019s going on in DC.\u201d If history is any indication, the policies now being advanced by state legislatures could one day filter up to the federal level. The BSCA included funding to help states establish \u201cred flag laws,\u201d which allow courts to temporarily confiscate guns from those considered a danger to themselves or others. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have already enacted such policies. \u201cAs states are passing critical legislation around safe storage, background checks, red flags \u2026 it gives us the opportunity to ladder up at the federal level and say, hey, the majority of states are already doing this,\u201d Yahya said. While advocacy press for more action at the state and federal levels, Americans continue to grapple with the daily reality of gun violence. According to Everytown, more than 110 Americans are killed with guns every day, and more than 200 are shot and wounded. Gun owners also make up a growing share of the US population, although they still represent a minority. Americans have bought roughly 150m firearms since the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. One recent study found that an estimated 6 million Americans carried a loaded handgun on a daily basis in 2019, compared to 3 million who said the same in 2015. In America\u2019s capital city, a local nonprofit has started hanging posters reading \u201cThou shalt not kill\u201d in a poetic attempt to combat the alarming rise in gun violence that has gripped Washington in recent years. The violence has made Henley and her allies more determined to enact reform across the country, and she predicted that 2023 would bring more change. After the midterm elections, four additional states \u2013 Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan and Minnesota \u2013 now have Democrats controlling both the state legislature and the governor\u2019s mansion, clearing the way for lawmakers to pas new gun laws. \u201cThe states have been leading the way. They will continue leading the way,\u201d Henley said. \u201c[With] these brand new trifectas with gun safety majorities, there will be a lot of positive action that\u2019ll continue to happen on this issue.\u201d"

            "content": "\u201cIt was scary. It made you realise how, despite all the sophistication of modern society, we\u2019re still reliant on water falling from the sky.\u201d Sam Alfred, the lead designer at Cape Town-based video game studio Free Lives, vividly remembers his city nearly running out of water. During 2018, the area surrounding South Africa\u2019s second largest city suffered months of dwindling rainfall. Dams were unable to replenish themselves at the rate its inhabitants required. Water was rationed. Businesses shut. The situation even called for its own grim version of the Doomsday Clock: hour by hour, the city ticked ever closer to Day Zero, marking the end of its fresh water supply. Terra Nil, the video game that Alfred has been developing since 2019, is a response to these terrifying events. Dubbed a \u201ccity-builder in reverse\u201d, it foregoes the consumption and expansion of genre classics such as Civilisation and SimCity to paint a picture of environmental restoration. Starting with arid desert, it\u2019s up to the player to rewild a landscape using various technologies \u2013 a toxin scrubber, for example, or a beehive. At light-speed, and with eye-massaging flushes of emerald green and azure blue, the environment transforms into lush vegetation. Terra Nil\u2019s simplicity is as beautiful as its visuals, offering the satisfaction of a colouring book while doling out a clear-eyed critique of environment-wrecking extraction. With Terra Nil\u2019s story of \u201cclimate positivity\u201d, Alfred is part of a burgeoning wave of game makers attempting to both educate players on the dangers of the climate crisis while stretching perceptions of what is possible in response to it. Niantic, the maker of Pok\u00e9mon GO, has used the real-world setting of its augmented reality game to spearhead a tree-planting initiative. Ubisoft, meanwhile, staged an in-game climate march for Riders Republic players, and is set to unleash a virtual forest fire to demonstrate the devastating real-world effects of such arboreal disasters. The idea with each of these ventures is to use video games as tools of moral instruction. For the past three years, a United Nations project called Playing for the Planet has catalysed these efforts with its annual Green Game Jam. Deborah Mensah-Bonsu, founder of partner organisation Games for Good and organiser of the jams, believes video games are perfectly placed to encourage changes in mindset and behaviour. \u201cThe idea of player agency is a really big piece [of the picture],\u201d she says. \u201cWithin other mediums, it\u2019s more of a passive experience. With games, you get to be part of a story \u2013 you have a say in its outcome.\u201d She sees two sides to what the organisation is calling \u201cgreen content.\u201d On the one hand, \u201cIt\u2019s trying to help players understand these different subjects.\u201d On the other hand, it\u2019s giving them \u201cagency to take action.\u201d In the hidden object game June\u2019s Journey and arcade fighter Brawlhalla, these actions amount to purchasing in-game items whose proceeds are then donated to environmental charities such as Ecologi. For deeper engagements with the brief, you have to look at titles such as snowsports utopia Riders Republic or another Ubisoft title, Anno 1800, the kind of grand city-builder that Terra Nil riffs on. Anno 1800\u2019s ecological twist is an environment that reacts to the player\u2019s expansionist actions. Creating monocultures depletes soil fertility, while overfishing destroys marine populations; each demand on the environment carries a consequence that could decide a city\u2019s fate. David Attenborough\u2019s wonder for the natural world permeates the Horizon series, each immaculately rendered blade of grass or clump of moss a tiny act of veneration. And dark climate dread looms in the primordial landscapes of Death Stranding. However, there\u2019s a dark contradiction at the heart of these blockbuster games: the very extraction that Terra Nil rallies against sustains players\u2019 and the industry\u2019s thirst for increasingly high-fidelity graphics. Every cutting-edge console, graphics card, and processor is the product of many carbon-intensive processes, including the mining of rare earth minerals. When Sony pledges to plant trees for every \u201cReached the Daunt\u201d trophy earned by players of Horizon: Forbidden West, an effort promoted as part of the 2022 Green Game Jam, it raises the spectre of greenwashing. Sony recently announced that it was accelerating its net zero commitments by 10 years, but 2020 emissions stemming from the use of its TVs and game consoles were the highest they\u2019ve been since 2016, according to its 2021 sustainability report. Furthermore, an eye-watering 17.1m tons of C02 were created over the course of its products\u2019 life-cycles, with a further 1.4m tons emitted from the company\u2019s business sites. Next to these numbers, it\u2019s hard to see tree-planting as anything other than trivial. Radical ideas are needed if the games industry is to collectively decarbonise, and Playing for the Planet hopes to advise companies on how to do just that in the coming years. Kara Stone, a designer and assistant professor at Alberta University of the Arts, is already working on a quietly radical alternative from her south-facing apartment balcony in Calgary: a solar-powered web server that players will be able to stream her games from. The first is called Known Mysteries, a deduction game set in a near-future Canada held captive by massive oil companies. Stone says it\u2019s partly inspired by her home of Calgary, a city she describes as the \u201coil capital of Canada\u201d. It will feature \u201crecycled\u201d visuals sourced mostly from 1970s industrial and nature films; Stone is compressing the images so that the game can fit on the tiny solar-powered web server she\u2019s making using a panel bought off Craigslist, a Raspberry Pi microcomputer, and an old car battery. Stone\u2019s work gently challenges the idea that increasingly high-resolution graphics, whose rendering requires ever-larger amounts of electricity, is the indisputable future for games. And because it runs on a solar server in the often dark and cloudy climate of Canada, players may be unable to access her game 24/7. \u201cNot everything has to be accessible to everybody at every single moment,\u201d Stone says. \u201cI\u2019m not really too concerned if it goes down for even a few hours a day every day ... Full access to every user is such a capitalist mindset.\u201d Stone isn\u2019t trying to convince an audience of anything, she says; \u201cthat\u2019s a condescending place to come from.\u201d Jonathan Hau-Yoon, art lead on Terra Nil, is similarly uninterested in changing people\u2019s minds, preferring to show players an alternative to the status quo and let them do the rest. He references the futurist Monika Bielskyte, who thinks about \u201cprotopian\u201d rather than utopian futures \u2013 a world of plural futures, rather than just one. \u201cIt\u2019s very much the idea of creating positive things to inspire imaginations,\u201d Hau-Yoon says. \u201cTo think in terms of possibilities.\u201d The question is whether any of this can move the needle on players\u2019 attitudes towards the climate crisis. According to new data collected through a number of mobile titles by Mensah-Bonsu and Playing for the Planet, the answer tentatively suggests it can. Of 389,594 respondents (split evenly across men and women with the greatest number between the ages of 21 to 39), 78.6% believe that gaming could help them learn about the environment and 35.4% want to see more environmental content in their games. Nearly two-thirds of respondents (61.1%) said they would be motivated to pay for environmentalist content if it added to their in-game experience, supported a good cause, or taught them something new. Mensah-Bonsu stresses the research is far from \u201cthe final word on the subject\u201d. She says further studies with greater academic rigour are required, but it\u2019s the first step in validating work that, until now, was unproven. At the very least, Mensah-Bonsu says, the research shows that engaging with the climate crisis isn\u2019t a turn-off for players. Establishing causation would be harder: many have tried to find a link between games and player behaviour when it comes to video games and violence, at great length and even greater cost, and none have succeeded. Regardless of whether it changes minds or behaviour, there\u2019s an appetite from game makers and players alike to engage with the ongoing threat of global heating. Games such as ABZ\u00db and Alba: A Wildlife Adventure \u2013 ecological fables set in the ocean and on land \u2013 are among many that show us a way of seeing the world that isn\u2019t through an aiming reticle."

            "date": "2023-01-27T11:00:49Z",
            "content": "A media outlet founded by conservative influencer Ben Shapiro paid Google to advertise on search pages questioning whether the climate crisis is real, according to new research from a disinformation watchdog group. The Daily Wire bought ads on search terms over the past year such as \u201cclimate change is a hoax\u201d and \u201cwhy is climate change fake\u201d, meaning that when people Googled these phrases, stories from Shapiro\u2019s outlet were some of the first results that appeared, the research found. Google sold these ads even after announcing a new policy in October 2021 prohibiting ads that promote climate crisis denial. Its CEO, Sundar Pichai, publicly stated at the time that \u201cwhen people come to Google Search with questions about climate change, we\u2019ll show authoritative information from sources like the United Nations\u201d. \u201cGoogle\u2019s hypocrisy knows no bounds,\u201d said Imran Ahmed, CEO of the US and UK-based Center for Countering Digital Hate, which provided its research exclusively to the Guardian. \u201cThey\u2019re actually selling the right to climate deniers to spread disinformation.\u201d A spokesperson for Google didn\u2019t contest the center\u2019s new findings about the Daily Wire but said that \u201cwhen we find content that crosses the line from policy debate or a discussion of green initiatives to promoting outright climate change denial, we remove those ads\u201d. The Daily Wire didn\u2019t respond to a list of detailed questions about its Google ad buys. For its research, Ahmed\u2019s organization relied upon a commercial analytics tool called Semrush, which is used by many Fortune 500 companies and shows the Google phrases and search terms that brands advertise on. Semrush also provides estimates of the dollar amounts companies are spending on digital marketing efforts. Based on these estimates, researchers say that the Daily Wire could have spent almost as much as $60m on more than 150 Google search term ads over the past two years on various topics. These search term ads also included such phrases as \u201cargument against reparations\u201d, \u201cbill gates population control\u201d, and \u201cwhy does george soros hate america\u201d. More than a dozen of the search terms were climate-related, including: \u201cclimate change is a hoax\u201d \u201cclimate change is a lie\u201d \u201cwhy is climate change fake\u201d \u201cclimate change debunk\u201d \u201cthe real truth about wind turbines\u201d \u201cis global warming a scam\u201d \u201cthe climate change scam\u201d The Google spokesperson would not comment on the spending estimate. The center focused on the Daily Wire because it is among the most popular publishers on Facebook, with levels of engagement that at times have surpassed the combined digital reach of the New York Times, Washington Post, NBC News and CNN. In November 2021, the Center for Countering Digital Hate named the Daily Wire in a report as one of the top ten spreaders of climate disinformation on Facebook, along with other far-right outlets such as Breitbart, Newsmax and the Western Journal. Shapiro\u2019s outlet, which reported more than $100m in revenue in 2021, was started with $4.7m in seed funding from Texas fracking billionaire Farris Wilks. In its latest research, the center said it found multiple instances of the Daily Wire promoting climate crisis denial through its Google advertisements. When people Googled the phrase \u201cclimate change debunk\u201d in April 2022, one of the top results they were shown was an article authored by Shapiro entitled \u201cDebunking Climate Change Hysteria\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard that climate change is going to put an end to all life on Earth; that it puts civilization in existential peril,\u201d Shapiro claimed in the article. \u201cThese are lies.\u201d Another Daily Wire ad from last summer linked the search phrase \u201cclimate change a hoax\u201d \u2013 along with deliberately misspelled phrases like \u201cgobal warming hoax\u201d and \u201cclimate change hiax\u201d \u2013 to the outlet\u2019s 2016 article \u201c9 Things You Need To Know About The Climate Change Hoax\u201d, in which Aaron Bandler falsely claimed that \u201cthere is no evidence that the Earth has been warming in recent years\u201d. \u201cIn accordance with our policy against climate change denial content, Google ads aren\u2019t running on this page, nor is this page being promoted in Google ads,\u201d Google said in relation to this specific article. But Google\u2019s policies allow some wiggle room. \u201cWe will also continue to allow ads and monetization on other climate-related topics, including public debates on climate policy, the varying impacts of climate change, new research and more,\u201d its policy says. Last July, the Daily Wire paid Google to promote its story \u201cWind Turbines Not Only Shred Birds But Are Piling Up In Landfills\u201d anytime someone searched \u201cthe real truth about wind turbines\u201d. Shapiro\u2019s outlet has pushed discredited theories on a wide range of topics, including buying an ad last July on the search term \u201cgeorge floyd cause of death\u201d which linked to a Daily Wire article stating that it likely was a fentanyl overdose, not police violence, that killed George Floyd in 2020. A Reuters fact check recently found \u201cno evidence\u201d for this claim. But on Google you don\u2019t need to be factually correct in order to shape people\u2019s opinions, the disinformation group pointed out. \u201cNinety-nine percent of Google clicks go to results on the first page,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cIf you can be the first result on a Google search, you essentially get to set the truth.\u201d The Daily Wire\u2019s climate ads are particularly egregious according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate because Google publicly presents itself as having one of the most aggressive sustainability plans of any large tech company. It promises to achieve the goal of \u201cnet-zero\u201d carbon emissions in its operations by 2030, ten years earlier than Amazon. Last year, the company teamed up with the United Nations to provide people with \u201cshort and easy-to-understand information panels and visuals on the causes and effects of climate change\u201d when they search for the topic on Google. Yet in a report last year the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that major climate polluters like BP, ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell were purchasing ads on Google searches such as \u201cnet-zero\u201d and \u201ceco-friendly\u201d, giving the impression that these companies were helping to fix the climate crisis instead of being the main contributors to it. Ahmed said The Daily Wire ad buys appear to be a direct contradiction of Google\u2019s own promises to promote reliable information on the climate crisis: \u201cGoogle has rules against their search ads being used to spread disinformation, they should be enforcing them, even against people who give them lots of money.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-12T06:00:04Z",
            "content": "Every crisis is in part a storytelling crisis. This is as true of climate chaos as anything else. We are hemmed in by stories that prevent us from seeing, or believing in, or acting on the possibilities for change. Some are habits of mind, some are industry propaganda. Sometimes, the situation has changed but the stories haven\u2019t, and people follow the old versions, like outdated maps, into dead ends. We need to leave the age of fossil fuel behind, swiftly and decisively. But what drives our machines won\u2019t change until we change what drives our ideas. The visionary organiser adrienne maree brown wrote not long ago that there is an element of science fiction in climate action: \u201cWe are shaping the future we long for and have not yet experienced. I believe that we are in an imagination battle.\u201d In order to do what the climate crisis demands of us, we have to find stories of a livable future, stories of popular power, stories that motivate people to do what it takes to make the world we need. Perhaps we also need to become better critics and listeners, more careful about what we take in and who\u2019s telling it, and what we believe and repeat, because stories can give power \u2013 or they can take it away. To change our relationship to the physical world \u2013 to end an era of profligate consumption by the few that has consequences for the many \u2013 means changing how we think about pretty much everything: wealth, power, joy, time, space, nature, value, what constitutes a good life, what matters, how change itself happens. As the climate journalist Mary Heglar writes, we are not short on innovation. \u201cWe\u2019ve got loads of ideas for solar panels and microgrids. While we have all of these pieces, we don\u2019t have a picture of how they come together to build a new world. For too long, the climate fight has been limited to scientists and policy experts. While we need their skills, we also need so much more. When I survey the field, it\u2019s clear that what we desperately need is more artists.\u201d What the climate crisis is, what we can do about it, and what kind of a world we can have is all about what stories we tell and whose stories are heard. Climate change was a story that fell on mostly indifferent ears when it was first discussed in the mainstream more than 30 years ago. Even a dozen years ago, it was supposed to be happening very slowly and in the distant future. There were a lot of references to \u201cour grandchildren\u2019s time\u201d. It was a problem that was difficult to grasp \u2013 this dispersed, incremental, atmospheric, invisible, global problem with many causes and manifestations, whose solutions are also dispersed and manifold. That voices from the climate movement have finally succeeded in making the vast majority understand it, and many care passionately about it, might be the biggest single victory the movement will have. Because once you\u2019ve won the popular imagination, you\u2019ve changed the game and its possible outcomes. But this was a long, slow, arduous process, and misconceptions still abound. A lot of people don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve largely won the battle to make people aware and concerned. The LA Times ran a well-intentioned editorial last year about how most Americans don\u2019t care about climate breakdown. That was true once, but no longer is. A Pew Research poll in 2020 concluded that two-thirds of Americans wanted to see more government action on climate, but last summer the scientific journal Nature published a study concluding that most Americans believe that only a minority (37-43%) support climate action, when in reality a large majority (66-80%) does. That gap between perceived and actual support undermines motivation and confidence. We need better stories \u2013 and sometimes better means more up to date. * * * Outright climate denial \u2013 the old story that climate change isn\u2019t real \u2013 has been rendered largely obsolete (outside social media) by climate-driven catastrophes around the globe and good work by climate activists and journalists. But other stories still stop us from seeing clearly. Greenwashing \u2013 the schemes created by fossil fuel corporations and others to portray themselves as on the environment\u2019s side while they continue their profitable destruction \u2013 is rampant. It\u2019s harder to recognise a false friend than an honest enemy, and their false solutions, delaying tactics and empty promises can be confusing for non-experts. Fortunately, as the climate movement has diversified, one new organisation, Clean Creatives, focuses specifically on pressuring advertising and PR agencies to stop doing the industry\u2019s dirty work. Likewise, climate journalists are exposing how fossil fuel money is funding pseudo-environmental opposition to offshore wind turbines. (As the climate activist and oil policy analyst Antonia Juhasz recently told me, the climate movement is now going after every aspect of the fossil fuel industry, including funding by banks and, via the divestment movement, shares held by investors; donations to politicians; insurers; permits for extraction; transport; refinement; emissions, notably through lawsuits concerning their impact; shutting coal-fired power plants; and pushing for a rapid transition to electrification.) But we still lack stories that give context. For example, I see people excoriate the mining, principally for lithium and cobalt, that will be an inevitable part of building renewables \u2013 turbines, batteries, solar panels, electric machinery \u2013 apparently oblivious to the far vaster scale and impact of fossil fuel mining. If you\u2019re concerned about mining on indigenous land, about local impacts or labour conditions, I give you the biggest mining operations ever undertaken: for oil, gas, and coal, and the hungry machines that must constantly consume them. Extracting material that will be burned up creates the incessant cycle of consumption on which the fossil fuel industry has grown fabulously rich. It creates climate chaos as well as destruction and contamination at every stage of the process. Globally, burning fossil fuels kills almost 9 million people annually, a death toll larger than any recent war. But that death toll is largely invisible for lack of compelling stories about it. All mining needs to be done with respect for the land and people in the vicinity, but the impact of mining for renewables needs to be weighed against the far more devastating impact of mining for and burning fossil fuel. The race is on to find battery materials that are more commonly available and less impactful than lithium and cobalt, and some of the results look promising. Last summer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced an aluminium-sulphur battery is in the works, while a US company is developing one that stores electricity using iron \u2013 the so-called \u201ciron-air\u201d battery. Efforts to extract battery materials from longterm coal waste in West Virginia are among the many others under way. And the Inflation Reduction Act includes funding to research better battery materials and domestic US sources. Other stories of premature defeat are all too common. In the 400,000-strong 2014 climate march in New York City, one section marched behind a huge banner declaring \u201cWE HAVE THE SOLUTIONS\u201d \u2013 but many people still believe we do not. We have the solutions we need in solar and wind; we just need to build them out and make the transition, fast. Looking to wildly ineffectual carbon sequestration and other undeveloped technologies as a relevant solution is like ignoring the lifeboats at hand in the hope that fancy new ones are coming when the ship is sinking and speed is of the essence. * * * One story I frequently encounter frames the possibilities in absolutes: if we can\u2019t win everything, then we lose everything. There are so many doom-soaked stories out there \u2013 about how civilisation, humanity, even life itself, are scheduled to die out. This apocalyptic thinking is due to another narrative failure: the inability to imagine a world different than the one we currently inhabit. People without much sense of history imagine the world as static. They assume that if the present order is failing, the system is collapsing, and there is no alternative. A historical imagination equips you to understand that change is ceaseless. You only have to look to the past to see such a world, dramatically different half a century ago, stunningly so a century ago. The UK, for example, ran almost entirely on coal power until the 1960s, and if you had said then that it would have to quit coal, many would have imagined this meant an utter collapse of the energy system, not its transformation. Even in 2008, the organisation Carbon Brief noted, \u201cfour-fifths of the UK\u2019s electricity came from fossil fuels. Since then, the UK has cleaned up its electricity mix faster than any other major world economy. Coal-fired power has virtually disappeared and even gas use is down by a quarter. Instead, the country now gets more than half of its electricity from low-carbon sources, such as solar, wind and nuclear.\u201d Scotland already generates nearly all the electricity it needs from renewables. While I often hear people casually assert that our world is doomed, no reputable scientist makes such claims. Most are deeply worried, but far from hopeless. There are already profound losses, but our action or inaction determine how much more loss will occur, and whose it will be, and some repair is possible. Efforts sufficient to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could lower temperatures and reverse some aspects of climate breakdown. Even the journalist David Wallace-Wells, who rose to fame with a deeply pessimistic book about climate a few years ago, has shifted his view. He currently describes a future somewhere between the best and worst case scenarios, a future \u201cwith the most terrifying predictions made improbable by decarbonisation and the most hopeful ones practically foreclosed by tragic delay. The window of possible climate futures is narrowing, and as a result, we are getting a clearer sense of what\u2019s to come: a new world, full of disruption \u2026 yet mercifully short of true climate apocalypse.\u201d * * * A climate story we urgently need is one that exposes who is actually responsible for climate chaos. It\u2019s been popular to say that we are all responsible, but Oxfam reports that over the past 25 years, the carbon impact of the top 1% of the wealthiest human beings was twice that of the bottom 50%, so responsibility for the impact and the capacity to make change is currently distributed very unevenly. By saying \u201cwe are all responsible\u201d, we avoid the fact that the global majority of us don\u2019t need to change much, but a minority needs to change a lot. This is also a reminder that the idea that we need to renounce our luxuries and live more simply doesn\u2019t really apply to the majority of human beings outside what we could perhaps call the overdeveloped world. What is true of Beverly Hills is not true of the majority from Bangladesh to Bolivia. When it comes to who\u2019s harming the climate, it\u2019s also been popular to focus on individual contributions. The fossil fuel industry likes the narrative of personal responsibility as a way to keep us scrutinising ourselves and one another, rather than them. They\u2019ve promoted the concept of climate footprints as a way to keep the focus on us and not them, and it\u2019s worked. Usually if I ask people what they\u2019re doing about the climate emergency, most will talk about what they\u2019re not consuming or doing \u2013 but these will never add up to the speed and scale of change needed to change the system. One of the goals of system change is to supersede individual virtue. Just as you no longer have to opt in to buying a car with seatbelts or ask for the no-smoking section on the train or restaurant, at some point in the near future you won\u2019t have to opt into travelling in an electric car or bus, or living or working in all-electric buildings. Electrification will have happened because of the collective action that takes shape as policy and regulation. Last year, the veteran environmentalist Bill McKibben wrote a brilliant analysis pointing out that if you have money in one of the banks funding fossil fuels \u2013 especially, in the US, Wells Fargo, Chase, Citi, and Bank of America \u2013 your retirement funds or savings account may have a much larger climate footprint than you do. The impact of your diet and how you get to work may pale in comparison to the impact of your money in the bank. The vegan on the bicycle may still be contributing to climate chaos if her life savings are in a bank lending her money to the fossil fuel industry. Individual impact, leaving the ultra-wealthy aside, matters mostly in the aggregate. And in aggregate we can change that. On 21 March, McKibben, via his new climate group Third Act (on whose advisory board I sit), and dozens of other climate groups will be organising actions by people with money in, or credit cards from, the key US banks, to try to force those institutions to stop funding fossil fuels. Our greatest power lies in our roles as citizens, not consumers, when we can band together to collectively change how our world works. Various campaigns around the world have focused on fossil finance, with significant successes behind them, and much more to achieve ahead. The climate movement has become far more sophisticated and precise in its targets in recent years. It\u2019s doing a brilliant job; it just needs enough people and resources behind it to be more powerful than the status quo. * * * Last year, I took three activists who were formerly part of the Sunrise Movement, a youth group campaigning to address climate breakdown, to see the 1991 film Terminator 2 at a cinema. The film was as great as I remembered, not least because the lead character, Linda Hamilton playing a ferocious young mother, chooses as her motto \u201cno fate but what we make\u201d. In that movie, the future has come back to meddle with the present through the sci-fi technologies of time travel and robot-warrior terminators. We see how actions in the present shape the future through tremendous battles over what that future will be. This is, of course, just as true in real life. We don\u2019t get terminators and other time-travellers to tell us what the consequences of our actions are, but they still have consequences. You ban the insecticide DDT, and a lot of bird species stop dying out. You ban chlorofluorocarbons, and the hole in the ozone layer stops growing. In another way, Terminator 2 is less useful as a lens for thinking about the climate crisis. It\u2019s part of the conventions of storytelling in film \u2013 and comics, fiction, graphic novels and too many news narratives \u2013 that tells us that the world can only be saved by exceptional individuals, often loners, whose gifts are often the capacity to inflict and endure extreme violence. Linda Hamilton and co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger shoot, clobber, crush, outrun and outfight everything thrown at them, and that\u2019s their celebrated skillset, along with a bit of dry humour. Humour aside, this has little to do with how the world really gets changed most of the time. The skills of real-world superheroes are solidarity, strategy, patience, persistence, vision and the ability to inspire hope in others. The rescuers we need are mostly not individuals, they are collectives \u2013 movements, coalitions, campaigns, civil society. Within those groups there may be someone with an exceptional gift for motivating others, but even the world\u2019s greatest conductor needs an orchestra. One person cannot do much; a movement can topple a regime. We are sadly lacking stories in which collective actions or the patient determination of organisers is what changes the world. Another thing we get from our films and fictions is the expectation of a single solution and a clear resolution to our problems: a sudden victory, a celebration, and the trouble is over. The climate crisis does not fit easily into this format. Ceasing to extract and burn fossil fuel is central, but there is no single solution. Protecting carbon-sequestering peat bogs, forests and grasslands also matters; so does transforming high-impact materials such as cement; implementing better design for buildings, transport and cities, and addressing soil conservation, farming and food production and consumption. There are milestones and important goals, but the familiar Hollywood ending \u2013 crossing the finish line to wrap up the story \u2013 doesn\u2019t describe this reality. Change often functions more like a relay race, with new protagonists picking up where the last left off. In 2019, a Berkeley city councilwoman decided to propose banning fossil-gas connections in new construction, and it was passed by the council unanimously. This small city\u2019s commitment to all-electric new buildings could seem insignificant, but more than 50 other California municipalities picked it up, as did the city of New York. The state of New York failed to pass a similar measure, but Washington state succeeded, and the idea that new construction should not include gas has spread internationally. Such relay races have long been how human rights campaigns work: a good protest, campaign, or even piece of legislation can introduce new ideas that do their own work in the world at large. Even failed campaigns may succeed in opening the path for later change. The Green New Deal did not pass in the US Senate, but it became a template for the Biden administration\u2019s climate legislation, and shifted the conversation about what is possible. It led the way to the Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest climate bill the US has ever passed. Opponents of environmental action often say it is killing jobs; the Green New Deal did a lot to change that story by portraying climate action as a job creator. Recognising the reality of climate breakdown means recognising the interconnectedness of all things. That connection brings obligation: to respect nature, to build domestic regulation and international treaties that protect what\u2019s needed, to limit the freedom of the individual in the name of the wellbeing of the collective. This is, of course, a worldview in direct contrast with free-market fundamentalism and libertarianism. Even the facts of climate science are ideologically offensive to people committed to individual freedom without accountability, let alone the demands created by treaties and regulations. Responsibility and obligation are dismal words in mainstream culture, so perhaps there will be other stories that recognise this process as reciprocity and relationship, in which we give back, in gratitude and respect for all the Earth does for us. Even short of that, we can recognise our self-interest in maintaining the system on which life depends. * * * If news is the daily report on what\u2019s just happened, we need a way of pulling back from individual events, to see the broad context of how it happened. If you only tell short-term stories, it all becomes kind of meaningless. Martin Luther King Jr said: \u201cThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\u201d We\u2019ve seen it bend a lot of ways in recent years, toward and away from justice, but it takes time just to see it bend at all. You need benchmarks or memories of how things used to be even to see change of any kind, including climate change. The South Pacific climate activist and poet Julian Aguon recently declared that Indigenous peoples \u201chave a unique capacity to resist despair through connection to collective memory, and just might be our best hope to build a new world rooted in reciprocity and mutual respect \u2013 for the Earth and for each other\u201d. That emphasis on collective memory suggests that a strong sense of the past allows for a strong sense of the future, that remembering difficulty and transformation equips us to face them again. One of the things that buoys me up is the long arc of change in renewable technology. Mostly what you see in the news about renewables is short-term: stories on the latest drop in price, or proliferation of solar and wind over the past year or two. If you enlarge your time frame, you see that those annual changes have amounted to an astonishing plummet in prices and rise in efficiency and global use, compounded by innovations in materials and storage. Twenty years ago we did not have constructive ways to leave the age of fossil fuel behind. Now we do. And the solutions keep getting better. In 2021, the organisation Carbon Tracker put out a report that showed current technology could produce 100 times as much electricity from solar and wind than current global demand. The report concludes: \u201cThe technical and economic barriers have been crossed and the only impediment to change is political.\u201d At the end of the last millennium, those barriers seemed insurmountable. The change is revolutionary, but the revolution was too slow to be visible to most. The report continues: \u201cAt the current 15-20% growth rates of solar and wind, fossil fuels will be pushed out of the electricity sector by the mid-2030s and out of total energy supply by 2050. The unlocking of energy reserves 100 times our current demand creates new possibilities for cheaper energy and more local jobs in a more equitable world, with far less environmental stress.\u201d We tend to think utopias are unbelievable, but this is a sober-minded thinktank focused on climate and energy politics. The report made little impact on the general public. Because the energy revolution has been incremental, there\u2019s been no single breakthrough moment. Yet it adds up to an encouraging, and even astonishing narrative. On the other hand, people find grim narratives all too believable, whether or not they are grounded in fact. We are still inundated by harmful, as well as untrue, stories about climate and the future. Prophecies can be self-fulfilling: if you insist that we cannot possibly win, you pit yourself against the possibility of victory and the people trying to achieve it. * * * There\u2019s yet another narrative that\u2019s persisted at least since the invention of compact fluorescent lightbulbs and the Toyota Prius: that we must renounce abundance and enter an age of austerity. It\u2019s all in the telling. To consider our age an age of abundance, you have to be counting sheer accumulated stuff and ignoring how it is distributed. That is, we live in an age of extreme wealth for some, and desperation for the many. But there\u2019s another way to count wealth and abundance \u2013 as hope for the future, safety and public confidence, emotional wellbeing, love and friendship and strong social networks, meaningful work and purposeful lives, equality and justice and inclusion. Early on, we heard that renewables were very expensive \u2013 this was part of the austerity narrative, or an excuse for not making the transition. But improvements in design and economies of scale are among the factors making them the cheapest form of electricity almost everywhere on earth. There\u2019s no reason to think the innovations of design and economic improvements are all behind us; I suspect they\u2019re mostly ahead of us. Engineer and energy expert Saul Griffith recently wrote: \u201cMost people believe a clean-energy future will require everyone to make do with less, but it actually means we can have better things.\u201d The old story was that we couldn\u2019t afford to do what the climate emergency required. The new one is that it would not only be ecologically devastating, but more expensive not to. Renewables are on the way to being cheaper than fossil fuel; in many places, they already are. Texas and Iowa get a huge amount of their electricity from wind because it makes economic sense, not because these red states are passionate about addressing the climate crisis. Over their lifetime, electric cars work out to be cheaper than internal combustion cars because charging and maintaining them is cheaper. And of course these two examples don\u2019t include the indirect effects of burning fossil fuels on human health and the climate. A lot of people tend to measure climate action in terms of huge national or international news events, but the change that matters is often happening at local and regional and other levels. A university divests; a state sets a date for ending the sale of new petrol cars; a city passes a measure mandating all-electric new buildings; ground is broken on a major solar installation; a state or country sets a new record for percentage of wind power in its energy mix; a pipeline or gas terminal or drilling site gets cancelled; a carbon-sequestering forest or peat bog gets protected status; a coal plant closes. This does not erase all the bad news, about continuing breakdown of natural systems and its toll on human lives and impact on a livable future, but it does contextualise them as crises we can respond to if we choose to. So much is happening, both wonderful and terrible, and it adds up to more stories than almost anyone can take in. But the overarching frameworks in which we receive them matter, and so do the critical skills to recognise, choose, and change stories. The climate crisis is a problem with no single solution, but many, just as there is no one saviour, but many protagonists in the struggle. In 2019, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg said we must embrace \u201ccathedral thinking\u201d, adding: \u201cWe must lay the foundation while we may not know exactly how to build the ceiling.\u201d The speculative fiction writer Octavia Butler included this passage in one of her essays: \u201cOK,\u201d the young man challenged. \u201cSo what\u2019s the answer?\u201d \u201cThere isn\u2019t one,\u201d I told him. \u201cNo answer? You mean we\u2019re just doomed?\u201d He smiled as though he thought this might be a joke. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean there\u2019s no single answer that will solve all of our future problems. There\u2019s no magic bullet. Instead there are thousands of answers \u2013 at least. You can be one of them if you choose to be.\u201d \u2022 This is an edited version of a speech given at Princeton University in November 2022 \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."

            "title": "UK FTSE 100 closes at highest level since 2018; cost of living crisis and climate change top global risks \u2013 as it happened",
            "date": "2023-01-11T16:54:54Z",
            "content": "With the UK\u2019s blue-chip share index at its highest level since 2018, it\u2019s time to wrap up. Here\u2019s today\u2019s main stories: In the City, the FTSE 100 share index has ended the day at its highest closing level since August 2018. The blue-chip index closed 30 points higher at 7724 points, a gain of 0.4%. It earlier hit a four-year high of 7772 points, as the market rallied (see earlier post). Retailers helped to lift the Footsie higher, with JD Sports finishing almost 7% higher after lifting its profit outlook this year, helped by younger shoppers having more cash to spend than a year ago. Frasers, which owns Sports Direct, gained 4%, while warehouse operator Segro rose by 3.4%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says there is optimism over consumer spending patterns, despite the cost of living crisis: European markets have seen another positive session with the FTSE100 continuing to gain ground above the 7,700-level helped by another set of solid trading numbers from the UK retail sector. For all the doom and gloom leading up to Christmas and the end of the year period, it would appear that while consumers are becoming choosier about where they spend their money, they are still spending it. Milder weather in January also appears to be helping sentiment, fuelling optimism that the start of 2023 might offer some respite from further increases in energy prices. Traders are also hoping for a drop in US inflation, when the latest data is released tomorrow. That could herald a slowdown in interest rate increases, which hit many markets last year. Today\u2019s gains leave the FTSE 100 closer to its alltime high of 7,903 points, set in May 2018. Lauren Wills-Dixon, solicitor at law firm Gordons and an expert in cyber security, says the Royal Mail incident shows just how disruptive cyber incidents can be to an organisation\u2019s core business processes. She explains: \u201cThe threat of cyber incidents to organisations of every size and scale is ever-increasing, and this is another reminder that businesses must have the right systems in place to combat attacks, along with business continuity and recovery plans should this type of event take place.\u201d As we head into the European market close, International Distribution Services shares look set to end the day lower after a \u2018severe service disruption\u2019 to its overseas letter and parcel delivery service following a \u2018cyber incident\u2019, Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor tells us: Its import services are continuing but are facing minor delays. Royal Mail says it is working hard to resolve the issue with some customers potentially experiencing \u2018delay or disruption to items already shipped for export.\u2019 It has asked customers to \u2018stop submitting any export items into the network while we work hard to resolve the issue.\u2019 This is yet another headwind for Royal Mail which had a torrid 2022, weighed down by heavy industrial action, the end of the pandemic era parcel boom, a structural long-term decline in letter volumes and cost inflation. International Distribution Services\u2019 finances are in a tough spot too with its latest results outlining a half-year adjusted operating loss of \u00a357 million, swinging from a profit of \u00a3404 million last year. Investor confidence is also in a bad way with shares down more than 55% over a one-year period, significantly underperforming the wider market. Drastic action is needed to revamp the business with serious job reductions and other cost cuts on the horizon. First class stamps may also go up in price again while the postal service is arguing that it should stop weekend deliveries altogether in order to avoid the price hike. Today\u2019s cyber incident means Royal Mail is unable to send letters and parcels overseas. It is telling customers to stop sending items overseas while it tries to resolve the issue, the BBC adds here. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take on the Royal Mail disruption: Britain\u2019s Royal Mail said on Wednesday it was facing severe disruption to its international export services following what it described as \u201ca cyber incident\u201d. \u201cWe are temporarily unable to despatch items to overseas destinations,\u201d Royal Mail, one of the world\u2019s largest post and parcel firms, said in a service update on its website. It advised customers to temporarily hold any export mail items while it works to resolve the issue. The company, part of International Distributions Services Plc, said it was working with external experts to investigate the incident and had also reported it to regulators and security authorities. Royal Mail said its import services remained operational, albeit with minor delays. Royal Mail says its team are \u201cworking around the clock \u201cto resolve the disruption to its international export services from a cyber incident. It adds: We immediately launched an investigation into the incident and we are working with external experts. We have reported the incident to our regulators and the relevant security authorities. Royal Mail is experiencing \u201csevere service disruption\u201d to its international export services following a cyber incident, the company announced. In a service incident (online here), the company says: Royal Mail is experiencing severe service disruption to our international export services following a cyber incident. We are temporarily unable to despatch items to overseas destinations. We strongly recommend that you temporarily hold any export mail items while we work to resolve the issue. Items that have already been despatched may be subject to delays. We would like to sincerely apologise to impacted customers for any disruption this incident is causing. Gold futures reached a fresh eight-month high today. Gold futures for February delivery traded as high as $1,890.90, according to Marketwatch. It says traders are betting that China\u2019s decision to drop Covid-19 restrictions on its economy would continue to boost prices of precious and industrial metals. Wall Street has opened higher too. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 major US companies has gained 75 points, or 0.22%, to 33,779 points, with the broader S&amp;P 500 index up almost 0.5%. The FTSE 100 index is continuing to climb to four-year highs. It\u2019s now up 69 points or 0.9% at 7763, having hit 7772 a few minutes ago extending its earlier gains to levels not seen since summer 2018. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, says economic optimism is lifting shares: Investors remain in an upbeat mood going into tomorrow\u2019s US inflation report, buoyed still by the December jobs report and the prospect of the economy being less squeezed by interest rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell may have refrained from commenting on the monetary policy outlook on Tuesday but the chances are, he wouldn\u2019t have said anything investors would have liked even if he had addressed it. It\u2019s been clear from other commentaries that policymakers are sticking to the hawkish script. Another good inflation number tomorrow could change that as the trend has already been very encouraging and the jobs data that appeared to throw a spanner in the works last month has since been revised out. From an investor perspective, it would take something pretty terrible tomorrow - the inverse of what we were treated to on Friday - to really rock the boat. In a fantasy world, the would-be rescuer of Britishvolt would be a consortium that included a car manufacturer or two, our finance editor Nils Pratley writes. The ailing startup would instantly get what it needs most after six months of crisis: endorsement for a battery product that is still in development, plus some future customers. At that point, the big political claims made about Britishvolt, its planned gigafactory in Northumberland and \u201cthe UK\u2019s place at the helm of the global green industrial revolution\u201d, as the former prime minister Boris Johnson put it a year ago, would start to sound more credible. Sadly, the deal on the table does not resemble a dream version. The prospective buyer is a consortium led by DeaLab Group, a little-known UK-based private equity investor with backing from interests in Indonesia. Details are sketchy until Britishvolt\u2019s board votes on the proposal on Friday but, as far as one can tell, the Indonesian angle seems to be access to metals needed to produce batteries \u2013 lithium, nickel, cobalt and so on. All useful, but, if the consortium has expertise in battery chemistry or in supplying the automotive industry with vital kit, it has so far kept quiet. Therein lies one reason to be underwhelmed. Another is the fact that Britishvolt is being valued at only \u00a332m, or 90%-plus less than a year ago. Good luck to DealLab but the outline proposal reinforces the fact that the fast action in the global gigafactory race is happening outside the UK\u2026 More here: The cost of living crisis is the most severe global risk to the world economy over the next two years. It\u2019s followed by natural disasters and extreme weather events, and the risk of geoeconomic confrontation, on the threats facing us over the next two years. That\u2019s the conclusion from the World Economic Forum\u2019s latest Global Risks Report, released today ahead of next week\u2019s Annual Meeting in Davos. It polls the views of 1,200 government, business and civil society professionals. The report warns that the economic aftereffects of COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine have led to skyrocketing inflation, a rapid normalization of monetary policies and started a low-growth, low-investment era, adding: Governments and central banks could face stubborn inflationary pressures over the next two years, not least given the potential for a prolonged war in Ukraine, continued bottlenecks from a lingering pandemic, and economic warfare spurring supply chain decoupling. It also warns of the downside risks to the economic outlook also loom large, as \u201ca mismatch\u201d between monetary and fiscal policies could lead to liquidity shocks, causing a longer economic downturn and debt distress \u201con a global scale\u201d. Saadia Zahidi, managing director at WEF, says: As the conflict between Russia and Ukraine approaches one year, economies and societies will not easily rebound from continued shocks. In this year\u2019s Global Risks Perception Survey, more than four in five respondents anticipated consistent volatility over the next two years. The persistence of these crises is already reshaping the world that we live in, ushering in economic and technological fragmentation. A continued push for national resilience in strategic sectors will come at a cost \u2013 one that only a few economies can bear. Geopolitical dynamics are also creating significant headwinds for global cooperation, which often acts as a guardrail to these global risks. Looking further ahead, the climate emergency dominates the top long-term risks. That list of topped by \u201cFailure to mitigate climate change\u201d, followed by \u201cFailure of climate-change adaption\u201d, \u201cNatural disasters and extreme weather events\u201d and \u201cBiodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse\u201d. More here: The publisher of the Mirror and the Express is to cut 200 roles in a \u00a330m cost-cutting drive, after advertisers failed to spend heavily through the World Cup, Black Friday and Christmas season. Reach, which also owns hundreds of regional titles including the Manchester Evening News, Birmingham Mail and Liverpool Echo, reported a slump of 20.2% in print advertising and 5.9% in digital ads in the traditionally strong fourth quarter. The company said this was largely due to a significantly lower than anticipated benefit from traditionally stronger ad spending around Black Friday and Christmas, which has affected the whole sector. It added: \u201cMore broadly, we have also seen the continued impact of macroeconomic and consumer uncertainty, reflected in slowing market demand for advertising.\u201d More here: S&amp;P Global Ratings has forecast that European housing prices are set to decline \u2013 but not crash \u2013 in most countries in the region over 2023 and through 2024. A new report predicts that rising mortgage costs will hit house prices, with UK house prices forecast to fall 3.5% in 2023. The report also forecasts that a strong rebound over the next three years remains unlikely, as the downward adjustment in housing prices to higher interest rates will take time. S&amp;P Global Ratings says: We forecast a decline--but no crash--in house prices in most European countries over 2023 and through 2024 for others, with few if any prospects of a strong rebound through 2025. That\u2019s because housing prices as well as investment are likely to suffer from rapidly rising mortgage rates. It will take time for market prices and investment to adjust fully to those higher interest rates, with some countries taking longer than others. We have found that such an adjustment could last up to 10 quarters and is typically twice as pronounced as after a low-rate regime. That said, the past has shown that housing prices in Europe are quite inelastic to decline. And today\u2019s drivers (such as limited supply, a strong labor market, high household wealth, and what appear to be shifts in preferences) may lessen the effect of rising interest rates. Parcel firm Evri has apologised to customers across the UK who are continuing to wait for delayed Christmas deliveries. The firm said that staff shortages, Royal Mail strikes and bad weather had contributed to the problems and it was working to sort them out. An Evri spokeswoman said (via PA Media): \u201cWe are sorry that some customers are experiencing short, localised delays in receiving their parcels. \u201cWe continue to be impacted by high demand, staff shortages and bad weather conditions but due to the hard work of our local teams, we successfully delivered over three million parcels each day over recent weeks. \u201cDespite incredible efforts from all of our people, our service has not been as good as we would have liked in some areas, and we are committed to redoubling our efforts this year including a focus on recruitment. \u201cIn some local areas, there are still some delayed parcels that should be cleared over the next few days and we apologise for any inconvenience and disappointment. \u201cHowever, in the unlikely event that a parcel hasn\u2019t been delivered within 10 days, we would advise customers to contact their retailer/seller who will in turn contact us if necessary.\u201d While stocks are rallying, the pound is having a more mixed day. Sterling has dipped by a third of a cent against the US dollar, to $1.212. Against the euro, it\u2019s lost 0.3 of a eurocent to \u20ac1.129. Concerns over the UK\u2019s economy prospects have been weighing on the pound recently. Georgette Boele, senior FX strategist at ABN Amro, explained: \u201cThe economic outlook for the UK has already deteriorated substantially and is worse than that for the U.S. and the eurozone.\u201d With the UK expected to fall into recession, the Bank of England may raise interest rates more slowly than forecast, which would also weaken sterling. The UK was the only G7 country to suffer a drop in productivity in 2021, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show. Output per hour worked in current prices was \u00a346.92 in the UK in 2021, 10% lower than the other G7 nations\u2019 average, the ONS says, and down from \u00a347.58 in 2020. All other G7 countries saw a rise in output per hour worked, apart from Japan where there was a lack of data for the ONS to work with. In 2021, the UK\u2019s output per hour worked was lower than France, Germany and the United States, but higher than Canada and Italy, the report shows. Longer NHS waiting lists and rising inactivity due to ill health are hitting productivity in the UK, says Paul McGuckin, head of employee benefits distribution at consultancy Broadstone: \u201cThe UK\u2019s productivity continues to lie substantially behind many of its major international peers including the USA, France and Germany. \u201cOf more immediate concern will be the direction of travel with the UK the only G7 nation to see its productivity go into reverse in 2021 following the pandemic. With the economy set to enter recession, the nation\u2019s productivity puzzle will be a key challenge for the Prime Minister and businesses to overcome in the year ahead. \u201cProductivity has a huge impact on the economy and people\u2019s standard of living. But growing NHS waiting lists, diminishing access to treatment and surging economic inactivity due to ill-health are all weighing on productivity in the UK. \u201cBusinesses that proactively implement effective incentivisation and employee benefits programmes throughout their entire workforce will be best placed to retain staff, drive better performance and grow in a post-Covid landscape.\u201d UK bank NatWest has announced a new package of Cost of Living support measures, including \u00a35.7m of funding for charities and partners. NatWest is giving \u00a31m to the Trussell Trust, the food bank charity, to support the Help through Hardship scheme, plus over \u00a31.6m to the debt advice sector; \u00a3900k for Responsible Finance to support provision of accessible credit to people; and a \u00a31m partnership with Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) to provide cost of living support. NatWest is also giving struggling customers more time to repay debts, it says: From early February this year, where customers have missed several payments on an unsecured debt such as a loan or overdraft, the bank will extend the time for them to repay their debt from 18 to 24 months, giving them more time and flexibility. European financial markets are relatively upbeat after a good showing on Wall Street last night, ahead of the next US inflation numbers on Thursday, says AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. \u201cIt helped that a speech by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell yesterday didn\u2019t contain any shocks which would cause investors to worry about markets even more. JD Sports\u2019 upbeat trading statement helped to drive renewed interest in the retail sector and extended a trend that gathered pace last week when Next said it had experienced a good Christmas. JD Sports said more work available for its young shoppers and better availability of key brands helped spur a surge in sales over Christmas, my colleague Sarah Butler reports. The retailer, which operates in Europe and the US as well as the UK, said sales surged more than 10% in six months to New Year\u2019s Eve, compared to 5% growth in the first half of the year. Growth was strongest in the US and in stores - but it also saw growth online as shoppers could pick up orders from stores, staving off concerns about deliveries. R\u00e9gis Schultz, the chief executive of JD, said young shoppers had more cash in their pockets than a year ago thanks to the reopening of retail and hospitality which had provided jobs, while inflation had prompted people to go out and buy instead of waiting for bargains. He added that competition from online pure plays was waning as the costs of delivery racked up. \u201cInvestors are now saying to online players you have got to make money. The era of the free lunch for online pure plays is a little bit over.\u201d The UK\u2019s blue-chip share index has hit its highest level in over four years. The FTSE 100 index has climbed by around 0.7% to hit 7749 points, up 55 points today, the highest level since August 2018. The Footsie has been lifted today by gains in mining stocks and retailers. JD Sports are the best performing stock, up 7%, after lifting its profit outlook towards the top end of expectations this morning following strong sales growth in the run-up to Christmas. Fellow retailers Frasers (+3.6%) and Next (+2.7%) are also among the top risers. Mining stocks are also rallying, despite the World Bank\u2019s warning yesterday that the world economy risked falling back into recession. Copper-producer Antofagasta (+2.6%), Anglo American (+1.9%) and Glencore (+2%) are benefitting from China\u2019s move to relax Covid-19 restrictions. Commodity prices have been rising this year, as Raffi Boyadjian, lead investment analyst at XM, explains: Copper futures have jumped about 7% so far this year and an increasing number of analysts are predicting that oil prices will top $100 a barrel again in 2023. In the meantime, though, concerns about a recession and some doubts about how quickly Chinese demand will rebound when Covid infections are so high are putting a lid on any upside in oil. Investors are also relieved that Jerome Powell, the head of America\u2019s Federal Reserve central bank, didn\u2019t push back against expectations of a slowing in US interest rate rises when he spoke yesterday. The markets are also hoping for a drop in US inflation, when the latest consumer price index figures are released. Boyadjian points out that a drop in inflation could encourage the Fed to stop hiking interest rates as rapidly. Sentiment was boosted on Friday from signs that wage pressures in the United States are easing and that the services sector is headed for a sharp slowdown, but the hawkish rhetoric that later followed revived recession worries. If Thursday\u2019s CPI figures point to further moderation in inflation in December, it\u2019s likely to fuel bets that the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle is nearing the end. The internationally-focused FTSE 100 outperformed major rivals last year. It gained almost 1% in 2022, while global markets fell 20%. It is now approaching its record high, of 7903.5 points, set in May 2018. Bernard Arnault, the world\u2019s richest person, has appointed his daughter Delphine to run Christian Dior, the second-biggest brand in his LVMH luxury goods empire. Arnault, 73, is the chief executive, chair and majority shareholder of the group, which owns a swathe of high-end businesses including Louis Vuitton, Tiffany, Givenchy, Kering and Moet Hennessy. He announced on Wednesday that his eldest daughter would become Dior\u2019s Cchief executive and chair as part of a shake-up of the \u20ac382bn (\u00a3337bn) conglomerate. Delphine Arnault, who is the executive vice-president of Louis Vuitton and in charge of its product product-related activities, will take up the new position from 1 February. The 47-year-old joined the family business in 2000 after two years at the management consultancy firm McKinsey and studying at the London School of Economics. She joined the LVMH board in 2003 \u2013 becoming the first woman and youngest person to serve on it. Her father said: \u201cUnder Delphine\u2019s leadership, the desirability of Louis Vuitton products advanced significantly, enabling the brand to regularly set new sales records. Her keen insights and incomparable experience will be decisive assets in driving the ongoing development of Christian Dior.\u201d More here. Britain\u2019s largest housebuilder, Barratt Developments, has introduced a hiring freeze and is \u201csignificantly\u201d cutting back on buying land as it steels itself for a further slump in the UK housing market, my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff reports. Barratt said it was responding to a \u201cmarked slowdown\u201d in the UK housing market after a rise in interest rates that had made mortgages more expensive for prospective homebuyers. The company said the average weekly net number of private reservations of properties fell in the second half of last year, down from 259 to 155. It was also forced to scrap building plans for 3,293 land plots, cancelling out the 3,003 plots that proceeded with construction. The net cancellation of 290 plots compares with the net addition of 8,869 a year earlier. More here. Shares of Darktrace have touched a record low this morning, after the UK cybersecurity firm cut its revenue forecasts and said the economic downturn was hitting sales. Cambridge-based Darktrace says there was a \u201cnoticeable\u201d slowdown in new customer additions towards the end of last year, as economic uncertainty made potential customers more reluctant to run product trials. It says the impact of macro-economic uncertainty on new customer growth has been greater than expected, and is lowering its guidance for annual recurring revenue (ARR) from customers, and for revenue. Darktrace uses artificial intelligence to spot attacks on a company\u2019s network, and other security threats. Cathy Graham, CFO of Darktrace, said the current macro-economic environment is creating challenges to winning new customers. In regions with historically higher conversion rates, those rates starting to decline, Graham adds. Shares in Darktrace fell as low as 240p, below the 250p at which it floated in 2021, before recovering a little to 252p, down 14% today. Last September, US private equity firm Thoma Bravo walked away from a potential takeover of the business. Heathrow has reported its busiest Christmas getaway since 2019, but claimed that bringing in new Covid-19 tests on arrivals from China could hurt the recovery. The airport handled 5.9m passengers in December, a 90% increase on the same month a year ago, as \u201cChristmas and New Year reunions fuelled passenger growth\u201d. Transatlantic travel was a key driver behind last month\u2019s high passenger volumes, making New York\u2019s JFK the busiest route for Heathrow. Heathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye says: \u201c2022 ended on a high with our busiest Christmas in three years and a smooth and efficient service for passengers, thanks to the hard work of our colleagues and close planning with airlines, their ground handlers and Border Force.\u201d Through 2022, Heathrow saw 61.6m passengers, an increase of 217% or 42.2m compared with 2021. Heathrow says this is the highest passenger increase of any airport in Europe, \u201cand possibly worldwide\u201d. But it warns: We are concerned that the recovery of the aviation sector, which is critical to the economy, could be set back by the reintroduction of testing for travellers in the UK and elsewhere in response to increasing COVID levels in China, even though governments acknowledge there is no scientific basis for doing so. UK prime minister Rishi Sunak decided to introduce tests on arrivals from China at the end of December, after other countries including the US and Italy brought in similar measures. But scientists told the Observer that screening people coming from China would make little difference, as the number of Covid-19 infections in the UK was already very high, while airport checks had been shown to be unreliable in pinpointing disease carriers. If there is to be a correction in UK house prices, it will be driven by the homeowners whose fixed rate mortgage deals are set to expire over the next 12 months, says Zainab Atiyyah, analyst at Third Bridge. But the UK\u2019s \u201cmassive undersupply of new-build and second-hand houses.\u201d will cushion that effect, Atiyyah points out. \u201cOverall, our experts expect a slowdown in sales to continue in 2023 despite new stamp duty thresholds, as supply continues to dwindle.\u201d \u201cThose on Help to Buy deals will be crossing their fingers and hoping their deals don\u2019t fall apart as new homes are delayed or not completed by the end of the year. Looking forward, housebuilders may have to offer their own shared equity schemes to make their homes more affordable to first-time buyers.\u201d \u201cWith first-time buyers facing a very challenging environment, Barratt is likely to focus on the middle market, changing its product mix to increase the volume of detached and 3-4-bedroom homes.\u201d Many City economists and housing economists predict house prices will drop this year, as this table shows: Housebuilders will also face rising costs; Third Bridge predicts that building material inflation will continue at 8-10% over the next 12 months, with \u201cBarratt forced to absorb most of these costs\u201d. Insurance company Direct Line is scrapping its final dividend for 2022 after a surge in claims from customers during the recent severe weather. Penny James, Direct Line\u2019s chief executive officer, says the fourth quarter of 2022 was \u201cvolatile and challenging\u201d. The UK was hit by snow and ice weather warnings in December, as the record for the coldest night of the year so far was broken. James says: We have seen a significant increase in claims as a result of the prolonged period of severe cold weather in December and I am proud of the way that we have supported our customers during this period. These claims, combined with further increases in motor inflation, have had a significant impact on our underwriting result for 2022. Direct Line says it expects around \u00a390m of claims from the \u2018freeze event\u2019 in December. It has helped three thousand customers deal with burst pipes, water tanks and other related damage. Direct Line says: This, together with the freeze event from January 2022 and subsidence related claims over the summer means that we currently expect total weather claims to be in the region of \u00a3140 million for 2022, well above our 2022 expectation of \u00a373 million. Direct Line\u2019s motor insurance division also saw an increase in third party claims inflation during the fourth quarter of last year, and more claims in the quarter --partly due to adverse weather conditions. Shares in Direct Line have tumbled 28%, to 166p. JD Sports has also predicted its profits will be towards the top end of expectations, following a jump in sales over Christmas. JD Sports\u2019 revenues grew by over 10% in the 22 weeks to 31 December 2022, accelerating to more than 20% in the six-weeks to 31 December 2022. It now expects pre-tax profits for the year to 28 January to be \u201ctowards the top end\u201d of market expectations (\u00a3933m to \u00a3985m), although the final performance depends how the post-Christmas sales go. Shares in JD Sports have jumped 4.6% in early trading, to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. Record sales of Champagne and prosecco have helped to push profits at Sainsbury\u2019s to the upper end of forecasts. The supermarket chain has reported that profits this year are expected to be towards the upper end of its guidance range of \u00a3630m to \u00a3690m, although still below last year\u2019s profits of \u00a3730m. J Sainsbury\u2019s retail sales, excluding fuel, rose by 5.2% year-on-year in its third quarter (to 7th January). Grocery sales were 5.6% higher \u2013 and 12.5% ahead of pre-pandemic levels. And in the Christmas period, sales rose 7.1%, with grocery sales up 7.1%, general merchandise sales up 7.4% and clothing sales up 5.1%. That included a 22% jump in Taste the Difference Mince Pies, and a 49% rise in Taste the Difference Panettone, while there was \u201crecord sales for Champagne and prosecco\u201d. But Simon Roberts, chief executive of J Sainsbury, flags that 2023 will be tough for households. \u201cWe understand money will be exceptionally tight this year particularly as many people wait for Christmas bills to land. We are working together with our suppliers to battle cost inflation and we\u2019re keeping prices low again this year with our biggest value campaign yet in January, price matching Aldi on around 300 of our most popular products. John Moore, senior investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, says Sainsbury\u2019s traded strongly during the key Christmas period, but faces a darkening outlook. Notable within the results is that grocery sales are 19% above pre-pandemic levels and Argos has helped add sales, and no doubt footfall, in the more integrated click-and-collect model the company has adopted. However, the backdrop for consumers is expected to darken in 2023, and there are several hints at this in today\u2019s statement. That said, Sainsbury\u2019s is reasonably well placed in terms of the balance of its business offering and still has levers to pull in property \u2013 which could be sold and leased back \u2013 and further cost and efficiency savings, giving it the opportunity to keep pace with competitors and reinvest in product pricing.\u201d Andy Murphy, director at Edison Group, says Barratt looks to be in a \u2018far better financial position\u2019 today, than it was in the last downturn: Although the total number of completions increased from 8,067, to 8,826 in H1, there was a sharp slowdown in the number of net private reservations in the period. In the whole six months from the start of July, the net private reservation rate was 0.44 homes/site/week. However, in the period from the AGM on 10 October, the rate fell further, from 0.69, to 0.30. The slowdown is the result of many well documented macro factors and has seen the Company hold back on land investment, with a net cancellation of 290 plots, ie Barratt chose not to purchase already agreed plots over newly agreed plots, vs an approval of 8,869 plots last year. Consequently, cash of the balance sheet was strong at \u00a3965m down from \u00a31.1bn at the same point last year despite the investment of \u00a3260m in dividends and \u00a3100m in share buybacks. This clearly implies that Barratt is in a far better financial position than it was going into the last downturn. Murphy adds that Barratt\u2019s home completions could miss forecasts, if there isn\u2019t a bounce in demand this spring (as flagged in the opening post). Barratt is pointing towards a Spring trading pattern of 0.5 homes/site/week, assuming a bounce that is usual at that time of year. This would imply volumes of 17,475, in line with consensus. If the bounce does not happen, then volumes could be in the range of 16,000 to 16,400 and there would be an implied downgrade to consensus. Barratt has been hit by several headwinds \u2013 including the jump in mortgage costs and the disruption caused by the mini-budget, explain Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor: \u201cBarratt Development said its order book on 31st December hit \u00a32.54bn, considerably lower than \u00a33.79bn from the same time last year while its sales rate per outlet per week hit 0.44 homes in the final quarter of 2022, falling sharply from 0.79 in same period in 2021. Rising mortgage rates, a slowing housing market, build cost inflation and the fallout from the mini-budget have been key headwinds for Barratt Developments in recent months. Investor sentiment is sour towards the sector after a very tough year on the stock market with shares in Barratt Development down more than 40% over a one-year period. Persimmon is nursing an even more painful share price slump, down by over 50% year-on-year. Cost-of-living pressures are prompting many potential homeowners to hold off from buying a property as they wait hopefully for mortgage rates and house prices to cool further later this year into next year. Although forecasts are for the housing market to soften this year, a chronic shortage of supply of UK housing is stemming a more aggressive slump.\u201d Barratt\u2019s net land approvals were negative in the last six months of 2022, with a net 290 housing plots cancelled as it responded to the slowdown in the market. It approved 16 new sites, but that was more than offset by 22 previously approved sites which will no longer proceed. Barratt explains: The approved sites added 3,003 plots, with 3,293 plots removed with respect to the sites no longer proceeding, resulting in a net cancellation of 290 plots in the half year. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The UK housing market has seen a \u201cmarked slowdown\u201d in the last six months, according to housebuilder Barratt this morning. The UK\u2019s largest housebuilder has told the City that demand in the first half of 2023 is likely to be hit by rising mortgage rates and the cost of living squeeze, which will \u201cundoubtedly impact trading\u201d. In a trading update for the half year to 31 December, Barratt warns that the outlook for the second half of its financial year is \u201cuncertain\u201d. Homebuyer confidence and the availability and competitive pricing of mortgages will be \u201ccritical to the health of the UK housing market in the coming months\u201d, it says. If demand picks up in the spring as nomal, Barratt will be on track to complete 17,475 homes, as the market expects. But, if trading remain at recent levels, home completions will be lower \u2013 at 16,000 to 16,500. Its forward order book has dropped to 10,511 homes, worth \u00a32.5bn, over \u00a31bn less than a year ago when it was 14,818 homes (worth \u00a33.8bn). Barratt says it has already responded to the slowdown, by significantly reducing land approvals, pausing recruitment of new employees and introducing further controls for new site openings to manage its working capital deployment. David Thomas, chief executive, says Barratt delivered \u201ca strong operating performance\u201d for the last six months, despite challenges. Thomas says: The first half of the financial year has however seen a marked slowdown in the UK housing market. Political and economic uncertainty impacted the first quarter; this was then compounded by rapid and significant changes in mortgage rates which reduced affordability, homebuyer confidence and reservation activity through the second quarter. That \u2018political and economic uncertainty\u2019 included the turmoil around the mini-budget in September, which drove up mortgage rates and hit demand. Barratt\u2019s net bookings rate per average week fell to 0.30 from 10th October to the end of December, lower than the 0.69 seen during the corresponding period a year earlier. Halifax and Nationwide have both reported that house prices have fallen in recent months, as those rising borrowing costs weighed on the market. Many forecasters predict prices will drop this year.

            "content": "That\u2019s where we\u2019ll leave our coverage for today. Thanks very much for sticking with me. Here\u2019s a recap of the day\u2019s events: Firefighters in South Australia are preparing for a long night battling an out-of-control blaze near the town of Montacute in the Adelaide Hills. The fire is burning in inaccessible, steep terrain in a local reserve, Black Hill conservation park. Almost 60 firefighting vehicles have been deployed and the Country Fire Service is using water bombers to attack the fire. Residents have been warned they may be in danger. The NSW opposition leader, Chris Minns, says he doubts Dominic Perrottet\u2019s admissions he wore a Nazi uniform to his 21st birthday will affect the upcoming state election. Minns says the premier made a mistake and has apologised to the Jewish community. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says the government\u2019s changes to a mechanism to lower greenhouse gas emissions from major emitters strike the right balance. The changes have been criticised for allowing emitters to rely heavily on buying offsets, rather than forcing genuine decarbonisation. Albanese said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got the balance right. And I\u2019d say to those people in the parliament that they should listen to what industry are saying, listen to what economists are saying as well.\u201d The body of Cardinal George Pell is lying in state in a dark brown coffin on the floor of the small Church of St Stephen of the Abyssinians in Vatican City. Early on Friday in the Vatican, Reuters reported about 20 people were seen kneeling in prayer in the church when it opened for 10 hours of lying in state. Parts of the church date back to the fifth century. The body of a missing bushwalker has been found on the New South Wales Central Coast, police believe. NSW police say: Just after 8pm (Friday 13 January 2023), officers from Brisbane Water Police District were notified that a 78-year-old woman became lost while bushwalking on a trail. Police were told the woman \u2013 who is visiting from the USA \u2013 was in bushland in the vicinity of Middle Head, between Pearl and Patonga Beach. A multi-agency search of the area immediately commenced, with assistance from the Dog Unit, PolAir, Marine Area Command, Surf Life Saving NSW, NSW Ambulance, the Toll Ambulance Rescue Helicopter and Marine Rescue. The search was suspended about 3am and resumed this morning along the coast line, in the bushland and from the air. During the search today (Saturday 14 January 2023), a body, believed to be that of the missing woman, was sighted by PolAir in Patonga before being retrieved by ground crews. The body is yet to be formally identified. A report will be prepared for the information of the Coroner. Man dies in collision on Queensland\u2019s Tamborine Mountain Road Queensland police say a 61-year-old man has died in a collision between a motorcycle and a vehicle on the Tamborine Mountain this morning. Police said in a statement: Initial investigations indicate just before 10.45am on Tamborine Mountain Road a crash has occurred involving a motorcycle and vehicle. The motorcyclist, a 61-year-old Ipswich man, died at the scene. Four occupants in the vehicle were not physically injured. The Forensic Crash Unit is investigating the circumstances of the crash. Anyone with information or dashcam footage in the area at the time is urged to contact police. Queensland police officer charged with computer hacking and misuse of information A Queensland police officer has been charged with computer hacking and misuse and the improper disclosure of information. The 26-year-old constable from Queensland\u2019s central region has been served with a notice to appear in court over the alleged offences. He has been suspended from duty and is expected to appear in Proserpine magistrates court on 16 January. In a statement, Queensland police said: In keeping with our commitment to high standards of behaviour, transparency and accountability, we have undertaken to inform the public when an officer faces serious allegations of misconduct. This does not mean that the allegations against the officer have been substantiated. Firefighters battle out-of-control bushfire in the Adelaide Hills Firefighters are continuing to battle an out-of-control bushfire in the Adelaide Hills, near the town of Montacute. The Country Fire Service has just issued a new update. It says 59 fire trucks and nine aircraft, including water bombers, are now responding to the blaze. The CFS, supported by SA Police, SA Metropolitan Fire Service and Dept of Environment and Water are responding to a scrub fire in the Black Hill Conservation Park off Gorge Road, Montacute. The fire is burning freely in steep inaccessible terrain within the Black Hill Conservation Park. There is currently a warning message issued for this fire. Refer to the CFS website for the most up to date warning information. Approximately 59 fire trucks supported by 9 aircraft including fire bombers and observation aircraft are working to contain the fire within the conservation park. Gorge Road remains closed to the public between the intersections of Kirkevue Road and Corkscrew Road. Corkscrew Road is closed between Gorge Road and Montacute Road. For updates visit the CFS website or phone the Information Hotline on 1800 362 361. Images and vision of the fire show it is throwing up a significant amount of smoke, which some Adelaide residents are saying can be seen from metropolitan Adelaide. Child found dead after being reported missing in Northern Territory community The ABC reports that a young child has been found dead after being reported missing in a remote part of the Northern Territory. NT police said the child was reported missing on Friday afternoon in the east Arnhem Land region. The child was found dead later in the afternoon near their home, but no cause of death has been released, the ABC reports. Police are not naming the community involved and would release no further information. \u201cInvestigations are ongoing and a report will be prepared for the coroner,\u201d police told the ABC. Lawyers reject suggestions of bogus claims being made amid huge asylum backlog Leading human rights lawyers have rubbished suggestions people are seizing on huge backlogs of asylum applications to lodge bogus claims for protection. The Refugee Council of Australia, in its submission to a government migration review, said the backlogs facilitated spurious applications for protection from people who could reside in the country for years because of protracted processes. But Hannah Dickinson, the principal solicitor of the Human Rights Law Program at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said the argument was a red herring. Dickinson told AAP: The Department of Home Affairs has always had mechanisms for dealing with unmeritorious claims, including prioritising them for faster decisions. I don\u2019t think any question of unmeritorious claims is really relevant to the backlog. There is no evidence to suggest any kind of large-scale intentional unmeritorious claims being made. We have application processes for visas because we require people to meet criteria. - AAP Adelaide Hills fire reportedly grew from five to 20 hectares in 10 minutes The Adelaide Advertiser is reporting that the fire in the Adelaide Hills, which is threatening the town of Montacute, grew from five hectares to 20 hectares in 10 minutes. The latest update from the CFS says the fire is burning freely in steep inaccessible terrain within the Black Hill conservation park and has spread to 30 hectares. Smoke is said to be visible from metropolitan Adelaide. The CFS says it has deployed 15 firetrucks supported by 8 aircraft, including firebombers and observational aircraft. Gorge Road has been closed to the public. Flood warnings in place as Queensland\u2019s north coast is battered by rain Queensland\u2019s north coast is being battered by heavy rain as a monsoon trough brings severe thunderstorms and heavy falls to the region. An alert for potentially life-threatening flash flooding is in place, with the Bureau of Meteorology warning six-hour rainfall totals between 100 and 180mm are likely along a 630km stretch of coast between Cardwell and Carmila. Isolated 24-hour totals of more than 300mm are also possible on Saturday and into Sunday, the bureau said. Flood watch notifications are in place for Mackay, Proserpine, Charters Towers, Bowen, Townsville, Moranbah, Collinsville, Ingham and Ayr. Several major roads \u2013 including the Bruce Highway near Mackay \u2013 are also partially closed on Saturday due to flooding. Queensland Fire and Emergency Services urged residents to keep up to date with warnings and alerts and not to attempt to drive through flood waters. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, echoed the caution on Saturday morning. \u201cFollow the advice of the authorities,\u201d he said to reporters. \u201cDon\u2019t risk driving through flood waters if they\u2019re present. Make sure that you stay safe because that\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d A police 4WD with an officer inside was swept off the Pump Creek causeway, near Almaden in far north Queensland, on Friday afternoon. The officer managed to get out of the vehicle as it was swept into Pump Creek and swam a short distance to the creek bank. He was not injured. \u2013 AAP South Australian fire burning in Black Hill conservation park The South Australian Country Fire Service has just issued an update on the fire threatening the small town of Montacute. The CFS says the fire is burning in \u201csteep inaccessible terrain within the Black Hill Conservation Park\u201d. Here\u2019s the full update: The CFS, supported by SAPOL and SAMFS is responding to a scrub fire at Gorge Road, Montacute. The fire is burning freely in steep inaccessible terrain within the Black Hill Conservation Park. There is currently a Warning Message issued for this fire. Refer to the CFS website for the most up to date warning information. Approximately 15 firetrucks supported by 8 aircraft including firebombers and observational aircraft are working to contain the fire within the conservation park with additional trucks being responded to the scene. Gorge Road has been closed to the public. For updates visit the CFS website (www.cfs.sa.gov.au) or phone the Information Hotline on 1800 362 361. Here are some views of the fire threatening the small town of Montacute in the Adelaide Hills, which according to the 2016 census has a population of about 300 people. A reporter for the Adelaide Advertiser tweets the fire is burning in the Black Hill conservation park. Chris Minns doubts Perrottet\u2019s Nazi costume admission will affect NSW election The NSW opposition leader, Chris Minns, doubts Premier Dominic Perrottet\u2019s admissions he wore a Nazi uniform to his 21st birthday will affect the upcoming state election. AAP reports that Minns said this morning that Perrottet had made a mistake and had apologised to the Jewish community. Minns said: It\u2019s not up to me to absolve him or accept his apology on behalf of the state. Obviously those people from the Jewish community, returned service men and women, that were victims of the Nazi war machine. They\u2019re responsible for accepting his apology, not me. You\u2019re asking me whether it will affect the NSW election campaign. My sense is that it won\u2019t. Earlier this morning, Anthony Albanese said Perrottet\u2019s admission was \u201ca matter for him\u201d and it would be up to others to \u201cmake judgments based upon the premier\u2019s explanation\u201d. People in and around Montacute in the Adelaide Hills have been warned to take shelter now as an out of control bushfire threatens the small town. A warning about the scrub fire has been issued for people in Gorge Road, Main Ridge Track and Montacute, near Athelstone in the Mount Lofty Ranges. The warning from the South Australian Country Fire Service reads: You are now in danger. Take shelter now in a solid building. Do not leave or enter this area in a vehicle or on foot. It is too late to leave as the roads will not be safe. Conditions are dangerous and firefighters are now unable to prevent the fire spreading. Shelter before the fire arrives as heat can kill you well before the flames reach you. The MONTACUTE fire is uncontrolled. This scrub fire is burning in a South Easterly direction towards Montacute Rd, Montacute. Conditions are continually changing. Flooding closes Bruce Highway in far north Queensland Heavy rain in north Queensland has cut the Bruce Highway in both directions around Mackay. The Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting heavy rain and flooding in the state\u2019s far north. Socceroos teenage sensation Garang Kuol made his debut overnight for Edinburgh-based Scottish Premiership team Heart of Midlothian. Kuol, 18, came on the field as a substitute in the 76th minute in Hearts\u2019 home game against St Mirren, which ended 1-0 for Kuol\u2019s new team. Kuol was loaned to Hearts earlier this week by his parent club, the English Premier League\u2019s Newcastle United. Robbie Nelson, the Hearts manager, had a few words about the 18-year-old\u2019s debut. Garang is just a young kid coming in and we thought giving him 15, 20 minutes just to build him in. But you can see already his speed of movement and decision-making is top level. The fears of flooding in far north Queensland have been heightened with a severe weather warning for parts of the north. The Bureau of Meteorology has said this morning areas between Cardwell and Carmila could see flash flooding with heavy rainfall expected. Later today, the bureau says intense falls are possible north of Bowen that could see up to 250mm fall in a six-hour period. Those intense falls could spread south on Sunday. Dutton\u2019s approach to Indigenous voice is \u2018straight from John Howard\u2019s playbook\u2019 Political reporter Paul Karp has some insights into the opposition leader Peter Dutton\u2019s tactics on the issue of an Indigenous voice to parliament. The real political dynamite, says Karp, is Dutton\u2019s line that a body could be enacted when parliament resumes. The tactics are straight out of the John Howard playbook. More from the prime minister\u2019s press conference in Townsville earlier this hour, where he was asked about changes to a mechanism to lower greenhouse gas emissions from major emitters. There have been some strong criticisms the government\u2019s changes will allow big emitters to rely too much on buying offsets, rather than forcing genuine decarbonisation at their facilities. Anthony Albanese said: We\u2019ve got the balance right. And I\u2019d say to those people in the parliament that they should listen to what industry are saying, listen to what economists are saying as well. What you need to do is to provide a pathway for lowering emissions. That\u2019s what our program of Powering Australia is doing. That\u2019s what our Rewiring the Nation program is doing. That\u2019s what our hydrogen hubs are doing as well. Not disrupting the system so that it loses support because you have disruption and industry not being able to reduce their emissions over the shortest time possible. We want to work with industry to do that. We\u2019ve got the balance right, which is why both the Coalition and the minor parties should support our program when it goes to the House of Representatives and the Senate. My colleague Adam Morton has looked this morning at what needs to happen with the Labor government\u2019s climate policies to make them a success. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has responded to the admission of the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, that he wore a Nazi uniform to his 21st birthday party. At a press conference just finished in Townsville, Albanese said had been in PNG but had seen the statements from the NSW premier. I have observed his statements. That\u2019s a matter for him, and then for others who\u2019ll make judgments based upon the premier\u2019s explanation. New technique reveals otherwise invisible fingerprints on banknotes Federal police are using a new forensic technique to reveal otherwise invisible fingerprints on banknotes, allowing them to make breakthroughs in a number of major operations. The Australian Federal Police says it is using a technique known as vacuum metal deposition (VMD) at its Canberra-based forensics lab. The technique uses the thermal evaporation of metals, typically gold, zinc, or silver, inside a chamber. The process causes the metals to form thin films and develop invisible fingerprints, which can then be analysed by forensics experts. AFP forensic coordinator Dr Nathan Scudder said the technique has allowed for breakthroughs in operation ironside, allowing for arrests to be made following 20 seizures of proceeds of crime money. Scudder: These banknotes were sent to our Majura Forensic Facility to undergo specialist fingerprint development in a purpose built machine. This is an extremely powerful and sensitive process where precious metals such as gold can actually enhance the fingerprints of individuals that have touched the exhibits, such as banknotes. Suddenly evidence that was not visible before has been miraculously recovered, thanks to this capability. The body of Cardinal George Pell is lying in state in a dark brown coffin on the floor of the small Church of St. Stephen of the Abyssinians in Vatican city. Early on Friday in the Vatican, Reuters reports about 20 people were seen kneeling in prayer in the church when it opened for 10 hours of lying in state. Parts of the church date back to the fifth century. Reuters reports the preparations for a funeral mass at St Peter\u2019s Basilica in the Vatican \u2013 scheduled for 9.30pm AEDT today \u2013 have been overshadowed by revelations Pell was the author of an anonymous memo that branded the papacy of Pope Francis a catastrophe. Pope Francis praised Pell for his \u201cdetermination and wisdom\u201d earlier this week, before news broke of the anonymous memo. Pell\u2019s coffin is just metres away from the Pope\u2019s Santa Marta residence. Pell\u2019s funeral mass will take place across the road from the church. Plunging in to sewage diving: Australians reveal their weird careers What\u2019s the weirdest job you\u2019ve ever had? Besides, say, being a journalist? Fancy plunging in to a career as a sewage diver? How about leaping in to a vocation as a frog sniffer? Have you got your eye on being an ocularist making prosthetic eyeballs? Or maybe trying your hand at hand modelling? Donna Lu has asked five Australians about their odd careers. Rental crisis hits asylum seekers My colleague Stephanie Convery writes how the rental crisis is hitting asylum seekers. Asylum seekers in Australia are increasingly at risk of homelessness as the rental crisis continues to bite, with more than 70% of people who turn up to a leading asylum seeker support charity in housing distress unable to be placed in accommodation. The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre has shifted resources since the pandemic to provide emergency accommodation for asylum seekers who are sleeping rough or at immediate risk of homelessness. But right now, only 40 of the 150 or so people turning up to the centre for support can be accommodated. Kanye West \u201cmarries\u201d Australian designer: reports The world\u2019s tabloid online media is awash this morning with reports of an apparent \u201cmarriage\u201d between controversial rapper Kanye West \u2013 now known as Ye \u2013 and Australian designer Bianca Censori. In recent months Ye has unloaded a flurry of anti-semitic remarks, taken to praising Adolf Hitler and posting an image of a swastika inside a Star of David on his Twitter account \u2013 the latter getting him thrown off that social media site. In case you don\u2019t want to quickly rush away to search for all the news, photographers have reportedly seen the pair wearing wedding rings and they went on a holiday to a \u201cposh Utah resort\u201d which is being reported as a honeymoon. TMZ reports that: \u201cDespite the wedding ceremony, the union isn\u2019t legal because the pair do not appear to have filed a marriage certificate.\u201d Elle reports Censori works as a designed at Ye\u2019s company Yeezy. All this comes after Ye and his ex-wife Kim Kardashian reached a divorce settlement last November. Morning. Graham Readfearn with you now. Thanks to Martin Farrer for covering the first hour of the day. The Vatican mass for George Pell will be held at 11.30am local time in Rome today, which is 9.30pm AEDT today. The mass will be held at St Peter\u2019s Basilica in the Vatican, the same church where the funeral for former pope Benedict was held last week, Australian Associated Press reports. Pope Francis will give a final commendation for Pell, Australia\u2019s most senior Catholic, who died in Rome this week aged 81. In keeping with tradition for deceased cardinals, the mass will be said by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Italian Giovanni Battista Re, and the Pope will give the final blessing and commendation. The cardinal will also be remembered in a funeral at St Mary\u2019s Cathedral in Sydney, before being interred at St Mary\u2019s crypt, but no date has been set. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet and Victoria\u2019s Daniel Andrews ruled out holding state services for the former archbishop of Melbourne and Sydney. Andrews said on Thursday a state funeral or memorial would be distressing for victim-survivors, but the cardinal\u2019s legacy would be for others to judge. North Queensland on flood alert After a week that saw devastating floods in Western Australia, Queensland\u2019s north coast is on alert for potentially life-threatening flash flooding as a monsoon trough brings severe thunderstorms and intense downpours to the region. The Bureau of Meteorology says six-hour rainfall totals between 100 and 180 mm are likely and isolated 24-hour totals of more than 300mm possible along a 450km stretch of coast between Innisfail and Bowen and inland areas on Saturday and into Sunday, Australian Associated Press reports. It has issued flood watch notifications for Charters Towers, Bowen, Townsville, Palm Island, Ingham, Innisfail, Ayr, Cardwell, Giru, Abergowrie, Clare and Lucinda. The bureau said: Locally intense rainfall which may lead to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding is also possible over small portions of the warning area during this period. A vast swathe of inland central and northern Queensland could also see moderate to major flooding with 17 catchments placed on flood watch. Queensland Fire and Emergency Services warned residents to keep up to date with warnings and alerts and not to attempt to drive through floodwaters. Police echoed the caution as the \u201cextraordinary weather\u201d set in over the next several days. In a statement they said: Trying to navigate these hazards, either in vehicles or on foot, can be treacherous, as water levels rise and fall quickly and very often with little or no warning.\u201d Emergency services are struggling to comprehend why some motorists ignore notice signs and warnings that are erected on flooded roads. Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage this Saturday morning. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and I\u2019ll get you started with the top stories overnight before my colleague Graham Readfearn takes the wheel. The travails of New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet continue to dominate the headlines with the focus really now not so much on his donning of the Nazi uniform but who within the Liberal party wanted to use the revelation to damage him. Our state political reporters Michael McGowan and Tamsin Rose report that one insider says it\u2019s a bit like the film Knives Out \u2013 \u201cthere are about 20 people who it could\u2019ve been and they all had a motive\u201d. Ouch. The other big story of the week was the death of George Pell and, as the Vatican prepares to honour him later today with a funeral mass at St Peter\u2019s Basilica in Rome, we look at the cardinal\u2019s significant political legacy. Pell forged strong links with conservative politicians such as John Howard and Tony Abbott, writes our reporter Christopher Knaus, and \u201cwas afforded a degree of power and influence few other religious leaders could boast\u201d. It\u2019s been another lively night in America with Donald Trump\u2019s business empire, the Trump Organization, sentenced in a New York court to the maximum allowable fine of $1.6m for a tax fraud scheme going back at least 10 years. One of our Washington reporters, Chris Stein, says that although the fine itself is relatively small for a huge business, the symbolism of a criminal conviction for an entity so close to the former president is significant."

            "date": "2023-01-30T11:03:36Z",
            "content": "Global carbon emissions are expected to fall quicker than previously expected as a result of the war in Ukraine and Joe Biden\u2019s efforts to encourage green investment, BP has said. The oil and gas company said carbon emissions would fall more rapidly than it forecast a year ago thanks to renewed efforts by countries to pursue greater energy security by supporting domestic, renewable energy supplies. In its annual energy outlook report, BP said it had reduced forecasts for global emissions in 2030 by 3.7% and by 9.3% in 2050. It expects oil demand to be 5% lower and gas demand to have fallen by 6% by 2035. The company said deployment of renewables projects would be 5% higher at current rates. Countries moved rapidly last year to wean themselves off Russian gas supplies after the invasion of Ukraine. In the short term this has resulted in other fossil fuels such as coal being ramped up or kept on standby to fill the gap. However, demand for renewable projects to provide a cheap long-term replacement has also improved. Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which came into force in August, is credited with encouraging a new wave of investment in renewables in the US. Policymakers in the UK and EU have been encouraged to follow suit. BP\u2019s new outlook forecasts that global emissions will peak during the 2020s and fall by 30% on 2019 levels by about 2050. However, that would still be short of the target of net zero by 2050 needed to avoid extremely damaging global heating. The UK has legally committed to this goal. The BP chief economist, Spencer Dale, wrote in the report: \u201cFrom an energy perspective, the disruptions to Russian energy supplies and the resulting global energy shortages seem likely to have a material and lasting impact on the energy system. \u201cGlobal energy policies and discussions in recent years have been focused on the importance of decarbonising the energy system and the transition to net zero. The events of the past year have served as a reminder to us all that this transition also needs to take account of the security and affordability of energy.\u201d The BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, set a target of making the company net zero by \u201c2050 or sooner\u201d on taking charge in 2020. Looney has been attempting to revamp BP\u2019s image and increase its focus on renewables. However, it faced criticism over plans to spend up to double the amount on oil and gas projects than on renewable investments this year. In its outlook report, BP expects oil demand to level out at about 100m barrels a day over the next 10 years or so before falling to about 75m barrels a day by 2050. To hit global net zero goals, this would need to be reduced by 20m barrels a day. BP\u2019s profits have soared after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sent already inflated gas prices even higher and led ministers to introduce a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators. The company is expected to reveal fourth-quarter underlying profits of about $5bn next week."

            "title": "Australian councils told to cut emissions rather than spend millions on overseas carbon offsets",
            "date": "2023-01-24T03:35:36Z",
            "content": "Renewed questions are being asked about Australian councils\u2019 use of international projects to offset local carbon emissions, off the back of a Guardian investigation that found 90% of rainforest credits issued by one leading company were likely worthless. The research into Verra, a world leader in the rapidly growing voluntary offsets market, found that the majority of rainforest offset credits were likely \u201cphantom credits\u201d and do not represent genuine carbon reductions. The company strongly disputes the studies\u2019 conclusions, has strenuously defended its projects and challenged the methods used to undermine their credibility, saying they cannot capture the true impact of projects on the ground. They say this explains the difference between the credits it approves and the emission reductions estimated by scientists. But the revelations have energised critics of public entities for using offsets rather than concentrating on reducing their own emissions. Fifteen local governments in Australia, including those in central Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, trade offsets through Verra\u2019s registry platform, spending millions of dollars to claim carbon-neutral status. While the vast majority are not the rainforest credits that were the subject of the Guardian investigation, and its findings are not applicable to them, they are mainly for overseas-based projects, prompting questions about why local governments aren\u2019t spending that money trying to reduce their own emissions. Brisbane city council, Australia\u2019s largest local government, spent $6 million last year offsetting its emissions, including banking 130,000 tonnes of carbon emissions on a landfill gas recovery and power generation project in China. University of Melbourne climate futures senior research fellow Lily O\u2019Neill described it as \u201ca joke\u201d that an organisation whose core function is to dispose of waste would spend money reducing emissions on that same activity offshore. O\u2019Neill said that offsetting was only valid as a last resort for emissions that could not be avoided. \u201cDoes anybody [at council] go out and check that these carbon credits are being generated in the way that they say they will be?\u201d she said. Brisbane city council did not respond to Guardian Australia questions about what due diligence it does on overseas offsets projects. The Labor opposition in Brisbane, led by Jared Cassidy, has long been critical of council\u2019s offset spending and described the Guardian investigation as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d. \u201cThe only large-scale action a council can take to reduce emissions on a citywide scale is remove organic material from landfill,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t simply buy your way out of it. \u201cIf you want to make real change you start in your own back yard.\u201d O\u2019Neill said there were high-value offset projects that were working, including First Nations-led emissions reductions projects. Brisbane was among the councils that did fund some Australian-based initiatives, including Indigenous-led savannah fire management in Arnhem Land. But more than 90% of Brisbane city council\u2019s offset funding was spent on projects abroad. Many other councils \u2013 including Woollahra in Sydney, Subiaco in Perth and Moreland, Moonee Valley, Maroondah and Yarra in Melbourne \u2013 obtained 100% of their credits from overseas-based renewable energy projects. Queensland University of Technology\u2019s pro vice-chancellor of sustainability and research integrity, Kerrie Wilson, also advised that local governments should be \u201clooking at things in their own back yard\u201d as they strive to achieve carbon neutrality. \u201cThat\u2019s challenging, because it requires a focus on our internal policies and our own practices and our own behaviours rather than relying on offsetting,\u201d she said. Wilson said QUT had invested in a solar farm in western Queensland in an effort to achieve carbon neutrality. \u201cYou have more oversight, transparency and assurance around the integrity if they are projects that you can touch and feel and identify,\u201d she said. Brisbane city council did not respond to questions about whether it was reviewing its offset program but did say it was currently undertaking \u201ca major food waste recycling pilot involving 6,000 households across 30 suburbs\u201d. A City of Sydney spokesperson said that over the past few years it had been \u201cbuying an increasing share of high-quality local carbon offsets\u201d and aimed to have 100% high-quality Australian regenerative offsets by 2025. The City of Melbourne is understood to be reviewing its past and future offsets following the Chubb review, which this month recommended a new integrity body be set up for Australia\u2019s carbon credits scheme."

            "title": "NSW forests could become net carbon emitters in coming decades, report finds ",
            "date": "2023-01-04T14:00:03Z",
            "content": "Forests in New South Wales could become net carbon emitters in coming decades, undermining state government efforts to reach net zero emissions, according to a report by one of its own agencies. The Natural Resources Commission has warned the Perrottet government the benefits the state\u2019s forests provide are degrading and will continue to degrade without \u201cmajor intervention\u201d. The report, published in December, urges the government to avoid \u201cbusiness-as-usual management approaches and reactive policy decision making\u201d, saying this would lead to \u201csub-optimal outcomes at best, or ecosystem and industry collapse under worst case scenarios\u201d. The management of forests on public and private land is expected to be an issue in the March state election. Some independent candidates running in key Sydney seats are calling for an end to logging of native forests. There have also been broader calls from the Greens and environment groups to address the state\u2019s high rate of land-clearing. The NRC report comes after the release of annual accounts for NSW Forestry Corporation, which showed its hardwood or native timbers division ran at a $9m loss in 2021-22, largely due to flooding on the north coast and costs associated with bushfire recovery. The report says the state\u2019s forests are under increased strain from combined pressures of invasive species, population and economic growth and the intensification of urban and agricultural land use. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup It states that streamflow in NSW forests, particularly on the south coast, had been declining for 30 years and ongoing reductions would have \u201cmajor implications for future water security in NSW\u201d. It also warns the unprecedented fires of 2019-20 \u201cwill not remain an outlier\u201d. As global heating drives more frequent fires and droughts there was a risk, it says, that these disturbances could trigger \u201congoing cycles of decline in key areas such as forest regeneration and soil organic carbon\u201d by reducing the capacity for full recovery after these events. \u201cIn this case, forests will become a net carbon emitter in the coming decades, undermining key government commitments to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050,\u201d the report states. The NRC elaborates on this, saying it was commonly assumed carbon lost to fire would be reabsorbed by forests as they recovered and regenerated in the 10 to 15 years post-fire. But the extent to which forests were able to recapture lost carbon would depend on their ability to fully recover and the absence of further disturbances in the recovery period, the report said. For soil organic carbon, recovery after fires was estimated to be about 60% after 20 years but this estimate did not account for additional bushfires during this time, the NRC said. The commission said there was a risk of a cycle of declining soil organic carbon if there were repeated fires \u201cor other disturbances such as grazing, timber harvesting or land clearing\u201d. The report calls for a \u201cmajor intervention\u201d and recommends the government develop an overarching forests 2050 strategy to \u201csystematically address\u201d the climate crisis and other stressors. Andrew Macintosh, an environmental law and policy professor at the Australian National University and former head of the federal government\u2019s Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee, said more frequent fires and dry cycles caused carbon stocks in forests to fall. He said the most important thing for governments was to introduce stronger land-clearing regulations, incentives for landowners to protect forest on private land and to reduce logging. \u201cIf the government wanted to improve the condition of forests, the best thing you could do is stop remnant clearing and large-scale commercial harvesting of native forests,\u201d he said. Justin Field, an outgoing independent MLC, pushed the government in the last term of parliament to provide greater clarity about the impacts of land-clearing and land use on the state\u2019s emissions. \u201cThe report highlights the importance of turning around the massive increase in land clearing under the Coalition government in the last five years,\u201d he said. The NSW Greens environment spokesperson, Sue Higginson, said the report was \u201cmore evidence that it is time to stop the industrial-scale logging of our public native forest estate and manage them for their habitat and carbon storage functions\u201d. Shortly before Christmas the NSW government announced a new 2035 emissions reduction target of 70% as it tries to head off the threat of independent candidates running in Liberal party heartland seats at the state election. Jacqui Scruby, an independent running for the seat of Pittwater, said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense to be setting emissions reduction targets and then subsidising native forest logging\u201d. The agriculture minister, Dugald Saunders, said there were clear rules in place for the sustainable harvest of timber in NSW. He said half of the 2m hectares managed by the NSW Forestry Corporation was conservation land and just 1% of the total area was harvested each year. The NRC was unavailable for comment."

            "date": "2023-01-19T14:01:10Z",
            "content": "New South Wales\u2019s environmental watchdog has released what it calls Australia\u2019s \u201cmost comprehensive plan\u201d to regulate carbon emissions, requiring firms to show how they will hit net zero by 2050 and nudging them to improve resilience in a warming world. The Climate Change Policy and Action Plan 2023-26, released on Friday by the Environment Protection Authority, will identify what progress is already under way by companies now covered by pollution licences and encourage them to improve. Licensees will be given a mandatory survey to show how they are contributing to the NSW government\u2019s climate change objectives, including cutting 2005-level emissions by 70% by 2035. Firms will have to prepare and develop their own climate change mitigation and adaptation plans (CCMAPs), and report their progress over time, including on company websites. Advisory groups will develop targets for each industry sector. Tony Chappel, the EPA\u2019s CEO, said this plan \u201cmeans for the first time in Australia, there will be a comprehensive approach around emissions reduction pathways\u201d. Sectoral targets would not initially be binding \u201cbecause there is a huge variety of what is and is not cost-effective abatement\u201d, Chappel said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have a simple one size fits all approach.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup NSW\u2019s approach was triggered by a case brought before the state\u2019s land and environment court in 2021 by the Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action (BSCA). They argued the EPA had a duty under the Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991 to develop objectives, guidelines and policies to ensure environmental protection from climate change. They won the case and Matt Kean, then the environment minister and now treasurer, opted not to appeal. The survivors group and the NSW Environmental Defenders Office both welcomed the action plan as \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d but also as a first step with more to do. \u201cAs a result of that case, the NSW EPA is now an environmental regulator with teeth,\u201d said Fiona Lee of the BSCA, who lost her home in the black summer bushfires of 2019-20. \u201cWe will work constructively with the EPA to see the plan strengthened at the next annual review,\u201d Lee said. \u201cFor example, the rollout of legally enforceable emissions reduction targets should occur faster than is required under the current plan.\u201d The EDO\u2019s Elaine Johnson called on other states to follow NSW. \u201cIt is absolutely the responsibility and duty of all EPAs to ensure protection from climate change for all Australians,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat means dramatically cutting emissions and ensuring a rapid and just transition away from fossil fuels.\u201d Chappel said several states, including Victoria, had been in discussions about the NSW plan. It was also designed to complement the Albanese government\u2019s revised safeguard mechanism which aims to lower emissions from the 215 largest pollution industrial facilities in the country. NSW\u2019s emissions in 2018-19 totalled 136.6m tonnes of CO2-equivalent, 17% lower than in 2005. For now the plan will not extend beyond licence holders in the state but the EPA will consider extending it to other polluters if there are signs that actions set an uneven playing field or incentivise less sustainable practices, Chappel said. There is no intention to apply the action to sectors the EPA does not currently regulate, such as local bakeries, he said. Chappel said the shift to net zero offers new business opportunities \u201cright across the board\u201d, from regenerative agriculture and hydrogen, to renewable energy and metals made without fossil fuels. The EPA will also be asking licensees to consider how they might increase the resilience of their operations to extreme weather, such as flooding and intense rainfall. The working groups set up for each sector will also be aiming to identify best practice approaches that can inform actions by others, Chappel said."

            "title": "Greenwashing or a net zero necessity? Climate scientists on carbon offsetting",
            "date": "2023-01-18T14:00:46Z",
            "content": "To offset or not to offset? We asked three prominent climate scientists what they think of the murky world of offsetting. Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and chief scientist at Conservation International, which manages a number of carbon offsetting projects, says that offsetting can be valuable but only if companies are already cutting their carbon emissions by at least half each decade, from now to reaching net zero in 2050. They can buy offsets as an additional effort, beyond those reductions, but the offsets cannot be used as a substitute for those stringent emission-reduction requirements. Rockstr\u00f6m told the Guardian: \u201cOn the one hand, carbon offsetting is necessary, and has positive potentials of providing incentives and thereby generating much-needed investments, for example in nature climate solutions [such as forests]. On the other hand, there is a large risk of misuse of offsetting, if used (as often is the case) to compensate for the inability to follow the scientifically defined mitigation pathway.\u201d He argues that a sound pathway requires cutting emissions by half each decade. This is now the requirement of the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), which certifies whether companies are in line with the Paris agreement. While companies should not use carbon offsets as a substitute for making real emissions reductions, they should still be encouraged to buy offsets, he argues. That is because the world is doing badly at keeping its existing forests standing, even though these are vital if we are to stay within 1.5C of global heating. Only by ensuring that forests remain intact, by protecting the oceans so they can still act as a carbon sink, and by growing new forests and changing our agricultural practices so that soils store carbon instead of releasing it, can we hope to stay within a 1.5C limit. Offsets, correctly managed, can help to achieve these goals, and therefore can be a wise investment for the good of the planet. \u201cCarbon offsetting is important but can only be an additionality \u2013 we need to get off fossil fuels, and do carbon offsets,\u201d he said. Simon Lewis, professor of global change science at UCL, says carbon offsetting can bring benefits, particularly in funding forest protection, but with strong caveats. \u201cWe are clearly not doing a good job of getting cash to our forests,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to think about that, particularly forests in the tropics \u2013 we should be funding these global assets. Ideally that should be separate from the carbon markets \u2013 through a levy on fossil fuels, or on international financial transactions, for example. But there are ways of funding forests through offsets. There should be a debate about all this.\u201d He said generating high quality credits was possible. \u201cWe want there to be more good credits that are really beneficial, and less scam credits. The problem with the carbon markets is that they\u2019re a wild west, they\u2019re unregulated.\u201d He said: \u201cI think the carbon markets have a place, as we do not have other mechanisms, but they really have to be highly regulated, otherwise people are buying hot air, and things they don\u2019t know the true value of. I think scientists are quite sceptical of the carbon markets.\u201d People should also look behind the carbon markets to the reasons why forests are under threat. \u201cOne of the biggest drivers [of forest destruction] is agriculture. So people should be eating less meat, as that would free up space for nature.\u201d Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the University of Manchester, says that offsets are actively dangerous. \u201cMy take on offsets, even supposedly good ones, is that from a climate perspective they are worse than doing nothing.\u201d This is partly owing to the \u201crebound\u201d effect, he says. Essentially, if people think their carbon-emitting activities are covered by offsetting, they have no incentive to really reduce their emissions, and this encourages the continuation and even expansion of high-carbon activities. Think of flying \u2013 if you believe that your flights are carbon-neutral, you will continue to take more of them. Another issue is the time lag between the emissions and the impact of the offset. Each flight you take is pouring carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, where it will continue to heat the planet, even though the trees you consider to be offsetting your journey are taking up to a century to grow. For Anderson, there are also equity issues \u2013 offsets are often used to cover for high-carbon activities in richer nations, without really benefiting the poor countries they are often bought from. Anderson says: \u201cThe timeframe for cutting CO2 associated with \u201cpursuing \u2026 1.5C\u201d and \u201cwell below 2C\u201d [the requirements of the Paris agreement] is now so tight that there is no emissions space for companies to use offsetting as a means of further locking in high-carbon activities, technologies, norms and practices, even under the heroic assumption that offsetting actually works. Put simply, we need to pull every mitigation level to its max level; there is no longer any give or flexibility in the system.\u201d He adds: \u201cTrees, and temporary CO2 sequestration, are not an offset for an essentially permanent transfer of carbon from the lithosphere into the atmosphere.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-31T13:37:11Z",
            "content": "The value of Darktrace has plummeted to a record low after the emergence of two new short sellers betting against its business, as the British cybersecurity firm was hit by a new wave of criticism of its sales, marketing and accounting practices. The company, which earlier this month warned of slowing numbers of new customers signing up for its artificial intelligence-led security products, has attracted the attention of Quintessential Capital Management (QCM) and the London-based Marshall Wace, one of the world\u2019s biggest hedge funds with $60bn (\u00a349bn) in client assets. Darktrace has been dogged by criticism and struggled to emerge from the spectre of its controversial co-founder Mike Lynch, the British billionaire fighting extradition to the US over fraud charges relating to the $11bn sale of his software company Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard in 2011. Lynch denies all charges against him. The US hedge fund QCM has backed up its short position, publishing on Tuesday a 69-page document criticising the management and operations of Darktrace. The firm alleges that questionable and aggressive marketing, sales and accounting practices were employed by Darktrace to drive up the value of the company before its multibillion-pound flotation in London almost two years ago. \u201cAfter a careful analysis, we are deeply sceptical about the validity of Darktrace\u2019s financial statements and fear that sales, margins and growth rates may be overstated and close to a sharp correction,\u201d QCM said. \u201cWe would like to give our strongest possible warning to investors and believe that Darktrace\u2019s equity [is] overvalued and liable to a major correction, or worse.\u201d Shares in Darktrace fell more than 7% to a record low of 198p on Tuesday after the positions of the short sellers were made public on Monday, well below the 250p at its initial public offering in April 2021, and a far cry from the heady heights of almost \u00a310 it reached in the months after listing in London. QCM alleges that questionable practices to ensure vital revenue growth rates, such as so-called \u201cchannel stuffing\u201d, were employed to maintain a glowing image of soaring client sales to investors. Issues noted also include a significant increase in revenue from multi-year contracts being booked in the first year of a deal, which inflates revenue, growth and ultimately profits in the short term. While this is not an uncommon practice in many industries, and certainly not illegal, QCM alleges that the amount of revenue being deferred as a percentage of sales has dramatically decreased between 2018 and 2022. As other sceptics have noted, QCM observes that Darktrace has an extremely high level of spend on marketing expenses compared with its budget on the research and development of its products. The New York-based company believes the marketing heavy sales approach employed by Darktrace, which has been previously likened by some clients interviewed by an analyst at Peel Hunt to \u201csnake oil\u201d, could result in clients failing to renew after their initial three-year contracts. \u201cWe suspect that a large portion of legitimate sales have been obtained through an extremely aggressive sales force,\u201d it said. \u201cSales momentum might be about to drop as the surge in contracts signed before Darktrace\u2019s IPO expire without being renewed by disappointed customers.\u201d Earlier this month, Darktrace reported that it had signed up a quarter fewer new customers in the final three months of 2022 than the previous year. The company has downgraded full-year guidance for growth in annual recurring revenue, regular spending by existing clients and total revenue. Despite questions over the underlying viability of Darktrace\u2019s business model, the slowdown is being mirrored at many of the biggest players in cybersecurity as macroeconomic conditions worsen. Shares in US-based market leader CrowdStrike and its rival Sentinel One are down 43% and 67% over the past 12 months respectively. The company said it was focusing on bringing in bigger clients and upselling existing ones, resulting in new customer accounts worth on average 17% more in revenue than those signed up in 2021 and contract renewals up by 12%. Darktrace is led by Poppy Gustafsson, who co-founded it in 2013 aged 30, one of the dozens of former Autonomy employees at the firm. \u201cWe would like to provide our strongest possible warning to Darktrace investors and invite them to read our report carefully,\u201d said Gabriel Grego, a founder of QCM, which has taken a 0.86% position in Darktrace. Marshall Wace, which has taken a 0.9% position in Darktrace and is also shorting stocks including Burberry, The Hut Group and the owner of British Airlines, declined to comment. A spokesperson for Darktrace said: \u201cAs a UK listed business, our management team and board take our fiduciary responsibilities very seriously and have full confidence in our accounting practices and the integrity of our independently audited financial statements. \u201cWe have rigorous controls in place across our business to ensure we comply fully with IFRS accounting standards. We\u2019re proud of the business we have built, which today helps to protect over 8,100 customers around the world from cyber disruption.\u201d David Reynolds, an analyst at research firm Davy UK, said that in the trust-based world of cybersecurity the report tarnished Darktrace\u2019s reputation. \u201c[The report] pulls no punches,\u201d said Reynolds, in a note to clients on Tuesday. \u201cDarktrace operates in the cybersecurity arena and trust is everything. QCM\u2019s report undermines that trust.\u201d Shares in Darktrace closed at 210p, down more than 4%, on Tuesday."

            "date": "2023-01-19T00:01:11Z",
            "content": "Ukraine has suffered a threefold growth in cyber-attacks over the past year, with Russian hacking at times deployed in combination with missile strikes, according to a senior figure in the country\u2019s cybersecurity agency. The attacks from Russia have often taken the form of destructive, disk-erasing wiper malware, said Viktor Zhora, a leading figure in the country\u2019s SSSCIP agency, with \u201cin some cases, cyber-attacks supportive to kinetic effects\u201d. Zhora\u2019s comments came as he visited London\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a part of GCHQ, where he and Ukrainian colleagues were due to discuss how to work together to tackle the Russian threat. Welcoming them, Tom Tugendhat, the UK security minister, said the fight \u201cagainst Russian barbarism goes beyond the battlefield\u201d and terror inflicted on civilians. \u201cThere is the real and persistent threat of a Russian cyber-attack on Ukraine\u2019s critical infrastructure,\u201d he added. A day earlier, SSSCIP released an analysis of Russia\u2019s cyberstrategy during the war so far, which concluded that cyber-attacks on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure last autumn were linked to its sustained bombing campaign. Russia launched \u201cpowerful cyber-attacks to cause a maximum blackout\u201d on 24 November, the report said, in tandem with waves of missile strikes on Ukraine\u2019s energy facilities that at the time had forced all the country\u2019s nuclear plants offline. Enemy hackers carried out 10 attacks a day against \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d during November, according to Ukraine\u2019s SBU domestic spy agency, part of the wider effort to leave millions without power amid plunging temperatures. Cyber-attacks were also coordinated with Russian \u201cinformation-psychological and propaganda operations\u201d, SSSCIP said, aimed at trying to \u201cshift responsibility for the consequences [of power outages] to Ukrainian state authorities, local governments or large Ukrainian businesses\u201d. Russian hackers range from highly professional military groups, part of the Kremlin\u2019s security complex, through criminal gangs, often seeking to make money, to so called pro-Kremlin \u201chacktivists\u201d. Ukraine appears to have had some success in tackling and containing Russian and pro-Russian hacking since before the start of the war, although Kyiv has been helped by substantial support from the west. The UK has provided a \u00a36.35m package of support, helping with incident response and information sharing, plus hardware and software. British officials hosting the Ukrainians added there had been no increase in Russian cyber-activity aimed at the west, although some attacks have targeted \u201cRussia\u2019s near abroad\u201d, most notably Poland, which has reported an increase in attacks on government and strategic targets from the autumn. In late October, Poland\u2019s senate was hit by a cyber-attack, a day after the country\u2019s upper house had unanimously adopted a resolution describing the Russian government as a terrorist regime. Poland later blamed the pro-Russian group NoName057(16) for a denial of service attack aimed at shutting down its website. Warsaw has also accused the pro-Russian Ghostwriter group, which its experts believe operates from Belarus and has links to the Kremlin\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency, of being engaged in a disinformation campaign aimed at trying to hack mail addresses and social media accounts of public figures in the country. Britain continues to believe there remains a significant threat to British organisations from the Russian cyberactivity, but it has not obviously stepped up since the start of the war. Nor has there been any sign of Russian wiper malware being targeted against UK organisations. However, UK experts warn there has been \u201cpre-positioning\u201d in case a denial of service or other cyber-attacks are ordered. British organisations are urged to continue to review their digital security during what the NCSC considers to be an \u201cextended period of heightened threat\u201d."

            "content": "The market value of Darktrace has fallen to the lowest level since floating almost two years ago after the British cybersecurity company warned about slowing numbers of customers signing up for products. The warning prompted a drop in the share price of the company, based in Cambridge, which positions itself as a potential European superpower in the US-dominated cybersecurity space but had its business model criticised last year. Shares in Darktrace, whose co-founder Mike Lynch continues to fight extradition to the US on fraud charges, fell by as much as 18% on Wednesday, below the 250p level at which it debuted on the London Stock Exchange in April 2021, making it one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE. The company, whose market capitalisation of \u00a31.8bn is far from the heady highs of almost \u00a37bn months after flotation, said it had underestimated the impact of economic uncertainty on its business. Cathy Graham, the chief financial officer, said: \u201cThe current macroeconomic environment is creating challenges to winning new customers, with prospects reluctant to run product trials and, in regions with historically higher conversion rates, those rates are starting to decline. Against this backdrop of weaker trends and continuing uncertainty, we are being prudent and revising our full-year guidance.\u201d Darktrace is led by Poppy Gustafsson, a former Autonomy executive who co-founded it in 2013 aged 30. Analysts at the bank Berenberg pointed out that while the 421 new customers added in the three months to the end of December represented a 31% quarter-on-quarter increase, the number was almost one-quarter lower than the 556 new sign-ups in the same period in 2021. Darktrace, whose financial year ends on 30 June, said: \u201cLate in the second quarter, it became clear that the impact on new customer growth had been larger than expected.\u201d The company said it was focusing on bringing in bigger clients and upselling existing ones, resulting in new customer accounts worth on average 17% more in revenue than those signed up in 2021 and contract renewals up by 12%. However, the downturn in business has led Darktrace to downgrade full-year guidance for growth in annual recurring revenue, regular spending by existing clients and total revenue. Analysts at the bank Jefferies and Berenberg said the cybersecurity sector is experiencing similar growth issues, with the value of stocks down by 45% last year. Graham said: \u201cDespite expecting growth to remain slower for the rest of the financial year, we expect to emerge from this uncertain period in an even stronger position. [We will] capitalise on our very large market opportunity and demonstrate to customers and investors that a period of economic adversity has not hindered what we believe is our unique and sustainable value proposition.\u201d"

JD Sports said it had taken the \u201cnecessary immediate steps\u201d to investigate and respond to the incident, including working with cybersecurity experts, and to be aware of potential fraud and phishing attacks and \u201cbe on the lookout for any suspicious or unusual communications purporting to be from JD Sports or any of our group brands\u201d. \u201cWe are continuing with a full review of our cybersecurity in partnership with external specialists following this incident,\u201d said Greenhalgh. \u201cProtecting the data of our customers is an absolute priority for JD.\u201d This month Royal Mail revealed it had been hit by a ransomware attack by a criminal group, which threatened to publish the stolen information online, and said it could not process international parcel and letter deliveries."

            "title": "What is LockBit ransomware and how does it operate?",
            "date": "2023-01-13T15:13:26Z",
            "content": "LockBit has emerged as the most prolific name in ransomware attacks and has now been blamed for an incident that has hit Royal Mail\u2019s international operations. Here is what we know about LockBit and how it operates. What is ransomware? Ransomware is a piece of malicious software, or malware, that is often inserted into an entity\u2019s computer network via a so-called \u201cphishing attempt\u201d. This involves tricking the receiver into downloading the malware, commonly by clicking on a link or attachment contained in an email. The phishing attempt can also include trying to access the person\u2019s user name and password to get into the network, by fooling them into thinking they are logging on to the network in question. The malware then encrypts infected computers, making it impossible to access their content. The rogue actor behind the attack then demands money from the affected entity \u2013 typically a company or government organisation \u2013 for those computers to be unlocked or decrypted. According to the US Treasury, US banks and financial institutions alone processed approximately $1.2bn (\u00a3990m) in ransomware payments in 2021. How does LockBit work? LockBit is the name given to a specific piece of malware, with the criminal organisation behind it also carrying that name. The LockBit group also sells this malware to other operators for financial gain, in a model known as ransomware as a service (Raas). On underground forums the malware has been advertised as \u201cthe fastest encryption software all over the world\u201d. \u201cWe have seen a real trend in ransomware gangs operating an \u2018affiliate model\u2019 where they sell access to this malware on the dark web in exchange for payment, often in cryptocurrency,\u201d says Toby Lewis, the global head of threat analysis at Darktrace, a UK cybersecurity firm. \u201cThis helps LockBit to scale its operations like a franchise.\u201d Lewis says LockBit operators do not just encrypt the files but also commit \u201cdouble extortion\u201d where they steal the data and threaten to release it online. Some of the features of the malware include being able to print ransom demands on affected network printers, a detail that has been reported in the Royal Mail hack, with the Daily Telegraph reporting that a ransomware note stated: \u201cLockbit Black Ransomware. Your data is stolen and encrypted.\u201d LockBit, like most ransomware groups, demands to be paid in cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has been the preferred payment method historically but according to Sophos, a British cybersecurity company, LockBit is demanding payment in other digital assets. \u201cMany like LockBit have moved over to the cryptocurrency monero instead, due to the increased anonymity it provides,\u201d says Peter Mackenzie, who leads the incident response team at Sophos. He adds: \u201cLockBit ransom demands can range from the hundreds of thousands into the tens of millions, typically based on the amount damage believed to have been caused, type of data stolen and how much they believe the victim can afford.\u201d Who is behind LockBit? Most ransomware groups tend to operate from eastern Europe, former Soviet Republics and Russia itself. \u201cLockBit falls into the same category,\u201d says Lewis. In November the US Department of Justice charged a dual Russian and Canadian national, Mikhail Vasiliev, over alleged participation in LockBit\u2019s ransomware campaign. The DoJ said LockBit had been deployed against at least 1,000 victims in the US and around the world, has made at least $100m in ransom demands and has \u201cextracted tens of millions of dollars in actual ransom payments\u201d. Victims of LockBit attacks include Pendragon, a UK car dealership company, which has refused to pay a $60m ransomware demand. According to Trustwave, a US cybersecurity firm, the LockBit group \u201cdominates the ransomware space\u201d and uses large payments to recruit experienced actors. It accounted for 44% of ransomware attacks in January-September last year, according to Deep Instinct, an Israeli cybersecurity firm. The malware was previously known as \u201c.abcd\u201d, after the file extension that was added to encrypted files as they were made inaccessible. Ransomware, and the groups behind it, often undergoes name changes in order to avoid law enforcement or a company-style rebranding exercise after becoming excessively notorious. \u201cRebranding is often a common occurrence. This may be to avoid law enforcement or it is simply to do with marketing,\u201d says Lewis. Can ransomware attacks be disabled? This is difficult. Once the attack has got in, it is really hard to stop. \u201cYour best chance is to stop the attack in the first place,\u201d says Lewis. Cleanups often involve rebuilding systems and networks. \u201cIf you have got ransomware on your network it\u2019s really hard to get reassurance any other way than to rebuild the systems from scratch.\u201d Is it illegal to pay ransomware demands? Last year the UK data watchdog, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, and the National Cyber Security Centre wrote to legal professionals in England and Wales stressing that law enforcement did \u201cnot encourage\u201d the payment of ransoms although payments were not usually unlawful. For instance, it is illegal to pay ransoms if the affected entity knows, or has reason to suspect, the proceeds will be used to fund terrorism. The ICO and NCSC letter said: \u201cPayment incentivises further harmful behaviour by malicious actors and does not guarantee decryption of networks or return of stolen data.\u201d In the US, payment of ransoms is discouraged by the government, but an advisory note from the US Treasury in 2020 emphasised this was \u201cexplanatory only\u201d and did \u201cnot have the force of law\u201d."

            "content": "Before I go, another quick comment on the US GDP numbers. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, notes that GDP growth outperformed thanks to inventory building and falling imports. He explains: Both the fourth quarter US GDP report and the December durable goods numbers are strong at the headline level, but look a little closer and evidence of a deteriorating growth story is plain to see Looking to first quarter GDP data, the momentum in the numbers isn\u2019t looking great. We\u2019ve had six consecutive MoM falls in residential construction, three consecutive drops in industrial production, the big falls in retail sales in November and December already mentioned and now we find both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing ISM indices are in contraction territory. We need to see a turn quickly in something to prevent first quarter GDP turning negative. But the Conference Board\u2019s measure of CEO confidence is now at the lowest level since the Global Financial Crisis, which suggests that the risk is corporate America will turn increasingly defensive, implying a greater focus on costs rather than motivation to expand businesses. The former chief economist of the Bank of England has warned there is \u201cmore pain to come\u201d for households and the wider economy as mortgage rate increases hit people\u2019s bank accounts and weigh on spending. Andy Haldane, who is now chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts, said it was painful to see the effects of rising interest rates since he left the Bank of England and its rate-setting monetary policy committee in June 2021. The UK\u2019s political instability \u2013 a \u201cministerial merry-go-round\u201d in Haldane\u2019s terms \u2013 has meant that government policy has not been followed through, and there is still a lack of a \u201cmedium-term plan for growth in this country\u201d, he added. More than 300 jobs at Asda are at risk and 4,300 staff will receive a pay cut after the supermarket announced a swathe of changes to night shifts, Post Office outlets and pharmacies to cut costs. The supermarket chain said 211 night shift manager roles were going and a further 4,137 staff would lose out on premiums of at least \u00a32.52 an hour for working nights as it switched the restocking of packaged groceries and frozen food to daytimes and evenings. In addition, Asda planned to close seven of its 254 in-store pharmacies, putting 62 jobs at risk, including 14 pharmacists. The US economy grew faster than expected at the end of last year, suggesting a soft landing despite the interest rate hikes, according to some economists \u2013 although others say the underlying growth is weaker and still forecast a \u201cmild recession\u201d in the first half of this year. GDP rose at an annualised rate of 2.9% between October and December, faster than the 2.6% forecast by economists, a slight slowdown from 3.2% growth in the third quarter. European stock markets are pushing higher as upbeat quarterly results from TSB owner Sabadell, STMicroelectronics and Nokia helped ease recession worries. Wall Street is also up after the GDP data, with weekly jobless claims and durable goods orders for December also better than expected. Our other main stories today: Many thanks for reading. Back tomorrow morning, bright and early. Bye!! \u2013 JK Morrisons has revealed its sales and profits fell last year as shoppers became \u201cincreasingly pessimistic\u201d amid the rising cost of living and political uncertainty. The retailer, which lost its spot at the UK\u2019s fourth largest supermarket to Aldi last year, said underlying profits fell 15% to \u00a3828m in the year to 30 October as sales at established stores slid 4.2%. After one-off costs and interest payments the company made a \u00a333m loss, narrowing from a \u00a3121m in the previous 39 weeks, the only figure available. David Potts, the chief executive of Morrisons, said the amount of goods sold by the supermarket had slid back as prices had risen and \u201cacross the UK consumers were becoming increasingly pessimistic as they battled with things through the covid pandemic, political uncertainty, cost of living price rises and interest rates.\u201d \u201cIt has clearly been a tough time when consumers have been making hard choices,\u201d he said. While Morrisons\u2019 sales figures are disappointing in comparison to its bigger rivals Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Aldi, Potts said that a \u00a37bn debt-fuelled takeover by US private equity firm Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice in 2021 had not hindered the retailer. He said last year was \u201cone of transition\u201d but added \u201cWe are combining well with CD&amp;R to be more effective.\u201d Interesting comments from the head of HMRC re tax affairs (NB the deadline for self assessment tax returns is next Tuesday). The head of HM Revenue and Customs has told MPs there are \u201cno penalties for innocent errors\u201d in relation to tax affairs, raising further questions about the circumstances that led to the Conservative party chair, Nadhim Zahawi, being fined by the tax office. HMRC\u2019s chief executive, Jim Harra, said his department did not penalise taxpayers who were deemed to have taken \u201creasonable care\u201d. \u201cThere are no penalties for innocent errors in your tax affairs,\u201d he told the public accounts committee on Thursday. \u201cIf you take reasonable care, but nevertheless make a mistake, whilst you will be liable for the tax, and for interest \u2026 you would not be liable for a penalty. \u201cBut if your error was as a result of carelessness, then legislation says that a penalty could apply in those circumstances.\u201d Hunter then turns to durable goods orders: Elsewhere, the bigger-than-expected 5.6% [month-on-month] jump in durable goods orders in December was almost entirely due to a bumper month for bookings at Boeing, with notoriously volatile non-defence aircraft orders up 115.5% m/m. Excluding transport, orders fell by 0.1% month on month (m/m). Worse, non-defence capital goods orders (ex. aircraft) fell by 0.2% m/m last month, while shipments in the same category declined by 0.4% m/m. Alongside the already-reported falls in production of business equipment, that\u2019s another signal that higher interest rates are increasingly weighing on business investment. The advance economic indicators showed that the good trade deficit widened to $90.3bn in December, from $82.9bn. Exports fell by 1.6% m/m, with imports rebounding by 1.9% m/m. After adjusting for price changes, real good exports appear to have increased by 1.0%, with real imports up 1.4%. Nevertheless, this adds to the evidence that, despite the resilience of GDP growth in the fourth quarter, the economy was losing considerable momentum going into the first quarter of this year. Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics, says the underlying pace of growth was much weaker: The 2.9% annualised rise in fourth-quarter GDP was a little stronger than we had expected, but the mix of growth was discouraging, and the monthly data suggest the economy lost momentum as the fourth quarter went on. We still expect the lagged impact of the surge in interest rates to push the economy into a mild recession in the first half of this year. Headline growth beat our 1.9% estimate mainly thanks to another positive contribution from net trade \u2013 with the surge in exports in the third quarter being only partly reversed with a 1.3% fall in the fourth, despite drags from softer global demand and the stronger dollar. The 1.5%pt boost to growth from inventory building was also stronger than we had anticipated. But the rest of the report was a disappointment, with final sales to private domestic purchasers edging up by only 0.2% annualised, after a muted 1.1% rise in the third quarter. Consumption growth slowed slightly to 2.1%, from 2.3%. Moreover, that growth reflects strong gains at the start of the quarter, with the retail sales data suggesting that real consumption fell slightly over the final two months of last year. That suggests higher rates were starting to take a bigger toll, and sets the stage for weaker growth in the first quarter of this year. The 6.7% slump in fixed investment was also worse than we had anticipated, with residential investment plunging at a 26.7% annualised pace, and business investment rising by a muted 0.7%. Despite the drop back in mortgage rates, further weakness in residential investment lies in store, and we also think the 3.7% fall in business equipment investment has further to run. Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, says the GDP figures suggest that the Federal Reserve has succeeded in engineering a soft landing for the economy, despite interest rate hikes needed to bring inflation down. Today\u2019s figures exceed expectations for growth in the fourth quarter. For almost a year, the Federal Reserve has been trying to achieve a soft landing by raising short-term interest rates just-enough to bring down inflation without causing a recession. It\u2019s clear the economy remains relatively strong in the face of the Fed\u2019s efforts, suggesting they\u2019re succeeding. However, investors may fear that today\u2019s figures are somewhat deceiving as other recent data has pointed towards a recession. Whilst Fed officials have signalled they plan to \u201chike and hold\u201d rates at high levels to ensure inflation recedes, the market seems doubtful. In fact, investors are already pricing in cuts to the federal funds rate target in the second half of 2023. This mismatch in expectations may drive volatility in the months ahead. The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 2.9% between October and December, faster than the 2.6% forecast by economists. This comes after 3.2% growth in the third quarter. Other data was also better than expected. There were 186,000 claims for unemployment benefits last week, the lowest number since April 2022, versus expectations of 205,000. A slump in retail sales this month is expected to continue in February as shops battle rising costs and squeezed household incomes, according to a leading business survey. The CBI\u2019s distributive trades survey, which covers retail and wholesale businesses, registered a sharp fall in sales in January and found respondents were concerned about a repeat next month. The number of shops reporting a rise in sales was outnumbered by those reporting a fal to leave a balance of -23 in January, from +11 in December, the CBI said. Car sellers hit by a slump in demand for both new and used cars reported an even lower balance of -34. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: The survey suggests that households have started the year in belt-tightening mode, as worries about job losses, higher mortgage rates and another jump in energy prices in April dominate their spending decisions. He said the drop in sales was disappointing, \u201cgiven the potential for a partial recovery in January after a combination of snow and strikes across both the rail and postal sectors weighed temporarily on spending in December\u201d. He added that a surplus of stock coming out of the Christmas trading period was also troubling the sector and would limit the ability of shops to make up for lost sales with higher prices. The net balance of retailers reporting that stocks were more than adequate to meet demand increased to +23 in January, from +16 in December, and now exceeds its +18 average in the 2010s. This suggests that retailers will slow the pace of price rises significantly, not just because producer prices are now barely rising, but also because they want to get rid of excess inventory. Tombs echoed many retail analysts who believe a squeeze on sales and margins will make 2023 \u201ca tough year for most retailers\u201d. Martin Sartorius, che CBI\u2019s principal economist, said the downturn in consumer spending was likely to last all year, which meant it was important for the government to address the structural problems holding back retailers. Reforming business rates and the Apprenticeship Levy would unlock much-needed investment and help the UK avoid getting stuck in a rut on growth. NatWest is to shut 23 branches across the country, adding to a raft of closures across the industry so far this month. The 21 sites in England and two in Wales will close in the first half of this year. The bank said the closures were due to more customers moving to \u201cmobile and online banking\u201d. It comes a week after Lloyds Banking Group said it would close 40 Halifax and Lloyds sites in England and Wales. Lloyds said the number of customers visiting the branches it plans to close had dropped by 60% on average over the last five years. The latest announcement from NatWest means 87 branches have been slated for closure by high street banks so far this year. A NatWest spokesperson said: As with many industries, most of our customers are shifting to mobile and online banking, because it\u2019s faster and easier for people to manage their financial lives. We understand and recognise that digital solutions aren\u2019t right for everyone or every situation, and that when we close branches we have to make sure that no one is left behind. We take our responsibility seriously to support the people who face challenges in moving online, so we are investing to provide them with support and alternatives that work for them. Changing customer habits caused by the rise of online banking has prompted banks to rethink their high street presence, with a slew of closures last year. In November, HSBC announced it would shut 114 branches in the UK, more than a quarter of its network. Royal Mail has resumed some international deliveries following a damaging cyber-attack on its business, and revealed that recent strikes by postal workers cost it \u00a3200m and pushed it into a hefty operating loss. The company said it has restarted overseas tracked and signed-for services to all destinations for customers buying online after the attack by a Russia-linked ransomware gang named Lockbit. The group\u2019s owner, International Distributions Services, said Royal Mail\u2019s operating losses rose to \u00a3295m in the first nine months of its year so far, as the company was hit hard by 18 days of strikes, including walkouts in the run-up to Christmas. Its outlook for the full year (a loss of \u00a3350m to \u00a3450m) is based on no further days of strike action in its fourth quarter and on the Communication Workers Union (CWU) accepting its \u201cbest and final\u201d pay offer, it said. Royal Mail bosses are back in talks with the union in an attempt to resolve a long and bitter dispute, but the CWU launched its third ballot for industrial action this week. In its trading update, the group reported further pressures in the embattled Royal Mail business, as revenue fell 16.7% in its third quarter to 31 December, with letters down 7.5% and parcels down 23.6%. It also said the number of voluntary redundancies needed under plans to axe 10,000 roles by August will be \u201csignificantly\u201d lower than the 5,000 o 6,000 it initially expected because of staff turnover and cuts to variable full-time staffing. \u2022 Royal Mail contacted the Guardian after publication with the following statement: \u201cFollowing the recent cyber incident, we have been temporarily unable to despatch export mail parcels to overseas destinations. We have temporarily asked customers not to submit any new export parcels into the Royal Mail network until further notice. \u201cWe have been working on new despatch processes and we have started moving export parcels that are already in the Royal Mail network. \u201cOur initial focus is on clearing export parcels that have already been processed and are waiting to be despatched. We continue to make good progress. We have recently resumed International Tracked &amp; Signed as well as International Signed services to all destinations for business account customers and customers buying postage online. \u201cWe would like to sincerely apologise to impacted customers for any disruption this incident may be causing. We understand how frustrating this situation is for our customers, and we would like to reassure them that our teams are working around the clock to fully resolve this situation.\u201d Asda has announced sweeping changes to people working nights and the closure of in-store pharmacies, which will affect more than 4,000 workers and could result in about 300 job losses. The supermarket plans to move overnight restocking shifts at 184 supermarkets to the daytime, putting 211 night shift manager roles at risk. It said the changes will also affect 4,137 night workers who are paid by the hour, as their shifts will be moved to daytime and they will lose their night shift pay premium of at least \u00a32.52 per hour. It also announced a 25% cut to the opening hours of 23 in-store Post Office shops, and will shut seven in-store pharmacies, which employ 14 pharmacists and 48 other workers. Akio Toyoda is to step down after 14 years at the helm of Toyota as the world\u2019s largest carmaker battles to keep its leading position amid a global shift to electric vehicles. Toyoda, 66, is the grandson of the Japanese company\u2019s founder and has led it as president (similar to CEO) since 2009. He becomes chairman on 1 April, and will be replaced on that date by Koji Sato, 53, Toyota\u2019s chief branding officer and head of the Lexus luxury car division, who has been with Toyota for 30 years. The carmaker has been slow to move to electric vehicles. Toyoda said Sato\u2019s mission would be to transform Toyota into a \u201cmobility company\u201d without giving further details. Sato said Toyoda had offered him the CEO job at the end of last year when both were in Thailand for an event to celebrate Toyota\u2019s 60th anniversary of operations there. \u201cCan you be the CEO?\u201d Sato said Toyoda asked him. Drinks giant Diageo, which makes Johnnie Walker whisky, Smirnoff vodka and Guinness, is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 this morning, down 5.8%, despite better-than-expected results. Since the pandemic, drinks makers like Diageo have benefited from people buying more expensive alcohol to drink at home. Diageo\u2019s sales rose 9.4% to \u00a39.4bn in the second half of 2022 thanks to a tequila boom and price rises, but slowing sales growth in North America spooked investors. Don Julio sales jumped 20% in the US and Casamigos was up 27%. However, overall organic sales growth in the US was just 3% in the six months, about half of what analysts had been expecting. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould has looked at the moves in UK markets: The FTSE 100 continued to edge higher this morning ahead of US GDP figures out later on. Asian markets were continuing to make ground as they returned after the Lunar New Year break as optimism over China\u2019s reopening continues to build despite surging Covid cases. Booze is supposed to be pretty recession resistant but Diageo sparked some concern from investors, despite an otherwise solid set of first-half results, by reporting slowing growth in its key North American market. Wizz Air was punished for adopting a more cautious tone than its competitors on the outlook for the holidays market, helping to bring some sobriety to a share price which had doubled in just three months. European shares are trading higher, boosted by optimism following upbeat quarterly results from companies such as the chipmaker STMicroelectronics, Spanish bank Sabadell, which owns TSB, the Finnish telecoms group Nokia. This eased worries that the eurozone could slide into recession, along with China\u2019s reopening of its economy. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 14 points, or 0.2%, at 7,760 Germany\u2019s Dax up 31 points, or 0.2%, at 15,112 France\u2019s CAC up 53 points, or 0.8%, at 7,097 Italy\u2019s FTSE Mib up 200 points, or 0.8%, at 26,077 Executives at TSB have declared a successful turnaround of the business, after reporting record profits that allowed the UK bank to pay a dividend to its Spanish owners for the first time since the takeover in 2015. The high street lender, which suffered a catastrophic IT meltdown in 2018, reported a 16.5% rise in annual profits to \u00a3182.5m for 2022, thanks in part to rising interest rates which resulted in higher returns from loans and mortgages. It comes despite the FCA hitting TSB with much-delayed \u00a348m fine over a botched IT migration that left millions of banking customers locked out of their accounts for weeks in 2018. TSB said it would pay Sabadell, which bought TSB from Lloyds for \u00a31.7bn in 2015, a \u00a350m dividend as a result of its strong performance, helping quash ongoing speculation over a potential sale of the business. Chief executive Robin Bulloch told journalists today: Sabadell have been crystal clear they have no plans to sell TSB and in fact I think they are looking at the results we\u2019re delivering with great pride\u2026but they\u2019ve been unequivocal around this position which is that they see TSB as an integral part of Sabadell. Executives also confirmed that bonuses had also risen, with most staff receiving payouts worth 11.8% of their salaries, compared to 10.2% last year. However, the CEO warned that while they were yet to see signs of significant financial distress from its customers, the bank was steeling itself for further economy turmoil, which could result in a 10% fall in house prices this year compared to 2022. *Correction: The bonus payouts for TSB staff were not 6.5% vs 4% last year, as previously stated. Those figures were in regard to pay increases for most staff. The correct bonus figures have been included above. The chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer has become the latest business leader to criticise the government\u2019s economic policy, as he described its plans for post-Brexit trade as \u201cbaffling\u201d and \u201coverbearing\u201d. Archie Norman, a former Tory MP, said the plans for solving the Northern Irish Protocol stand-off would push prices higher and give EU companies a competitive advantage over their UK counterparts. His comments on planned labelling changes for retailers came in a letter to the foreign secretary, excerpts of which have been seen by the Daily Telegraph. Last week, the billionaire businessman Sir James Dyson accused the government of a \u201cshort-sighted\u201d and \u201cstupid\u201d economic approach while the director general of the confederation of British Industry questioned the lack of a \u201cstrategy\u201d. Norman said: The overbearing costs of a labelling regime would raise prices and reduce choice for consumers, further disadvantage UK farmers and suppliers and impact UK retailers competitiveness in other international markets. The simple fact is retailers already operate in real-time digital information \u2013 day or night, at the click of a button, we can locate our products be that in a depot, in transit or in a store. In a digital era, when one tap of a mobile can check-in a customer at store and locate their order in under 60 seconds, it\u2019s baffling that the government and EU have rewound four decades to discuss an expensive \u2018solution\u2019 involving stickers and labelling. Using different product labelling could in theory ease the need for customs checks at the border but the M&amp;S chairman argues in his letter that it would lead to increased costs for producers and in turn higher prices for customers. A costly labelling solution will mean customers will be hit by reduced ranges, higher prices \u2013 at a time of huge inflation and when the economy in Northern Ireland is already disadvantaged \u2013 and a worsening of availability. This proposal adds cost, labour and complexity at a time when the supply base really does not need it and is struggling to stay on its feet to the specific advantage of EU producers. The National Grid has asked coal factories to warm up in case they are needed today, amid continued cold weather across the UK. Two coal units at Drax in Yorkshire and one at West Burton in Nottinghamshire were asked to fire up just before midnight yesterday. The West Burton unit was stood down at 5:13am, but the Drax units have continued to heat up, according to notifications sent to the industry. National Grid has been active in balancing the UK\u2019s energy supplies in recent days as it copes with colder, less windy weather which pushes up energy use and causes power generation from wind to drop. It was the third time in the last week that the National Grid\u2019s Electricity Supply Operator (ESO) has asked coal plants to warm up in case they are needed. National Grid has also been running its demand flexibility service for the first time this month outside of trials. The service pays households with smart meters for energy reductions, helping to reduce peak demand which means it has less need to draw on more polluting energy sources when energy use rises in the evenings. Some businesses were already paid to reduce energy use. The former US president Donald Trump will be allowed back on Facebook and Instagram, as the company behind the social media platforms, Meta, said it would end the two-year suspension of his accounts. His Twitter ban has already been lifted by the firm\u2019s new owner Elon Musk. The suspension will end \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d, Meta said. Meta\u2019s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg (a former UK deputy prime minister), said a review had found that Trump no longer poses a serious risk to public safety. Clegg said the public \u201cshould be able to hear what their politicians are saying\u201d. Trump\u2019s accounts were suspended when he, then US president, encouraged his supporters in January 2021, via his social media accounts, to storm the US Capitol building and disrupt the presidential election certification process, after Joe Biden won the election. In response to Meta\u2019s decision, Trump posted on his own social media company, Truth Social, yesterday, saying that Facebook had \u201clost Billions\u201d after banning \u201cyour favorite President, me\u201d. He wrote: \u201cSuch a thing should never again happen to a sitting President, or anybody else who is not deserving of retribution!\u201d News of Meta\u2019s decision has been met with fury and indignation among civil rights and online safety advocates. Haldane explained why the UK economy has fared worse than others: We\u2019ve seen many businesses teetering who have been able to just make it through Covid and the cost of living but are vulnerable to any shock that might come along. Think of it as a weakened societal immune system, that we\u2019ve run down our defences and that makes us particularly vulnerable nasty coming along. It seems that recent shocks that we\u2019ve had, which have been global, from Covid to the cost of living, but the UK always seem to cop disproportionately for the after-effects in terms of hits to income and lives and that is down to us not having invested sufficiently in our systems whether that\u2019s health or education or charities. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s former chief economist, now chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts and a government adviser on levelling up, has predicted real wages would fall again this year as higher mortgage costs continue to bite. He also warned that the recent political chaos was contributing to the UK\u2019s poor economic performance. But he also said that with inflation having peaked, central banks could raise rates more slowly, and saw \u201cflickers of life in the economy\u201d. Speaking on BBC radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Haldane argued that the UK economy was less resilient to economic crises because of underinvestment and poor coordination between the public, private and charity sectors. The terrible double whammy of first Covid and then the cost of living crisis has and is causing huge amounts of financial stress for many businesses, many households and of course many charities. We\u2019ve had a lost decade and a half in terms of pay rises in inflation-adjusted terms. Last year we saw real pay fall and we\u2019ll most likely see the same happen again and that is putting acute financial stress and indeed mental stress on a great many households, that\u2019s one consequence of the absence of growth, or certainly anaemic growth that we\u2019ve seen. Asked whether the political instability had contributed to the UK\u2019s poor economic performance recently, he said: When you do have a ministerial merry-go-round, that increases the probability of measures not being followed through and of programmes that are working not being scaled up. We are still a little short of having that medium term plan for growth in this country that we could then adhere to whichever government and whichever minister is in place. Asked whether he had any regrets, as the Bank of England has hiked interest rates at the same time as when the massive energy price hikes and inflation have come through: It is painful and I fear there is more pain to come as those mortgage rate rises from last year begin to hit people\u2019s bank accounts over the course of this year. I would have preferred the Bank and other central banks to have started their rate rises a bit sooner. That would have helped a bit in nipping inflation in the bud and would have meant that we wouldn\u2019t have had those rapid rate rises at the same time as the economy was hitting the buffers. But overall this global shock was always going to bring a significant degree of pain including through higher rates. I\u2019m hoping that with headline inflation now having peaked there is a decent chance that central banks will go a bit slower over the course of this year and won\u2019t become too much of a brake on the recovery and the early signs on that was some flickers of life in the economy. The Bank of Canada said yesterday it would pause after its eighth interest rate rise, to 4.5%, and there are some expectations that the US Federal Reserve could do the same. The focus in markets today is the US GDP data for the fourth quarter, which are expected to show a slowdown in economic growth to 2.6% from 3.2% in the previous quarter. Asian shares hit a fresh seven-month high, as MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.9% to its fifth day of gains, after falling back again. However, trading was thin with Australia shut for a holiday and some parts of Asia, including China, still celebrating Lunar New Year. European markets are expected to open higher ahead of US GDP.

            "title": "UK economy grew by only 0.1% in November ",
            "date": "2023-01-13T07:34:07Z",
            "content": "The UK economy unexpectedly grew by 0.1% in November as consumers headed to the shops in the run-up to Christmas and pubs and bars enjoyed a boost from the men\u2019s World Cup. Raising the government\u2019s chances of avoiding a long recession, City economists said hard-pressed consumers had proved more resilient than forecast despite the cost of living crisis. However, business groups warned that the economy was likely to suffer over the coming months as higher mortgage rates and the withdrawal of state support for energy bills begin to hit disposable incomes further. A downturn in the manufacturing sector also limited the strength of the economy and meant that over the three months to November the economy contracted by 0.3%, according to the Office for National Statistics. The British Chambers of Commerce said it was significant that the boost to consumer-facing industries, including retail, wholesale and hospitality, had failed to overcome a dramatic loss of sales compared with pre-pandemic levels. \u201cThe figures provide further evidence that UK economic growth is heading in the wrong direction despite this period normally being among the busiest for the retail sector. \u201cWhile month-on-month GDP grew by 0.1%, this is a volatile measure. The three-month average, standing at \u20130.3%, sends a clearer signal of the current trajectory of the economy,\u201d it said. The ONS said that sectors selling directly to consumers had suffered an 8.5% fall in income since February 2020 and that unlike other G7 countries, the whole economy remained smaller than it was three years ago. Cost of living pressures are likely to become more acute this year as tax rises and the withdrawal of government subsidies take effect. Ministers are poised to increase unit gas and electricity prices for consumers from April, pushing the average bill to \u00a33,000, up from \u00a32,500. Meanwhile, interest rate rises by the Bank of England mean average annual payments for millions of mortgage holders will increase by \u00a33,000. The Bank of England has warned that the UK is probably set for a long recession, as defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction. The economy shrank by 0.3% in the third quarter between July and September, and figures for the October to December period will be published next month, confirming whether or not the economy entered recession at that point. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the verdict \u201changs in the balance\u201d but it was almost certain a recession was coming in the first half of 2023. \u201cLooking ahead, we continue to think that GDP will drop substantially in the first and second quarters of this year.\u201d James Smith, a senior economist at ING, downplayed the prospect of the UK suffering a bigger downturn than other developed nations. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a peak-to-trough fall in GDP of a little more than 1.5%, which would match closest with the early 1990s recession in terms of scale,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd despite the UK\u2019s many woes, particularly in the jobs market, we aren\u2019t convinced Britain will be a serious outlier from the rest of Europe on the hit to GDP this year, even if it probably does sit in the bottom half of the pack.\u201d Analysts have warned that some of the trends in the data were difficult to judge after a series of events that distorted the usual pattern. November\u2019s 0.1% rise represented a slowdown compared with 0.5% growth in October, when the economy rebounded from a weak September, caused in part by the closure of many businesses for the Queen\u2019s funeral. A Reuters poll of City economists predicted the economy would shrink by 0.2 % in November. Jeremy Hunt said his priority was to bring down inflation to alleviate the cost of living crisis and revive the economy. \u201cWe have a clear plan to halve inflation this year \u2013 an insidious hidden tax which has led to hikes in interest rates and mortgage costs, holding back growth here and around the world,\u201d the chancellor said."

            "date": "2023-01-31T01:30:32Z",
            "content": "Britain is expected to be the only major industrialised country to see its economy shrink this year after the impact of Liz Truss\u2019s brief premiership prompted a sharp growth downgrade from the International Monetary Fund. Adding to growing political pressure on Rishi Sunak after the sacking of the Conservative party chair Nadhim Zahawi, the Washington-based IMF warned on Tuesday it expected the UK economy to contract by 0.6% this year \u2013 0.9 percentage points worse than it had pencilled in just three months ago and slower even than sanctions-hit Russia. The IMF said that while the prospects for every other member of the G7 group of leading developed nations had improved or remained unchanged since October, rising interest rates and higher taxes had made the outlook for the UK gloomier. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, said 2023 would be \u201cquite challenging\u201d for the UK as it slipped from top to bottom of the G7 league table. \u201cThere is a sharp correction,\u201d he added. The UK chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, last week warned a sense of declinism was hampering the UK\u2019s economic recovery, and has come under pressure to come up with a credible plan to boost growth. His speech, which focused on \u201centerprise, education, employment and everywhere\u201d, was widely criticised by business leaders as being devoid of policies. The UK growth downgrade came in the IMF\u2019s update to its half-yearly World Economic Outlook (WEO) \u2013 a health check on the global economy published in April and October. The October 2022 WEO was completed before the tax-cutting mini budget from the then-chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, in late September and pencilled in growth of 0.3% for 2023. In its update, the IMF said the UK had performed more strongly in 2022 than anticipated, growing by 4.1% rather than the 3.6% expected three months ago. But it said the outlook for 2023 had deteriorated, with its updated forecast reflecting the higher taxes announced by Hunt after he replaced Kwarteng, the increase in interest rates from the Bank of England, tougher financial conditions for borrowers, and still-high energy prices. The Bank is expected to raise interest rates from 3.5% to 4% on Thursday. \u201cWith inflation at about 10% or above in several euro-area countries and the United Kingdom, household budgets remain stretched. The accelerated pace of rate increases by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank is tightening financial conditions and cooling demand in the housing sector and beyond,\u201d the IMF said. Treasury sources said the IMF\u2019s focus on the high level of inflation reinforced the need to tackle the UK\u2019s cost of living crisis. They added that in 2021 Britain had outperformed forecasts made by the IMF and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Hunt said in response to the IMF forecasts: \u201cThe governor of the Bank of England recently said that any UK recession this year is likely to be shallower than previously predicted, however these figures confirm we are not immune to the pressures hitting nearly all advanced economies.\u201d Hunt, whose plan for growth includes developing the UK equivalent of California\u2019s Silicon Valley, added: \u201cShort-term challenges should not obscure our long-term prospects \u2013 the UK outperformed many forecasts last year, and if we stick to our plan to halve inflation, the UK is still predicted to grow faster than Germany and Japan over the coming years.\u201d Gourinchas said the UK\u2019s high dependence on still-expensive natural gas, the \u201cscarring\u201d effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the size of the workforce, and higher mortgage costs would have an impact on growth. \u201cAll together these factors will lead to a fairly sharp retrenchment in activity this year,\u201d the IMF official said. Of the other G7 countries, it revised up its growth forecasts for the US, Germany, Italy and Japan, while leaving them the same for France and Canada. Russia\u2019s growth prospects have markedly improved, the IMF said, with higher military spending and buoyant energy exports leading to forecast expansion of 0.3% in 2023 \u2013 a 2.6 point upgrade. Overall, global growth is forecast by the IMF to be 2.9% this year, 0.2 points higher than anticipated in October, while the projection for 2024 has been revised down by 0.1 points to 3.1%. Gourinchas said even after the modest improvement in the global picture for 2023, growth would remain weak by historical standards, as the fight against the strongest inflationary pressures in four decades and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine took their toll. \u201cDespite these headwinds, the outlook is less gloomy than in our October forecast, and could represent a turning point, with growth bottoming out and inflation declining. \u201cEconomic growth proved surprisingly resilient in the third quarter of last year, with strong labor markets, robust household consumption and business investment, and better-than-expected adaptation to the energy crisis in Europe.\u201d The IMF\u2019s economic counsellor said he was also encouraged by signs that inflation rates were falling in many countries, even though core inflation \u2013 which excludes energy and food prices \u2013 had yet to peak in most cases. \u201cElsewhere, China\u2019s sudden re-opening paves the way for a rapid rebound in activity. And global financial conditions have improved as inflation pressures started to abate. This, and a weakening of the US dollar from its November high, provided some modest relief to emerging and developing countries,\u201d Gourinchas said. \u201cOn the upside, a stronger boost from pent-up demand in numerous economies or a faster fall in inflation are plausible. On the downside, severe health outcomes in China could hold back the recovery, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine could escalate, and tighter global financing conditions could worsen debt distress.\u201d Financial markets might also respond badly to higher than expected inflation news, the IMF added."

            "title": "CBI boss urges Sunak to show more ambition on economy",
            "date": "2023-01-23T07:00:16Z",
            "content": "The head of the UK\u2019s leading business organisation is to call for Rishi Sunak to show more ambition on the economy, warning that the country risks being left behind on green growth and that a cull of EU laws could scupper a recovery. While stressing that he did not want to be seen as a \u201cdoomster or gloomster\u201d, Tony Danker, director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), is to use what the organisation is billing as a \u201cmajor\u201d speech to call for action on several fronts. The comments, while carefully worded and pitched by the CBI as a positive set of ideas rather than direct criticism, will nonetheless be widely seen as a rebuke to No 10 and the Treasury. Speaking at University College London on Monday, Danker will praise Sunak and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, for stabilising the economy after the impact of Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous autumn mini-budget, but will add that both now need to be more proactive. Public services like the NHS, schools and transport require more investment, Danker will say, according to extracts of the speech briefed in advance, adding: \u201cBut there isn\u2019t any more money, because there isn\u2019t any growth.\u201d He will say there is a \u201cdenial of where our economy is right now compared to our international competitors\u201d which risked the UK suffering through limited ambition. \u201cThe current CBI forecast is that the prime minister should comfortably hit his pledge of getting the economy growing by the end of the year, by 0.1%. But my argument is that if our policies today aim for 0.1% growth, it\u2019s the most we\u2019ll ever achieve.\u201d The speech is particularly damning on green-based growth, with Danker saying that \u201cthe UK is falling behind rapidly to the Americans and the Europeans, who are outspending and outsmarting us\u201d. While Sunak has talked up his desire to invest in green technology and renewable energy sources, there is resistance among some Tory MPs to areas such as onshore wind and solar power. In contrast, Labour has promised to invest \u00a328bn a year in climate measures. Inaction means the country is \u201cleaving huge amounts of money on the table\u201d, Danker is to argue, saying that in two years the UK lost a potential \u00a34.3bn in green market share. \u201cWhile our competitors across Europe, Asia and the US are making their move, and going hell for leather, we seem to be second guessing ourselves and hoping for the best.\u201d He will add: \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to take those hard decisions, generating the forward momentum not only to limit recession this year but also get us really growing next.\u201d Another strongly worded section sees Danker argue that while there is a good argument for the UK to diverge from EU regulations after Brexit, scrapping up to 4,000 EU-derived laws by the end of 2023, as promised under the retained EU law bill, was \u201ccreating huge uncertainty for UK firms\u201d. He will say: \u201cOn the UK\u2019s regulatory divergence from Europe, the government is convinced this is a major opportunity for growth. I agree it can be too. But it\u2019s a bit more complicated than scrapping overnight many of the terms of trade we\u2019ve used for decades. \u201cDo we really want to subject the public \u2013 and industry \u2013 to another round of mass confusion and disruption, just when we\u2019re trying to exit recession?\u201d EU laws should be reviewed and, where needed, repealed as part of a wider strategy, Danker is to say: \u201cSmartly, not the retained EU law bill\u2019s way \u2013 foolishly.\u201d Other concerns to be raised by Danker included the imminent demise of the \u201csuper deduction\u201d tax incentive for business investment, and a lack of action over issues affecting employees, including expensive childcare and the need for higher skills."

            "date": "2023-01-25T17:21:58Z",
            "content": "The governor of the Bank of Israel has warned Benjamin Netanyahu that his new government\u2019s proposals for sweeping judicial reform could damage the country\u2019s economy, according to Israeli media reports. Prof Amir Yaron met the Israeli prime minister on Tuesday, according to the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, after requesting an \u201curgent meeting\u201d. Yaron reportedly conveyed worries shared by fellow attendees at last week\u2019s World Economic Forum summit in Davos that the overhaul of Israel\u2019s justice system would erase democratic checks and balances, potentially leading to a decision to lower the country\u2019s credit rating and scaring away foreign investment. Much of the country\u2019s high-tech sector \u2013 which at 15.3% of GDP is the main engine of economic growth \u2013 is funded by outside investors. The governor\u2019s reported intervention comes after a public rebuke of the government\u2019s plans by two of his predecessors earlier this week, and a strike by several hundred tech sector employees in Tel Aviv\u2019s \u201cSilicon Wadi\u201d on Tuesday. An official statement released after the meeting at the Knesset said: \u201cThe governor of the Bank of Israel reviewed the state of the Israeli economy and the challenges it faces, both local and from an international perspective.\u201d Netanyahu returned to office in December at the head of the most rightwing government in Israeli history: various elements of the coalition wish to annex the occupied West Bank, roll back pro-LGBTQ+ legislation, limit freedom of speech and give the Knesset the power to overturn supreme court decisions. Critics say this last point would help Netanyahu evade a conviction in his ongoing corruption trial, in which he denies all charges, and fundamentally undermine democratic norms and civil liberties in a country with no formal constitution. \u201cInvestors don\u2019t just think about tomorrow, they are looking at the next decade. They do risk analysis: shareholders are asking me, \u2018What\u2019s plan B? Should we take our funds out of the country?\u2019 Investors need confidence that governments and countries will behave like democracies,\u201d said Eynat Guez, CEO and co-founder of Papaya Global, a startup unicorn developing workforce management software. \u201cThe feeling in our sector is that politicians like to use us as the face of the country when it suits them. So if they want to use us as poster boys, now they have to listen to our voices too.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s hour-long strike at one point blocked traffic on a busy thoroughfare in central Tel Aviv, as marching workers held placards reading \u201cNo high-tech, no taxes.\u201d It follows major demonstrations in cities across the country over the last few weekends which have managed to unite people of differing religious beliefs, ethnic background, income and political leanings in what is usually a highly polarised society. Guy Tytunovich, CEO and founder of CHEQ, a cybersecurity company, said: \u201cI am worried both as a citizen and as a CEO about democracy, but the strike on Tuesday and other actions are proof that there are ways for us to combat this. \u201cThere is optimism that the government will have to listen \u2026 I\u2019m willing to invest time and money into this cause because no one wants our country to turn into Turkey or Hungary.\u201d The judicial reforms must clear three Knesset plenum votes to become law. Israel\u2019s Channel 12 News reported on Tuesday that the coalition has made overhauling the legal system its top priority, and hopes to pass the bill by early April."

            "date": "2023-01-26T19:23:55Z",
            "content": "The US National Archives has asked representatives for former presidents and vice-presidents on Thursday to review their personal records for any classified-marked documents in their possession after a series of such discoveries at the homes of Joe Biden, Donald Trump and Mike Pence. The archives sent letters to the presidents and vice-presidents in the previous six administrations that are covered under the Presidential Records Act, which requires materials from their time in the White House to be turned over to the agency when they leave office. \u201cWe request that you conduct an assessment of any materials held outside of Nara [National Archives and Records Administration] to determine whether bodies of materials previously assumed to be personal in nature might inadvertently contain Presidential or Vice Presidential records,\u201d the letters said. The requests are understood to have gone to representatives for former presidents including Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton, as well as former vice-presidents Dick Cheney, Al Gore and Dan Quayle, according to a source familiar with the matter. The archives did not respond to a request for comment. Representatives for the four former presidents have said that they had not retained any classified-marked documents after leaving the White House, though Pence himself also claimed he had returned everything to the government until a recent search of his home found otherwise. The requests, earlier reported by CNN, come after lawyers to Biden and then Pence reported that a search of their private properties turned up classified-marked documents, months after the FBI searched Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in August and seized about 100 such documents. The most recent spate of discoveries started with the revelation that Biden\u2019s personal lawyer had found a number of classified-marked documents on 2 November, when he was clearing out his office last November at the University of Pennsylvania Biden Center for Diplomacy in Washington. Some of the documents at the UPenn Biden Center, the Guardian previously reported, included papers marked as classified at the Top Secret/Secret Compartmented Information level that were immediately reported to the National Archives, which in turn alerted the US justice department. The attorney general, Merrick Garland, asked US attorney John Lausch on 14 November to conduct a review of the matter. After the additional papers were found late last year, Lausch recommended on 5 January that Garland appoint a special counsel to take over the inquiry. Garland appointed Robert Hur, a top former Trump justice department official to serve as special counsel in the Biden documents case on 10 January, seeking to insulate the department from possible accusations of political conflicts after he named a special counsel to investigate Trump. The Biden documents case last week prompted close aides to Pence to search the former vice-president\u2019s home in Indiana out of an abundance of caution, where they found a number of classified-marked documents, Pence\u2019s counsel Greg Jacob said in a letter to the National Archives on 18 January. The letter added that the aide who searched the property could not specify anything more about the documents \u2013 including the content, dates and classification level, which remain unclear \u2013 because he stopped looking as soon as he saw the classified markings. The discovery of classified-marked documents is an embarrassing development for Pence after he confidently told ABC News last year that he had not improperly removed any materials from the White House. \u201cI did not,\u201d Pence said in November last year. Trump \u2013 Pence\u2019s former boss \u2013 has been under federal investigation for more than a year over whether he wilfully retained national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort, and whether he obstructed efforts by the justice department to secure their return starting in May last year. Compared with Biden, and now Pence, who moved quickly to return documents to the government, Trump\u2019s resistance to handing over materials at his Florida property led to the justice department turning his case into a criminal investigation. The department has typically pursued cases of mishandled classified documents criminally when they involve a combination of four aggravating factors: wilful mishandling of classified information, vast quantities of materials to suggest misconduct, disloyalty to the United States and obstruction. The investigation into Trump touches on at least two of those elements \u2013 obstruction, where a person conceals documents with an intent to impede a government agency, and the volume of classified materials at Mar-a-Lago."

            "content": "Fifty years ago on Sunday, Lyndon Baines Johnson died. He was 64, and had been out of power since stepping down as president in 1969, in the shadow of the Vietnam war. Forty-five years later, in 2018, the Guardian marked the anniversary of his death. The headline: \u201cWhy Lyndon Johnson, a truly awful man, is my political hero.\u201d Mark Lawrence laughs. \u201cI think I read that one,\u201d he says. It seems likely. Lawrence, a distinguished Vietnam scholar, is director of the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin, Texas. Johnson was a Texas Democrat who rose through Congress to be vice-president to John F Kennedy, then assumed the presidency when Kennedy was killed. From 1963 to 1969, Johnson presided over great social reform at home and gathering disaster abroad. His legacy has never been less than complex, his place in American culture attracting historians by the hundred and big-name actors in droves. Bryan Cranston, Brian Cox and Woody Harrelson have recently played LBJ. Lawrence continues: \u201cOne of the ideas that an awful lot of people hold about LBJ, and I think it\u2019s not wholly incorrect, but it\u2019s problematic, is that he was this vulgar, crude man who used four-letter words and demeaned his subordinates and threw temper tantrums. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that Caro\u201d \u2013 Robert Caro\u2019s biographical masterwork \u2013 \u201cis the go-to source for the uglier parts of his personal style. But I think you can also make an argument, and Caro I think comes around to this view in the later books, that LBJ managed to combine whatever elements of that old caricature hold up with a genuine sense of compassion for ordinary people. \u201cMany biographers see the link between his own hardscrabble youth and the struggles of his family and a peculiar sensitivity to the plight of the downtrodden, which certainly affected his view of racial discrimination. The sensitivity to poverty, whether it affected Black, brown or white, came from his own experience. \u201cMy writing about LBJ has largely been critical, but I don\u2019t have any difficulty saying this was a man with a genuine sense of compassion.\u201d Lawrence is speaking to mark the half-century since the 36th president died. LBJ is in the news anyway. He was the architect of the Great Society, overseeing the passage of civil rights protections and a welfare system now under renewed attack. Joe Biden often compares his post-Covid presidency to that of Franklin D Roosevelt amid the Great Depression, but comparisons to Johnson are ready to hand. Lawrence says: \u201cThe points of similarity are remarkable. The guy with long service in the Senate\u201d \u2013 Johnson from Texas, 1949-1961, Biden from Delaware, 1973-2009 \u2013 \u201cthe guy who could cross the aisle, the guy who spoke in pragmatic, bipartisan terms. Both of these guys became vice-president to a younger, less experienced but much more charismatic person\u201d \u2013 Biden to Barack Obama \u2013 \u201cand that was kind of their ticket to the presidency. \u201cBut I think some of these comparisons are ultimately unfair to Biden, because the political context is just so different. My own view is, sure, LBJ deserves credit for being this enormously persuasive, forceful guy who knew how to bend people to his will. But at the end of the day, LBJ was pushing an open door. \u201cEven the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, these great achievements, they passed by big margins. There were bipartisan coalitions. LBJ deserves credit for his ability to put those coalitions together. But \u2026 I think it\u2019s possible to exaggerate LBJ\u2019s importance and to forget the importance of Hubert Humphrey, Jacob Javits and Everett Dirksen, all key players as well.\u201d Bipartisan players, too. Humphrey was LBJ\u2019s vice-president, Javits a Republican senator from New York, Dirksen, of Illinois, Republican Senate minority leader. \u201cI think that\u2019s precisely what\u2019s lacking now. The situation is so polarised that you could bring LBJ back from the dead and he\u2019d be an utter failure in this political context, because his skills would have been meaningless in the context of 2023.\u201d Biden passed a coronavirus rescue package, an infrastructure bill and the Inflation Reduction Act, all meant to help the US recover from Covid, with razor-thin margins in Congress and against Republicans gone to extremes. LBJ\u2019s shadow may be long \u2013 at a shade over 6ft 3in he is the second-tallest president, after Abraham Lincoln \u2013 but Biden does not necessarily labour within it. \u2022\u2022\u2022 So how might progressives see Johnson? If they read Caro, they will learn how he came from a world of Texas populism, tinged with socialism, that now seems far gone indeed. \u201cAt least by the standards of the era,\u201d Lawrence sees in LBJ \u201ca genuine willingness to think hard about poverty and how to insulate people against economic forces over which individuals had no control whatsoever.\u201d Whether teaching in a dirt-poor school in Cotulla in 1928 or working \u201cfor the National Youth Administration in the 1930s, LBJ shows glimmers of his willingness to cross racial lines and to think seriously about the situation of African Americans and Mexican Americans\u201d. To Lawrence, the Texas years \u201cindicate that LBJ was an unusual person, for a southern white man who came of age in the 1920s and 30s.\u201d In the 1950s, when Johnson led the Senate, he defended white supremacy. As president, he oversaw the Vietnam disaster. But Charles Kaiser, a Guardian contributor and author of 1968 in America and The Gay Metropolis, also sees the bigger picture. \u201cIn 1968, I hated Lyndon Johnson with all my heart, because I was 17 \u2013 and lived in fear of being drafted. Fifty years later, it is clear three other things about his presidency were much more important than the war that destroyed him. \u201cThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 made him the most courageous president since Lincoln. Johnson may or may not have said \u2018We have lost the south for a generation\u2019 after he signed the 1964 law, but he certainly knew that was true. By fighting for those two laws, he did more to redeem the promise of the Emancipation Proclamation than any president before him. \u201cMedicare is the third prong of a noble legacy. It did more to improve the lives of senior citizens than anything else except Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s social security. A hundred years from now, I think Johnson will be considered one of our greatest presidents.\u201d To Lawrence, Johnson\u2019s reputation is \u201cmixed. But I think the mix of impressions is quite different from what it was certainly 30 years ago. \u201cWhen he died, and for many years thereafter, Vietnam hung so heavily over LBJ that he was a little bit radioactive \u2026 it was something conservatives and the left could agree on. Vietnam was a debacle and LBJ bore principal responsibility for it. But I think in the last decade and a half, there\u2019s been a gradual reappraisal. \u201cThe level of dysfunction and partisanship in Washington has led people to take another look at LBJ and how he was able to work across the aisle and achieve so much. There\u2019s a kind of longing, I think, for that kind of political effectiveness. \u201cSo many of the issues that LBJ worked on are back with us, and I think this has led at least parts of the political spectrum to have a new appreciation for him. \u201cIn a period when immigration and the environment and voting rights are under threat in a profound way, people are rediscovering LBJ as someone who maybe didn\u2019t have perfect answers but worked very effectively, at least by the standards of recent decades, and achieved real results.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-01-27T22:15:20Z",
            "content": "Peru\u2019s beleaguered president, Dina Boluarte, has urged Congress to bring forward elections scheduled for April 2024 to the end of this year as anti-government protests and blockades intensify across the country. Boluarte, who has refused to step down despite furious nationwide protests calling for her to resign, said on Friday that elections should be brought forward to December in an attempt to ease the seven weeks of unrest that has claimed 57 lives \u2013 mostly civilians killed in clashes with the security forces. Speaking at a military airbase in Lima, Boluarte said she hoped the unconditional proposal would \u201cget us out of this quagmire\u201d. She said the executive branch of government would call elections as soon as Congress set the date. The deeply unpopular chamber approved bringing forward elections by two years to April 2024 in a first vote earlier this month but must make a second vote to finalise the decision. \u201cNobody has any interest in clinging to power \u2026 and I, Dina Boluarte, have no interest in staying in the presidency,\u201d she said. Peru has been embroiled in political turmoil and street violence since early December when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve Congress and rule by decree. Boluarte, his vice-president and former running mate, took office. But the demonstrations and blockades have spread in size and scale as scores of civilians have been killed in violent clashes with the security forces, overwhelmingly in the southern Andes, a region ignored and marginalised by the Lima establishment which largely supported ousted Castillo who pledged to eradicate poverty and overturn the status quo. Hundreds of protesters marched through the streets of the southern city of Cusco on Thursday, carrying placards that denounced the president as a monster, a murderer and a Judas. \u201cWe are here to protest against this authoritarian government which kills its people,\u201d said one of the marchers, a 40-year-old teacher called Javier Cusimay. \u201cWe feel stronger than ever and we will carry on fighting until the very end. This is a peaceful, bullet-free struggle. The violence is coming from the government. So many of our brothers have died. This government cannot go on,\u201d Cusimay added as the protest moved through the cobblestone streets of the city\u2019s picturesque historic center. Protests have spread to the capital, Lima, as demonstrators travelled in convoys from the southern Andes to the capital to demand Boluarte\u2019s resignation, the closure of congress and fresh elections. Students joined the ranks of protesters on Tuesday in massive protests that ended in violent clashes with the police. Several journalists were among those injured by rubber pellets and teargas canisters fired by the police. A police raid on a university last Saturday sparked further outrage over heavy-handed police tactics and swelled the ranks of the protesters demanding political consequences for Boluarte and her cabinet. Boluarte, 60, apologised for the way the university raid was carried out on Tuesday but praised the police force\u2019s \u201cimmaculate conduct\u201d in the protests in Lima last week. She called for a \u201cnational truce\u201d and claimed violent groups, some of them from Bolivia, were sowing \u201cchaos and anarchy\u201d for a political agenda. The lawyer and former civil servant, who hails from Apur\u00edmac in the southern Andes, appealed to the protesters, saying in Quechua that she was one of them."

            "date": "2023-01-03T14:35:15Z",
            "content": "Brazil\u2019s new president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, has joined tens of thousands of mourners paying tribute to Pel\u00e9 in the coastal city of Santos before the former footballer\u2019s burial there Tuesday afternoon. Pel\u00e9, who died last week age 82, scored most of his 1,283 goals for Santos football club and it is there that he will be laid to rest after a funeral cortege from the stadium, Vila Belmiro, where his 24-hour wake has been held. More than 230,000 mourners from across Brazil have filed past Pel\u00e9\u2019s coffin since the wake began at 10am on Monday, voicing adoration and regret over the passing of a sporting legend who won three World Cups and became the country\u2019s most famous international calling-card. A giant banner draped over one of the stands captured their emotions with the words \u201cViva o Rei\u201d (\u201cLong live the king\u201d). Lula joined mourners on the pitch of the 16,000-capacity ground on Tuesday morning after flying into Santos from the capital, Bras\u00edlia, where he was sworn in for a historic third term as president on Sunday afternoon. The football-loving leftist, who grew up watching Pel\u00e9 (born Edson Arantes do Nascimento) play, comforted the sportsman\u2019s relatives and friends under a white marquee where the coffin had been draped with the yellow and green flag of Brazil and Santos\u2019 white flag. Speaking to Santos\u2019s official television channel, Lula voiced profound regret over the death of a sportsman whom he called a model of \u201cgood character, humility and dignity\u201d. He added: \u201cPel\u00e9 is so special. You can\u2019t compare him to anyone because there is nobody comparable when it comes to being a football player or a human. He\u2019s a player who, from a very young age, enjoyed such extraordinary exposure \u2026 but was never snooty. He was always a humble citizen who treated others as equals. \u201cHe never let himself become carried away with his brilliance or with the glory. Even in his most glorious moments, like when he met the queen of England, he acted as he would when meeting a normal person on the street.\u201d A message on a floral tribute sent by Lula and the first lady, Ros\u00e2ngela Lula da Silva, honoured \u201cthe great Brazilian, our king Pel\u00e9\u201d. In the early hours of Tuesday the queue to enter the Vila Belmiro stretched for more than 2km with tearful mourners waiting up to three hours to catch a glimpse of their idol. \u201cI\u2019m filled with so much sadness, it wasn\u2019t his time to go,\u201d said Lisete Santos, a 69-year-old administrative worker who had passed by the casket twice. \u201cPel\u00e9 is eternal, there will never be anyone like him again. This is why we are here to pay our respects.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been here all night,\u201d said Denis de Almeida Silva, a 43-year-old clothing store owner from S\u00e3o Paulo, as he emerged from the stadium. \u201cHe means so much to us as Brazilians. Wherever Pel\u00e9 walked he represented Brazil. Edson Arantes do Nascimento might be gone. But Pel\u00e9 will never die.\u201d After the wake ended at 10am on Tuesday, Pel\u00e9\u2019s body was placed on a red fire engine by police guards and driven south towards the seafront. From there the cortege moved east along the coast, towards the home of his 100-year-old mother, Celeste Arantes, after which it set off for a nearby cemetery for a private burial. Brazilian television channels suspended their normal programming to broadcast the procession, as happened in Argentina after the death of the footballer Diego Maradona in 2020. Thousands of residents of all ages poured on to the streets of Santos to shout their hero\u2019s name as his coffin passed by. \u201cWe will all continue to carry a little piece of Pel\u00e9 within us,\u201d said Claudia Diegues, 47, a dental surgeon from Santos. \u201cHe was our hero, our symbol of hope.\u201d For Jussara Giollo Ferreira, a black 23-year-old physical education teacher, who was among the mourners, Pel\u00e9\u2019s legacy went beyond the pitch. \u201cI see many of the kids I teach, they are inspired by what he was able to achieve. They look at him and say, why can\u2019t I achieve the same? So I think this is the legacy he leaves us: to never give up, to have faith and to fight hard \u2013 just like he fought for us.\u201d"

            "title": "Peru: growing outrage over protest deaths as president urged to resign",
            "date": "2023-01-19T15:08:30Z",
            "content": "Peru\u2019s capital city is bracing for further unrest as thousands of protesters from across the country pour into Lima to demand the resignation of President Dina Boluarte, after nearly six weeks of turmoil that has claimed close to 50 lives. Two more people were killed late on Wednesday and another seriously injured in Macusani, a city in the southern region of Puno. After the deaths, protesters torched a police station, forcing officers to flee in a helicopter. In Lima, police fired teargas after clashes broke out with protesters. Outrage over the rising death toll has powered the growing protests, which began in early December in support of ousted former president Pedro Castillo but have shifted overwhelmingly to demand Boluarte\u2019s resignation, the closure of congress and fresh elections. Boluarte was Castillo\u2019s vice-president, who replaced him after he attempted to shutter congress and rule by decree on 7 December. Travelling amid the convoys of lorries and cars en route to the coastal capital were a group of medical volunteers who were mourning Marco Antonio Samillan, a 30-year-old student doctor fatally shot while helping an injured protester last week in the deadliest bout of violence since the protests began. His companions have renamed their brigade in honour of Samillan, who had just completed his sixth year studying medicine and aspired to be a neurosurgeon. He died from internal bleeding caused by a bullet wound in the violent clashes last Monday, which saw 19 civilians and one police officer killed in the southern city of Juliaca. \u201cHe always had a vocation to serve, to help the poorest,\u201d said Samillan\u2019s elder brother, Ra\u00fal, 40. \u201cI tried to persuade him not to go to the protests, but he picked up his first aid case and went anyway. That\u2019s the last time I spoke to him. \u201cThe whole of Juliaca is in mourning. This has caused deep pain among our people,\u201d he added. Marco Samillan, the sixth of nine siblings who grew up in poverty, had always dreamed of becoming a doctor and treating patients in his native Puno, the poor, hardscrabble region on the high plateau which connects Peru\u2019s southern border with Bolivia. Human rights organisations and the UN have accused Peru\u2019s security forces of using disproportionate force in the protests, including firing live ammunition and launching teargas canisters from helicopters. Edgar Stuardo Ral\u00f3n, vice-president of the Inter American Commission on Human Rights, detailed last week that a fact-finding mission had \u201creceived reports of indiscriminate shootings against demonstrators in certain regions \u2026 as well as other reports of shots aimed at vital points [of the body] with lethal and high-calibre weapons in violation of the principle of the gradual use of force.\u201d Speaking to journalists on Friday, Ral\u00f3n said that the prolonged political crisis in Peru \u2013 which has seen seven presidents in six years \u2013 had contributed to deadliest political violence in two decades. Discrimination and inequality had also played a role, while labelling protesters as terrorists had added to the polarisation and conflict, he added. The deaths have also stirred longstanding grievances in Puno and much of the largely poor southern Andes, which is home to many of the mines that drive the country\u2019s economy, and attractions like Machu Picchu and Lake Titicaca, which account for the vast majority of its income from tourism. \u201cThe riches from those raw materials never reach our towns; they are shared among the elite in Lima,\u201d said Samillan. \u201cWe are part of this country. We want quality of life with good healthcare and education too. But when we raised our voice in protest asking them to respect our rights they responded with blows and bullets.\u201d Fifty-eight per cent of Peruvians consider there were excesses on the part of the forces of law and order in the face of the protests, according to an Institute of Peruvian Studies poll this month. The same survey indicated that 83% of those polled were in favour of bringing forward elections and just three in 10 Peruvians approved of Boluarte\u2019s government. Boluarte has apologised for the deaths but also insisted she will not resign, repeatedly blaming radical elements for stirring up the protests and coercing people into participating. Patricia Z\u00e1rate, head of public opinion research at the Institute of Peruvian Studies, said that while extremists \u2013 including some linked to the Shining Path rebel movement that terrorised the country in the 1980s and 90s \u2013 may have played a minor role in the protests, Boluarte\u2019s discourse was being perceived as being condescending. \u201cShe is treating people as if they are not in control of their political opinions, as if they were being manipulated and don\u2019t understand why they are marching,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t feel represented by the political system and they want to be included.\u201d"
