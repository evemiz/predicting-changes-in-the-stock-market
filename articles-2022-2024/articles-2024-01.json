            "date": "2024-01-18T18:41:17Z",
            "content": "The centrist group No Labels has filed a formal complaint with the justice department, asking it to investigate an \u201calleged unlawful conspiracy\u201d to shut down its effort to secure ballot access for the 2024 presidential election. No Labels has not yet decided whether it will run a third party against Joe Biden and the Republican nominee, widely expected to be Donald Trump, in November\u2019s presidential election. Critics say the effort would have the unintended consequence of hurting Biden and helping Trump. Last week No Labels sent an eight-page letter to the justice department\u2019s Kristen Clarke, assistant attorney general for the civil rights division, and Nicole Argentieri, acting assistant attorney general for the criminal division, accusing its opponents of violating federal law including racketeering and a number of criminal civil rights provisions. \u201cThere is a group of activists and operatives and party officials who are participating in alleged illegal conspiracy to use intimidation, harassment and fear against representatives of No Labels, its donors and its potential candidates,\u201d Dan Webb, a No Labels leader who has served as the US attorney in Chicago, told a press conference in Washington DC on Thursday. The letter cites examples including a recent Semafor report on an 80-minute call organised by Matt Bennett, co-founder of the thinktank Third Way. One attendee explained on the call how they would dissuade candidates from running on a No Labels unity ticket: \u201cThrough every channel we have, to their donors, their friends, the press, everyone \u2013 everyone \u2013 should send the message: if you have one fingernail clipping of a skeleton in your closet, we will find it.\u201d In another case, Holly Page, a co-founder of No Labels, was allegedly approached by a representative of the Lincoln Project and told to walk away from the group. She was allegedly warned: \u201cYou have no idea of the forces aligned against you. You will never be able to work in Democratic politics again.\u201d The letter also notes that Rick Wilson, co-founder of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, posted a tweet last year of a video in which he said No Labels and its leaders \u201cneed to be burned to the fucking ground politically\u201d. At Thursday\u2019s press conference, Pat McCrory, a national co-chair and former governor of North Carolina, responded: \u201cWho do they think they are, Tony Soprano? I hope not.\u201d Benjamin Chavis Jr, a No Labels national co-chair and a leader and veteran civil rights activist, said: \u201cThe alleged conspiracy to stop No Labels is a brazen voter suppression effort. \u201cBased on the evidence that we have submitted to the United States Department of Justice, if individuals were working to frighten and harass an organisation seeking to register disenfranchised voters, the country would be outraged and those individuals would likely be prosecuted. That is what is happening today and needs to be exposed for what it is.\u201d Joe Lieberman, a No Labels National founding chair and former senator, added: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of giving voice to millions of Americans who feel abandoned by the Democratic and Republican political establishments. They\u2019re angry at the two major parties. Who can blame them? \u201cAnd they\u2019re profoundly disappointed that they\u2019re going to be forced to choose once again between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. They want a third choice. There\u2019s a lot of talk lately about democracy being on the ballot in 2024 and in many ways it is. But I think it\u2019s really important to understand what we mean by the word democracy.\u201d Demand for a third-party presidential candidate has reached record highs amid deep voter dissatisfaction with 81-year-old Biden and Trump, who faces 91 criminal charges across four cases. A Reuters/Ipsos poll in December showed six in 10 respondents were unhappy with the two-party system and wanted a third choice. Founded in 2009, No Labels is now on the ballot in 14 states and say it will decide in March whether to offer its ballot line to a unity presidential ticket. If it does, the Unity ticket presidential campaign will be responsible for securing ballot access in the final 18 states plus the District of Columbia. On Tuesday a federal judge blocked the Arizona secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, from recognizing candidates wanting to run for office under the No Labels banner aside from the party\u2019s yet-to-be-chosen ticket for president and vice-president. Lieberman acknowledged that, should Nikki Haley drop out of the Republican primary race and express an interest in joining a No Labels ticket, she would \u201cdeserve serious consideration\u201d. The Lincoln Project rejected No Labels\u2019 legal complaint, saying in statement: \u201cNo Labels is a dark money group that is so consumed with its own quest for power and relevancy that it is willing to risk electing Trump, despite their own acknowledgment that he is a dangerous ideologue. \u201cAnd like Trump, they want to weaponize the DoJ to get to attack their opponents for protected political speech. This is a desperate attempt to salvage their failing campaign and keep their fleeing supporters who have finally seen through their facade.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-01T11:00:28Z",
            "content": "Whether or not the 2024 US presidential election presents the expected Joe Biden v Donald Trump rematch, much will be at stake. From the future of reproductive rights to the chances of meaningful action on climate change, from the strength of US support for Ukraine in its war with Russia to the fate of democracy in America itself, existential issues are set to come to the fore. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Economy \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d So said the Democratic strategist James Carville, in 1992, as an adviser to Bill Clinton. Most Americans thought stewardship of the economy should change: Clinton beat an incumbent president, George HW Bush. More than 30 years later, under Joe Biden, the post-Covid recovery seems on track. Unemployment is low, the Dow at all-time highs. That should bode well for Biden but the key question is whether enough Americans think the economy is strong, or think it is working for them in particular. It seems many do not. Cost-of-living concerns dominate public polling, inflation remains high. Republican threats to social security and Medicare might offset such worries \u2013 hence Biden (and indeed Donald Trump) seizing on any hint that a Republican candidate (see, Nikki Haley) might pose a threat to such programmes. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Equality Ron DeSantis made attacks on LGBTQ+ rights a hallmark of his attempt to \u201cMake America Florida\u201d. The hardline governor\u2019s tanking campaign suggests how well that has gone down but Republican efforts to demonise all forms of so-called \u201cwoke\u201d ideology should not be discounted. There have been tangible results: anti-trans legislation, book bans and restrictions on LGBTQ+ issues in education, the end of race-based affirmative action in university admissions thanks to the conservative-packed supreme court. Continuing struggles on Capitol Hill over immigration, and Republicans\u2019 usual focus on crime in major cities, show traditional race-inflected battles will play their customary role on the campaign trail, particularly as Trump uses extremist \u201cblood and soil\u201d rhetoric in front of eager crowds. On the Democratic side, meanwhile, a distinctly worrying sign: Black and Hispanic support for Biden is no longer such a sure thing. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Abortion High-ranking Democrats are clear: the party will focus on Republican attacks on abortion rights, from the Dobbs v Jackson supreme court ruling that struck down Roe v Wade last year to the forthcoming mifepristone case, draconian bans in Republican states and candidates\u2019 support for such bans. For Democrats, it makes tactical sense: the threat to women\u2019s reproductive rights is a rare issue on which the party polls very strongly and has clearly fuelled a series of electoral wins, even in conservative states, since Dobbs was handed down. Trump, however, clearly also recognises the potency of the issue \u2013 while trying to dodge responsibility for appointing three justices who voted to strike down Roe. Haley and DeSantis have tried to duck questions about their records and plans on abortion. Whoever the Republican candidate is, they can expect relentless attacks. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Foreign policy The Israel-Gaza war presents a fiendish proposition for Biden: how to satisfy or merely mollify both the Israel lobby and large sections of his own party, particularly the left and the young more sympathetic to the Palestinians. Proliferating protests against Israel\u2019s pounding of Gaza and the West Bank show the danger of coming unglued from the base. A recent Capitol Hill hearing, meanwhile, saw Republicans claim a political victory with the resignation of the president of the University of Pennsylvania over alleged antisemitism amid student protests for Palestinian rights. Elsewhere, Biden continues to lead a global coalition in support of Ukraine in its fight against Russia but further US funding is held up by Republicans seeking draconian immigration reform, some keen to abandon Kyiv altogether. Throw in the lasting effects of the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan (teed up by Trump but fumbled by Biden), questions about what the US should do should China attack Taiwan, and the threat Trump poses to US membership of Nato, and heavy fire on foreign policy is guaranteed throughout election year. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Democracy If Biden is happy to be seen as a protector of democracy abroad, he is increasingly keen to stress the threat to democracy at home. After all, his most likely opponent refused to accept the result of the 2020 election, incited the deadly attack on Congress of 6 January 2021, has been linked to plans to slash the federal government in a second term, and has even said he wants to be a \u201cdictator\u201d on day one. Trump will no doubt maintain the lie that his 2020 defeat was the result of electoral fraud as various criminal cases proceed towards trial, 17 of 91 state and federal charges concerning election subversion. For Biden, the issue has been profitable at the polls. DeSantis and Haley, though, must dance around the subject, seeking not to alienate Trump supporters. The New York Times sums up their responses, dispiritingly, thus: DeSantis \u201chas signed restrictions on voting rights in Florida, and long avoided questions about 2020\u201d; Haley \u201csaid Biden\u2019s victory was legitimate, but has played up the risk of voter fraud more broadly\u201d. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Climate If Trump threatens US democracy, the climate crisis threatens the US itself. From forest fires to hurricanes and catastrophic floods, it is clear climate change is real. Public polling reflects this: 70% of Americans \u2013 strikingly, including 50% of Republicans \u2013 want meaningful action. But that isn\u2019t reflected in Republican campaigning. Trump says he doesn\u2019t believe human activity contributes to climate change, nor that climate change is making extreme weather worse, and is opposed to efforts to boost clean energy. Haley does believe humans are causing climate change and making weather worse, but worked for Trump as UN ambassador when the US pulled out of the Paris climate deal and opposes clean energy incentives. DeSantis is closer to Trump \u2013 and wants to end regulation of emissions. Biden\u2019s record on climate may be criticised by campaigners but his record in office places him firmly against such Republican views."

            "date": "2024-01-15T20:35:03Z",
            "content": "Iowa Republicans braved brutally cold temperatures on Monday evening to participate in the state\u2019s presidential caucuses, as Donald Trump remains the clear frontrunner in the race for his party\u2019s nomination. The caucuses began at 7pm CT and marked the first round of voting in the 2024 presidential primary. They will offer the most tangible insight yet into whether any of Trump\u2019s primary opponents, particularly the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, and the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, have managed to diminish his significant polling advantage in the race. Trump has maintained that advantage for months, even as he has been charged with 91 felony counts across four criminal cases. Despite his legal liabilities, Trump still appears well ahead of his fellow Republican candidates in Iowa. According to the latest Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom poll, Trump has the support of 48% of likely Republican caucus-goers, putting him nearly 30 points ahead of Haley at 20%. DeSantis trailed in third place, winning the support of 16% of likely caucus-goers. The other three Republican candidates \u2013 the entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, the former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson and the businessman Ryan Binkley \u2013 languished in the single digits. If polls are accurate, Trump may secure the largest margin of victory in the history of the Iowa Republican caucuses by outperforming Bob Dole\u2019s 13-point win in 1988. The Iowa Republican party announced that it will post results online for the state\u2019s 99 counties. On Monday, the candidates held last-minute events to whip up voters and hopefully increase turnout despite the treacherous winter weather. Trump, for his part, attacked his GOP rivals. He called Haley a \u201cglobalist Rino\u201d (Republican in name only) and DeSantis \u201cMaga-lite\u201d and said votes for Ramaswamy were \u201cwasted\u201d. \u201cNikki is a Globalist RINO, backed by American\u2019s for Chinese Growth, the Charles Koch con job. It\u2019s not going to happen for her, or DeSanctimonious! Vivek Votes are wasted, should come to \u2018TRUMP.\u2019 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. Iowa voters said their top issues were the economy, border security and foreign policy. Despite fears for the future of democracy, Trump supporters said they still believed the 2020 election was stolen and the court cases against Trump would backfire. Polls showed that Trump support could grow if he is indicted. But supporters of other candidates in the Republican contest said they were sick of Trump\u2019s chaos and wanted to move forward. Some voters were still undecided earlier on Monday, and attended events to hear from candidates they might vote for. Caucus captains who volunteer to whip votes for their preferred candidates worked to sway voters to their side at precincts throughout the state on Monday night, a unique feature of Iowa\u2019s caucus (and one typically illegal at polling places in other states). The final results depend on turnout, which on Monday seemed stronger than expected despite the weather. After a blizzard swept through Iowa on Friday, many roads remained covered in snow as temperatures dropped well below freezing. Trump acknowledged on Saturday that he was concerned about the weather affecting caucus turnout but expressed confidence in his supporters\u2019 dedication. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be cold. It\u2019s not going to be pleasant,\u201d DeSantis said at a campaign event in West Des Moines on Saturday. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to brave the elements and be there for the couple hours that you have to be there, if you\u2019re willing to do that and you\u2019re willing to fight for me on Monday night, then as president I\u2019ll be fighting for you for the next eight years.\u201d Even as the National Weather Service warned of \u201clife-threatening\u201d cold, Iowa voters largely shrugged off questions about how they would reach their caucus sites. \u201cPeople in the country live like this all the time,\u201d said Abbey Sindt, a caucus-goer who attended Haley\u2019s town hall in Ames on Sunday. \u201cSo it\u2019s really not that big of a deal, in my opinion.\u201d Max Richardson, who also attended the town hall, agreed with Sindt, saying, \u201cEveryone\u2019s shoveled out. Everyone\u2019s getting the ice melt down. It\u2019s just a question of, can you get the car there?\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-11T16:00:23Z",
            "content": "Nikki Haley\u2019s difficulty articulating the cause of the civil war \u2013 the war that began in her home state of South Carolina \u2013 has put that issue in the headlines just days before the first votes are cast in the Republican nomination contest. While Haley was caught trying to be too clever by half in refusing to name slavery as the cause of the nation\u2019s bloodiest conflict, the controversy has had the unintended effect of framing what is facing the country\u2019s voters in 2024. This year\u2019s election is, in fact, a continuation of the unresolved question of the civil war era: will the country continue to move towards fostering a multiracial democracy, or will it aggressively reject its growing diversity and attempt to make America white again? Haley\u2019s entire career has consisted of trying to walk the tightest of tightropes. She is a woman of color operating in a political party whose driving forces are white racial resentment and misogyny (and, increasingly, homophobia and transphobia). On the one hand, she is eagerly embraced as a high-profile party symbol who serves as a strong rebuttal to accusations of racism and sexism (\u201cSee, we\u2019re not racist and sexist, we have a woman of color as our governor!\u201d). On the other hand, white racial resentment serves as fuel for the Trump movement to the extent that no presidential candidate can hope to win the nomination without bending a knee to the Confederate cause. This high-wire act was most prominently on display in 2015, when a white man who had proudly posed with pictures of the Confederate flag walked into the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina, declared, \u201cYou rape our women. And you\u2019re taking over our country. And you have to go,\u201d and proceeded to murder nine Black people. That tragedy was too much even for most defenders of the Confederate flag, and Haley and the state\u2019s political leadership begrudgingly capitulated to years-long demands to stop flying that flag over statehouse grounds. The current conundrum is important not just because of Haley, who is emerging as Trump\u2019s strongest competitor in the Republican field, but because of what it reveals about politics in this country in general and in the Republican party in particular. Boiled down to its essence, much of the country \u2013 and most of the Republican voters \u2013 are still fighting the cause of the civil war in ways both literal and figurative. The active and organized resistance to removing Confederate statues led a mob of white nationalists to march through the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 chanting \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d; one Hitler-loving member of the crowd gunned his car into a group of counterprotesters, killing a woman, Heather Heyer, who had come to stand for racial tolerance and peace. That was the protest of which then president Trump observed: \u201cThere are good people on both sides.\u201d While it is fairly widely accepted now that Trump has a stranglehold on the Republican party, many have forgotten what propelled him to his current position of seemingly unshakable dominance. In the month before launching his presidential bid in June of 2015, Trump was largely seen as a joke and languished in the polls with support from just 4% of his party. After he staked out his position as defender of white people and demonizer of Mexican immigrants (\u201cthey\u2019re rapists, they\u2019re murderers\u201d), he zoomed to the top of the polls and has never looked back. For all the talk of the Trump phenomenon being unprecedented, the truth is that he is not the first political leader to ride a wave of white racial resentment to high levels of political influence and power. In the 1960s, when Trump was in his 20s, the nation watched the Alabama governor, George Wallace, proudly proclaim \u201cSegregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\u201d in his 1963 inauguration speech (delivered from the same spot where Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy, took office). Six months later, Wallace physically stood at the door of the University of Alabama auditorium to block the desegregation of Alabama\u2019s colleges and universities. That defiant embrace of white supremacy boosted Wallace\u2019s national standing to the extent that he launched a presidential campaign in 1968 that attracted millions of voters. Wallace\u2019s presidential bid was preceded by that of Strom Thurmond, who held the same office that Haley later did \u2013 governor of South Carolina. In 1948, after President Harry Truman had the temerity to urge Congress to outlaw lynching Black people, Thurmond joined forces with his fellow southern governors to create the Dixiecrat party and ran for president on a platform unapologetically stating that \u201cWe stand for the segregation of the races.\u201d Thurmond\u2019s third-party bid won four states outright: Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana and, oh look!, South Carolina. The centrality of white racial resentment to American politics is longstanding and explains the panic that caused Haley to become so tongue-tied. As the former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, until Wednesday Haley\u2019s competitor for the anti-Trump mantle, explained in the wake of Haley\u2019s comments: \u201cIf she is unwilling to stand up and say that slavery is what caused the civil war \u2026 what\u2019s going to happen when she has to stand up against forces in our own party who want to drag this country deeper and deeper into anger and division?\u201d If the size and power of the constituency that will brook no retreat on the cause of the Confederacy is so large that a leading presidential candidate can\u2019t even state the simple fact that the civil war was about slavery, then the stakes in 2024 should be crystal clear. One party is propelled and dominated by voters who, essentially, want America to be a white country. On the other side is an incumbent president who just last week specifically namechecked and denounced \u201cthe poison of white supremacy\u201d in a speech delivered from the pulpit of the same church where parishioners were murdered in 2015. The good news is that the portion of the population that wants America to be a white nation is not the majority of people. (That\u2019s why the Confederates had to secede in the first place, after failing to win popular support at the polls.) The challenge for those who know why the civil war started and who want to continue the journey towards multiracial democracy is to organize, inspire and galvanize that majority in the upcoming elections. To do that, we need to do what Nikki Haley can\u2019t or won\u2019t \u2013 state clearly why the civil war started, declare our determination to finish the job of reconstructing this nation and do everything we can to ensure massive voter turnout in November. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 January 2024 to make clear that in 2015 the confederate flag was removed from statehouse grounds. The main photo was also changed to show this. An earlier version said the flag was removed from the capitol and showed a picture of it flying from the building\u2019s dome. This change, however, happened in 2000. \u2022 Steve Phillips is the founder of Democracy in Color, and author of Brown Is the New White: How the Demographic Revolution Has Created a New American Majority and How We Win the Civil War: Securing a Multiracial Democracy and Ending White Supremacy for Good"

            "date": "2024-01-11T17:28:57Z",
            "content": "The head of the SVR, Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, has claimed that the US is planning to interfere in the re-election campaign of Vladimir Putin, saying Russian graduates of US education programmes could be mobilised to serve as a potential \u201cfifth column\u201d. Sergei Naryshkin, the Russian spymaster, said that the US planned to \u201cactivate\u201d Russians graduates of the Fulbright, Summer Work Travel, high-school Flex and other exchange programmes to \u201creplace the non-systemic opposition that fled en masse to the west and become the core element of the fifth column\u201d. Russia has largely banned its education exchange programmes with the US since relations soured in the early 2010s, but Naryshkin\u2019s remarks as carried by an SVR press release indicate for the first time that former Russian exchange students, who number more than 80,000, could be seen as a potential security threat. \u201cIt is obvious that on the eve of the presidential elections in Russia, Americans are seizing on the slightest opportunity to \u2018shake up\u2019 the internal political situation in our country,\u201d said Naryshkin. \u201cApparently, the time is not far off when the state department will take control of the pupils of Anglo-American kindergartens and schools.\u201d Observers have said that the security services are engaged in \u201cspymania\u201d as academics and other researchers tied with foreign governments have been swept up in espionage investigations. At least three scientists involved in Russia\u2019s hypersonic missiles programme have been accused of treason, prompting protests from colleagues and fears that past connections with foreign institutions could attract the attention of the security services. The exchange programmes were once seen as a sign of prestige, and alumni include prominent pro-Kremlin figures such as Margarita Simonyan, the head of state-funded RT (formerly known as Russia Today), who spent time as a high school exchange student in the small town of Bristol, New Hampshire in 1995. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian courts have halted the work of the Anglo-American school of Moscow, established to serve the children of foreign diplomats in the late 1940s, and also banned a longstanding liberal arts partnership between St Petersburg State University and Bard College in New York. The US last year accused the Kremlin of seeking to harass the children of diplomats after it declared the Anglo-American school a \u201cforeign agent\u201d. \u201cFor 74 years the United States and Russia recognised our mutual interest in ensuring both sides\u2019 dependent children were able to access educational opportunities without unnecessary disruption or harassment,\u201d the state department said in a statement. \u201cThe Russian government\u2019s recent actions directly undermined this principle.\u201d Tens of thousands of Russians opposed to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, many involved in opposition politics, independent journalism and NGO work have fled abroad since Putin announced the offensive in February 2022. Since then, the search for enemies of the state in Russia has continued apace, with the Kremlin suggesting the west would try to interfere with Putin\u2019s re-election, widely viewed as a foregone conclusion in a managed contest. Naryshkin\u2019s remarks came after an explosion in treason cases in Russia in 2023, with the independent legal NGO First Department saying that the trend was heavily driven by the war in Ukraine and the security services\u2019 desire to show that it was successfully carrying out its counterintelligence function. \u201cI believe that more than 100 treason cases have been filed this year and their number continues to grow,\u201d said Yevgeny Smirnov, a lawyer for First Department. \u201cThe \u2018threshold of sensitivity\u2019 for the security services is rapidly decreasing and the distribution of news about Ukraine, the transfer of several hundred roubles, or the desire to leave the country began to be recognised as treason. Provocations deserve special attention, because this is a signal that the FSB is [fulfilling quotas] \u2013 [the number of] people sent to camps for treason.\u201d"

            "content": "Finland\u2019s former prime minister Alexander Stubb and the country\u2019s former foreign minister Pekka Haavisto have progressed through to the second round of the presidential elections, knocking out a rightwing populist candidate. With all votes counted, Stubb, of the centre-right National Coalition party, had won 27.2% of votes, while the liberal candidate Haavisto, a member of the Green party who is running as an independent, had secured 25.8%, election officials said. Heading into the vote, experts had thought far-right Finns party candidate Jussi Halla-aho might make it to the second round. In the event, he came third with 19% of the vote. Voter turnout was 74.9%. The high-stakes election \u2013 the first since Finland joined Nato \u2013 to replace two-term president Sauli Niinist\u00f6 saw a record turnout among advance voters. More than 44.6% of those who were able to vote in advance did so, the equivalent of 1.9 million people. \u201cThis is more than I dared to believe,\u201d Stubb, 55, told YLE. \u201cWe made it to the second round. That is now clear,\u201d Haavisto, 65, told the crowd at his election party in Helsinki on Sunday night. \u201cI am very happy and satisfied. We have worked hard for this.\u201d A runoff between the two top candidates will be held in two weeks\u2019 time, on 11 February. To be declared president, the winning candidate must receive more than 50% of votes. After a last-minute surge by Halla-aho, liberals had feared there could be two rightwing candidates in the second round. But early results suggested that was unlikely. \u201cI am concerned, but now we have to follow the will of the voters,\u201d Haavisto, who would be Finland\u2019s first out gay and Green president, told the Observer on Friday at a campaign event. Taking place against a backdrop of escalating geopolitical drama on the border with Russia, Finland\u2019s first election since joining Nato is seen as the most high-stakes in living memory. The president \u2013 who is head of state and commander-in-chief of the army and is responsible for foreign policy, in cooperation with the government \u2013 represents Finland at Nato summits and in meetings with international leaders, so is seen as crucial to the country\u2019s direction. Stubb, who was prime minister from 2014 to 2015 and has spent eight years in government, told the Guardian on Friday that he came out of political retirement because of Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. He said: \u201cHaving been in government for eight consecutive years and having held all the key portfolios, I felt in 2016 that I had very much done it for God and country, as they say. My plan was not to return to politics, or certainly not to national politics \u2026 but Putin\u2019s attack on Ukraine changed it.\u201d In the current climate, he said, foreign and security policy was \u201cexistential\u201d for Finland, which has closed its entire land border with Russia. After Finland joined Nato in record speed last April, he said the country was entering \u201ca new age in Finnish foreign policy\u201d. He said: \u201cWhen it became evident, right at the beginning of the war, that our path towards the alliance would begin, I felt strongly that this was a new age in Finnish foreign policy and perhaps I could throw my hat into the ring once again.\u201d The election so far has centred largely on international and security issues, including Russia, Ukraine, Gaza, the US elections and Nato membership. But in the past few weeks, debates between the nine candidates had focused more on domestic issues, benefiting the Finns party candidate."

            "date": "2024-01-17T07:10:04Z",
            "content": "China has lodged diplomatic protests with Australia for congratulating the winner of Taiwan\u2019s presidential election, with the Chinese ambassador warning there is \u201cno room at all\u201d for compromise on the \u201csensitive\u201d issue. China\u2019s top envoy in Australia, Xiao Qian, also dashed hopes that the Australian writer Dr Yang Hengjun might be released from custody in a similar manner to the Australian journalist Cheng Lei last year. The ambassador further denied that a Chinese warship had subjected Australian naval divers to dangerous sonar pulses in an incident in Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone in November. He suggested that a Japanese boat was also in the area but did not make any direct accusation against Japan. Xiao made the comments during a two-hour-long press conference held at the Chinese embassy in Canberra on Wednesday. Taiwan was a recurring topic after Saturday\u2019s presidential election and Nauru\u2019s decision on Monday to sever diplomatic relations with the self-governed island that China claims as its own. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Xiao confirmed China had complained about a media release posted on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website that said Australia \u201ccongratulates Dr Lai Ching-te on his victory in the Taiwan elections held on 13 January\u201d. The Dfat statement also offered congratulations to \u201cthe people of Taiwan on the peaceful exercise of their democratic rights\u201d. Xiao said China was willing to be flexible in many areas in the relationship with Australia, including to resolve trade disputes, but the issue of Taiwan was particularly \u201csensitive\u201d. \u201cOn the question of Taiwan, there is no room at all for us to show flexibility or to make compromise,\u201d he said. \u201cI can share within you that through diplomatic channels, we have been communicating with the Australian side; we have made serious representations that we are strongly opposed to such a statement, a statement by a government on China\u2019s local provincial elections.\u201d Xiao reiterated Beijing\u2019s position that Taiwan was a matter of \u201cChina\u2019s internal affairs\u201d and \u201cinvolves China\u2019s core interests\u201d so \u201cexternal forces\u201d should not interfere. Beijing has repeatedly refused to rule out taking Taiwan by force, while the Australian government\u2019s longstanding position is to oppose \u201cany unilateral change to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait\u201d. Xiao also offered the most gloomy public assessment by a Chinese official to date on the prospects for release of Yang, an Australian writer and avowed democracy activist who was detained in China in January 2019 and charged with espionage later that year. Xiao argued Yang\u2019s case was \u201cdifferent in nature\u201d from the case of Cheng, who was released late last year. \u201cTo be honest, I cannot expect that the case would come to such a conclusion likewise.\u201d Yang has previously stated he is \u201c100% innocent of the allegations\u201d and that he \u201cwill never confess to something I haven\u2019t done\u201d. His trial was held in May 2021 but he has still not received a verdict, with the court granting multiple three-month extensions on the deadline for handing down a decision. Yang told supporters last year he was in pain from a large cyst on his kidney and feared dying in Chinese custody. On Wednesday, Xiao confirmed Yang had \u201csome health problems\u201d but argued \u201cthese health problems are not as serious as has been publicly described by his family members\u201d. Pressed on why China would not just deport Yang to solve a lingering obstacle in the Australia-China relationship, Xiao said the case was \u201cstill in the legal process\u201d and \u201cwe need to respect [that] and be a bit patient on this issue\u201d. Xiao was also asked about an incident in mid-November that the Australian government described as an \u201cunsafe and unprofessional\u201d interaction with a Chinese destroyer. The defence minister, Richard Marles, had said that HMAS Toowoomba had stopped to clear fishing nets entangled around its propellers when a Chinese vessel \u201cwas detected operating its hull-mounted sonar in a manner that posed a risk to the safety of the Australian divers who were forced to exit the water\u201d. Marles said medical assessments had found the divers had \u201csustained minor injuries likely due to being subjected to the sonar pulses from the Chinese destroyer\u201d. Xiao said on Wednesday he had \u201cdouble-checked\u201d with defence colleagues in Beijing and they had told him the Chinese naval vessel \u201cdidn\u2019t initiate the so-called sonar against the divers from the Australian side\u201d. \u201cAnd at that moment, there was a third country boat nearby,\u201d he said, naming Japan. \u201cWhether or not there was sonar from the other side, other party, we\u2019re not sure. Perhaps our Australian colleagues can find out really what\u2019s the truth.\u201d A spokesperson for the acting defence minister, Pat Conroy, said: \u201cThe Australian Government conveyed to the Chinese Government our serious concerns and we stand by our position regarding the unsafe and unprofessional conduct by the People\u2019s Liberation Army \u2013 Navy towards HMAS Toowoomba in November.\u201d The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, who travelled to Shanghai and Beijing in November as part of the ongoing push to \u201cstabilise\u201d the relationship with Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, said his government would continue to cooperate with China where it could and \u201cdisagree where we must\u201d. China is due to make a decision by March on whether to remove tariffs on Australian wine."

            "title": "Judges skeptical of Trump\u2019s presidential immunity arguments in election interference case",
            "date": "2024-01-09T17:42:49Z",
            "content": "A federal appeals court on Tuesday signaled it would reject Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to throw out his indictment over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results because it involved actions he took while president, questioning such an expansive view of executive power. The three-judge panel at the US court of appeals for the DC circuit expressed particular skepticism with the position that he had absolute immunity from prosecution as Trump, attending in person, looked on. \u201cI think it is paradoxical to say that his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed allows him to violate criminal law,\u201d the circuit judge Karen Henderson, a George HW Bush appointee, told Trump\u2019s lawyer John Sauer during the roughly 90-minute hearing in Washington. Last year, Trump filed a motion to dismiss the federal indictment brought by the special counsel Jack Smith, which charged the former president with seeking to reverse the 2020 election, including by advancing fake slates of electors and obstructing Congress on 6 January 2021. The motion was rejected by the trial judge, prompting Trump to appeal to the DC circuit. The special counsel sought to bypass the potentially lengthy appeals process by asking the US supreme court to directly intervene, but the nation\u2019s highest court returned the case to the appeals court. Trump\u2019s lawyer John Sauer received a cold response at the DC circuit and was even forced into conceding that presidents did not in fact have absolute immunity, after he acknowledged that presidents who were convicted in impeachment trials could be prosecuted. The questioning came from the circuit judge Florence Pan, who noted incredulously that under Trump\u2019s interpretation, presidents could hypothetically self-pardon, sell military secrets or order assassinations of political rivals. Trump\u2019s lawyer initially sought to dodge the hypotheticals and disputed whether they were examples of \u201cofficial acts\u201d. But he ultimately acknowledged with a \u201cqualified yes\u201d that presidents could be prosecuted if they had been convicted in a Senate impeachment trial first. Pan then closed the trap and pointed out that Sauer\u2019s acknowledgement meant he was conceding there was no absolute immunity for presidents. The circuit judges also cornered Sauer with comments made by Trump\u2019s lawyer during his second impeachment trial, who had argued that senators should acquit Trump for incitement of insurrection because no former office holder was immune from investigation and prosecution. Trump\u2019s lawyer said he disagreed with the characterization of those remarks. Sauer said it referred to Trump being investigated generally, and, in any event, \u201coffice holders\u201d referred to lesser government officials, not the president himself. The mechanics of the panel\u2019s eventual ruling \u2013 despite their skepticism toward Sauer \u2013 remains unclear. Trump\u2019s position has been that all the allegations in the indictment involve official acts he undertook as president that he contends cannot be prosecuted, in contrast to private conduct which he argues can be subject to criminal charges. Henderson questioned whether Trump had been engaging in ministerial or discretionary acts as president, but later raised the possibility of sending the case back to the trial judge to adjudicate on a charge-by-charge basis whether the acts were official or private conduct. While the judges indicated incredulity at Trump\u2019s legal arguments, Trump might still benefit from the hearing. His team\u2019s goal is more about delaying the trial, scheduled to start on 4 March, rather than winning the immunity argument. They\u2019re likely to appeal a loss at the DC circuit to the US supreme court, which could further delay the trial. Trump has made it no secret that his strategy for all his impending cases is to delay, ideally beyond the 2024 election in November, in the hopes that winning re-election could enable him to potentially pardon himself or direct his attorney general to drop the charges. The clear attempt to stave off the looming trial prompted the special counsel, Jack Smith, to attempt a rarely seen move to ask the US supreme court to resolve the presidential immunity question before the DC circuit had issued its own judgment. Prosecutors made it plain in their 81-page court filing that they wanted to leapfrog the lower appeals court because they were concerned that the process \u2013 scheduling hearings and waiting for rulings \u2013 would almost certainly delay the trial date. But when the supreme court declined to hear the matter last month, it remanded the case back to the DC circuit, directing the circuit judges Pan, Henderson and Michelle Childs to issue their own decision first. In the interim, the case against Trump remains frozen. The decision has almost certainly slowed down Trump\u2019s federal election interference case. Even if the DC circuit were to rule against Trump quickly, he can ask the full appeals court to rehear the case, and then has 90 days to lodge his own appeal to the supreme court."

            "date": "2024-01-28T05:46:36Z",
            "content": "Four years ago, Democrats in South Carolina \u2013 and Black Democrats in particular \u2013 effectively cleared the field for Joe Biden\u2019s nomination, ending what might have otherwise been a rowdy primary campaign for the right to face Donald Trump. At a Democratic party dinner on Saturday in Columbia celebrating South Carolina\u2019s new status as the first Democratic primary state, the US president returned to thank them for it, one week before voters head to the polls. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here without the Democratic voters of South Carolina, and that\u2019s a fact,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re the reason I am president. You\u2019re the reason Donald Trump is a defeated former president. You\u2019re the reason Donald Trump is a loser. And you\u2019re the reason we\u2019re going to win and beat him again.\u201d The Democratic National Committee changed its bylaws at Biden\u2019s behest last year to designate South Carolina\u2019s primary as the party\u2019s first nomination contest, rankling Iowa and New Hampshire. Iowa\u2019s botched 2020 caucuses contributed to the change, but party leaders argued that South Carolina\u2019s voters better reflected the racial and economic diversity of the country. That, and Biden plainly wanted to reward his South Carolina supporters. Biden specifically praised James Clyburn, South Carolina\u2019s only Democratic congressman, long a kingmaker in South Carolina politics. \u201cJim is the reason I\u2019m president,\u201d Biden said. Clyburn introduced Biden, quoting Alexis de Tocqueville and citing America\u2019s historical ability to \u201crepair its faults\u201d as a mark of its greatness. Clyburn also read a litany of accomplishments of the Biden administration \u2013 about the rollout of vaccines, the infrastructure bill, student loan forgiveness and the Chips Act \u2013 as an answer to \u201cRussian bots\u201d on social media challenging those accomplishments. \u201cIf you go down I-26 today where it intersects with 126, you\u2019ll see for the first time in decades,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cWhat do we call it? Malfunction Junction being fixed for the first time in decades. If you\u2019re driving from Columbia down I-26 on over to Orangeburg \u2026 you\u2019ll see those four lanes, crowded for years, will soon be six lanes. Why? Joe Biden\u2019s infrastructure bill.\u201d Biden also touted his economic record, with 14m jobs created so far, billions in student loan relief and capping the consumer price for insulin. And he pointedly noted political and economic gains made by Black voters, including a record number of Black women appointed to the federal judiciary, more Black Americans with health insurance and \u201cthe lowest levels of Black unemployment recorded in history\u201d, he said. \u201cThe racial wealth gap is at its lowest level in 20 years.\u201d Biden\u2019s address was also sharply partisan, as might be expected at one of his first actual campaign appearances of the 2024 campaign. \u201cTwo months ago, my team began to work with a bipartisan group of senators to put together the toughest, smartest, fairest border security goal in history, the best one the nation\u2019s ever seen,\u201d Biden said. The bill would fund an additional 1,300 border patrol agents, 375 immigration judges, 1,600 asylum officers and 100 drug detection machines to stop fentanyl smuggling across the south-west border, he said. The law would also give the president legal authorisation to declare an emergency and shut the border down. \u201cIf that bill was a law today, I\u2019d shut down the border right now and fix it quickly,\u201d Biden said. Attendees expressed support for Biden\u2019s posture on the border, and skepticism that Republicans would act. \u201cThe Republicans will not pass this border bill,\u201d said Barbara Cameron, a political activist in Orangeburg county. \u201cThey are the ones making all the noise about the border, but they really do not want to pass the border bill.\u201d Biden likened Trump to Herbert Hoover, one of two presidents who left office with fewer jobs at the end of his term than at its start. He also challenged Trump\u2019s fitness, turning the former president\u2019s tactics back on him. \u201cHave you noticed that he\u2019s a little confused these days? He apparently can\u2019t tell the difference between Nancy Pelosi and Nikki Haley.\u201d Biden\u2019s speech was interrupted three times by protesters \u2013 twice by pro-Palestinian activists and once by a climate activist. All were quickly ejected. While the stakes of the election in November are high, the stakes of the South Carolina Democratic primary are much lower. Dean Phillips, a Democrat from Minnesota who is also running a long-shot campaign for president, acknowledged as much while addressing the audience before Biden\u2019s speech, conceding that 95% of the audience was voting for Biden. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have a first-in-the-nation primary, you need two people on the ballot,\u201d he said. He stopped telling a story about a difficult moment in his father\u2019s life as background chatter swelled. \u201cCan I have your attention for just a minute? We\u2019re all Democrats here,\u201d he said, begging for some silence. Biden\u2019s political headwinds have less to do with partisan challenges than with a general negative sentiment toward his administration, as expressed in polling. Not that this matters to the partisans of South Carolina Democratic politics. \u201cI don\u2019t care about ratings and polling,\u201d said Charleen Smith, a retiree from Columbia. \u201cLook at what he has accomplished. If you look at the list of accomplishments, you\u2019d see how much more we\u2019ve improved. It\u2019s right in front of everybody\u2019s face, if they will open their eyes and read it.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 29 January 2024 to correct a quote from Joe Biden, who referred to Nancy Pelosi and Nikki Haley, not to Hillary Clinton and Nikki Haley as an earlier version said."

            "date": "2024-01-10T23:49:50Z",
            "content": "The former New Jersey governor Chris Christie has suspended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, he announced on Wednesday evening. \u201cIt is clear to me tonight that there is not a path to win the nomination,\u201d he said at a town hall in Windham, New Hampshire. The former New Jersey governor, who also ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in 2016, when he lost out to Donald Trump, has been struggling in the polls for weeks and had failed to qualify for the last GOP debate before Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses kick off the nominating contest of the 2024 race for the White House. He had always stood out as the Republican candidate with the most overtly critical viewpoint of the policies and character of Donald Trump. He has yet to endorse a rival and was heard publicly on an apparent inadvertent \u201chot mic\u201d before he took the stage in New Hampshire predicting that one, almost certainly Nikki Haley, will \u201cget smoked\u201d in the race for the nomination and that a \u201cpetrified\u201d Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, had called him, while a person he was talking to was heard predicting that the struggling DeSantis would not last beyond next week\u2019s Iowa caucuses. Haley and DeSantis are the closest contenders behind the solid frontrunner, Trump. The hot-mic comments were widely heard on a YouTube audio livestream before Christie\u2019s event began, with the audio being cut abruptly after a few seconds. Appearing before a subdued crowd at the town hall event a few moments later, Christie said: \u201cThis race has always been bigger than me.\u201d And he warned the US against re-electing Donald Trump to a second term. \u201cIf we put him back behind the desk at the Oval Office, and a choice is needed to be made about whether to put himself first or you [the public] first, how much more evidence do you need? He will put himself first,\u201d Christie said. He had earlier said that if Trump had been president when Islamist terrorists attacked the US on 9/11, \u201che would have [gone] to the bunker\u201d instead of taking charge to protect the country. Christie said that \u201cthis is a fight for the soul of our party\u201d and \u2013 echoing a campaign message Joe Biden, the Democratic president, has said many times \u2013 he added \u201cand the soul of our country.\u201d He said that if Trump ultimately becomes the Republican nominee, the moment that was going to happen could be traced back to the GOP debate in Milwaukee last August when all the other candidates present \u2013 Trump was absent \u2013 except Christie himself raised their hands when asked if they would still nominate someone if they had a criminal conviction. If Trump became president again, the US \u201cwill remain angry \u2026 remain divided\u201d, Christie said. Christie\u2019s exit removes from the race the only candidate willing to base his campaign on attacking Donald Trump, the former president who faces 91 criminal charges arising from his conduct since entering politics, including his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, as well as provoking multiple civil cases and moves to remove him from the ballot in states including Colorado and Maine. A longtime Trump ally and adviser since endorsing him in 2016, Christie stayed loyal even after Trump nearly killed him with Covid-19, only to turn after Trump incited the deadly attack on Congress of 6 January 2021. In a recent campaign ad, Christie said: \u201cEight years ago when I decided to endorse Donald Trump for president, I did it because he was winning, and I did it because I thought I could make him a better candidate and a better president. Well, I was wrong, I made a mistake.\u201d On the campaign trail, Christie focused on attacking Trump from the debate stage and on campaigning in New Hampshire. Long seen as suspect by hardline Republican voters, largely over his past as governor of an east coast, predominantly Democratic state, he could not make much of an impact. Christie\u2019s failed presidential campaign in 2016 and scandal-tainted record in office \u2013 in 2013, he became embroiled in the Bridgegate scandal over political payback \u2013 also worked against him. In further details of the apparent hot-mic incident, which was widely reported on social media and in US news outlets, Christie was heard saying to an unknown individual: \u201cShe\u2019s going to get smoked, and you and I both know it \u2026 She\u2019s not up to this.\u201d He was assumed to be referring to Haley as he then mentioned fundraising numbers that resemble Haley\u2019s. She is the former governor of South Carolina and formerly the Trump-appointed US ambassador to the United Nations. Christie could then be heard saying \u201cDeSantis called me, petrified\u201d and an unknown person responding that DeSantis is \u201cprobably getting out after Iowa\u201d. Christie had not, immediately after announcing his campaign suspension, commented on the hot-mic incident."

            "date": "2024-01-27T04:06:07Z",
            "content": "The pro-Taiwan leader of the Pacific islands nation of Tuvalu, Kausea Natano, has lost his seat according to partial election results. The vote is being closely watched by Taiwan, China and the United States, amid speculation the micronation could be poised to switch diplomatic recognition to Beijing. Tuvalu, with a population of about 11,200 spread across nine islands, is one of three remaining Pacific allies of Taiwan, after Nauru cut ties this month and switched to Beijing, which had promised more development help. Kausea Natano had pledged to continue support for Taiwan, a diplomatic ally since 1979. Another leadership contender, Seve Paeniu, has said diplomatic ties should be reviewed, with the new government deciding whether Taiwan or China can best respond to Tuvalu\u2019s needs. Results for the electorate of Funafuti released on Saturday on a Tuvalu TV showed Natano did not retain his seat. He could not immediately be reached for comment, reports Reuters. Paeniu was returned unopposed in the Nukulaelae island electorate, and said he will seek to form a coalition among elected lawmakers to run for prime minister. There are no political parties in Tuvalu\u2019s parliament, where two lawmakers are elected in each of eight island electorates. The diplomatic tussle between Taiwan and China comes amid a wider contest for influence in the Pacific between China and the US, with Washington recently pledging the first submarine cable to connect Tuvalu to global telecommunications. Paeniu told Reuters on Saturday the issue of diplomatic recognition of Taiwan or China should be debated by the new government. \u201cOur last government under prime minister Natano had extensive internal discussions about it upon the commencement of our term in government to determine our policy stance on it, so undoubtedly the new government would need to look at the matter and decide its policy position accordingly,\u201d he said. Taiwanese ambassador to Tuvalu Andrew Lin recently dismissed the idea of a potential switch, telling AFP the two allies enjoyed a \u201cvery long-term friendship\u201d that would endure beyond the election. Reacting to the partial results, Taiwan\u2019s foreign ministry said its understanding was that most of those elected \u201csupport the maintenance of the friendship between the two countries\u201d. The ministry said it would pay close attention to post-election developments and continue to deepen friendship and cooperation with newly elected members of parliament to ensure stable relations, said Reuters. Tuvalu\u2019s election commissioner Tufoua Panapa said on Friday evening after polling booths closed that the new lawmakers will meet next week to vote for a prime minister, at a time notified by the governor general. \u201cWe will have a clearer picture by next week \u2013 as we need to bring elect-MPs to the capital island, from the outer-islands,\u201d he said. The boat journey can take up to 27 hours. Another leadership contender, Enele Sopoaga, was still waiting for results. Sopoaga previously supported Taiwan ties, but wants a security deal with Australia to be scrapped. Former foreign minister Simon Kofe, who attracted global headlines in 2021 when he delivered a speech to the United Nations climate change summit standing knee-deep in water to highlight the plight of the low-lying nation, has retained his seat in parliament for Funafuti. Australia\u2019s foreign minister Penny Wong said the country looked forward to working with the new Tuvalu government. \u201cAustralia and Tuvalu are longstanding friends, sharing an interest in building a stronger, more resilient and more peaceful Pacific,\u201d she said in a statement on social media. There are only a little over 6,000 registered voters in the country. It\u2019s understood votes are still coming in from the atolls of Vaitupu and Nukufetau. With Reuters and Agence France-Presse"

            "date": "2024-01-04T10:18:00Z",
            "content": "Serbia\u2019s opposition is doubling down on its campaign to challenge the legitimacy of last month\u2019s elections, after full results gave the ruling party a large win in a parliamentary vote. Data released by the election commission on Wednesday showed President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107\u2019s Serbian Progressive party (SNS) won 46.75% of the vote, while a pro-European opposition coalition, Serbia Against Violence, got 23.66%. Serbia held the snap election, along with local elections, on 17 December, but government critics said the vote was fraudulent \u2013 in particular in Belgrade, where opposition politicians argue they would have won the city assembly election in a fair race. The election commission\u2019s numbers \u201cproved that captured institutions in our country are being abused [with the aim of] whitewashing of the electoral fraud and major stomping on the will of our people\u201d, said Borko Stefanovi\u0107, the deputy president of the Party of Freedom and Justice, part of the Serbia Against Violence coalition. Concerns about how the elections were conducted prompted several politicians to go on hunger strikes and fuelled tense protests in late December, with at least 38 people detained. An international observation mission also concluded that Serbia\u2019s elections took place under \u201cunjust conditions\u201d. But opposition politicians say they are not giving up and insist the vote \u2013 especially in the capital \u2013 must be re-run. \u201cSince our coalition has won in Belgrade, Vu\u010di\u0107\u2019s regime is now trying to cover it and to use the silence of our western partners,\u201d said Stefanovi\u0107. \u201cThis shall not pass.\u201d Opposition groups and domestic observers claimed a significant number of people who live outside the capital arrived to vote in the city. The ruling SNS won 49 seats in the 110-seat city assembly, while Serbia Against Violence took 43 seats, according to the city\u2019s electoral commission. But observers at the Center for Research, Transparency and Accountability watchdog said they had \u201cidentified instances of organised transportation of voters, supervised voting, [and] possible identity manipulation of voters in 71 polling stations, or 14% of polling stations in Belgrade\u201d. The opposition says people should be given another chance to vote. \u201cWe and the people are asking that the 17 December elections be annulled and to have new elections, especially in Belgrade, where the rigging process was most evident and proven,\u201d said Stefanovi\u0107. \u201cWe will continue with peaceful protests,\u201d he added, saying the opposition expected the EU \u201cto support their own and OSCE [Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe] recommendations for free and fair elections in Serbia\u201d. Vladimir Obradovi\u0107, the opposition\u2019s candidate for Belgrade mayor, said the protests would continue on a weekly basis and the opposition would continue to try to lever pressure through \u201cdiplomatic efforts\u201d. He emphasised that Serbia needed the international community to weigh in. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the institutions that work, and that may be the major problem, because if you give all the evidence and everything to the court, and there is no reaction from that side \u2013 that\u2019s why we need some sort of international monitoring and mediation to help.\u201d Vu\u010di\u0107 has rejected allegations of election fraud, called demonstrators \u201cthugs\u201d and claimed that the west was encouraging the protests. Serbia\u2019s government thanked Russia for tipping it off in advance of protests, and the president pointedly discussed the demonstrations in a meeting with the Russian ambassador in Belgrade. Vu\u010di\u0107\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. Dobrica Veselinovi\u0107, a member of the Green-Left Front, part of the Serbia Against Violence coalition, said the government\u2019s critics did well, given the circumstances. \u201cIn a very unequal, dirty and difficult campaign, [the] opposition still managed to achieve a decisive and good result,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must bear in mind that if there was not so much theft and selective electoral engineering from the side of government, which the international observation mission and civil society organisations talked about \u2013 in Belgrade [the] opposition would have won,\u201d he added. \u201cNow, with the help of citizens which are protesting in Serbia on the streets and partners from Europe, we have to fight for the annulment of these elections.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-18T06:07:08Z",
            "content": "China conducted joint combat patrols around Taiwan on Wednesday, in a potential resumption of military intimidation after Taiwan\u2019s presidential election last weekend. But analysts say the reaction from China\u2019s ruling Communist party has been relatively muted so far, despite the success of Taiwan\u2019s ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP) \u2013 which Beijing loathes as \u201cseparatists\u201d \u2013 in retaining the presidency. On Thursday morning Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry reported the People\u2019s Liberation Army had sent 24 planes and five navy vessels into Taiwan\u2019s air defence identification zone in the previous 24 hours, the first incursion of significant size since November. The air and sea craft conducted joint patrols including crossing the unofficial maritime border, the median line, it said. The patrol followed the shock announcement on Monday that the government of Nauru was severing ties with Taiwan and switching recognition to China, the 10th diplomatic ally of Taiwan that Beijing has managed to flip since the DPP and president Tsai Ing-wen won the 2016 election. Beijing has also issued angry statements to other governments that congratulated president-elect Lai Ching-te on his win. English-language state media, especially the hawkish Global Times tabloid, has run dozens of negative articles and editorial pieces about the election. However, beyond these incidents, Beijing\u2019s reaction to the election has been relatively muted, approaching nowhere near the scale of its previous outbursts over particular acts by Taiwan, such as the visit of then US House speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, or the US meeting between Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi\u2019s successor, Kevin McCarthy. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty positive start to this period, but I think we still need to see what will happen, it\u2019s a very interactive situation,\u201d said Amanda Hsiao, a Taipei-based senior China analyst with the International Crisis Group. China engaged in influence operations ahead of Taiwan\u2019s vote, but visibly reduced its military activity, which analysts had linked to a perception that any threatening activity would probably bolster the pro-sovereignty DPP. Analysts also pointed to recent significant improvements in the China-US relationship. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Beijing just decided to, there\u2019s been a concerted attempt by Washington and Taipei to signal continuity and to lower the temperature,\u201d said Hsiao. \u201cA key factor for why China\u2019s response has been measured, perhaps the most important, is that they don\u2019t want to tear up the gains made in improving US-China relations.\u201d Inauguration looms However, a stronger response may come when Lai is inaugurated in May. Ja-Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore, said there was likely to be increased pressure from Beijing in the lead up, as it \u201cprobably wants to see how much it can get Lai to concede and then to hold him to their interpretations of those concessions\u201d. Lai is not expected to deliver what Beijing wants, which would effectively be a reversal of the DPP\u2019s platform of resisting China\u2019s claims and promoting Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty. \u201c[Beijing] often waits for a justification for its actions, and we know Lai is going to give them that because he\u2019s not going to say what they want him to say,\u201d said Hsiao. \u201cThat alone means Beijing will have something to point to if they want to point to something to justify a larger response.\u201d But Hsiao said the size and intensity of that response shouldn\u2019t be assumed, and would depend on how Beijing, Taipei, and Washington communicate and interact in the lead-up. Chong said Beijing would probably try to test or goad Lai into a provocation after his inauguration. \u201cThe PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China] is probably going to see if they can force Lai into making a mistake or frustrating him into making a rash move, which they can then paint as Lai being provocative and seek international agreement on.\u201d \u2018A continuation, if not intensification\u2019 The election result was closely watched inside China, and the DPP\u2019s lack of a mandate in both the presidential and legislative votes prompted increased discussion about winning over Taiwanese people through non-violent means, while still preparing for a military intervention. An increasing majority of Taiwan\u2019s population rejects the prospect of Chinese rule, but the minority win allowed China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office to argue on Sunday that the DPP \u201cdoes not represent the mainstream public opinion on the island\u201d. On Monday parts of a 2022 speech by China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, who has previously described unification of Taiwan with China as a \u201chistorical inevitability\u201d, were newly published in state media, urging CCP workers to do better at winning the hearts and minds of Taiwanese people, and to \u201cdevelop and strengthen the patriotic, pro-unification forces in Taiwan, [and] oppose the separatist acts of \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019.\u201d Chong said: \u201cAt face value, the Xi speech suggests a continuation, if not intensification, of cognitive, psychological, economic, and political pressure in the form of isolating Taiwan, co-opting entities and individuals in Taiwan, placing pressure on Taiwanese businesses, disinformation, and the like.\u201d In an article published the day after the vote, Zheng Yongnian, a professor of international relations at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, wrote: \u201cthere is a need to actively win over the new forces of Generation Z \u2026 to promote the resolution of the Taiwan issue in the new era, we must pay attention to innovative cross-strait communication platforms, focusing on the use of new media platforms such as Xiaohongshu and Douyin, to circulate and change the identity of young people in Taiwan\u201d. In recent years, there has been a growing concern in some circles that the popularity of Chinese social media apps among young Taiwanese is influencing generation Z into a more pro-Chinese worldview."

            "title": "Taiwan\u2019s election result is a triumph for democracy \u2013 and a thorn in Beijing\u2019s side | Michelle Kuo",
            "date": "2024-01-14T16:08:53Z",
            "content": "On a gorgeous, sunny Saturday, Taiwan held its presidential election: 14 million people, or 72% of eligible voters, turned out to vote \u2013 my elderly parents among them. As with many families in Taiwan, ours is politically divided along generational lines, and we\u2019ve had our share of screaming matches. But somehow, on voting day, we were at peace. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d I said, snapping a photo. And I meant it. We live in a democracy, and we all appreciate it. Afterwards, we lunched at a spot that had a particularly excellent three-cup chicken \u2013 and then, ice-cream. My story is far from unique. My social media feed was filled with friends whose multigenerational families \u2013 many of whom disagreed with each other \u2013 travelled to the polls together. Later that day, we learned that Taiwan\u2019s Democratic Progressive party (DPP) had scored an unprecedented third consecutive win. In 1996, the first year that Taiwan held presidential elections, it would have been unthinkable that this party of subversives and underdogs would become the political establishment. Its members were freedom fighters who founded the DPP under martial law in 1986, and were frequently arrested on charges of sedition or subversion. In prison, they read Nelson Mandela and penned manifestos calling for free and fair elections. After Taiwan ended martial law in 1987, these formerly incarcerated activists ran for office across Taiwan \u2013 and won. In a world gone mad, Taiwan\u2019s story is indisputably, heartbreakingly hopeful. According to the nonprofit Freedom House, Taiwan is the sixth most free country in the world \u2013 above France and the US. It has legalised same-sex marriage, making it a haven for queer people across Asia. It boasts one of the highest rates of female participation in the legislature. It has universal healthcare and affordable public transport. The DPP holds on to a vision of Taiwan that is genuinely multicultural and multilingual. This is a giant thorn in Beijing\u2019s side, because Taiwan shows that democracy works. One of the Chinese Communist party\u2019s central claims is that democracy is incompatible with Chinese-speaking societies. But Taiwan\u2019s very existence undermines that claim. On the surface, the result is a smashing victory for the DPP. But a closer analysis of the numbers reveals a narrow victory. Had the Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People\u2019s party (TPP) \u2013 the two losing parties \u2013 formed an alliance, the DPP would not have won. The DPP lost its majority in the legislature, which means that it will have a tough four years moving its policy agenda forward. The party must learn from the closeness of this election. Its greatest failure in the past eight years has been its inability to address the malaise shared by young people in Taiwan: long working hours, low pay, unaffordable housing, poor protection for renters, and a growing gulf between the mega-rich and everybody else. It must look beyond economic policy for answers. To young people, the DPP no longer seems anti-establishment. As Freddy Lim, a heavy metal rocker turned legislator, told the Guardian, the party needs to reconnect with its radical roots. \u201cTaiwan in Asia is a revolutionary country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very rebellious.\u201d That rebellious history is forged through its links to social movements, whose victories will seem astonishing, no matter where you\u2019re from. Let me paint a brief picture. From 1987 to the early 2000s, farmers, fishers and rural people living in the poorest parts of the country marched in protest against the construction of petrochemical factories on their land, and succeeded in the majority of cases. In 2003-04, the \u201crice bomber\u201d, a rural farmer whose livelihood was devastated by a World Trade Organization agreement, planted bombs around Taipei. He was sentenced to more than seven years in prison. Farmers and their advocates rallied to get him a pardon; he got pardoned. In 2012, Indigenous activists walked for 17 days, their leader barefoot, to stop a mega hotel from being constructed on their coastline. They succeeded. Five years later, activists protested over mining on Indigenous land. They also succeeded. And in 2014, college students launched the revolutionary Sunflower movement, occupying the legislature in protest over a secretive trade pact with China. Half a million people showed up on the streets to support them. Together, they stopped the bill. These provide just a glimpse of the movements led by Taiwan\u2019s marginalised and powerless people, which were in turn mobilised and co-opted by the DPP to extraordinary effect. Yet today, the DPP, which originated as a social movement against martial law (the movement\u2019s name, dangwai, literally translates to \u201coutside the party\u201d), is now entering its third consecutive term. It is an establishment party with a radical history. Its challenge is to reach beyond itself, working with the opposition while also daring to take risks that win the hearts of young people. It should pay attention to politicians who are extremely popular with young people, among them the new vice-president Hsiao Bi-khim and the first out lesbian Taipei city council member, Miao Poya, who lost in a tough district. And it must craft an agenda that appears fresh and meaningful, while continuing to battle China\u2019s cognitive and economic warfare. But for a brief moment, we will celebrate the accomplishments of Taiwanese democracy: a peaceful transition of power, with graceful concession speeches, transparent voting and efficient procedures. For now, this civil society has withstood polarisation and preserved its hard-won freedom. It\u2019s a place where families can go to the polls, and eat ice-cream together afterwards.

            "date": "2024-01-16T06:55:17Z",
            "content": "The Republican race for the 2024 presidential nomination began with a surprisingly large field but rapidly winnowed down. Voters flocked to the Iowa caucuses \u2013 the first contest in the process \u2013 on Monday. In a US election, Republican and Democrats hold contests in each state to decide who their nominee will be in the presidential election in November. The winner in each state gets delegates who vote at the party conventions in the summer to choose their nominee. The state elections are usually called primaries with a simple vote, but in some states the election follows a more complex, meeting-based format known as a caucus. The Iowa caucuses were held at 7pm CT on Monday. This year the state\u2019s Republican party were updating the results in realtime, and the result came so quickly, many people had not gathered to caucus by the time it was called. So far the 2024 Republican race has been heavily dominated by former US president Donald Trump, who has had a strong poll lead in Iowa itself, as well as in national surveys. Many experts expect a rerun of the 2020 race with Trump facing off against Democratic incumbent Joe Biden for the White House. The trailing pack of Republican candidates has seen numerous highly regarded figures \u2013 such as former vice-president Mike Pence and South Carolina senator Tim Scott \u2013 drop out. Those remaining split into two distinct groups of those who were (just about) potential rivals to Trump and those who are also-rans. The key candidates dueling it out in Iowa: The favorite Donald Trump The former US president\u2019s campaign to retake the White House and once again grab his party\u2019s nomination got off to a slow start that was widely mocked. But his campaign has steadily moved into a position of dominance and never looked likely to be dislodged from that. Trump declined to attend any of the Republican debates, has used his court appearances and many legal woes as a rallying cry to mobilize his base, and has run a surprisingly well-organized campaign. His extremist rhetoric, especially around his plans for a second term and the targeting of his political enemies, has sparked widespread fears over the threat to American democracy that his candidacy represents. His political style during the campaign has not shifted from his previous runs in 2016 and 2020 and, if anything, has become more extreme. Many see this as a result of his political and legal fates becoming entwined with a return to the Oval Office being seen as Trump\u2019s best chance of nixing his legal problems. The potential rivals Nikki Haley The former South Carolina governor and ex-US ambassador to the United Nations under Trump has mostly hewed a fine line between being an alternative to Trump, while not outraging his base with too much direct criticism. That has paid off as Haley has shone in debates and worked hard on the campaign trail and risen in the polls to give her a shot at coming second in Iowa and causing an upset in New Hampshire \u2013 where she is polling strongly. However, that prominence has now earned Trump\u2019s ire and the two campaigns are openly hurling insults at each other. Ron DeSantis The rightwing Florida governor was widely seen as the most likely rival to Trump but DeSantis has proved a disaster as a campaigner on the national stage. Positioning himself as an extreme culture warrior, DeSantis has run a campaign of hardcore rightwing politics but he himself has proved a serious turnoff to voters. He has failed to use the debate stage to break through and been subject to a brutal months-long assault from Trump and his surrogates as his stiff campaign trail style damaged his standings. The result has been a prolonged tanking in the polls and Haley has largely overtaken him as the main \u201cnon-Trump\u201d candidate. The also-rans Vivek Ramaswamy The entrepreneur and extreme Trump fan had a moment in the sun during the early debates where he briefly seemed to be emerging as someone even Trumpier than Trump \u2013 but with a younger, more dynamic candidacy. That did not last long though as his poll numbers never caught on and his extremist comments generated endless negative press. He failed to qualify for the final debate. Asa Hutchinson Former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson has remained in the race \u2013 but few people would really know why. He has not qualified for recent debates and is not expected to make any meaningful impression in Iowa or nationally and frequently dips below 1% in polls. Hutchinson feels like an older school pre-Trump Republican campaigning in a vastly different age from the one where he carved out a career as a traditional conservative."

            "date": "2024-01-15T19:34:36Z",
            "content": "As Iowa Republicans gather on Monday to choose their presidential candidate, a host of big questions surround the potential return of Donald Trump and the future of democracy in the US. Ongoing court cases against Trump, the frontrunner, loom large. Threats against elections officials and judges in Trump-related cases raise the possibility of political violence in a tense election year. For some Republican voters, the belief that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump remains a core part of their ideology. Trump also faces the prospect of being removed from the ballot over his role in the 6 January insurrection. Legal decisions using the 14th amendment as a basis for removing the former president from the contest will be heard by the US supreme court in February. The former president has vowed to retaliate against his enemies, go after Joe Biden and his family, and weaponize the justice department for his political goals in a second term in office predicted to center around retribution. Trump\u2019s legal liabilities and heated rhetoric are not turning off his base of voters \u2013 they remain steadfast supporters of the Maga movement and think the cases against him are part of a conspiracy to keep him out of office. For voters choosing other candidates, though, the former president\u2019s court woes and penchant for whipping up chaos have turned them off. A poll of likely Republican caucus voters in Iowa found that 61% said their support of Trump would not be affected by a potential criminal conviction before the general election. The NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll says 19% of Republican caucus-goers in Iowa go even further \u2013 they would be more likely to back Trump if he is convicted \u2013 though 18% said the opposite. Jamie Copher, a 52-year-old Trump supporter who works in sales and marketing, voted for the first time in 2020 for Trump because he \u201cran this country like a business\u201d, she said at a rally in Indianola, Iowa. She thinks Biden did not receive 81m legal votes in the 2020 election and that the election was a fraud, but she does not think the 2024 election could be stolen because \u201ctoo many Americans are going to be watching\u201d. (There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election.) \u201cI heard before that they were going to steal the 2020 election and, to be honest with you, I didn\u2019t think any Democrat was smart enough to be able to steal an election and didn\u2019t realise they\u2019ve been stealing elections since pretty much before I was alive. I\u2019ve learned a lot about the election system and I love it so I\u2019m getting more involved locally,\u201d she said. The potential of Trump being removed from the ballot because of the 14th amendment will not prevent Copher from voting for him. \u201cI\u2019m writing that man\u2019s name in and I don\u2019t care if he has a VP or not because I believe he never conceded. He\u2019s still my president.\u201d Cathy Kurtinitis, a 69-year-old Trump supporter, described January 6 as \u201coverblown\u201d and said the 2020 election should have been investigated more than it was, pointing out that Biden did not campaign in person much or draw the crowds Trump did. Asked if she was confident that Trump would beat Biden in 2024, Kurtinitis replied: \u201cApart from the machinations of the deep state, yes.\u201d Trump\u2019s supporters have not been put off by his language in recent months on the campaign trail, where he has vowed to be a dictator for a day after resuming office and called his political opponents \u201cvermin\u201d. Gary Leffler, 62, does not buy in to the notion that Trump would be a dictator. \u201cWell, if he was going to do that he would have done it the first time, so what we say in Iowa is that\u2019s a bunch of hogwash.\u201d For the Republicans who are trying to avoid a Trump return, the concerns around the frontrunner are more of a turn-off. They do not like how his words tend to require clarification after the fact, though they are not always sure if he intends to incite violence or means exactly what he says. And they are looking for a future president who does not bring such baggage, which they see as a distraction, even if they also believe the 2020 election was not fair and the legal cases are politically motivated. The former UN ambassador Nikki Haley\u2019s supporters were more likely to say a conviction would hinder their support of Trump in a general election in the NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll. Haley, seen as likely to place second in Iowa, has more crossover appeal to moderate and independent voters. Some of her supporters in Iowa said they did not believe the 2020 election was stolen and thought those involved in the insurrection were rightly held accountable, but that the court cases against Trump could backfire and only solidify his support. Jim Baker, a 61-year-old from San Diego who came to Iowa to help Haley\u2019s campaign in the final days of the caucus, said he thought Trump lost to Biden, but that Biden had done a \u201cpoor job\u201d as president. The 2024 election should be about finding the right person to lead the country forward, Baker said. \u201cDonald Trump is not that person.\u201d Still, he was not sure if the threat of political violence could come true or if it was more of Trump\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bark,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much bite there is. There\u2019s a lot of bark. Yeah, he loves to bark and he loves to thrive on barking.\u201d Supporters of the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, were less likely to turn against Trump if he is convicted compared with Haley supporters, according to the NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll. Some supporters of DeSantis, who typically polls in third place in the Republican contest, said the prospect of electing Trump again, particularly while he faces ongoing civil and criminal cases, was too risky. Some said they were tired of the Trumpian brand of politics. Kent Christen, a 53-year-old analyst from Cedar Rapids, said the former president was careless when he talks, though he did not think Trump was necessarily telling people to be violent. \u201cI think the issue is there\u2019s not much delta between his brain and his mouth,\u201d Christen said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s more and more difficult these days for people to clean up his message behind him. He gives people too many opportunities. Chaos follows him. He\u2019s like an instrument of chaos. I\u2019m kind of tired of all that. That\u2019s the biggest reason I\u2019m tired of him.\u201d Amy Christen, a Cedar Rapids special education teacher who attended a DeSantis rally this weekend, said she did not think a Trump loss would lead to political violence, but she thought the left could become violent instead. \u201cI will definitely see violence if Biden loses. I don\u2019t know why the left \u2013 we saw the summer of love \u2013 we saw it in Seattle, in Portland, in Kenosha, we\u2019ve seen it in Minneapolis,\u201d she said, referring to the 2020 protests after George Floyd\u2019s murder. \u201cThey\u2019re angry. They\u2019re violent.\u201d"

About 2 billion people have the opportunity to cast their ballots in polls that span the globe from the United States to Taiwan, and India to Mexico in 2024. The outcomes, as our analysts and correspondents explain in our big story, have implications for us all. Washington bureau chief David Smith looks at the likely rerun of 2020\u2019s Biden v Trump contest in November and explores what has changed and what has not in the US as the old adversaries square up. It is an almost foregone conclusion that Narendra Modi will be back for a third term as Indian prime minster, reports Hannah Ellis-Petersen from Delhi where analysts fear his victory will further imperil the country\u2019s Muslim minority. And while Vladimir Putin will certainly continue as president in Russia, Pjotr Sauer explains why the man about to become fifth-time president might allow other candidates onto the ballot list. From Taiwan\u2019s poll on 13 January to the 27-state European elections in June, how citizens vote will influence the geopolitical landscape for us all, while the conduct of campaigns will reveal how vulnerable democracies now are to misinformation and cyber interference from malign actors. Away from the ballot boxes, we look at what other big stories to watch for in 2024 with reports from Amy Hawkins on China\u2019s social and economic travails to another crisis year for the natural world from biodiversity reporters Patrick Greenfield and Phoebe Weston. Our main feature read takes us back to a childhood in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles. Author Darran Anderson reflects on the cost of growing up in Derry, in British-controlled Northern Ireland, and recalls finding relative freedom over the border in the Republic of Ireland. His beautifully written essay discusses how he came first to crave sanctuary and, as an adult, sought it out practically and emotionally in a new life in London. In Culture, Mark Kermode interviews Yorgos Lanthimos ahead of the release of his highly anticipated new film Poor Things. It is the latest collaboration between the Greek director and actor Emma Stone, an adaptation of late Scottish novelist Alasdair Gray\u2019s science fiction, Victorian romantic pastiche. We also meet artists who only got into their stride in later life and find out what\u2019s behind the big band revival in jazz music. And while at Guardian Weekly we aren\u2019t big on making new year resolutions \u2013 or perhaps not so great at sticking to them \u2013 this week\u2019s issue does feature smartphones and fitness, things that many of us want to either renounce or embrace more fully in January. US writer Simar Bajaj considers whether over dependence on smartphones should be considered an addiction and science writer David Cox looks at the potential for developing medication to keep us fit.

            "content": "The ignominious end of Ron DeSantis\u2019s presidential campaign is unlikely to boost Donald Trump\u2019s last challenger, Nikki Haley, to the Republican nomination, according to two New Hampshire polls released on the eve of the primary in the north-eastern state. DeSantis also endured a round of scathing critiques of his campaign which started off being seen as a major source of opposition to Trump. But his White House bid never fully took off and fizzled into failure and a major blow to the rightwing Florida governor\u2019s political reputation. In a poll released on Sunday, the day the hard-right Florida governor contradicted his own Super Pac, Never Back Down, and backed down, NBC News, the Boston Globe and Suffolk University put Trump 19 points clear of Haley, at 55% to 36% support. Ending his campaign, DeSantis looked past months of personal attacks from Trump to offer the twice-impeached, 91-times criminally charged former president \u2013 whose lie about a stolen 2020 election DeSantis has disowned \u2013 his endorsement to face Joe Biden. On Monday, the Washington Post and Monmouth University put Trump at 52% support in New Hampshire, to 34% for Haley. That represented a near-doubling of support for the former South Carolina governor and UN ambassador since November. But, the Post said, that was primarily a result of the withdrawal of Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who campaigned as an anti-Trump candidate. DeSantis had 8% support in the Post-Monmouth poll, which was carried out before he ended his campaign. \u201cIf DeSantis\u2019s supporters in the poll are allocated based on their second choice,\u201d the Post said, \u201cTrump\u2019s support rises by four points while Haley\u2019s increases by two.\u201d On Sunday, Haley staged a rally in New Hampshire with Judy Sheindlin, better known to millions of Americans as Judge Judy, a former Manhattan family court judge made famous by a small claims, arbitration-based TV show. \u201cWhat a crowd, Exeter!\u201d she said. \u201cThe energy on the ground is electric, and it\u2019s clear Granite Staters are ready to make a difference on Tuesday! An extra special thanks to America\u2019s favorite judge, Judge Judy Sheindlin, for joining us! She gets it: this country needs no drama, no chaos, no nonsense \u2013 just results!\u201d But despite such determined boosterism, polling results undeniably show Haley well adrift of Trump in New Hampshire and even further behind in South Carolina, her home state which next month will be the third to vote. According to the polling site FiveThirtyEight.com, Trump leads Haley by 61% to 25% in the southern state. Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said: \u201cI wish I had a dollar for every Republican who\u2019s told me over the last three years, \u2018We\u2019ve learned our lesson. No way will Trump be our nominee again.\u2019\u201d Speaking to CNN, Sabato added: \u201cIf [Haley] loses on Tuesday, it almost certainly marks the end of her run. She may continue through her home state of South Carolina though I think she\u2019d be hesitant to do it because she wouldn\u2019t want to lose her home state. That\u2019s really difficult to explain to people. \u201cBut for all practical purposes, once DeSantis left and once the other candidates were knocked out of the race, it was Trump\u2019s to lose and Trump has to lose significantly and he\u2019s not going to lose it.\u201d DeSantis exited the race with a statement containing both a Churchill quote it turned out Churchill never said and his endorsement of Trump. Sabato was asked about DeSantis\u2019s decision to back Trump after, only last week, attacking Republicans he said had chosen to \u201ckiss the ring\u201d and endorse the former president. \u201cI guess he saw some good examples of ring kissing and decided to imitate it,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cLook, who knows what was going through his mind other than the fact that he certainly wants to run the next time. Now, whether he\u2019ll be credible as a candidate after this disastrous run? Remember, he was supposed to be Trump\u2019s main challenger and most of the establishment in the Republican party was betting on him. And his campaign crashed and burned. \u201cThis was really a disgraceful enterprise in so many different ways. But in [DeSantis\u2019s] mind, at least right now, as he\u2019s coming to terms with the the demise of his dream, he\u2019s thinking about running in 2028. Well, being associated with Nikki Haley is not going to help you, because this party has already become the Donald Trump party or the Maga party and it will be in all likelihood even more so as the years go on.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-15T22:46:47Z",
            "content": "Vivek Ramaswamy, the biotech entrepreneur who has gone all in on Iowa to jumpstart his presidential bid, urged supporters not to believe the polls during a final appearance at a Cedar Rapids brewery hours ahead of Monday night\u2019s caucuses. Ramaswamy has visited all 99 counties in Iowa twice and even rented an apartment in Des Moines during the final stretch of the campaign. He said on Monday he had done nearly 400 events in the state. A final Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa poll on Saturday showed him with the support of 8% of likely Republican caucus-goers, trailing Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley for second place. DeSantis registered support with 16% of likely GOP caucus-goers while Haley had 20%. Trump held a commanding lead of 48% of likely caucus-goers in the poll. \u201cI think what we\u2019ve seen is bordering on a kind of election interference in our GOP primary,\u201d he told about 100 supporters on Monday. He went on to claim that his name wasn\u2019t being included in polls when voters were asked who they support, causing him to register lower levels of support. \u201cI think the media has prebaked a narrative about this race that is disconnected from the reality of where people are on the ground, but does have an effect of shaping what some of those less engaged people who don\u2019t come to events think about the race.\u201d Ramaswamy spoke for 30 minutes and then spent nearly 45 minutes taking questions from attendees on a range of topics, including immigration and gun rights. He also dismissed a last-minute attack from Trump, who urged his supporters over the weekend not to vote for Ramaswamy. \u201cVery sly, but a vote for Vivek is a vote for the \u2018other side\u2019 \u2013 don\u2019t get duped by this. Vote for \u2018TRUMP,\u2019 don\u2019t waste your vote! Vivek is not MAGA,\u201d Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Ramaswamy seemed to suggest the attacks came from Trump\u2019s \u201chandlers\u201d and continued to decline to attack Trump. He emphasized how he has staunchly defended the former president as he has come under attack. \u201cThis system has made clear that they will stop at nothing, I mean nothing, to keep this man away from the White House.\u201d Gerry Dilla, who works in sales in Iowa City and plans to caucus for Ramaswamy, also dismissed Trump\u2019s attacks. \u201cIt\u2019s just more of his BS that I may have to listen to for the next four years.\u201d Several attendees mentioned they had seen him speak previously and thanked him for investing his campaign time in Iowa. Steven Mosnik, a 56-year-old retiree who is supporting Ramaswamy, also said he didn\u2019t believe the polls. \u201cThe polls that I\u2019ve gotten in the mail that I would respond to, they don\u2019t include him,\u201d Mosnik said. \u201cThey take the question and formulate the answer they want. \u201cTrump has a national platform, I mean he\u2019s covered on every news channel every day, multiple times, I mean he\u2019s already got the exposure,\u201d he said. \u201cVivek doesn\u2019t have exposure yet and they actually squash it.\u201d Mosnik was sitting next to Gaylen Vance, who is 68 and also retired, and was still deciding who he was going to support. He was deciding between Ramaswamy, DeSantis and Haley, but said he couldn\u2019t caucus for Trump because of his claims of a stolen election. \u201cAfter Trump, Nikki\u2019s got the best chance to win in the general. DeSantis could be the most like Trump without some of the extraneous crap. And Vivek\u2019s the smartest guy in the room,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be happier with Trump if he could quit denying the election being stolen,\u201d he added. \u201cJanuary 6 or not, he can\u2019t keep claiming that all the way up and trying to win another one or not which he did.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-26T17:18:54Z",
            "content": "You\u2019d think a week spent in the snow and ice of New Hampshire, watching Donald Trump stroll to a double-digit victory over his last remaining Republican rival, would have left me filled with angst about the presidential election in November. Sure enough, given that a second Trump presidency would have a truly disastrous impact on the US and the world, the fact that the now near-certain rematch of Trump and Joe Biden remains a \u201ccoin flip\u201d, in the private assessment of one of America\u2019s foremost electoral analysts, still makes my palms go clammy. But to my surprise, I left the frozen American north-east not hopeful, exactly, but lifted by the thought that Trump is weaker, and Biden stronger, than this week\u2019s headlines \u2013 or the latest polls showing the current president six points behind the previous one \u2013 might suggest. Now when I hear the words \u201ccoin flip\u201d, I react like Jim Carrey\u2019s character in Dumb and Dumber, when told that the odds of him winning over the woman of his dreams are one in a million: \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me there\u2019s a chance.\u201d Of course, the causes for gloom have not gone away. Biden\u2019s age remains the biggest single obstacle to his re-election: even Democrats worry that he might just be too old to serve a second term, which would see him leave his Oval Office desk at the age of 86. Inflation has hurt him: a pair of 18-year-olds at Bedford High School told me they had cast their first vote for \u201cDonald J Trump\u201d, as they reverentially put it, in part because of high petrol prices. And too many voters blame Biden for the fact that \u201cthe world is on fire\u201d, to quote Trump\u2019s challenger, Nikki Haley. They see wars in Ukraine and in Gaza, hear Trump boast that there was no such trouble when he was in charge, and blame Biden. That aversion to overseas conflict, and fear of the US getting sucked in, is now loud in the once hawkish Republican party, but anti-war sentiment among Democrats poses its own danger to Biden. He is struggling to hold his party together. The left, and younger voters especially, are appalled by his support for Israel in its fight against Hamas \u2013 a sentiment that will only harden after the international court of justice\u2019s ruling on Friday demanding that Israel ensures acts of genocide are not committed in Gaza. Young voters were a bedrock for Biden in 2020, but he can rely on them no longer. Those teenagers for Trump I met in Bedford were not the only ones. And yet, there are encouraging signs. In New Hampshire, Trump\u2019s win over Haley was assured by his three-to-one lead among registered Republicans. His overall margin narrowed because she beat him convincingly among undeclared or independent voters, who under New Hampshire\u2019s rules are allowed to take part in a party primary. I spoke to dozens of them, and few were motivated by admiration for the former US ambassador to the UN. On the contrary, their driving purpose was to stop \u201cthat man\u201d, many expressing plain disgust for Trump. In the race for his party\u2019s nomination, those views were easily swept aside by the Maga, or Make America Great Again, majority. But in a general election, independents can make the difference between victory and defeat. That they so heavily rejected Trump \u2013 58% backing Haley \u2013 spells trouble for the former president. Those are voters Biden should be able to win over, but there are seams to mine among dissident Republicans too. In New Hampshire, about 25% of them could not stomach voting for Trump. Even if most Republicans eventually fall in line, it would take only a small slice to defect to Biden or stay home to deny Trump a second term. That may not be so hard to achieve. For the presumptive nominee remains as repellent as ever. His victory speech on Tuesday was a reminder of his talent for obnoxiousness. He humiliated one-time rivals who now back him and, as if setting out to alienate the suburban female voters who often form a decisive swing bloc in US elections, nodded along as the crowd chanted the nickname he\u2019s given Haley \u2013 \u201cbirdbrain\u201d \u2013 while he mocked the outfit she had worn at her own event earlier that evening: \u201cI watched her in the fancy dress that probably wasn\u2019t so fancy.\u201d The macho boor stuff works well inside the Maga bubble, where the devotees love it, but it will do Trump no favours over the course of an exceptionally long general election campaign, which began, in effect, this week and will stretch to November. Paradoxically, Trump may have benefited from his post-6 January spell of enforced exile from most social media platforms, limiting how much Americans saw him. Now the spotlight is back on \u2013 and it is rarely flattering. That is especially true of his multiple and continuing court cases. Among the Republican base, the 91 felony charges against him are a badge of honour, proof that he\u2019s a victim of the liberal deep state; among the wider US electorate, they don\u2019t play so well. Note that even among those who voted for Trump in New Hampshire, 13% believe that, were he convicted of a crime, he would not be fit to be president. A verdict may not come in time for 5 November, but it\u2019s further proof of Trump\u2019s vulnerability. What of Biden\u2019s strength? There was no real Democratic primary in New Hampshire, but there was a challenger, a perfectly competent congressman called Dean Phillips. Even though the president was not on the ballot, he crushed Phillips, thanks to a drive to get Democrats to \u201cwrite in\u201d Biden\u2019s name. That suggests organisational muscle. And he can press at least two issues that have a proven record of winning elections for Democrats. The first is abortion, following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the 2022 Dobbs case to end the constitutional protection of abortion rights. Trump brags that he\u2019s \u201cproud\u201d of that, because it was he who appointed three rightwing judges to the court. But it\u2019s not a popular position. On the contrary, Republicans have repeatedly lost at the ballot box since the court\u2019s ruling, whether in elections or state-level referendums. \u201cDobbs may have broken the Republican party,\u201d says the Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg, who accurately predicted his party\u2019s success in the 2022 midterms and is bullish about Biden\u2019s chances now. The second issue is the core anti-Trump argument: that the man who tried to overturn the 2020 election is a would-be dictator who poses a threat to democracy. Add to that some healthy economic numbers and rising consumer confidence, and you can see the outline of a winning message. To be sure, the messenger remains flawed, though the veteran Republican consultant Mike Murphy thinks there\u2019s a line Biden could use to deal with the age issue, one that would draw the contrast with his opponent: \u201cWe\u2019re both old \u2013 but he\u2019s old and crazy.\u201d There\u2019s peril, too, in third-party candidacies who would split the anti-Trump vote. The point is, no one could possibly be complacent about a Biden victory and Trump defeat in 2024. Like the man said, it\u2019s a coin flip \u2013 but the evidence is telling us there\u2019s a chance.

            "content": "The chief constable of Northamptonshire police will face an accelerated gross misconduct hearing after allegedly misrepresenting his military service, including wearing a medal from a war he did not fight in. Nick Adderley, who served as police chief from August 2018 until he was suspended in October, has been accused of wearing a medal from the Falklands war \u2013 which took place when he was 15. Questions have also been raised about his claims that he rose to the rank of commander in the navy, and that he had served 10 years in the military. The claims were referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which said he should face an accelerated disciplinary hearing. In a statement, the IOPC said its criminal investigation into Adderley was ongoing, and that once concluded it would decide \u201cwhether or not to refer a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider any potential offence\u201d. In July last year it emerged Adderley had worn a Falklands war medal despite only being 15 during the conflict, and had not joined the navy until 1984, two years after it ended. At the time Adderley said the medal belonged to his brother, who had given it to him as a gift. In a statement, he said: \u201cIt is disappointing that someone has leaked such details about what I deem to be a very personal family issue that I have yet to respond to formally. \u201cComing from a military family, I wear all my medals with pride and have always worn the two medals my brothers gave me to wear when one became critically ill and one emigrated, alongside my own.\u201d He said that, following advice, he had changed the side of the chest on which he wore the medals. Royal British Legion guidance says: \u201cThe medals awarded to a deceased service/ex-service person may be worn on the right breast by a near relative.\u201d The NN Journal later reported that Adderley had claimed in his CV, read by the panel appointing him to his role in 2018, that he had served as a commander in the Royal Navy. It has been frequently reported that Adderley served in the navy for a decade, including in a Northamptonshire police press release in February last year, which said he \u201cserved in the Royal Navy for 10 years including the Falklands war\u201d. It has since been claimed he only served two years in the navy. After the allegations came to light, the chief constable was suspended in October while investigations were carried out, and an interim chief constable was installed. A statement from the office of the county\u2019s police, fire and crime commissioner, Stephen Mold, said: \u201cThe IOPC is carrying out an investigation and in a report has assessed, based on the evidence gathered to date, that there is a case to answer for gross misconduct. A hearing will now be convened at the earliest opportunity. \u201cI am now convening an independent panel to consider the allegations.\u201d Adderley became head of the Northamptonshire force in 2018 after joining the police service in 1992 and serving in Cheshire, Greater Manchester and Staffordshire. He has previously made the news on several occasions for causing controversy with some of his social media statements. Adderley has been approached for comment."

            "date": "2024-01-11T11:00:16Z",
            "content": "Jonathan Glover\u2019s new book, on the seemingly intractable nature of the Israel-Palestine conflict, quotes George Orwell on the Spanish civil war: \u201cEverybody believes in the atrocities of the enemy and disbelieves in those of his own side without ever examining the evidence.\u201d This could have been written today, amid bipolar thinking and pressure to take sides, where people\u2019s identification with the facts can reflect their political predilections. Glover wrote the bulk of his study before the recent horrors, though it is published with a foreword addressing them. Not surprisingly, it is still deeply relevant. We have seen these tragic cycles of violence again and again in the past; they continue on an even more horrific scale today. Glover is a philosopher and author of Humanity: a Moral History of the Twentieth Century, which took him 10 years to write and involved careful scrutiny of acts of human barbarism and the ethical questions surrounding them. The way to end them, he believes, is to foster dialogue of all kinds. Borrowing from Michael Oakeshott the phrase \u201cconversation of mankind\u201d, he hopes for a form of engagement free from \u201cthreats or other coercion\u201d. He invokes reconciliation in South Africa and peace-making in Northern Ireland, but points out that the \u201cconversation\u201d might take many forms; non-violent protest can be a form of communication, as can cultural engagement, such as Daniel Barenboim and Edward Said\u2019s West-Eastern Divan Orchestra. Crucially, it must involve breaking down barriers of denial \u2013 accepting that \u201chorrible things are done by \u2018our\u2019 side as well as theirs, accepting that \u2018they\u2019 too do good things\u201d. Moving away from blame alone, and taking responsibility. With insight and understanding, Glover merges philosophy with psychology, arguing that atrocities are committed because of deeply embedded human tendencies. It is only by looking at the monsters within us that we can hope to cage and tame them. As someone who has spent the last two decades working in conflict resolution in the Middle East I have seen how important it is to combine these two levels of analysis. The Israeli government and Hamas defend their people with violence as they believe it is the only language that the other side understands. Every \u201cwound\u201d is followed by a \u201cbacklash\u201d. But this reciprocity compounds the trauma, making peace even more difficult. Israel was founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust, in which 6 million Jewish people were exterminated, unable to defend themselves against systematic, state-sponsored murder. Each fresh attack against Israeli civilians reinforces the collision of the traumatic past and present, reviving deep fears of annihilation. For Israel, 1948 was the moment of independence. For Palestinians it was the Nakba (\u201cCatastrophe\u201d), when an estimated 700,000 Palestinians were expelled from or fled their homeland. More than seven decades of increasingly repressive and violent occupation has continually retraumatised Palestinians, erasing hopes for a better, more peaceful future. Glover emphasises the need to recognise these traumatic pasts, and then to move beyond black-and-white thinking, creating dialogue in a greyer zone of mutual understanding and shared values. People have been trapped into describing themselves only in opposition to each other, unable to articulate a vision of what they stand for and what a better future might entail. This, of course, raises the problem of managing really radical differences. My own experiences have taught me that even when there is dialogue, people seldom have empathy for the other or an appetite to find common ground. Representatives of each side often have completely different ways of describing their experiences, with little interest in their adversaries\u2019 interpretations. Their deep suffering makes them consumed with their own experience, making the first step \u2013 recognising the others\u2019 humanity \u2013 particularly difficult. What we do know is that the vast majority of the people want to live in peace, take their children to school and spend time with their friends and loved ones. Glover quotes the Palestinian proverb: \u201cdon\u2019t curse the darkness, light a candle\u201d, a recognition that however hard it can be to contemplate, without conversation there is only violence and war. \u2022 Gabrielle Rifkind is the director of the Oxford Process and co-author of The Fog of Peace: How to Prevent War (Bloomsbury). \u2022 Israelis and Palestinians: From the Cycle of Violence to the Conversation of Mankind by Jonathan Glover is published by Polity (\u00a320).

            "date": "2024-01-13T18:10:10Z",
            "content": "Last summer, as Washington tried quietly to coax Saudi Arabia towards the grand bargain of normalisation of its relations with Israel, diplomats in Riyadh were much more focused on securing a different peace deal on its southern borders with one of the most successful insurgencies of modern times \u2013 the one led by the Houthi rebels of Yemen, also known as Ansar Allah, the supporters of God. With an informal ceasefire holding inside Yemen, and after months of private talks mainly mediated in Oman, on 14 September a Houthi delegation flew to Riyadh, where they met Prince Khalid bin Salman, the defence minister and brother of the crown prince. Major differences remained to be settled, but it seemed as if, after decades of various forms of fighting, peace was to come to the country, and largely on the terms dictated by a group that did not really exist as a political force inside Yemen until the early 2000s. Saudi Arabia was finally going to cut its losses on the disastrous offensive it launched in 2015 to push back the Houthis. Yet 23 days after the Riyadh meeting, Hamas broke through the border with Israel, massacring Israelis and sparking a chain of events that this week left Yemen exposed to a two-day attack mounted from US and British submarines and warships on the Red Sea. The attacks on Houthi bases in Yemen, as well as ratcheting up the tension in a region already gripped by violence, took Yemen further away from elusive internal peace. In a country of nuance, two factors are adding to the complexity of a region riven by conflict: the Houthis\u2019 support for the Palestinian cause, and the way Yemen\u2019s geography helps shape political dynamics. As the writer Iona Craig observes, Yemen is a quintessential example of geopolitics \u2013 the place where geography and politics come together. Yemen itself may be relatively impoverished, but the often unprotected fruits of western globalisation temptingly pass by its shores day and night. Nearly 15% of goods imported into Europe, the Middle East and North Africa are shipped from Asia and the Gulf by sea. Nearly 21.5% of refined oil and more than 13% of crude oil go through the waterways. Asian imports and exports account for about a quarter of Israel\u2019s total foreign trade and transit mainly via Red Sea routes. Israel has long feared that the narrowness of the Bab al-Mandab strait represents a security vulnerability. For decades it has sought alliances with countries such as what is now Eritrea to fend off first Egyptian- and then Iranian-led efforts to close the waterways to Israeli traffic. Indeed one motive for Israel to sign the \u201cAbraham accords\u201d with the United Arab Emirates in 2020 was the UAE\u2019s own maritime security network, encompassing Djibouti, Eritrea, Somaliland, and Yemen\u2019s Perim Island and Socotra archipelago. The Houthis for their part have been experimenting with how to become a naval power. In October 2016 they started using the recently captured strategic port of Hodeidah on Yemen\u2019s west coast as a base. They twice fired at the USS Mason as a form of counterattack for the US providing air support to the Saudis. In January 2017 Houthis switched from lobbing ballistic missiles and drones over the land border towards Riyadh, and instead sent three suicide boats. It also tried to mine the waterways. \u201cIf the aggressors keep pushing toward Hodeidah, and if the political solution hits a wall, some strategic choices will be taken as a point of no return, including blocking the international navigation in the Red Sea,\u201d said the Houthi political council chief, Saleh al Samad. \u201cShips pass by our waters while our people starve.\u201d Israel for its part realised that Iran, with its sophisticated navy, was starting to train Houthis in using boats, drones and missiles to disrupt Israeli-linked traffic, including by providing machinery that could detect a ship\u2019s origins. As the Houthis chalked up more victories, Tehran\u2019s patronage grew. It was evident to Israeli eyes that by 2019 Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the Houthi leader, was increasingly directing his rhetoric against Israel and denying claims by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Iran had begun supplying precision missiles to Yemen. He said: \u201cOur people will not hesitate to declare jihad against the Israeli enemy and deliver the most severe blows against the enemy\u2019s sensitive targets if he gets involved in stupid acts against our people. Our hostile position against Israel is principled, humane, moral and religious.\u201d Maysaa Shuja al-Deen from the Sana\u2019a Centre for Strategic Studies says: \u201cThe Houthi threats to Israeli shipping are not an excuse or an attempt to divert attention from their own failings. It is deep in their ideology. They talk of cursing the Jews and death to America. Their founder, Hussein al-Houthi, started his lectures around the time of 9/11 and the US invasion of Iraq, and it was very much about a clash of civilisations. It is Muslims v Christians, a religious conflict, not about Arab nationalism.\u201d Once the Gaza crisis exploded, the Houthis initially fired ineffectual missiles towards the Israel port town of Eilat, insisting they would only desist when Israel allowed humanitarian aid into Gaza. But taking advantage of the territory they had captured since 2014, their tactics quickly evolved into a campaign of surprise attacks on shipping that has spread mayhem through the world\u2019s supply chains. Since at least 12 November, according to the Sana\u2019a Centre, \u201cHouthi forces have been training recruits for amphibious assault teams, with exercises including mock missile launches targeting decoy naval ships and simulated ship raids. They have also gradually widened their targets from Israeli-flagged ships to ships trading with Israel.\u201d Al-Deen argues the positive domestic response will only embolden the Houthis: \u201cYemenis are pro-Palestinian, and that feeling has been growing to unprecedented levels over the last three months.\u201d Where other groups have hesitated, the Houthis have shown daring, all the while producing propaganda videos such as a Palestinian flag-festooned helicopter landing on the deck of the Galaxy Leader, a cargo ship sailing in the Red Sea. The Houthis were particularly proud when a BBC interviewer asked Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a member of the Houthi supreme council, why they saw fit to interfere in Palestine \u201cmiles and miles away\u201d. He replied: \u201cAs for Biden, is he a neighbour of Netanyahu? Do they live in the same flat, and does the French president live on the same floor and the British prime minister in the same building?\u201d Abdulghani al-Iryani, also from the Sana\u2019a Centre, claims: \u201cThe anti-Houthi camp inside Yemen is dumbfounded. The few statements made against the Houthis since the beginning of their operation in support of Palestine have been severely criticised by the Yemeni public. The sentiment is captured in a common phrase: \u2018My brother and I are against our cousin, and my cousin and I are against the stranger.\u2019 Citizens of all stripes have demanded that spokespeople of anti-Houthi groups \u2018shut their mouths\u2019.\u201d Indeed some Houthi leaders have already reached out to their long-term political opponents in the Islah party to see if they will make common cause against Israel. Al-Deen insists the Houthis will not be deterred by western attacks but will see them as a gift, even a recruiting sergeant. \u201cThey have spent years fighting the Saudis, absorbing losses. They are not a classic army with static military bases. Militias change the rules of war, and with Iran\u2019s help they now have the capacity and expertise to manufacture drones inside the country. The US and the UK gave very lengthy warnings that this was about to happen, so there was no element of surprise.\u201d She says if anything the last week \u201cwill make the Houthis believe they are no longer local players but regional players legitimised in their own right for directly confronting America\u201d. She says she can see the Houthis even firing missiles towards Bahrain, the one Arab country that supported the air strikes in defence of freedom of navigation. Farea al Muslimi, from the Chatham House middle east programme, warns: \u201cThe Houthis are far more savvy, prepared and well-equipped than many western commentators realise. Their recklessness and willingness to escalate in the face of a challenge are always underrated.\u201d They also know that the military naval alliance supporting America is thin. Egypt, despite seeing income from the Suez canal, refused to support the US air strikes. No Arab country, except possibly the UAE, has the nerve to challenge the Houthi framing of plucky Yemenis taking on US power. Saudi Arabia worries its exit ticket from Yemen is being torn up. The missile assault may be seen by the west as the only option, but it is not cost free. Houthi drones are cheap. By contrast the French spend close to \u20ac1m on each Aster 15 missile used by the French and the British to fend off Houthi drones. This has the potential to be a long and costly war, perhaps waged at different levels of intensity."

            "date": "2024-01-07T03:44:04Z",
            "content": "US secretary of state Antony Blinken has urged Middle East countries to use their influence over regional actors to ensure the Gaza conflict is contained and prevent \u201can endless cycle of violence,\u201d as he continued his week-long trip aimed at calming tensions. Blinken was speaking on Saturday, after Lebanon\u2019s Iranian-backed Hezbollah group said it had fired rockets at Israel, who said it had struck a \u201cterrorist cell\u201d in retaliation. Hezbollah called the strikes a \u201cpreliminary response\u201d to the killing of a senior Hamas leader in Beirut last week in an attack widely attributed to Israel \u201cWe want to make sure that countries \u2026 [are] using their relationships with some of the actors that might be involved to keep a lid on things, to make sure that we\u2019re not seeing the spread of conflict,\u201d Blinken said before flying to Jordan, after meeting the leaders of Turkey and Greece. His comments came as France\u2019s foreign minister told her Iranian counterpart that \u201cIran and its affiliates\u201d must stop \u201cdestabilising acts\u201d that could spark a broader conflict in the Middle East. Blinken, who will also visit Arab states, Israel and the occupied West Bank, said he would be looking at what could be done to maximise the protection of civilians in Gaza and increase deliveries of humanitarian assistance. \u201cFar too many Palestinians have been killed, especially children,\u201d he said. The war began when Hamas fighters attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages. Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed 22,700 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli army said on Saturday it had \u201ccompleted the dismantling\u201d of Hamas\u2019s command structure in the northern Gaza Strip. Army spokesperson Daniel Hagari told reporters that Palestinian militants were now operating in the area only sporadically and \u201cwithout commanders\u201d. \u201cNow the focus is on dismantling Hamas in the centre of the Gaza Strip and in the south of the Gaza Strip,\u201d he said, while acknowledging that the task will take time. On Saturday, fighting raged in and near the southern city of Khan Younis, where the Israeli military said it had killed members of Hamas. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported heavy shelling near the Al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis. Shrapnel flew into the medical facility amid the sound of firing from drones, it said on social media. Elsewhere, the Palestinian health ministry said an Israeli airstrike killed six people in the West Bank city of Jenin early on Sunday. The official Palestinian news agency Wafa said there was a major deployment of Israeli forces in Jenin. Some of Israel\u2019s forces have recently been withdrawn from Gaza, partly in response to US pressure. Speaking about Israel\u2019s efforts to dismantle Hamas in the central and southern Gaza Strip, Hagari said \u201cwe will do it in a different way\u201d without elaborating. On his current trip, Blinken is expected to put pressure on the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to do more to protect civilians in Gaza, allow more aid into the territory and rein in outspoken far-right ministers who have called for the mass resettlement of Palestinians \u2013 rhetoric the US has condemned as inflammatory and irresponsible. Netanyahu has angered Washington by so far refusing to engage in any detailed planning for the governance of Gaza when Israel\u2019s military offensive ends, and by rejecting the US\u2019s preferred options. In recent days, senior Israeli officials have rushed to offer some postwar proposals. Washington wants regional countries, including Turkey, to play a role in reconstruction, governance and, potentially, security in Gaza, which has been run by Hamas since 2007, an official said. On Saturday, Blinken said that Turkey is committed to playing \u201ca positive, productive\u201d role for postwar Gaza and prepared to use its influence in the region to prevent the Israel-Hamas conflict from broadening even more. The comments came after his meeting with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, a strong critic of Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza. During the talks which went for more than an hour, Blinken pointed to the need to \u201cwork toward broader, lasting regional peace that ensures Israel\u2019s security and advances the establishment of a Palestinian state\u201d, US officials said. A Turkish diplomatic source said foreign minister Hakan Fidan pressed Blinken during a separate meeting for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d in Gaza that could ensure the smooth delivery of aid. Erdo\u011fan has turned into one of the Muslim world\u2019s harshest critics of Washington\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s Gaza campaign. He has compared Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler, and accused the US of sponsoring the \u201cgenocide\u201d of Palestinians. He has also rebuffed US pressure to cut off the suspected flow of funding to Hamas through Turkey, and defended the group as legitimately elected \u201cliberators\u201d fighting for their land.

            "title": "\u2018More killing won\u2019t bring back lost lives\u2019: Tal Mitnick, 18, on going to prison instead of joining IDF",
            "date": "2024-01-23T13:00:11Z",
            "content": "On Tal Mitnick\u2019s first morning inside an Israeli military prison last month, he was ordered into a small classroom. Pinned to its walls were various famous quotes. One caught his attention: \u201cEducation is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world.\u201d The name beneath it: Nelson Mandela. \u201cI nearly laughed to myself,\u201d says the 18-year-old, speaking over Zoom from the bedroom of his family\u2019s Tel Aviv home. \u201cA military upholding apartheid putting that on their wall,\u201d he says, \u201cwhile South Africa was preparing its case against Israel for the international criminal court? I pointed out how ridiculous this quote being there was. No other prisoners engaged or agreed. I realised how alone I was.\u201d In late December, Mitnick refused his mandatory draft to join the Israel Defense Forces. As a result, a military court sentenced him to 30 days in custody, making him the first conscientious objector to be jailed in Israel since 7 October. He spoke to the Guardian late on Friday afternoon, one day after his release. Over the weekend, Mitnick spent time with friends and family and attended an anti-war march. This freedom will be short-lived. \u201cI\u2019ve already had my draft order from the army for Tuesday morning. Again, I\u2019ll go to the military base and tell them I refuse to serve. Again, I\u2019ll be sent to jail.\u201d On Tuesday morning, Mitnick was sentenced to a further 30 days in prison. No policy dictates how long this cycle might continue. Often refusers spend stints totalling 100 days or more locked away, after which the IDF eventually concludes they\u2019re unfit for service. Mitnick\u2019s last enlistment date was 26 December 2023. \u201cI was due to enlist that day, yes, but so were many others. My peers were there \u2013 with their mothers, fathers and siblings, too, all knowing they were sending their children off to maybe risk their lives.\u201d He counted other conscripts in their hundreds. \u201cSeeing someone else there, in this case me, refusing to do the same? It creates clashes. A lot either ignored me and kept walking, or said just a few words as they passed. They\u2019d call us traitors, say it should have been me in Be\u2019eri.\u201d A small protest had been organised by Mesarvot \u2013 a network supporting refuseniks \u2013 to show support for Mitnick outside the Tel HaShomer military base, his conscription location. Friends and family were also more understanding. \u201cThey know what I want is moderate, non-violent and peaceful,\u201d he explains, \u201ceven if my outlook isn\u2019t the norm here.\u201d Mitnick said he had known he wouldn\u2019t serve for many years. While he studied maths and computer science at school, a teacher suggested his natural aptitudes would suit a role in an elite intelligence unit. \u201cSo I looked into it more. Intelligence units, I learned, blackmail LGBTQ+ Palestinians and people needing health treatment in Israel into being informants. I started to see how the system is built on oppression. Once I realised this, I knew I had to not only refuse, but also work against it.\u201d The events of 7 October only affirmed his decision. \u201cIsrael has already lost this war,\u201d he believes. \u201cMore killing and more violence won\u2019t bring back the lives lost on 7 October. I know people are hurt. Traumatised. But this doesn\u2019t make anything better. To root out extremist ideas from Palestinian society, we must root them out in Israel.\u201d And so, once inside the military base last month, Mitnick presented the recruitment officer with his ID. \u201cI said: \u2018No, I\u2019m not doing this.\u2019 I was yelled at, told I had no choice. I had to stand up for myself.\u201d He was sent from commander to commander. \u201cTo each of them, I said the same thing: I believe there is no military solution to this conflict. I\u2019m a pacifist.\u201d For first-time refuseniks, seven to 10 days is a standard sanction. On 26 December, Mitnick received 30 days to be spent at a prison just outside the town of Kfar Yona. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as the hero or anything,\u201d he says, \u201cwhile people are being massacred every day in Gaza. And I want to stress I\u2019m by no means the only one. There are other anti-occupation activists. People opting to not join the army. Peace campaigners, young and old. But at the same time, I do think this takes bravery.\u201d Online, at least, some pro-Palestine voices have questioned the praise being poured on Mitnick, suggesting refusing to participate in the slaughtering of civilians is the very least to be expected. \u201cThere is a huge social consequence here for refusing to serve,\u201d he says, \u201cespecially doing so publicly. Israeli society is so militarised that most conversations start with \u2018Where did you serve?\u2019 or \u2018Where are you serving?\u2019 When you say you didn\u2019t, don\u2019t or won\u2019t, a gap opens up. I\u2019m paying a price for this. I was born in Israel \u2013 I didn\u2019t choose to live here. We have a test at 18, the country and system tests us to see if we\u2019ll be complicit. I chose not to be.\u201d The events of 7 October shifted political paradigms inside Israel. \u201cEven four months ago,\u201d says Mitnick, \u201cwe were in the middle of the judicial reform protests.\u201d He played an active part in the demonstrations. \u201cThe refusal movement was gaining traction. Now the supposed liberals, that protested judicial reform, are pilots massacring people in Gaza. People who were speaking out about government corruption are now supporting the far-right leadership, saying there are no civilians in Gaza.\u201d Hitpakhut is a term much-used in Israel today. \u201cIt means sobering up. Lots of Israeli liberals who were vaguely pro-peace are now for Gaza\u2019s destruction. They say they were high, drunk on the fantasy of peace; now they\u2019ve sobered up and say we have to kill the Palestinians.\u201d Prison life, for Mitnick, took some adjustment. \u201cYou\u2019re treated like a soldier inside a military jail,\u201d he says. \u201cStaff aren\u2019t called guards, but commanders. Some of the day is spent being told to stand in line for hours while they talk to you. Otherwise, you eat, clean your room, maybe rest. Then repeat, over and over.\u201d Access to media was limited. \u201cThe only regular news source is the rightwing daily paper Israel HaYom,\u201d he says. Occasionally, a news programme would air on his in-cell TV, although domestic broadcasters have all but ignored Mitnick and the wider anti-war movement. \u201cThe media is trying to manufacture consent to kill and massacre more and more,\u201d is Mitnick\u2019s explanation. \u201cIf they show my opinion, suggesting there\u2019s another way, it undermines what the government is doing.\u201d Mitnick was reluctant to tell other inmates why he was inside. \u201cI was mostly in prison with deserters. People who served in the military then didn\u2019t come back. Mostly, that\u2019s for socioeconomic reasons.\u201d Few, if any, shared his political position. \u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t keep it a secret the whole time,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I talked. Initially, I was called stupid and naive. Worse, too.\u201d But he had the conversations. \u201cHumanising my opinion is important. One guy I got to know heard other prisoners talking about me behind my back, and then defended me. He told them I don\u2019t support Hamas, I just want peace.\u201d In truth, Mitnick knows, his generation of Israelis doesn\u2019t broadly agree. \u201cYoung people here are more rightwing than their parents,\u201d he says. Peace activists have been arrested and face public condemnation. \u201cI still remain hopeful,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the privilege to lose hope here. I hope more and more young people my age see that it\u2019s not normal to live in constant fear of terrorist attacks, nor to enlist 18-year-olds into the army. Nothing here is normal, and we have the power to change that.\u201d On Tuesday morning, Mitnick returned to Tel HaShomer. He now faces another month in custody. \u201cThere\u2019s no end date to this in sight,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich isn\u2019t easy. Inside, I wasn\u2019t counting down the days. Here, I\u2019m not celebrating being out either. This is simply a step I have to take. At some point, they\u2019ll have to release me.\u201d"

            "content": "The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, was released from hospital on Monday, two weeks after he was admitted for complications following prostate cancer surgery, apparently leaving the White House unaware of his absence for three days. In a statement, the Pentagon said the most senior US military official will work remotely \u201cfor a period of time\u201d before returning to the office and has \u201cfull access\u201d to secure communications capabilities. \u201cSecretary Austin\u2019s prostate cancer was treated early and effectively, and his prognosis is excellent,\u201d Austin\u2019s doctors at Walter Reed national military medical center said in a statement. Austin said in a statement that he was \u201cgrateful for the excellent care I received\u201d and that \u201cas I continue to recuperate and perform my duties from home, I\u2019m eager to fully recover and return as quickly as possible to the Pentagon.\u201d Austin underwent a prostate procedure in December and was again hospitalized on 1 January for complications. But the Pentagon did not release any notification about his absence until 5 January. It later emerged that Austin had not notified Congress or the White House about his diagnosis or treatments. That prompted a political backlash, including an investigation by the defense department inspector general. The Pentagon later said the general\u2019s chief of staff was sick with the flu at the time. The national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said Austin\u2019s participation in national security affairs \u201cwas no different than it would be on any other given day, except that he was briefing the president on options and engaged in the discussions from the hospital\u201d. But the appearance that the links in a crucial chain of command during a moment of rising global tensions and US military action against Iran-backed militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen caused significant concern about communications within the administration. On his 12th day in hospital, last Thursday, Austin reportedly orchestrated and then watched in real time as US retaliatory strikes against Houthi militias were launched. That came as the Senate armed services committee chair, Jack Reed, a Democrat, and his counterpart, the Republican senator Roger Wicker, sent a letter to Austin asking for an accounting of his absences from defense department headquarters. \u201cWe are concerned that critical notification procedures were not followed while you were receiving medical care the past several weeks,\u201d they wrote, adding that their committee \u201chas serious questions about this incident, and members need a full accounting to ensure it never happens again\u201d. A day later, on Friday, Joe Biden was asked if the delay in notification of Austin\u2019s absence was a lapse of judgment. \u201cYes\u201d, the US president said."

            "date": "2024-01-07T17:47:45Z",
            "content": "US defense secretary Lloyd Austin has said he takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for secrecy surrounding an ongoing, week-long hospitalisation for a still-unspecified medical condition. Austin, who is 70, was admitted on New Year\u2019s Day to Walter Reed national military medical center for what the Pentagon has said were \u201ccomplications following a recent elective medical procedure\u201d, a fact the defence department kept under wraps for five days. The Pentagon has yet to detail why Austin is being treated, whether he lost consciousness over the past week or offer details on when he might be discharged from the hospital. \u201cI recognise I could have done a better job ensuring the public was appropriately informed. I commit to doing better,\u201d Austin said in a written statement on Saturday. \u201cBut this is important to say: this was my medical procedure, and I take full responsibility for my decisions about disclosure.\u201d Austin\u2019s statement came as the Associated Press news agency reported that senior Biden administration leaders, top Pentagon officials and members of Congress were unaware for days that Austin had been hospitalised. The Pentagon did not inform the White House national security council or top adviser Jake Sullivan of Austin\u2019s hospitalisation until Thursday, according to two administration officials who were not authorised to speak publicly about the matter and spoke to AP on the condition of anonymity. Air force Maj Gen Pat Ryder said the White House and the joint chiefs of staff were notified about Austin\u2019s hospitalisation but would not confirm when that notice happened. Politico reported that the joint chiefs chairman, Gen CQ Brown, did not learn of Austin\u2019s situation until the day after his hospitalization. Ryder said members of Congress were told late Friday afternoon, and other officials said lawmakers were informed after 5pm. It was not clear when key senior members of Austin\u2019s staff were told, but across the Pentagon, many staff found out when the department released a statement about Austin\u2019s hospital stay just minutes after 5pm. Many believed Austin was on vacation for the week. The top Republican on the Senate armed services committee, Senator Roger Wicker, accused the Pentagon of failing to inform Congress immediately about such matters, as required by law. But it is unclear how widely the information was shared even within president Joe Biden\u2019s administration. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AP Biden was only informed on Thursday evening. Another official said Biden maintained confidence in Austin and the two spoke on Saturday evening. Austin sits just below Biden at the top of the chain of command of the US military and his duties require his being available at a moment\u2019s notice to respond to any manner of national security crisis. It remains unclear the extent to which his duties were delegated to his deputy, Kathleen Hicks, or whether Austin was involved in any key decisions during his absence. Hicks, who took over when Austin was hospitalised, was also away. A US official said she had a communications setup with her in Puerto Rico that allowed her to do the job while Austin, who spent 41 years in the military and retired as a four-star Army general in 2016, was incapacitated. Not even Hicks knew Austin had been hospitalized when she began assuming some of his duties, CNN reported Sunday, citing two unnamed defense officials. Wicker said the episode further eroded the public\u2019s trust in the Biden administration, citing past failures to quickly disclose information about national security incidents, including the appearance of a Chinese spy balloon over the US last year. \u201cWhen one of the country\u2019s two national command authorities is unable to perform their duties, military families, members of Congress, and the American public deserve to know the full extent of the circumstances,\u201d Wicker said in a statement. Meanwhile, in an interview with CNN, former Republican vice-president Mike Pence called the delayed disclosure of Austin\u2019s hospitalization \u201ca dereliction of duty\u201d, especially at a time when two American allies \u2013 Ukraine and Israel \u2013 were engaged in separate wars. Retired Lt Gen Mark Hertling, who previously served as the US army\u2019s commanding officer in Europe, told CNN that Austin \u201cshould \u2026 have notified the [national security council] or the White House\u201d. \u201cYou always notify your boss if you\u2019re hospitalized for something, and we don\u2019t know what occurred that didn\u2019t allow that to happen,\u201d Hertling said. But Hertling downplayed the idea that the US may have been vulnerable with Austin hospitalized. \u201cHe has multiple deputies he trusts to continue the actions of the department while he\u2019s away,\u201d Hertling said to CNN. Other military officials saw matters more harshly than Hertling. A Politico report from Sunday quoted an unnamed defense department official who believed Austin\u2019s undisclosed hospitalization could cost a senior Pentagon aide\u2019s job, despite Austin\u2019s taking responsibility. \u201cSomeone\u2019s head has to roll,\u201d the official said, according to Politico. Military Reporters and Editors (MRE), a non-profit organisation for journalists covering the US military, said the decision to only release the information on a Friday evening, when online readership is typically lower, \u201cis keeping in the worst traditions of obfuscation and opacity.\u201d Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report"

            "date": "2024-01-18T10:00:06Z",
            "content": "Miami Dolphins: Is Tua Tagovailoa the guy? The inquiry into what went wrong for the Dolphins this season will be long and painful. They can point to the freezing weather in Kansas City and the mountain of end-of-season injuries as reasons for why they fell at the first hurdle in the playoffs, but such thinking would ignore the issues that plagued the team during the rest of the season. They couldn\u2019t beat good teams. They burned draft picks on players who couldn\u2019t contribute down the stretch. A defense that promised to be one of the best in the league was erratic. Yet those issues sit on the fringes of the biggest of them all: Should the team commit to Tua Tagovailoa as their long-term quarterback? We now have too much evidence that Tagovailoa is a fine point guard. Slot him into a point-and-shoot role with the ideal supporting cast and a great play-caller, and he can thrive. But when things go wrong \u2013 when he\u2019s missing key pieces, when he\u2019s forced to improvise, when his offensive line is conceding too much pressure \u2013 he folds. The options beyond Tagovailoa are limited. The team could look at a trade for Justin Fields. They could make a run at Kirk Cousins in free agency. But Cousins is coming off an achilles injury, and for all Fields\u2019s promise, Tagovailoa is a more seamless fit in Mike McDaniel\u2019s offense. Miami has plenty of talent and a good coaching staff. But they\u2019ve found themselves in one of the worst places in the NFL: quarterback purgatory. Tagovailoa is too good to move on from but too limited to overcome imperfect circumstances. Dallas Cowboys: The end for Mike McCarthy? It was just so quintessentially Cowboys. A 12-win season and a disastrous playoff loss. Long camera shots of a confused, irate Jerry Jones turning to his son in his suite. Stephen, do you have Belichick\u2019s number? This was not difficult to predict. For as long as McCarthy has coached, he\u2019s crafted excellent offenses while overseeing teams that fall apart in the postseason. When things start going wrong in big spots, his teams collapse. Dallas\u2019 defeat should not fall solely on the shoulders of their head coach. Dak Prescott once again failed in the postseason. Dan Quinn appeared to spend more time preparing for head coaching interviews than studying the Green Bay Packers offense. Green Bay\u2019s use of motion and pre-snap movement \u2013 the foundation of Matt LaFleur\u2019s offense \u2013 left the Cowboys defense befuddled. Packers tight end Luke Musgrave averaged (AVERAGED!) 9.71 yards of separation per snap, a record in the Next Gen Stats era. You read that right: A tight end averaged nearly a first down of separation on each snap. Still, being ill-prepared and unable to rebound from setbacks is a reflection on a head coach. Why did the team look so frazzled from the opening kickoff? Why were CeeDee Lamb and Prescott, the most productive receiver-to-quarterback duo in the league this season, bickering from the first snap until the last? McCarthy has many excellent qualities. Guiding a team through the postseason is not one of them. It\u2019s time for Dallas to move on and look for a new coach who can push a talented team over the top, although Jerry Jones, as ever, has different ideas. Pittsburgh Steelers: Will they find a quarterback? A toast, please, for another year of Mike Tomlin sustaining his \u2018never had a losing season\u2019 streak while getting bounced in the first round of the playoffs. Rumors swirled in the aftermath of Pittsburgh\u2019s postseason exit that Tomlin, with a year left on his contract, may quit. When asked about the state of his deal in the post-game press conference, he walked out before the reporter could finish their question. Reports now indicate that Tomlin and the Steelers are working on an extension. Bringing Tomlin back is a win; he remains one of the best coaches in the game. But it doesn\u2019t answer Pittsburgh\u2019s thorniest question. They need to find a new quarterback \u2013 and Tomlin must sign off on a fresh approach on offense. Few franchises are as insular as the Steelers. It\u2019s time for Tomlin to bring in an outside voice to pair with a new quarterback. Kenny Pickett doesn\u2019t have the tools to be a difference-maker in a conference that requires A-plus quarterback play. And while the Steelers are unlikely to make a splash by moving up in the draft, they should be the first port of call for any veteran quarterback looking to push through a trade this offseason or who is free to move in free agency. The Steelers have young talent all over their roster. If you\u2019re power-ranking Cousins destinations today (outside sticking in Minnesota), the Steelers should be at the top of the list. Philadelphia Eagles: How will they fix the defense? The end to the Eagles\u2019 season was an abject failure. No team has fallen so far, at such speed, inside a season. In some ways (sorry, Eagles fans), it\u2019s helpful that it went so wrong at the end. If the Eagles had limped through a playoff game or pulled out a couple of wins at the end of the regular season, it would have papered over systemic cracks. Philly needs a total reset. Whether Nick Sirianni should hang around as head coach or not is open for discussion, but the rest of the Eagles\u2019 coaching staff should be feeling twitchy. Philadelphia failed to build a coherent offense throughout the season, leaning into their own worst habits with zero solutions to basic problems. On defense, things were, somehow, worse. A ton of blame will be laid at the doors of Sean Desai and Matt Patricia, the two DCs tasked with piloting the unit. But to shovel the blame on that pair alone is a cop-out. The defense stunk this year for a whole host of reasons: poor team-building, philosophical flaws and an inability to master the details. The team\u2019s pass rush vanished. The corners fell off a cliff. The middle of the defense \u2013 versus the run and pass \u2013 was a sieve. Poor coaching should take up a decent chunk of the blame, but even solid coaching would not have stopped the likes of James Bradberry and Kevin Byard whiffing on simple tackles. Ultimately, though, the Eagles built an ill-fitting roster to the staff\u2019s defensive design. That\u2019s as much on Howie Roseman, the team\u2019s GM, as it is the coaching staff. Ironing those issues out in-season requires high-level talent and top-tier coaching. By the end of the season, the Eagles had neither. Fixing the problems in one offseason will be tough \u2013 and a task made all the more difficult by the concerns that need addressing with the offense. It\u2019s going to be a long offseason in Philadelphia. Cleveland Browns: How do they address the offense? Cleveland could not legislate for what happened against the Houston Texans. Their vaunted defense was pulverized by Houston\u2019s young offense. Even when they got close to CJ Stroud, the rookie quarterback put on his cape and diced them up anyway. A disappointing end should not overshadow an excellent year. The Browns proved they can be a playoff team and a divisional contender with above-average quarterback play. If Deshaun Watson can return and deliver a close facsimile of what Joe Flacco provided. There will be an injection of new blood, too. The Browns announced on Wednesday they had parted ways with Alex Van Pelt, Kevin Stefanski\u2019s long-time collaborator on offense. With Watson returning, the Browns need a new perspective. The Van Pelt-Watson partnership was largely a battle of two contrasting offensive philosophies. Because of his huge, fully guaranteed contract, Cleveland are committed to Watson, no matter how awful he looked for large chunks of this season. Finding a coach who\u2019s more aligned with how Watson views the game will be the key to the Browns tapping into whatever potential is still left in the quarterback. LA Rams: How aggressive will they be in the offseason? The Rams overachieved this season. They pushed an excellent Lions team to the brink on the road in the playoffs with the youngest defense (by far) in the NFL. Matthew Stafford played as well, consistently, as any quarterback in the league this season, answering any concerns about his long-term health. In Puka Nacua, they found the ideal receiver to pair with Cooper Kupp. Now the Rams hierarchy is left with a choice: do they push some chips into the middle and try to squeeze out the final drops of the Stafford-Kupp-Aaron Donald axis? Or do they continue to build toward the future, bringing an understudy to Stafford at quarterback and preserving some cap flexibility for the future? The Rams enter the offseason in a strong position. They will have their full allocation of day one and day two draft picks for the first time in years as well as $40m in cap space, with the ability to open up plenty more. They can pick any road they like. And given the resumes of Les Snead and Sean McVay, whichever one they pick will probably be the right one."

            "date": "2024-01-19T14:49:41Z",
            "content": "There was a moment at the beginning of Penny Wong\u2019s trip to the Middle East this week when the foreign affairs minister seemed to admit Australia\u2019s limited influence. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t think Australia can come to the region demanding specific assurances,\u201d Wong said when asked to spell out precisely what guarantees she would be seeking from her Israeli counterparts. \u201cWhat we can do is come to the region and add our voice to the cause of peace.\u201d To an extent, Wong\u2019s comments are stating the obvious, but they probably also reflect frustration of a government that has faced mounting political pressure in Australia \u2013 from two starkly different perspectives \u2013 over its stance on the conflict. Way back on 30 October, Wong urged Israel to \u201clisten\u201d when its longstanding friends such as Australia asked it to protect innocent lives in Gaza, while warning that the world \u201cwill not accept continuing civilian deaths\u201d. At that time, about 8,000 people in Gaza had been killed, including 3,300 children and 2,000 women, as Israel responded to Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack on southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 240 others were taken hostage. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Fast forward to today and the death toll in Gaza stands close to 25,000 Palestinians. While the Palestinian death toll figures do not distinguish between combatants and civilians, it is utterly undeniable that there has been an immense loss of innocent life. Two-thirds of the deaths in Gaza are reported to be women and children, while 85% of the territory\u2019s entire population has been displaced by Israeli evacuation orders, with many homes damaged or destroyed by Israeli strikes. Israel states that Hamas \u2013 which has threatened to repeat the attacks \u2013 bears responsibility because it embeds itself among civilians, but alarm over the impact of the war is growing. Shortly before Christmas, an Australian doctor who coordinated medical aid to Gaza told me: \u201cThe volume of children killed or mutilated in this conflict is very extreme.\u201d Unicef said this week that Gaza was now \u201cthe most dangerous place in the world to be a child\u201d, with children in the besieged strip placed \u201cat high risk of dying from malnutrition and disease\u201d. Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of \u201cusing starvation of civilians as a method of warfare\u201d. Israeli families of hostages still held by Hamas are also at their wit\u2019s end, hoping for their release but fearing the worst after more than 100 days of captivity. Many communities near Israel\u2019s border with Lebanon remain evacuated amid cross-border clashes with Hezbollah. The risk of regional escalation is growing. So when Wong describes the situation as \u201cdire\u201d, it\u2019s an understatement. Against this real-world suffering, it seems almost perverse to analyse the situation through the lens of Australian domestic politics. But it must be done because the Labor government, more than halfway into its electoral term, is finding it increasingly difficult to please two constituencies with vastly different expectations. On the one side, dozens of Labor party branches have passed motions urging the government to call for a full ceasefire, amid pressure from grassroots members and constituents to call out the Israeli government. Thousands of pro-Palestine demonstrators have rallied in cities every weekend since the outbreak of the latest war to show their solidarity with the people of Gaza and register their displeasure with the Australian government\u2019s depiction of Israel\u2019s bombardment of the territory as self-defence. To this constituency, the government\u2019s declaration that it mourns every innocent life lost \u2013 Israeli and Palestinian \u2013 is wearing thin as the number of deaths in Gaza rises sharply. The Greens are campaigning for support from these dissatisfied voters at the next election. On the other side, the Coalition is seeking to make the case that the Labor party\u2019s internal politics are preventing the government from offering full-throated support for Israel, and has tried to connect this to a broader \u201cweak on national security\u201d narrative. Jewish community leaders \u2013 with exceptions \u2013 are increasingly complaining about the government\u2019s messaging and decisions. They asked why Wong did not visit the sites of the 7 October Hamas massacres in southern Israel, saying it would have been an important show of solidarity to a community reeling from the worst loss of life of Jewish people in a single day since the Holocaust. The government was also criticised for providing $6m in humanitarian assistance through the UN Relief and Works Agency, which has previously faced accusations of including antisemitic content in textbooks used in its schools. At the same time, News Corp has shown it is not averse to trying to wedge the government. From the beginning, the Australian newspaper has amplified claims that Labor was going soft on terrorism. More recently, it slammed the government for not sending a warship to the Red Sea to join US-led efforts to disrupt the Houthi rebels. And a front-page article in the Australian on Friday accused the government of being far too slow to officially designate the 7 October attacks a case of overseas terrorism. (While the government has unequivocally and repeatedly condemned those attacks as terrorism, a formal declaration does have practical significance because it opens the way for Australian relatives of victims to receive financial assistance.) Against these competing political pressures, the government has appeared flat-footed at times. Hence, when South Africa first lodged its 84-page submission to the international court of justice alleging Israel had breached the genocide convention, the government couldn\u2019t bring itself to state a position, one way or the other, on the merits of the accusation. Eventually, Wong stated that Australia\u2019s respect for the ICJ \u201cdoes not mean we accept the premise of South Africa\u2019s case\u201d \u2013 carefully worded language that still is fence-sitting. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, ignored the legal question altogether by saying such court cases wouldn\u2019t do anything to achieve peace in the region so his government would stay focused on the \u201cmain game\u201d. The government will, however, face more pressure to be definitive if the ICJ issues preliminary orders in coming weeks to suspend the Israeli military offensive or allow more humanitarian access \u2013 an interim ruling that experts say is possible given a precedent in a similar case against Myanmar. Wong\u2019s itinerary this week was another case in point on the balancing act. One day, Wong was meeting with the relatives of Hamas-held hostages or victims and affirming solidarity with Israel. On the next, she was visiting the occupied West Bank to hear from Palestinians affected by violence by Israeli settlers. Wong maintains there is no contradiction between being a friend of Israel and being a friend of the Palestinian people, saying they all deserve to live in \u201cpeace, security and dignity\u201d. Similarly, in a striking intervention this week, a former leader of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet domestic security force said his country would not have security until Palestinians had their own state. \u201cWe Israelis will have security only when they, Palestinians, will have hope,\u201d Ami Ayalon told the Guardian. \u201cTo say the same in military language: you cannot deter anyone, a person or a group, if he believes he has nothing to lose.\u201d But it is increasingly obvious that the Australian government\u2019s oft-stated support for a two-state solution is more of a slogan than an achievable reality, at least in the current environment. That was laid bare on Thursday when the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, rejected US overtures to establish a Palestinian state when Israel ends its offensive against Gaza, and he declared that all territory west of the Jordan River must be under Israeli security control. If Israel\u2019s strongest backer, the US, can\u2019t persuade Netanyahu, then it seems doubtful Australia would be able to do so. But it is also wrong to suggest Australia\u2019s stance doesn\u2019t matter. Albanese \u2013 who wanted to start the political year promising action on the cost of living \u2013 will doubtless keep facing a political balancing act for as long as the Gaza conflict continues. For Albanese, the risk is that by trying to stay out of the political fray and find a \u201cbalanced\u201d position on the conflict he ends up leaving everyone unhappy. In the meantime, Albanese and Wong are particularly worried about fraying social cohesion in Australia. Since 7 October, community groups have documented sharp increases in antisemitism and also anti-Palestinian racism, anti-Arab sentiment and Islamophobia. Speaking in Jerusalem, Wong said one of the successes of Australian multiculturalism was that \u201cwe have understood that we might have differences of opinion, but we deal with them respectfully and inclusively\u201d. \u201cI hope that we can hold on to that,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that this is a conflict that is so distressing for so many Australians, but we must hold on to that. We treat each other with respect.\u201d This is easier said than done at a time when entire communities in Australia feel under siege as they mourn loved ones and process intergenerational trauma."

            "title": "IMF warns Jeremy Hunt against tax cuts in budget",
            "date": "2024-01-30T22:59:03Z",
            "content": "The International Monetary Fund has issued a strong warning to Jeremy Hunt against cutting taxes in his budget in March, stressing the need to boost key areas of public spending instead. In updated forecasts for the UK and the rest of the global economy, the Washington-based fund doubted whether the widely anticipated tax cuts would be possible without extra borrowing or post-election spending cuts. The IMF said the chancellor should be focusing on repairing the public finances after the damage caused by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine in order to meet growing spending pressures. An IMF spokesperson said: \u201cPreserving high-quality public services and undertaking critical public investments to boost growth and achieve the net zero targets, will imply higher spending needs over the medium term than are currently reflected in the government\u2019s budget plans. \u201cAccommodating these needs, while assuredly stabilising the debt/GDP ratio, will already require generating additional high-quality fiscal savings, including on the tax side.\u201d Hunt is expected to cut income tax in the budget, but the IMF called on the chancellor to increase carbon and property taxes, take steps to eliminate loopholes in the taxation of wealth and income, and overhaul the pensions triple lock. \u201cIt is in this context that [IMF] staff advises against further tax cuts,\u201d the IMF said. Hunt rejected the IMF\u2019s call. \u201cThe IMF expect growth to strengthen over the next few years, supported by our introduction of the biggest capital investment tax reliefs anywhere in the world, alongside national insurance cuts to improve work incentives,\u201d the chancellor said. \u201cIt is too early to know whether further reductions in tax will be affordable in the budget, but we continue to believe that smart tax reductions can make a big difference in boosting growth.\u201d However, it has been reported the Hunt warned the cabinet that \u201cmajor structural weaknesses\u201d in the economy meant tax cuts would be smaller than in the autumn statement, when he reduced national insurance contributions by two percentage points. \u201cWe are not likely to have as much room for tax cuts as we had in the autumn,\u201d Hunt told a cabinet meeting, according to the Times. The IMF said it was forecasting UK growth of 0.5% in 2023 and 0.6% in 2024 \u2013 both unchanged from October \u2013 and with only Germany of the leading G7 industrialised economies expanding more weakly. With lower inflation likely to boost consumer spending power, the IMF said it was pencilling in UK growth of 1.6% in 2025 \u2013 slower than forecast three months ago. \u201cThe markdown to growth in 2025 of 0.4 percentage points reflects reduced scope for growth to catch up in light of recent upward statistical revisions to the level of output through the pandemic period,\u201d the IMF said. Last year, the Office for National Statistics revised up its estimates of UK growth in 2020 and 2021 by 1.8 points in total across the two years. The IMF said the global economy was gliding towards a \u201csoft landing\u201d after coping with the impact of tough central bank interest-rate action to reduce inflation. Revising up its growth estimates for 2024, the IMF said a number of big economies \u2013 including the US, China, Russia and India \u2013 had posted stronger than expected performances in 2023 and it was surprised by the resilience shown. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor said: \u201cThe clouds are beginning to part. The global economy begins the final descent toward a soft landing, with inflation declining steadily and growth holding up.\u201d Announcing details of the interim World Economic Outlook (WEO), Gourinchas said the IMF expected global growth to be 3.1% in 2023 and 2024, upward revisions of 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points respectively. But he stressed the pace of expansion \u2013 which compares with an average of 3.8% during the 2010s \u2013 remained slow and there was a risk of turbulence ahead. The IMF said the likelihood of a hard landing had receded and risks to its forecasts were evenly balanced. Growth could be higher than expected if tumbling inflation allowed deeper cuts in interest rates, if governments facing elections boosted public spending or if artificial intelligence increased productivity. However, the IMF warned of downside risks including the volatile situation in the Middle East; the possibility that inflation would prove stubborn and signs that investors were excessively optimistic about the scale of interest rate cuts from central banks this year. Gourinchas said he had been particularly surprised by the rapid improvement in the supply side of the global economy, singling out higher labour force participation rates, the easing of supply chain bottlenecks and lower commodity and energy prices. He warned that central banks \u201cmust avoid premature easing that would undo many hard-earned credibility gains and lead to a rebound in inflation\u201d. However, Gourinchas added: \u201cSigns of strain are growing in interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as construction, and loan activity has declined markedly. \u201cIt will be equally important to pivot toward monetary normalisation in time, as several emerging markets where inflation is well on the way down have started doing already. Not doing so would jeopardise growth and risk inflation falling below target. \u201cMy sense is that the US, where inflation appears more demand-driven, needs to focus on risks in the first category, while the euro area, where the surge in energy prices has played a disproportionate role, needs to manage more the second risk. In both cases, staying on the path toward a soft landing may not be easy.\u201d The IMF produces two full versions of the WEO each year, in April and October, then updates its forecasts in January and July. The latest interim WEO revised up US growth for 2023 from 2.1% to 2.5%, China from 5% to 5.2%, India from 6.3% to 6.7% and Russia from 2.2% to 3%. The eurozone, in contrast, performed less strongly in 2023 than previously forecast and its growth has been revised down by 0.2 percentage points to 0.5%."

            "date": "2024-01-16T16:56:41Z",
            "content": "US Navy Seals boarded a boat heading for Yemen and seized Iranian-made missile components and other weaponry bound for Houthi forces, in an operation in which two Seal commandos went missing, the US military has said. US Central Command (Centcom) posted pictures of the missile parts on X, including what appeared to be the components of a complete small missile, rocket motors and guidance systems, as well as a photograph of the small cargo vessel that was allegedly carrying the arms. The seizure followed US and UK airstrikes on Houthi positions in an effort to stop the Yemeni rebels\u2019 attacks on shipping passing through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The incident, which Centcom said took place last Thursday, illustrated the potential for the conflict to continue to spread and draw in Iran directly, as the US and its allies seek to cut off the Houthis\u2019 arms supplies. In the latest of a string of attacks on Red Sea shipping, a Greek-owned cargo ship was hit by a missile off the coast of Yemen on Tuesday as it headed to the Suez canal. Greek officials said the Zografia, which remained navigable, had been sailing from Vietnam to Israel. The Centcom statement said that arms seizure happened as its naval forces were conducting a \u201cflag verification\u201d of a dhow near the coast of Somalia. It said Navy Seal commandos based on the USS Lewis Puller, which is classed as an expeditionary mobile base vessel, executed a \u201ccomplex\u201d night-time boarding, with the support of helicopters and drones, and seized Iranian-made ballistic and cruise missiles components. The cargo was alleged to include propulsion, guidance, and warheads for medium-range ballistic missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), and parts for air defence systems. \u201cInitial analysis indicates these same weapons have been employed by the Houthis to threaten and attack innocent mariners on international merchant ships transiting in the Red Sea,\u201d the US statement said, concluding that the dhow was \u201cconducting illegal transport of advanced lethal aid from Iran to resupply Houthi forces in Yemen as part of the Houthis\u2019 ongoing campaign of attacks against international merchant shipping.\u201d Two Navy Seals who were declared missing on Monday were involved in the operation, Centcom said. According to US reports citing defence officials, the Seals approached the dhow in small special operations combat boats. At 8pm, as they were boarding the boat in high seas with 8-ft (2.4-metre) swells, one Seal commando was knocked into the sea by a high wave and another dived in after him, following protocol for such an incident. Both are still missing. \u201cWe are conducting an exhaustive search for our missing teammates,\u201d Gen Michael Erik Kurilla, the Centcom commander, said. The dhow\u2019s 14-strong crew was taken into custody and held while a decision was made on where they should be taken under international law, and the boat itself was deemed unsafe and sunk. The US and UK have launched airstrikes over the past few days aimed at Houthi missile and drone sites and command centres, but a US official told CNN that those strikes had destroyed less than a third of the Houthis\u2019 offensive capabilities. An American-owned, Marshall Islands-flagged container ship, the Gibraltar Eagle, was struck by a missile on Monday while in the Gulf of Aden, but not badly damaged. Reuters reported on Tuesday that the US had carried out a new strike on Tuesday targeting Houthi anti-ship missiles. EU member states have meanwhile given initial backing to create a European naval mission to help protect shipping from Houthi rebels, European diplomats said on Tuesday. Such a mission would reinforce a US-led naval taskforce, Prosperity Guardian, established last month, as western powers struggle to keep the route linking the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, open to global shipping."

            "date": "2024-01-13T02:02:29Z",
            "content": "The US has carried out fresh strikes on Yemen, a day after a first raid triggered mass protests in the country\u2019s capital and other Middle Eastern countries voiced concern that the attacks could trigger further unrest in the region. The strike, carried out by the USS Carney early on Saturday, targeted a Houthi rebel radar site in Yemen and was a \u201cfollow-on action\u201d on a target \u201cassociated with strikes taken on Jan 12 designed to degrade the Houthi\u2019s ability to attack maritime vessels\u201d, the US military said in a statement on Twitter. The additional strikes were much smaller in scope than the previous night \u2013 which hit almost 30 locations \u2013 a US official told broadcaster CNN. The Iran-backed militants\u2019 official media earlier said the Al-Dailami airbase in Yemen\u2019s rebel-held capital of Sana\u2019a had been struck. Earlier on Friday, the director of the US joint staff, Lieut Gen Douglas Sims, told journalists the Houthis had launched an anti-ship ballistic missile in retaliation for Thursday night\u2019s strikes but it had not hit a vessel. \u201cAll American-British interests have become legitimate targets\u201d for the Houthis following the strikes, the rebels\u2019 Supreme Political Council said, while Hussein al-Ezzi, the rebels\u2019 deputy foreign minister, said the US and Britain must \u201cprepare to pay a heavy price\u201d. Five people were killed and six injured in Thursday night\u2019s offensive that the Houthis said on Friday had targeted 73 sites in the capital Sana\u2019a, around the port city of Hodeidah and three other regions. The UK and US defended the attacks, which marked a major escalation of the crisis in the Middle East triggered by the Israel-Gaza war, but leaders in the region condemned them for inflaming tensions in an already volatile climate. A vast crowd of people waving Yemeni and Palestinian flags and chanting \u201cdeath to America, death to Israel,\u201d gathered in Sana\u2019a\u2019s central square to protest against the western bombing, and other protests took place in at least two other major cities in Houthi-controlled areas of the country. Yahya Sare\u2019e, a spokesperson for the Houthi military, accused \u201cthe American-British enemy\u201d of launching brutal aggression \u201cas part of its support for the continuation of Israeli crime in Gaza\u201d. The intervention \u201cwill not go unanswered and unpunished\u201d, he said. Reports emerged late on Friday night from the UK\u2019s Maritime Trade Operation of a missile being fired at an unnamed vessel 90 nautical miles south-east of Aden in Yemen. It landed 400 to 500m short of the ship and no damage was reported. The US on Friday said that 28 locations had been hit in the initial strikes, using more than 150 munitions, while Britain\u2019s Royal Air Force bombed two, a sweeping bombing campaign intended to halt a spate of Houthi attacks on shipping in the southern Red Sea that has disrupted world trade and threatened to push up inflation. \u201cI know we have degraded [the Houthis\u2019] capability,\u201d said Lt Gen Douglas Sims. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that they would be able to execute the same way they did the other day. But we will see.\u201d In a letter to congress, president Joe Biden said that he ordered the strikes to protect US personnel, and disrupt the Houthis\u2019 ability to carry out future attacks in the Red Sea, warning: \u201cThe United States stands ready to take further action, as necessary and appropriate, to address further threats or attacks.\u201d The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said during a visit to Kyiv that he believed the attacks represented \u201cnecessary, proportionate and targeted action\u201d which had successfully degraded the Houthis\u2019 military capability. The bombing was justified because the Houthis were deterring merchant shipping from using the busy international waterway, Sunak said. \u201cPeople can\u2019t act like this with impunity and that\u2019s why together with allies we\u2019ve decided to take this action,\u201d he said. The White House national security spokesperson, John Kirby, told MSNBC that the airstrikes had sought to target the Houthis\u2019 ability to store, launch and guide missiles and drones, and insisted the bombing of Yemen was not escalatory. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for conflict with Iran. We\u2019re not looking to escalate and there\u2019s no reason for it to escalate beyond what happened over the last few days,\u201d he said, although he called on Iran to stop supporting the Houthis by helping to supply them with the missiles and drones used in the Red Sea. The UK defence secretary, Grant Shapps, also said that Iran could de-escalate tensions. Asked his message to Tehran in an interview with the Telegraph, he said: \u201cYou must get the Houthi rebels, others who are acting as proxies for you, Lebanese Hezbollah are obvious examples, [and] some in Iraq and Syria, you must get these different organisations to cease and desist because we are, the world is, running out of patience.\u201d Experts warned, however, that the western bombing, though at the high end of the range expected, would be unlikely to deter the Houthis from attempting some form of retaliation in turn risking further airstrikes against one of the world\u2019s poorest countries. Fabian Hinz, a Middle East expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the scale of the US strikes was \u201cclearly not symbolic\u201d but that \u201cif you look at the drones and missiles that the Houthis have been using against international shipping, they are mobile and compact and the Houthis are experts at hiding them\u201d. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called on all sides \u201cnot to escalate\u201d the volatile situation in the Red Sea, his spokesman said on Friday. Later, Khaled Khiari, assistant secretary general for the Middle East, told the UN security council: \u201cWe are witnessing the cycle of violence that risks grave political security, economic and humanitarian repercussions in Yemen and the region. \u201cThese developments in the Red Sea and the risk of exacerbating regional tensions are alarming,\u201d he said. Before the bombing the Houthi leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, said: \u201cAny American attack will not remain without a response.\u201d Hinz said: \u201cThey are talking like they are in a war with the US and they will not want to walk away from that.\u201d Aid agencies said they were alarmed by the prospect of further fighting in a country just emerging from a nine-year civil war and called for de-escalation. An Oxfam spokesperson said: \u201cThe humanitarian situation in Yemen remains dire with almost 21 million people in desperate need of food, water and life-saving aid. It is vital that peace is restored and further suffering prevented.\u201d Western military sources believe that any Houthi retaliation would be most likely to be aimed at international shipping, but the prospect of the rebel group trying to escalate further by targeting US and UK military bases around the Arabian peninsular with medium-range missiles is of particular concern. The Houthis, who are backed by Iran, control the north and west of Yemen. They have conducted 27 attacks against international shipping in the southern Red Sea area since mid-October in what they say is a concerted campaign to target ships with Israeli links in support of Hamas in Gaza. Many of the their attacks, however, have been directed at merchant ships without Israeli links, prompting the US and a coalition of allies to dispatch warships to the Red Sea to protect shipping lanes, see off raiding boats and shoot down missiles and drones when necessary. The White House said Biden had decided to bomb targets in Yemen on Tuesday, shortly after the Houthis attacked a fleet of US and UK warships with 18 drones and three missiles. Once that attack was repelled, the US president directed the country\u2019s military to respond, and Sunak decided to join in soon. Middle Eastern leaders voiced concern that the attacks risked further escalation in the region at a time when Israel\u2019s assault on Hamas in Gaza was ongoing, and tensions on the country\u2019s northern border with Hezbollah group, also backed by Iran, were high. Most vocal was Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the president of Nato member Turkey. \u201cIt is as if they aspire to turn the Red Sea into a bloodbath,\u201d he said, accusing the US and UK of acting disproportionately, and indicating that he expected the Houthis to retaliate by giving \u201cthe necessary response in the region\u201d. Saudi Arabia, which is engaged in peace talks with the Houthis, said it was monitoring the situation with great concern. Riyadh said: \u201cThe kingdom emphasises the importance of maintaining the security and stability of the Red Sea region, as the freedom of navigation in it is an international demand.\u201d No other country was prepared to participate in the US-UK bombing, although it received help from Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands. Denmark, Germany, New Zealand and South Korea signed a statement in support of the action, and France said the Houthis were to blame for the escalation."

            "date": "2024-01-30T19:50:48Z",
            "content": "The European Union has to make bold decisions to defend Ukraine, pre-empting any US decision to withhold or reduce its military support, Emmanuel Macron has said. In a speech in Sweden, which hopes to be the next country to join Nato, the French president also said the future security architecture of Europe, including arms control agreements covering European territory, could no longer be settled simply by the US and Russia, and Europe had to have a right to determine its own future. His remarks were designed as a warning to Europe that it needs to ramp up its whole defence effort and prepare for the possibility that either Joe Biden will be unable to push his military assistance budget for Ukraine through Congress, or that later in the year he is defeated in a presidential election by an isolationist Donald Trump. But Macron also argued that if Europe did step up, and helped to prevent a Russian victory, the US through Nato could no longer have a monopoly in determining future relations with Moscow. Speaking at the Swedish defence academy alongside Sweden\u2019s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, Macron said: \u201cThis is a decisive and testing moment for Europe. We must be ready to act to defend and support Ukraine whatever it takes and whatever America decides.\u201d He added: \u201cEurope had been lucky to have America as a partner but we have to be lucid. Ukraine is part of the European continent and whatever America decides we have to take the right and bold decisions to support Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.\u201d Insisting that Europe must do whatever it takes for years to come, and at whatever cost, he said it must be made impossible for Russia to win, since if it did then Europe would be without a functioning security architecture with consequences in Nato\u2019s eastern flank, the Caucasus and central Asia. Macron said: \u201cThe real cost to us of a Russian victory in the short and long run is too high for all of us.\u201d He said it would require Europe scaling up its own defence production effort so that Ukraine can be in a position to negotiate a sustainable peace The French president praised the way the EU had responded to Russian aggression for two years, including by putting the European defence industry on a war footing, increasing spending and developing more common capacities. But he said: \u201cEven though we can be proud of recent decisions, we have to do much more.\u201d If the EU compared spending on defence with the way Vladimir Putin had readapted his entire defence budget, the EU had not done enough, he said. Macron said: \u201cRussia managed to completely readapt that system, so we have to react and even overreact to be alongside with Ukrainians.\u201d Calling for a strengthening of production, he said Europe had to be ready to take national and European decisions that pre-empted any US decision to minimise vulnerability. He insisted his call for greater European defence interoperability need not be seen as undermining Nato. He also called for greater European cooperation and autonomy on energy. \u201cFor years and years we thought trading and exchanging energy with Russia was the best way to prevent a war,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a mistake. It was the best way to suffer from a war and suffer from a unilateral decision.\u201d Macron said that in future European energy needed a greater diversity of suppliers. He said the invasion in Russia occurred in part because Europe had been a geopolitical minority with strategic defence negotiations conducted solely by the US and Russia, leaving the EU largely excluded. The arms controls and security treaties \u201caffecting our territory were decided by the big guys, and not by the Europeans\u201d, he said. \u201cIn the future when it is about the intermediate nuclear range forces treaty, when it is about deployments, when it is about arms control for today and tomorrow, when it is about designing an architecture of security, we have to be the one to decide. \u201cOur involvement with Ukraine is not just to prevent a Russian victory but for us to decide our own future and to be around the table because Ukraine is part of our continent.\u201d Macron added: \u201cThere is no future for ourselves and our children if we are not in a situation to build the new architecture of security of arms control in our neighbourhood. We have to be the one who decides for ourselves and not delegate it to others, even if they are very good allies, because they live on the other side of the ocean.\u201d"

            "content": "The family of a New Orleans-area teenager who was reportedly shot dead by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank on Friday mourned the high schooler this weekend while also criticizing US military support for Israel. \u201cThey are killer machines \u2013 they are using our tax dollars in the US to support the weapons to kill our own children,\u201d Hafez Ajaq, the father of late 17-year-old Tawfiq Ajaq, said of Israel\u2019s forces, according to the Associated Press. Speaking on Saturday during his son\u2019s funeral, he added: \u201cHow many fathers and mothers have to say goodbye to their children? How many more?\u201d In the summer of 2023, Tawfiq\u2019s parents brought him and his four siblings to the village of Al-Mazra\u2019a ash-Sharqiya, in the West Bank, so the family could reconnect with their Palestinian roots. The circumstances of his killing remain under investigation. A relative has said he was barbecuing in a village field before Israeli authorities claimed an encounter with an off-duty police officer, a soldier and a civilian left him dead. Tawfiq (also identified in some reports as Tawfic Abdeljabbar) grew up in Gretna, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans on the west bank of the Mississippi River, according to local NBC affiliate WDSU. His family said he attended Muslim Academy in Gretna as well as the local Catholic college preparatory Brother Martin and planned to enroll at the University of New Orleans after finishing high school in Palestine. An uncle of Tawfiq said the teen passionately supported New Orleans\u2019s National Football League franchise, the Saints, and enjoyed beignets, French doughnuts covered in powdered sugar that are popular in the city. He also often played basketball with friends outside their mosque in Harvey, near Gretna, the local news outlet NOLA.com reported. \u201c[He was] a New Orleans native \u2013 a New Orleanian just like me and you,\u201d Mohammad Abdeljabber told WDSU. The vice-principal of Gretna\u2019s Muslim Academy, Sherean Muran, told NOLA.com that Ajaq was \u201ca good kid \u2026 certainly a dreamer and always the center of attention\u201d. The White House said it is \u201cseriously concerned\u201d by reports about the Palestinian American\u2019s killing east of Ramallah. On Monday, a US state department spokesperson told reporters that the US government was \u201cdevastated about the killing\u201d and had \u201ccalled for an urgent investigation to determine the circumstance of his death\u201d. A relative of Tawfiq, Joe Abdel Qaki, told the Associated Press that the teen and a friend were having a barbecue in a village field when Israeli bullets struck him in the head and chest. Abdel Qaki said he helped load Tawfiq on to an ambulance once he arrived at the field shortly after the shooting. He described being briefly detained alongside other Palestinians by Israeli forces who demanded IDs. Tawfiq died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, he added. Israeli police said Tawfiq was shot dead during an encounter \u201costensibly involving an off-duty law enforcement officer, a soldier and a civilian\u201d. They did not say who shot Tawfiq, adding the case was under investigation and saying the gunfire was meant for people \u201cpurportedly engaged in rock-throwing activities\u201d. Investigations surrounding the deadly shootings of Palestinians by Israeli police and military members are usually slow and rarely result in criminal charges. Nonetheless, Mohammad Abdeljabber said he hoped his nephew\u2019s killers \u201care brought to justice\u201d. \u201cThey say it\u2019s under investigation \u2013 they\u2019re trying to gather more information, but we\u2019ve heard that plenty of times before, never seen any results from it,\u201d Abdeljabber told WDSU. \u201cI hope this one changes that.\u201d Nabil Abukhader, the president of the Harvey mosque which Tawfiq attended, also said: \u201cWe lost a good kid, an American citizen.\u201d Tawfiq\u2019s death occurred on the same day that leading progressive and Jewish members of Congress criticized the US\u2019s military support for Israel after its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, declared bluntly that he opposed a Palestinian state following the ongoing war in Gaza. Netanyahu\u2019s comments were a pointed rejection of the Biden administration\u2019s policy in the region at a time when the president has asked Congress for an additional $14bn in aid to Israel. Israel receives about $3.8bn annually in US security assistance. After an attack by Hamas on Israel that killed about 1,200 people on 7 October, Israeli military operations in Gaza since have killed more than 24,000 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry. At least 369 had been killed by Israeli troops and settlers in the occupied West Bank since October, including 95 children, Reuters reported on Monday. The Associated Press contributed reporting"

            "date": "2024-01-31T11:55:36Z",
            "content": "The head of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards has said the country is not afraid of war with the US, as the Pentagon weighs how directly to respond to the killing of three US military personnel in a drone attack in Jordan. The IRGC commander-in-chief, Maj Gen Hossein Salami, said: \u201cWe hear some threats from American officials about targeting Iran. We tell them that you tested us and we know each other. We do not leave any threat unanswered, and we do not look for war, but we are not afraid of it. This is the well-known truth.\u201d It is expected that more Iran-backed militia in Iraq are preparing to follow the example of Kataib Hezbollah, the group blamed for the fatal drone attack on the US service base on Sunday, and suspend operations against US bases as they attempt to stave off an imminent American attack. Kataib Hezbollah, the most powerful member of the Islamic Resistance group in Iraq, announced the decision on Tuesday. It appears to have taken its decision following pressure from Iran to de-escalate. The UK defence secretary, Grant Shapps, has flown to Washington for talks about the crisis, including the possible deployment of a British aircraft carrier to the Red Sea to act as a substitute for the USS Dwight D Eisenhower, which is due to end its tour of duty at an as yet unspecified point. Houthi forces continued to fire missiles at US naval ships in the Red Sea, but no damage was caused. On Tuesday, Kataib Hezbollah said it would halt its attacks on American forces in the Middle East. \u201cWe\u2019re announcing the suspension of our military and security operations against the occupying forces to avoid any embarrassment for the Iraqi government,\u201d it wrote on its website. It insisted that it took its actions independent of Iran, but it now looks likely that other Iran-backed militia in Iraq will also suspend operations, a move that is likely to be coordinated with Tehran. Kataib Hezbollah absolved Iran of all responsibility for the drone strike. Its statement said: \u201cOur brothers in the resistance, especially in the Islamic Republic, do not even know the nature of our jihad/military operations. Many times they even objected to pressure and escalation against the Americans in Iraq and Syria. Militia are ordered to temporarily defend passively if any hostile American action occurs towards them.\u201d The statement may be designed as a piece of information warfare intended to make the US look like the side guilty of escalating matters, if a revenge attack goes ahead. But there has also been intense political pressure from Iraq\u2019s prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, urging the militia to close down the front against the US. A cessation of attacks on US bases may reduce the huge pressure from the Republican party on President Joe Biden to attack Iran directly. The director of the CIA, William Burns, made no attempt to disguise his assessment that Iran is at the root of the conflict. Writing in Foreign Affairs magazine he said: \u201cKey to Israel\u2019s \u2013 and the region\u2019s \u2013 security is dealing with Iran. The Iranian regime has been emboldened by the crisis and seems ready to fight to its last regional proxy, all while expanding its nuclear programme and enabling Russian aggression.\u201d Washington has promised a \u201cvery consequential\u201d response to the attacks. John Kirby, the White House\u2019s national security spokesperson, said the US had still not identified the specific group that attacked the US base, but believed the militants had Iranian backing. \u201cWe\u2019re still working through the analysis, but clearly the work has all the hallmarks of groups that are backed by the IRGC and in fact by Hezbollah as well,\u201d he said. Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group said on Wednesday it would keep up attacks on US and British warships in the Red Sea in what it called acts of self-defence, stoking fears of long-term disruptions to world trade. Ameen Hayyan, the group\u2019s military spokesperson, said Houthi forces had fired at USS Gravely late on Tuesday, adding: \u201cAll American and British warships in the Red [Sea] \u2026 will be targeted within the legitimate defence of our country.\u201d James Heappey, the UK armed forces minister, said on Tuesday that the UK could \u201ccooperate with the Americans\u201d and step in to \u201cplug a gap\u201d in the Red Sea. The UK has two aircraft carriers designed to carry F-35 fighter jets. One is HMS Prince of Wales, which would face its first combat operation if it were deployed. The other is HMS Queen Elizabeth, which has been sent into combat once before. American F-35B jets have taken off from the deck of HMS Queen Elizabeth during Operation Shader against Islamic State. A separate EU naval mission to protect shipping in the Red Sea will move a step closer when EU defence ministers decide which country should take command. The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, was in Saudi Arabia for further talks on how to secure a lengthy humanitarian pause in Gaza and a mass release of hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. He also met with leaders of the UN-recognised government in Yemen to discuss Houthi attacks on shipping Cameron\u2019s talks focus on the work Arab officials have been doing with the Palestinian Authority on how it can be revitalised after the war and take administrative charge of Gaza and the West Bank. The UK wants to see the current president, Mahmoud Abbas, either stand down or cede some power to his prime minister. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, is also due to travel to the region next week. Saudi Arabia has said it is not interested in helping with the reconstruction of Gaza unless there is a clear pathway to a two-state solution supported by Israel. Cameron has caused a stir by holding out the hope of recognising Palestine before the end of the peace talks."

She is right: while certainly highlighting the role of Russia, in particular, in stoking nuclear confrontation, the programme closes with the bizarre claim that \u201cafter a long battle [the Greenham women] succeeded\u201d in forcing the government to rescind the decision to station Nato intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) here. This is at least the second time that the BBC has promoted such disinformation. On the 25th anniversary of the initial encampment at Greenham Common, the Guardian invited me to comment on this claim. The resultant article (from 2006) is still on your website; it sets out the timeline in detail, showing how \u2013 at the end of 1987 \u2013 \u201cthe moderate leadership of the Soviet Union concludes an INF Treaty with Nato, based explicitly on [President Reagan\u2019s 1981] \u2018zero option\u2019 offer.

Whatever the shortcomings of Jane Corbin\u2019s investigation, it opens an opportunity for serious public discussion on the deadly implications of nuclear weapon possession and use. Notably, the British government \u2013 and nuclear weapons industry representatives \u2013 were absent from the documentary.

            "date": "2024-01-08T18:16:01Z",
            "content": "The top director responsible for safety and security at Sellafield is to leave the vast nuclear waste dump in north-west England, it has emerged. Mark Neate, the Sellafield environment, safety and security director, is to leave the organisation later this year. Neate reports directly to Euan Hutton, the interim chief executive of Sellafield, the nuclear waste and decommissioning site in Cumbria, which is also the world\u2019s largest store of plutonium. Multiple safety and cybersecurity failings, as well as claims of a \u201ctoxic\u201d working culture, were revealed in Nuclear Leaks, a year-long Guardian investigation into Sellafield, last month. The energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, said the reports were \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and wrote to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), the state-owned body which ultimately runs Sellafield, demanding a \u201cfull explanation\u201d. In his response last month, the NDA chief executive, David Peattie, said there had been \u201cnecessary changes to the leadership, governance, and risk management of cyber\u201d and responsibility for its cyber function had been moved. A new head of cybersecurity was due to take up the role this month, which Peattie said would ensure \u201csustained focus and leadership on this matter\u201d. Sellafield said Neate had responsibility for cybersecurity operations until January 2023, when control was shifted to report to its chief information officer. It declined to say whether Neate\u2019s departure was related to cybersecurity and safety failings at the site and said that he made the decision to leave last autumn. Sources claimed the timing of the exit of Sellafield\u2019s longest-serving director was related to the company\u2019s performance in critical areas including safety and security. After the Guardian approached Sellafield for comment on Neate\u2019s departure, the company released a statement saying that Neate would be in post for \u201cseveral more months\u201d and was leaving after a \u201ccareer dedicated to ensuring the safety and security of the Sellafield site and its workforce\u201d. Neate said: \u201cI took stock at the end of the summer break and ultimately decided that 2024 was the right time for me to move on.\u201d Neate joined Sellafield in 2012 and has held a number of roles, including director of security and resilience. He has a military background, including as a strategist during the Iraq war and working with the US army under the then general David Petraeus. Sellafield is yet to confirm an exact leaving date for the executive. In an interview in 2022, Neate said he was proud of Sellafield\u2019s security record, and acknowledged his responsibilities. \u201cIf we sneeze here the whole industry gets a cold,\u201d he said. \u201cI do see it as fun,\u201d he said of his job. Sellafield has \u201cmore work to do\u201d to reduce safety incidents, according to its annual accounts for the year to March 2023 which were published in late December. The accounts showed that annual operating costs at the taxpayer-funded site climbed by \u00a3170m to \u00a32.5bn. Last financial year the company pleaded guilty to a prosecution brought by the Office for Nuclear Regulation under health and safety regulations after an employee was injured falling from a scaffold ladder while carrying out repair work. The company was fined \u00a3400,000 and ordered to pay \u00a329,210 in costs as well as a surcharge of \u00a3190. The GMB trade union last month called on the government and nuclear authorities to take \u201curgent action\u201d to address concerns over safety at Sellafield. Sellafield, which has more than 11,000 staff, was last year placed into a form of \u201cspecial measures\u201d for consistent failings on cybersecurity, according to sources at the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the security services. Sellafield said it did not have evidence of a successful cyber-attack after the Guardian revealed that groups linked to Russia and China had penetrated its networks. A spokesperson for Sellafield said: \u201cMark Neate has made the decision to leave Sellafield following a decade of dedicated service working as environment, safety and security director. \u201cMark has brought significant value to Sellafield over the past decade, including the role that he played in running our response to the Covid crisis, and we are sad to see him go. \u201cHe made the decision in autumn last year to leave the company, and will continue in his role to ensure a smooth transition to his successor.\u201d Sellafield issued a range of responses to the Guardian\u2019s reports into its cybersecurity, safety and cultural issues, which it published online."

            "date": "2024-01-24T06:00:07Z",
            "content": "Nuclear power generation is likely to break records in 2025 as more countries invest in reactors to fuel the shift to a low-carbon global economy, while renewable energy is likely to overtake coal as a power source early next year, data has shown. China, India, Korea and Europe are likely to have new reactors come on stream, while several in Japan are also forecast to return to generation, and French output should increase, according to a report on the state of global electricity markets published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) on Wednesday. Electricity demand is also expected to increase around the world, fuelled largely by the move to a low-carbon economy. Electric vehicles and heat pumps, as well as many low-carbon industrial processes, require electricity rather than oil and gas. Continuing rapid growth in renewable energy supply means these additional demands are likely to be covered in full by generation from wind, solar and other clean energy sources. Renewables will make up roughly a third of total electricity generation globally by early next year. Dave Jones, the insights director at energy thinktank Ember, said the findings marked a potential turning point. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era,\u201d he said. \u201cFinally, the world seems like it is past peak fossil power, a crucial milestone in the energy transition. [This report] shows that 2023 will mark the end of fossil power growth. As of this year we are likely to be in a new era of declining fossil power.\u201d But he added: \u201cPeaking is not enough \u2013 we need deep and rapid CO2 cuts to keep within our vanishingly small carbon budget. We are doing the right things, we just need to do them even faster.\u201d Fatih Birol, the IEA\u2019s executive director, hailed the developments as a positive sign for the fight against climate breakdown, though he said far more effort was needed. \u201cThe power sector produces more carbon dioxide emissions than any other in the world economy, so it\u2019s encouraging to see that the rapid growth of renewables and a steady expansion of nuclear power are on course to match all the increase in global electricity demand over the next three years,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is largely thanks to the huge momentum behind renewables, with ever cheaper solar leading the way, and support from the important comeback of nuclear power. While more progress is needed, and fast, these are very promising trends.\u201d The IEA\u2019s annual analysis of market developments and policies, Electricity 2024, published on Wednesday, showed that global electricity demand increased by 2.2% in 2023, and was likely to reach about 3.4% from 2024 to 2026. Most of the increase was expected to come from rapidly emerging economies:chiefly China, India and south-east Asia. However, the IEA also warned that the growth of power capacity was still uneven around the world. For instance, while electricity supply has increased overall in Africa, on a per capita basis power use across the continent has remained stagnant for more than three decades. This is a brake on economic and social development, as people in poverty turn to polluting sources of energy such as biomass and paraffin. A lack of readily available electricity also holds back children from education and imperils health whenever hospitals experience blackouts. Birol said: \u201cThe international community needs to work with African governments to enable the urgent progress [in electricity access] that is needed.\u201d Africa has some of the world\u2019s greatest potential for solar and wind generation, and many of the vital minerals needed for renewable generation components, but would-be generators face large obstacles in the form of a high cost of capital for renewable energy projects. Many governments are urging institutions such as the World Bank to adjust their practices to make such development easier."

The landslide is slowly moving towards \u00d8lst, a village of 400 inhabitants south of Randers in Jutland, after the soil started moving at a nearby plant, run by Nordic Waste, where it has already demolished buildings. At least 2m tonnes of contaminated soil is believed to be moving at 2 metres a day \u2013 having slowed down from 9 metres a day \u2013 and is predicted by experts to be heading towards the village. It is feared it could pollute the Alling \u00c5 River. A report by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) into the scandal, which has prompted outrage across Denmark, found the landslide was caused by human, not natural, activity. It is understood to include material from Norway. Cleanup costs are expected to reach 205m Danish kroner (\u00a323.5m) over the next six months and could eventually run into the billions. Nordic Waste, whose website tagline is \u201cwe give the earth new life\u201d, last week declared itself bankrupt, saying: \u201cUnfortunately, the landslide has reached such a scale that we as a company are unable to take up the task of combating it.\u201d Rene M\u00f8ller Larsen, whose business is 500 metres up the hill from the landslide and has lived in the area for decades, said the usually peaceful rural community had been left shaken. \u201cThey have been shocked. And then the garbage [contaminated soil] was moving so fast. The worst case was it came to the village,\u201d he said. While the progress of the landslide has slowed significantly, he believes it will take months before the full impact becomes clear. \u201cWhat is the meaning of taking garbage to Denmark? They only see one thing: money.\u201d There had been speculation in Denmark that the landslide may have been caused by recent heavy rain. However Kristian Svennevig, a senior GEUS researcher and one of the authors of the report into the disaster, said it found evidence dating back to 2021 of the movement, which gathered pace last year before becoming public in December. \u201cWhat we concluded is that it is not a natural phenomenon, it is a man-made phenomenon and climate change is not to blame,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is basically the polluted soil itself that is sliding and it started sliding in the relatively dry years of 2021 and 2022, which is something you would not expect from a natural landslide.\u201d While some of the most imminent dangers have been mitigated, millions of tonnes of contaminated soil are still on the move and it is not yet certain how fast it is moving or how far it will reach. The environment minister, Magnus Heunicke, has said the disaster is still in \u201cthe acute phase\u201d. Svennevig said the creation of a computer model of the landslide would help to better constrain its future path and that the disaster was \u201calready the biggest in this century and it is still developing\u201d. Nordic Waste and the Danish government have been contacted for comment."

            "date": "2024-01-09T14:25:01Z",
            "content": "A threat to blackmail the president of the US\u2019s National Association of Realtors has forced her to resign from the organization which bills itself as the largest professional trade group in the country, she announced on Monday. Tracy Kasper\u2019s abrupt resignation from the presidency of a realtors association that counts on 1.5 million members comes during a particularly turbulent time in the organization\u2019s history \u2013 her predecessor stepped down months earlier when confronted with sexual harassment claims. A statement on Monday from the realtors association recounted how Kasper had informed the group\u2019s leadership that she \u201crecently received a threat to disclose a past personal, non-financial matter unless she compromised her position\u201d. \u201cShe refused to do so and instead reported the threat to law enforcement,\u201d the association\u2019s statement said. Nonetheless, Kasper said \u201cit was best for the organization that she step down,\u201d the statement added. \u201cAs president and a long-time member \u2026 I always have put the interests of [the association] first,\u201d read a statement attributed to Kasper. \u201cAs a result of the recent threat and given the significance of this moment for myself, my family and the organization, it is again time for me to put the interests of [the association] first. So, it is with a mix of gratitude and a heavy heart that I submit my resignation as \u2026 president effective immediately.\u201d The association named Kevin Sears, a broker from Springfield, Massachusetts, as Kasper\u2019s successor. The members of the association \u2013 which touts a strict code of ethics \u2013 participate in the residential and commercial real-estate industries. CNN Business has previously reported that the association is powerful, with more than $1bn in assets as well as a political action committee that raised more than $80m during the 2022 midterm election cycle. However, the real-estate industry as a whole has grappled in recent years with high mortgage rates, which in turn caused home sales to plummet to historic lows amid an unaffordable market, as CNN Business reported. Then, in August, the association made unflattering news headlines when Kasper\u2019s predecessor, Kenny Parcell, was the subject of a New York Times article reporting sexual harassment accusations against him. Past and present employees of the association alleged that Parcell engaged in \u201ca pattern of behavior that included improper touching and lewd photos and texts\u201d. Parcell denied the accusations in the article. But two days later the association announced his resignation from the presidency. Kasper assumed the association\u2019s reins at that point, pledging in a statement she would foster \u201ca welcoming, safe and respectful workplace\u201d. In November, Kasper lost her chief executive at the association when he resigned a couple of days after the organization and two brokerages were held liable for $1.8bn in damages. Federal jurors in Missouri hearing the case found the defendants had conspired to maintain artificially high real-estate agent commissions. The association has said it plans to appeal the verdict. The tumult prompted one real-estate agent to launch a group aimed at holding the organization accountable. That agent, Jason Haber, said on Monday on X that he welcomed Kasper\u2019s departure yet was gravely concerned by its alleged circumstances. \u201cNo one should be the victim of threats, intimidation or harassment,\u201d Haber wrote. \u201cIf that happened to Ms Kasper, that person should be prosecuted to the fullest extent under the law.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-12T06:00:21Z",
            "content": "A life on the road had caught up with Alphonce Wambua. Twenty-five years of transporting cargo between the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, and the coastal city of Mombasa, nine hours\u2019 drive away, had resulted in long days, a poor diet and an irregular sleep routine for the trucker. Still, it came as a shock when doctors told him he had hypertension a few years ago. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting it \u2013 I thought I just had serious fatigue,\u201d says Wambua, who has stopped by the clinic where he was diagnosed to pick up his monthly prescription. \u201cThis job is high pressure. There\u2019s not much rest: you either have a client waiting for you to drop cargo or pick it up.\u201d The health facility, based in Mlolongo, on the busy Nairobi-Mombasa highway, attracts a steady flow of patients. As well as workers and residents from the area, it also treats drivers from the truckers\u2019 rest stop across the road, as one of 19 roadside health facilities run by the nonprofit North Star Alliance, offering priority healthcare to mobile populations. The organisation, which constructs clinics out of shipping containers, has set up facilities along major transport routes, transit towns, and border crossings across east and southern Africa to increase mobile workers\u2019 access to medical services. \u201cWhen governments do their health planning, they usually plan for communities, but no one plans for mobile workers,\u201d says Jacob Okoth, a programmes manager at North Star Alliance. \u201cTheir operating hours are different, so you can\u2019t reach them with the traditional 8am-5pm healthcare service delivery model, and many can only afford to queue for short wait times.\u201d North Star was founded in 2006 to tackle HIV and STD cases in the transport sector during the height of the Aids epidemic, when some transport companies were losing more than 50% of their drivers to the disease. It extended its services to cover broader health issues after identifying other recurring health concerns among mobile workers, including non-communicable diseases. NCDs such as hypertension and diabetes are responsible for more than half of hospital admissions and deaths in Kenya. Health practitioners warn that the growing burden demands new approaches for prevention, diagnosis and treatment. North Star\u2019s clinics provided health services to more than 180,000 patients in the region in 2022, nearly third of whom were truck drivers. In 2023, its clinics treated 2,332 people for hypertension and diabetes, a relatively small number due to limited funding. Many of the NGO\u2019s health centres are along the northern corridor, one of east Africa\u2019s busiest transport routes, which connects several countries in the region. Truck drivers who transport cargo along the corridor can travel for 12-hour stretches with short breaks in between, sometimes for weeks or months at a time. In some areas, the distances between hospitals are long; drivers often delay seeking care due to time pressures or irregular work cycles. Because people with illnesses such as hypertension may not show symptoms early on, a number stumble upon their diagnosis. Billy Odhiambo, a clinician at North Star\u2019s Mlolongo clinic, says: \u201cThey came for another condition and then discover that they have hypertension. Considering high blood pressure is a life threatening condition, detecting it early can save lives.\u201d Regular health checkups are essential for truckers, whose sedentary lifestyle predisposes them to weight gain and non-communicable diseases. Many rely on high-carbohydrate meals to keep them full on long drives, and they struggle to maintain a balanced diet due to time and cost pressures, says Wambua, whose go-to meal is the Kenyan staple ugali (boiled maize meal), which he eats with fermented milk. Having simple meals, he says, also helps him avoid stomach upsets. At rest stops, he usually grabs a snack or fizzy drink. \u201cYou\u2019re not focused on eating healthy food \u2013 you eat what you find and continue with the journey,\u201d he says, while a clinician takes his blood pressure and writes him a new prescription. The clinics offer free medication when it is available, but shortfalls in funding mean they now mainly prescribe, rather than dispense medicine, and that their facilities are understaffed. Each health centre tailors its opening hours to the needs of mobile workers in the area. Some, like the Mlolongo health centre, have regular 9am-6pm opening hours, but run outreach programmes in which clinicians and trained volunteers offer free health screenings to target groups, such as truckers, sex workers and informal traders. The volunteers visit key areas like truck stops carrying blood pressure cuffs and glucometers to check for hypertension and diabetes. Cases of concern are then referred to the clinic. Medical staff can access patient information from any of North Star\u2019s facilities in the region, which helps them keep track of how the workers are faring, but face some challenges when patients travel frequently outside their countries of operation. \u201cIt makes it hard to follow up on their medication. One day, he\u2019s here, the next he\u2019s in Congo; you can\u2019t be sure if he\u2019s accessing the right care there,\u201d says Odhiambo. On his doctor\u2019s recommendation, Wambua has made some lifestyle changes. Drastic diet changes are cost prohibitive, he says, but he now goes for short morning walks and tries to stay physically active on Sundays when he\u2019s not working. As NCDs become more prevalent, access to flexible health services and an early diagnosis can be a lifeline for mobile workers, Wambua says. \u201cAs a truck driver, you need to know your [health] condition \u2013 that\u2019s the only way you can manage it.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-20T16:00:02Z",
            "content": "The bed was covered with baby clothes neatly arranged with milestone cards for future events such as \u201ccoming home\u201d and \u201cEaster\u201d. They were the outfits for all the special occasions Tara Maguire thought she would miss with her daughter Maisie, then just two weeks old. Downstairs her husband and mother-in-law were waiting to drive her to be admitted as an inpatient at the Bluestone psychiatric unit of Craigavon Area hospital in Northern Ireland. \u201cIt was really hard,\u201d recalls Tara, wiping away tears. Tara had postpartum psychosis, one of the mental health conditions that affect 10-20% of mothers either during pregnancy or the year after \u2013 the \u201cperinatal\u201d period. They include depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and psychosis. Many factors make women more vulnerable to mental illness during this period, from changes in hormone levels and the brain, physical and psychological stress and traumas during birth, the sheer magnitude of this life event, or a potential genetic vulnerability. While treatment can be vital to limit the impact on the mother, her baby, her partner and other children, accessing it can be a postcode lottery. Hence there was cautious optimism in October when the Northern Irish Department of Health announced Belfast City hospital as the site of Northern Ireland\u2019s first mother and baby unit (MBU). There are 19 MBUs in England where mothers can be admitted for mental health treatment with their newborns, two in Scotland and one in Wales. \u201cWe know that the existence of MBUs are the first things that women want, they are the most important things for rapid recovery,\u201d says Dr Jess Heron, a senior research fellow in perinatal psychiatry at the University of Birmingham, who set up Action on Postpartum Psychosis (APP), a national charity that campaigned for the new unit. However, she adds: \u201cWe need to know a timeframe; we need something to happen now.\u201d Postpartum psychosis is one of the more severe mental health conditions affecting one to two in every 1,000 who give birth. It can manifest as depression, mania, severe anxiety, confusion, catatonia, or a mixture of these symptoms, but it is the hallucinations, delusions and loss of touch with reality that define the condition. A diagnosis of bipolar disorder before pregnancy or among immediate family members is the strongest known risk factor, but as Heron explains, for half of the women who experience the condition, \u201cThe first episode comes out of the blue with no history at all.\u201d Tara had been \u201cbuzzing\u201d in the days after her daughter\u2019s birth, when she was readmitted to the hospital\u2019s maternity unit for anaemia. Although she mellowed during visits from her husband, Chris \u2013 rare because of Covid restrictions \u2013 her complete lack of sleep and manic behaviour had her flagged for possible postpartum psychosis when she was discharged into the care of the mental health team that supports people within the community. No one in her family had any inkling of the suspected condition, and when the mental health team left Chris an emergency contact number for psychiatric help he stuffed it in the pocket of the chair, thinking he would never need it. It wasn\u2019t until Tara nudged Chris awake at night that he realised something was definitely wrong. \u201cIs it time?\u201d she had asked. \u201cTo smother the baby?\u201d Tara\u2019s head was filled with choirs of angels telling her Maisie was too good for this world, but knowing she could not bring herself to kill her baby she had thought she could enlist Chris. He reached straight for the emergency number. For many women and their families in the UK, help is available. In 1997-1999, the then Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths (CEMD) included suicides in its report for the first time. Although incomplete, the data, supplemented with figures from the Office for National Statistics, suggested suicide was the leading cause of death in the first year after pregnancy. This is still the case, though focus on maternal mental health has gradually increased over the subsequent two decades with the launch of initiatives such as APP and the Maternal Mental Health Alliance. Outside the UK, including many states in the US and Europe, maternal deaths from suicide are often still not counted. \u201cWe\u2019ve done loads of educating over the last couple of decades to improve the knowledge in the health professionals, primary care professionals, midwifery, health visiting, obstetrician, social care and mental health specialists,\u201d says the consultant adult and perinatal psychiatrist and registrar of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Dr Trudi Seneviratne. Specialist perinatal mental health teams now operate in every locality in the UK, compared with just 40% of localities in Scotland and just 15% in England 10 years ago. When Heron set up APP in 2010, postpartum psychosis accounted for 43% of maternal suicides, yet fear, shame and stigma were preventing women from speaking out about inadequate support. More than a decade on, after work by charities such as APP, psychosis is now rarely a cause of death. In the 2023 APP peer support survey, 46% of respondents said: \u201cI might not be alive if I had not found APP\u2019s peer support services.\u201d However, deaths because of other causes have increased. The CEMD \u2013 now run by Mbrrace-UK (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk Through Audits and Confidential Enquiries), based at the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit (NPEU) at the University of Oxford \u2013 released new figures for 2019-2021 last October, which state that of the more than 2 million women who gave birth, 572 died during or within a year of pregnancy. Of those deaths, 39% were caused by psychiatric conditions, including drug or alcohol abuse, and 19% were because of suicide, still the leading cause of death between six weeks and a year after pregnancy. The government\u2019s five-year suicide prevention strategy, announced last September, specifically targeted pregnant women and new mothers, noting that \u201cthe high risk compared with other causes of maternal death (most of which are rare) and the potential long-term consequences on children\u2019s development mean we must take action to prevent suicides in this group\u201d. Chris still struggles, two and a half years later, to understand how Tara could have been discharged without anyone mentioning that the consultant suspected postpartum psychosis. Nor was it mentioned in their antenatal classes \u2013 they had never heard of it before. \u201cWe were completely blind,\u201d Tara says. Although all the NHS workers involved \u201cbent over backwards\u201d to try to help, \u201cthe left hand just did not know what the right hand was doing\u201d, says Chris. This, according to Prof Marian Knight, the director of the NPEU, \u201cis regularly identified as a challenge\u201d. She adds: \u201cWomen who die by suicide have often contacted different bits of the health service in mental distress several times and nobody\u2019s picked up the overall pattern of deteriorating mental health.\u201d Suicide or, in extremely rare incidents, infanticide are the worst-case scenarios, but other long-term impacts remain. \u201cThere are association studies between depression and anxiety and the child subsequently developing cognitive problems, behavioural problems, IQ deficiencies,\u201d says Seneviratne, adding that the children themselves can go on to develop psychological problems. A 2014 report put the net long-term cost of perinatal depression, anxiety and psychosis at \u00a38.1bn for each one-year cohort of births in the UK; 72% of this related to adverse outcomes for the child. However, Seneviratne says the associations are complex. \u201cWe don\u2019t want parents to feel guilty.\u201d When the economy suffers, people suffer more. Depression (often accompanied by anxiety) affects roughly 15% of mothers during or within a year of pregnancy, but among disadvantaged communities the proportion is significantly higher. While people come to Dr Cerith Waters, an NHS perinatal clinical psychologist and researcher at the University of Cardiff, for therapy \u2013 which is happening more and more during the current cost of living crisis \u2013 he has found himself directing them to where they can access safe housing, baby clothes or a buggy. \u201cSupporting people to get their social and basic needs met is increasingly an issue for our most vulnerable families before they\u2019re ready for, and have the head space to engage in, psychological therapy,\u201d he says. Studies have also shown that people respond well to treatment during the perinatal period, which benefits the child as well. A 2020 analysis of 16 studies identified eight interventions that led to improvements for the infant and the infant-mother relationship, highlighting the apparent benefits of interventions that encourage positive interactions between mother and infant, for example, helping mothers to understand their infant\u2019s perspective. \u201cIt represents a wonderful opportunity to make a difference,\u201d says Waters. Treatments can include talking and creative therapies, and improving diet, exercise and sleep. Medications such as antidepressants can also help, although the lack of clinical trials in pregnant or breastfeeding women makes it harder to balance the risks and benefits of medicines to mother and baby. For Tara, medication was not enough. Feeling she was no longer safe at home, Chris had her admitted. Had Tara gone into an MBU with her newborn as soon as red flags of potential postpartum psychosis were noted, much subsequent trauma might have been avoided, she suggests. These units admit the mother and baby together so that the mother has access to the psychiatric and psychological treatment she needs alongside postnatal physical care, with nurses on hand to care for the baby and support bonding and parenting behaviour. Being among other mothers of newborn babies in an MBU can also be a support. As it was, Tara was admitted into a general psychiatric unit. \u201cIt looked like a prison cell with a hospital bed,\u201d says Chris. Heron says: \u201cBeing forcibly separated from your newborn can be terrifying, especially when mentally unwell, and this can impede treatment and recovery.\u201d Despite improvements in recent years, many still fear the reaction of friends, families and even social services if they make their experience of postpartum psychosis or other mental illnesses known. This poses a barrier not just to public awareness but also access to support and treatment. \u201cYou\u2019re only going to get better if you\u2019re properly treated,\u201d says Knight. \u201cThat means speaking up.\u201d One of the striking characteristics of postpartum psychosis is how well people do recover. Speaking to Tara now, there is little trace of the severe condition she experienced. But, she says: \u201cWhat I\u2019m worried about is that mummies take their own lives to protect their kids because they\u2019re terrified of their own minds.\u201d In the UK, the charity Mind is available on 0300 123 3393 and Childline on 0800 1111. In the US, call or text Mental Health America at 988 or chat 988lifeline.org.

An earlier version referred to Tara being discharged into the care of the perinatal mental health team; she has informed us that it was a mental health team but not perinatal."

            "date": "2024-01-30T16:00:00Z",
            "content": "Last week, the Ohio legislature voted to override the Republican governor Mike DeWine\u2019s veto of HB68, a bill that would ban gender-affirming care for trans youth. The veto marks the end of a yearlong effort by LGBTQ+ activists to block HB68\u2019s passage. Starting this April, Ohio doctors are prohibited from prescribing puberty blockers or hormone therapy to any trans patient under 18. Ohio is now the 23rd state to pass restrictions on trans healthcare for minors (though courts have blocked a handful of those measures). It could also become the second state to restrict care for adults, through draft rules are currently open to comments from the public. Families in Ohio are now planning for a future without the healthcare that medical professionals say is necessary for lowering the concerning rate of suicide attempts among LGBTQ+ youth. Below is a collection of accounts from children and their parents, all of whom spent the past year meeting with and writing to state lawmakers, begging Ohio Republicans to reconsider their support of the bill. They are all considering leaving the state to preserve their families\u2019 ability to receive care. *** \u2018When it gets overwhelming, I remind myself that I\u2019m a different kind of person\u2019 Parker Elswick, 16, he/they Before I started on hormones last year, everything felt distorted, like I was seeing myself through an awful funhouse mirror. There was just a mismatch between my body and my brain, and now the two parts of me feel reconciled. I have this memory of opening TikTok one day during the pandemic. There was a video of a 50-year-old trans man smiling and dancing. He was celebrating the anniversary of his transition, and all I could think was: \u201cOh wow, we get to live that long?\u201d Testosterone made all that mental health stuff so much easier. It can get hard sometimes, feeling like the entire world resents your existence. When it all becomes overwhelming, when the noise is just a little too loud, I try to remind myself that I\u2019m not some monster, I\u2019m just a different kind of person. After I came out as trans at 13, my mom and I started reading about \u201ctwo-spirit\u201d people. In a lot of Indigenous cultures, people who lived outside the gender binary were cherished, they were sacred, they could become healers and shamans. Learning about that history made me feel a lot better. My family and I are going to leave Ohio sometime in the next few months. There\u2019s technically a \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d in HB68, where kids who are already on hormones should be able to continue getting medication. But we learned last month that the grandfather clause does not guarantee that I\u2019ll be able to stay on testosterone. If even one person on my care team at the clinic leaves, I might not be able to get my prescription filled any more. I\u2019ve learned a lot about politics and law this year. I was there in the statehouse when the house voted to override the governor\u2019s veto of HB68. I wanted to be physically present to show support for my friends. It felt important to be there, to force the Republicans to see and acknowledge me, even if my presence there didn\u2019t change any votes. I listened and sat there with the other trans kids and our families. It was such a strange thing to watch. Have you ever had a little kid come up to you after they had a dream? They just breathlessly recount everything: \u201cI was a superhero, I was being chased by all these killer robots, they almost caught me!\u201d And of course, you nod and listen and take everything the kid says very seriously. That\u2019s what it felt like, listening to Republicans debate whether or not trans kids should be allowed to get healthcare. The politicians all talk so much, and they expect their words to be taken very seriously. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to the other trans kids who have to stay here in Ohio. I\u2019m so scared for my friends. \u2018Loving Parker is the easiest part of being his mom\u2019 Betty Elswick, she/her I don\u2019t want to leave this state. I wanted so badly for Ohio to be our family\u2019s long-term home. I thought I would raise my kids here. But we cannot spend the next decade locked in this traumatic chess match against the state\u2019s politicians. We will not pay taxes in a state that does not want us. I will not stay in a place where my child is unsafe. Watching testosterone transform Parker\u2019s life and emotional wellbeing has been a wonderful thing to witness. Even before he came out, Parker was always self-conscious of his voice. The sound of it made him uncomfortable. In the months since he started testosterone, his voice started to deepen. I can see Parker\u2019s face light up every time he hears his own voice. Seeing your child be proud of his own voice is a type of joy that I cannot really articulate. People keep telling me, \u201cDon\u2019t panic, everything will work itself out \u2013 the new laws aren\u2019t such a big deal.\u201d That kind of apathy is maddening in its own way, because I know how dire this current moment is for both trans kids and adults. These new laws are going to make it so much harder for trans people to survive. There were trans adults in my life, friends who I loved so much, that are no longer alive. Losing those friends to suicide is a kind of pain that is impossible to ever metabolize. The grief I hold for them never left, but it lives a little closer to the surface now, with the end of the battle against HB68. I am aware that moving to a different state will not shield Parker against transphobia. But at least we won\u2019t be in this constant legal fight to protect Parker\u2019s basic needs. Supporting Parker has been easy. Loving him, getting him what he needs, that\u2019s the easiest part of being his mom. It\u2019s everything else that\u2019s so hard. *** \u2018I built a community here. It takes a long time to find people who are kind and don\u2019t suck\u2019 Amity Scaglione, 14, she/her Whenever I get anxious about the future, I try to remember the day of my homecoming dance. I was wearing this cute black dress that my mom and I had found at Kohl\u2019s a few days earlier. My mom helped me pick out a lipstick color that matched my corsage. Since coming out, I\u2019ve realized that clothing and makeup is such an easy way to tell the world, \u201cI\u2019m a girl, see?\u201d I think a lot of cisgender people take that kind of stuff for granted. Getting dressed up in a nice outfit, going to a big school event with my friends, that was a kind of happiness I had never experienced before coming out of the closet. Dancing around in high heels all night, getting blisters, promising myself that next school dance, I\u2019m going to wear Converse \u2013 that\u2019s all something that is so important and precious to me. Being trans doesn\u2019t have to be so complicated or sad. It\u2019s really simple, actually. Politicians just make it complicated. I try to remember my homecoming dance whenever all the political stuff starts to feel overwhelming. The past year has been tough, but I make it work \u2013 most of the time. Last month, I wanted to go help all the activists at the statehouse who were fighting to block HB68. My mom and I woke up at 4.30 in the morning to drive to the statehouse, and we spent the whole day meeting with senators, asking them to vote no, explaining why the law would hurt trans kids. I told them how badly I wanted to get on estrogen, and what it meant for my life. I told them how scared I am to go through male puberty, how traumatic that all feels. I ended the night testifying in front of the whole senate. We drove back home right after that, because I had my Spanish midterm the next morning. Last week, my mom started calling around, looking for clinics in other states that would be able to get me started on estrogen. The closest clinic is three hours away from our house. We might be forced to move out of Ohio, but it\u2019s not like Ohio is the only state that wants to take my rights away. What if we move to a new state, then next year, that new place passes something just like HB68? Last year it was Missouri, this year it\u2019s Ohio. Which state is next? I built a community here. I have a partner, I have friends, I have people in my life who don\u2019t suck. It takes a really long time to find people who are kind, people who I can trust. A lot of people can be cruel. So if we move to a place where the laws are better, that\u2019s obviously great, but I am nervous about the idea of starting from square one in a new school. *** \u2018Elected officials are a bigger threat to my daughter than school bullies\u2019 Alicia Burkle, mom of Astrid (age 10), she/her When Astrid first came out as trans, my husband and I wanted to be prepared. It was summer vacation, right before she started third grade, so we went to the kids\u2019 school and made a plan in case she encountered any bullying. Ultimately, one or two kids were mean to Astrid, but the school nipped that right in the bud. I don\u2019t worry about school bullies any more. I\u2019ve realized now that our elected officials are a much bigger threat to my daughter\u2019s safety. I have been to the statehouse over and over again in the year since HB68 was first introduced. Myself and the other parents of trans kids tried everything to convince Ohio legislators that this bill is a bad idea. We brought heartwarming stories about trans adults, scientific research on gender-affirming healthcare, empirical data on trans children\u2019s mental health, and religious leaders who support trans kids. None of it worked. The people who pushed for this bill did not budge, because it was never really about the kids. Astrid does not want to go through male puberty, and she should not have to. We have the best endocrinologists in the world here in Cleveland, doctors who can help us safely start puberty blockers when Astrid gets a little bit older. But now, if we stay in Ohio, she might have to face a very avoidable trauma. We\u2019ve been talking to Astrid\u2019s endocrinologist to try and plan out the next 90 days, before the law officially takes effect. Astrid is almost at the age where she would be eligible to start puberty blockers, so there\u2019s a small chance we could get her started on medication before that 90 day window closes. But if we wait too long to find an endocrinologist outside of Ohio, I worry there won\u2019t be any appointment slots left. There are doctors in Detroit, Pittsburgh, maybe even Buffalo that we could go to, but those clinics are about to be bombarded by calls from families that are leaving Ohio. The next few weeks are going to be chaotic, all because of this ban. When I ignore all the outside pressures, though, it\u2019s been an incredible thing to watch Astrid as she socially transitions. Astrid was such a goofy, giggly toddler; she always had a big smile on her face. At some point, maybe in first grade, she stopped smiling as much. She started having panic attacks. She started pulling her own eyelashes out as a way to self-soothe. Today, we watch her flit around the house in sparkly dresses, dancing around with her teddy bear. She\u2019s happy again. Coming out as trans, living life as a girl \u2013 that process has revived a light in her that was missing, or at least dimming, for years. *** \u2018Dysphoria is a terrible feeling that I would not wish on anyone\u2019 Ava Rose, 18, she/her I have a love-hate relationship with mirrors. There\u2019s this big, floor length mirror in my bedroom; it was left behind by the last people to live in my family\u2019s house. It was here when we moved in. When I do my pacing \u2013 I pace back and forth when I\u2019m thinking or anxious \u2013 I always catch little glimpses of my reflection in that big, stupid mirror. Adults always ask me to explain how and when I realized that I am a girl. There\u2019s not one particular moment that I can reference \u2013 I just know that at some point, I started to avoid mirrors, photos, anything that would force me to really study my own face. It might sound ridiculous to people who have never experienced gender dysphoria, but my reflection just looked so foreign to me. It felt so uncomfortable. I did not see myself in the mirror, I saw an entity that seemed very suspicious, like it was plotting something. My reflection became this house guest who had overstayed their welcome. Dysphoria is a terrible feeling that I would not wish upon anyone. A few months after I started on hormones, there was this day when my friends and I were hanging out at our town\u2019s arcade. I was playing Guitar Hero when a mom approached one of my friends, pointed to me and said: \u201cOnce she\u2019s done with the game, can my daughter play?\u201d The woman called me \u201cshe\u201d. It was this beautiful, soul-affirming feeling that I had never really experienced before. I know that I am and always have been a girl, but that was the first concrete confirmation that the rest of the world saw me as a girl, too. Pretty soon after that, I started to tolerate, then like, then sometimes love the mirror in my bedroom. When it enters my peripheral vision, I remain calm. I still don\u2019t always love my reflection, but it is now a person who I recognize. I\u2019m a legal adult, so hopefully the new laws about hormone therapy will not change my access to medication. I am so worried about my trans friends, and all the younger trans kids who won\u2019t be able to experience that thing I felt in the arcade. I feel so guilty sometimes, about my age. I want to enjoy my senior year of high school. I want to get ready for prom with my friends, and I want to plan for my life after graduation. I had always thought I would stay in Ohio long term, but that doesn\u2019t feel like a smart decision any more. \u2022 In the US, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 988, chat on 988lifeline.org, or text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

            "content": "Women should be given full control of their contraceptive needs by being allowed to buy the morning-after pill in supermarkets and petrol stations in the UK, a coalition of healthcare bodies has said. The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) said it was high time the barriers to emergency contraception were removed by reclassifying the morning-after pill under the general sales list, meaning it could be bought in shops. Emergency contraception is currently only available after a compulsory consultation with a pharmacist. The FSRH\u2019s position has been supported by organisations such as the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) and the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine. Dr Janet Barter, the FSRH president, said: \u201cAccess to contraception is such a basic human right and it is high time we begin to remove the barriers people face accessing oral emergency contraception. We want to make oral emergency contraception free and easily accessible to everyone who needs it, at a time and place that suits them, be that in a supermarket or their local sexual health clinic.\u201d In 2019 a report by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommended that the morning-after pill should be sold off the shelf alongside pregnancy tests and condoms. The FRSH said it \u201csupports universal provision across the UK of free, accessible oral emergency contraception without fear of harassment or stigma\u201d. Barter said: \u201cIt is so important that people can take full control of their own contraceptive needs. We believe that the reclassification of oral emergency contraception from a pharmacy medicine to general sales list would be an enormous step forward, giving people autonomy and empowering them to make the right decision for themselves. \u201cThe next important step in the process to improve access to oral emergency contraception would be to make it free for everyone.\u201d Georgina O\u2019Reilly, the associate director of communications and campaigns at BPAS, said: \u201cThis is not just a safe medication, and considerably safer than many other products on the shelf, it protects women against pregnancy, a condition which can seriously affect women\u2019s physical and mental health \u2013 as well as her personal safety. \u201cOf course it\u2019s not the same as taking a paracetamol, because the consequences if it\u2019s not taken are so much more significant that an ongoing headache. We owe it to women to do everything in our power to get this pill into their hands as swiftly as possible.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-29T00:01:19Z",
            "content": "A troubled NHS trust that treated Valdo Calocane for paranoid schizophrenia before he killed three people in Nottingham last year is to be the subject of a special review. Ministers said the review into Nottinghamshire Healthcare foundation trust would help provide answers to the families of Barnaby Webber, Grace O\u2019Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates, who were killed by Calocane last June. Calocane had been suffering from extreme mental illness for years before his violent rampage. His plea of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility was accepted by prosecutors last week. He had been in out of the trust\u2019s Highbury hospital due to his mental health problems, and also in the care of a community team. The health watchdog, the Care Quality Commission, downgraded the trust to \u201crequires improvement\u201d after an inspection in November 2022. It will conduct the review, and has been asked to present its findings in March. The CQC\u2019s investigation will be run in tandem with an independent mental health homicide review ordered by NHS England. In December, more than 30 staff were suspended from Highbury hospital over serious allegations including mistreating patients and falsifying records, the Independent revealed last week. These allegations are being dealt with separately, according to a press statement by the Department of Health and Social Care. It said: \u201cInvestigations continue at Highbury hospital in the light of separate recent staff suspensions and a rapid improvement plan is under way, overseen by a new oversight board established to ensure appropriate action is being taken.\u201d The trust also runs Rampton high-security hospital, which was rated as inadequate by the CQC this month. It had not treated Calocane before the killings. Calocane first came into contact with mental health services in May 2020 when he went to A&amp;E believing he was having a heart attack, Nottingham crown court heard. In the subsequent years leading to his deadly rampage, he was repeatedly sectioned to Highbury hospital over a number of incidents, and frequently refused to take medication. In September 2021 his apartment was search after he evaded contact with his community mental health team. Eight months\u2019 worth of unused medication was found and his behaviour was hostile. He also assaulted a police officer while being transported to Highbury hospital. After being released in October 2021, he missed mental health appointments and often appeared confrontational. He was sectioned again in January 2022 after an altercation with his flatmate. It was later found that Calocane first started buying weapons in 2022 as voices were telling him to harm others, psychiatrists said. In May 2022 he travelled to London and attempted to hand himself in to MI5, which he believed was controlling him. For almost a year before his deadly attack he was unmedicated and out of touch with psychiatric services. During the CQC\u2019s inspection in November 2022, it singled out various services as requiring improvement, including the psychiatric intensive care unit and rehabilitation mental health wards. The inspectors did not review mental health crisis services and community-based mental health services for adults as both had been rated \u201cgood\u201d in May 2019. Inspectors also praised the commitment of staff to improvement. The health secretary, Victoria Atkins, said: \u201cIt is crucial that our mental health services ensure both the care of patients and the safety of the public. \u201cI hope the review provides the families and public with some much-needed answers, and that it helps the trust to improve the standard of mental health care in Nottinghamshire.\u201d Chris Dzikiti, the CQC\u2019s director of mental health, said: \u201cWe will conduct a rapid review into mental health services in Nottingham to understand whether there are any practical actions which can be taken to improve the quality of services and ensure people receive safe and effective care. We will begin this work immediately, aiming to report to the secretary of state before the end of March.\u201d The trust has been approached for comment. In a previous comment to the Independent, it said: \u201cNottinghamshire Healthcare is committed to ensuring we provide the very best and safest care we possibly can for our patients \u2026 As investigations into these allegations are ongoing we are unable to comment further.\u201d"

            "content": "Eurostar traffic returned to pre-Covid levels with a 22% rise in passenger numbers in 2023, the cross-Channel train operator has announced. Eurostar also said it had found a partial solution to allow it to maintain a limited service to the Netherlands during work at Amsterdam station, which had threatened to halt the popular route in 2024. Booming demand from London drove growth of 25% for journeys to Paris and more than a third on Eurostar routes to Brussels and Amsterdam, as total passenger numbers reached 18.9 million. Eurostar, which merged with Franco-Belgian high-speed operator Thalys in 2022, said it was \u201cstrongly on [its] way\u201d to reach a stated target of 30 million passengers by 2030. Gwendoline Cazenave, the chief executive of Eurostar, said the company \u201cachieved exceptionally strong growth in 2023. We carried almost 8 million passengers between London and France, 1.1 million between the Netherlands and the UK and 2.2 million to Belgium. \u201cOur goal is to encourage more people to take the train so it\u2019s a win for customers and a win for the planet.\u201d Its terminal at Amsterdam Centraal is due to close for six months from June but Eurostar will continue to run three direct trains from London, although only with slower services connecting at Brussels on the way back. Passenger numbers from the city have been severely limited due to UK border requirements and lack of space, which has worsened since Brexit, but Eurostar hopes for a big capacity increase when work is finished. Cazenave said Amsterdam was a \u201ckey hub\u201d, adding: \u201cThe construction of a new terminal is vital for passengers, who will be able to increase their numbers significantly when it opens.\u201d Eurostar services will be particularly in demand this summer when it expects to carry close to 2 million passengers to Paris for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The growth in passengers underlines Eurostar\u2019s recovery since the pandemic, when travel restrictions saw it teeter on the edge of bankruptcy with only one train running each day. However, it has yet to reopen a number of stations, including Ashford and Ebbsfleet in Kent, and its network of direct routes remains limited. It may also face competition for the first time across the Channel, with the tunnel operator Getlink indicating that it has been in talks with a number of startups that wish to run high-speed trains."

            "content": "Sometimes you have to wonder whether politicians live in the same world as us. Breathe the same air, talk the same language. Almost as if election is immediately followed by a spell at idiot school. To implant that sense of effortless superiority that places their own experience on a higher plane to the rest of us. Their punishment is to be perpetually misunderstood. Take George Freeman. A former Tory minister unable to get by on \u00a3120,000 a year. It\u2019s only the Just Giving fundraiser I started this week that\u2019s keeping him off the streets. Pray for George. But Freeman is far from the only one. On Wednesday, it was hard to find any minister or former minister not hellbent on taking the public for mugs. Maybe they just had spare capacity in their condescension quota for the month. Start again afresh on the first day of February. Or could it be almost everyone has given up. They know change is coming and have given up even pretending to take the job seriously. Up in Scotland we had the former first minister giving evidence to the Covid inquiry. Since Nicola Sturgeon resigned from the top job in March she has spent more time than she would have wanted being questioned by police about the SNP\u2019s finances. No one still seems to know how a luxury motorhome came to be parked outside her mother-in-law\u2019s house in Dunfermline. But at the very least, it\u2019s given Nicola some practice in answering awkward questions. The lead counsel for the inquiry, Jamie Dawson, began with Sturgeon\u2019s missing WhatsApp messages. What was it about Covid that led so many senior politicians to delete all their WhatsApps? That was a side-effect Chris Whitty never warned the rest of us about. Specifically, Dawson wanted to know why the former first minister had told Channel 4 in 2021 that she would hand over all her messages to any inquiry when she knew that she had already deleted them. \u201cAh that,\u201d said Nicola. She was sorry if there had been any misunderstanding, but she had only wanted to keep things simple for the little people. Because all that had happened was that she had saved the messages she thought would be relevant. Not that everything else had been deleted. It had merely not been retained in a way that could be retrieved. Basically, she had been doing everyone a favour. Saving people the effort of going through messages asking people to amend her Tesco shopping order. In other words, Nicola had merely been doing the inquiry\u2019s job for it. Because who better to decide what was relevant than Sturgeon herself? Really, she should have been made chair of the Scottish leg of the inquiry and let Lady Hallett take a few weeks off. So nothing to see here, then \u2026 Er, no. Nicola. Back in 2021 you lied to a TV journalist. Nicola looked shocked. Her sentences became longer and more inarticulate. Openness and transparency had always been her guiding principles. If anything she had overshared with the Scottish people as first minister. \u201cI knew I had operated in line with a policy I had operated in line with,\u201d she said. No one was any the wiser. We moved on to a surviving WhatsApp from a civil servant describing a culture of plausible deniability. Sturgeon shrugged. She could plausibly deny any plausible deniability. She certainly couldn\u2019t recall any instructions to destroy evidence. That would be abhorrent. Someone might have said it as a joke. That was it, a joke. Ha ha. Then she had misremembered stuff in the past. \u201cI make no apology for saying that Boris Johnson was the wrong person to be prime minister,\u201d she said. Many of us could agree on that. But there had also been times when she wished she hadn\u2019t been first minister. She had just tried to be the best version of herself. Her voice caught and she dabbed her eyes as she recalled the responsibility. This was the human Nicola. The one she normally reserves for private consumption only. The rest of the evidence could be filed alongside plausible deniability. She had always wanted to be inclusive in her decision-making. Couldn\u2019t understand why the details of what was discussed were missing. Had definitely never tried to use the pandemic to her personal advantage. That would be the last thing she would do. Had merely tried to stop Scotland making the same mistakes as England. Believable? Barely. Then she hadn\u2019t had countless piss-ups, she hadn\u2019t ignored the scientific evidence and she hadn\u2019t lost billions in PPE fraud to mates. So there was that. Back in London, James Cleverly was also struggling with language during an appearance before the home affairs select committee. Jimmy Dimly\u2019s command of language often leaves a lot to be desired. His natural speech is pure bollocks. There was no backlog of migrants to be processed, he insisted. To suggest otherwise was a lie. There was just an orderly queue. A bit like at a supermarket checkout. He also said that sending one person to Rwanda would prove the whole scheme was worthwhile. He thinks we\u2019re all as dim as him. Rishi Sunak was also reduced to talking nonsense at prime minister\u2019s questions. Mostly because there\u2019s nothing sensible left for him to say. Other than, \u201cI give up. Let\u2019s have an election.\u201d Rish! has run out of road and no longer bothers to disguise his impotence. The only reason the Northern Ireland deal is going through is thanks to a \u00a33bn bung and the belief that the Tories won\u2019t be in power in a year\u2019s time. So no one\u2019s kicking up a fuss over alignment with the EU. That\u2019s now priced in. It was almost as if Keir Starmer had also got fed up with the one-sidedness of his exchanges with Sunak. His performance was no better than phoned in. Still enough to win easily, but nothing very inspirational. Trading on your opponent\u2019s uselessness doesn\u2019t win hearts and minds. Rishi had nothing. No answer to inevitable pleas for distressed Tory ministers. No answer to people\u2019s mortgage payments going up. Other than everyone should just sod off, stop bothering him and extend their mortgage into retirement. Great, we can all carry on working till we die. Thanks Rish!. Thanks Liz. Sunak shrugged. Phil from Iceland could also do one. Taking the piss out of a member of the public is bad politics. A sure sign the game is up. The Tory benches were half empty long before the end. Send for the whisky and barbiturates. There was one sign of life. A very primitive form of life. Barely sentient. Someone who makes Jimmy Dimly look like an intellectual giant. The one, the only Andrea Leadsom. No one lowers the stupidity bar further than her. She was out on the airwaves celebrating the four-year anniversary of Brexit. Luckily, her short-term memory is shot, so she can\u2019t remember what she said last year. Now she was insisting we should be cheering on rising food prices as a symbol of our liberation. We\u2019re going to miss her when she\u2019s gone. A Brexit giant \u2026"

            "date": "2024-01-25T18:25:28Z",
            "content": "Humza Yousaf has apologised \u201cunreservedly\u201d to both the UK Covid inquiry and to people bereaved by the pandemic for the Scottish government\u2019s failures to hand over WhatsApp messages relating to the handling of the crisis. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for it. We should have done better,\u201d Yousaf, Scotland\u2019s first minister, told the inquiry on Thursday. A tense day of evidence at the inquiry, which is sitting in Edinburgh for a second week, revealed that the former first minister Nicola Sturgeon had described Boris Johnson as \u201ca fucking clown\u201d as he broadcast to the nation to announce a second Covid lockdown in October 2020. She told her chief of staff: \u201cHis utter incompetence in every sense is now offending me on behalf of politicians everywhere.\u201d Following a succession of revelations about how senior Scottish ministers and officials regularly deleted informal messages and exhibited apparent disdain for freedom of information rules, Yousaf also told Jamie Dawson KC, lead counsel for the inquiry, that he had instructed an externally-led review into the use of WhatsApp and other unofficial technology in the Scottish government. His announcement came as evidence taken earlier in the day revealed that, despite consistent Scottish government denials, decisions about pandemic restrictions and strategy did appear to have been made using WhatsApp, in seeming contradiction of Sturgeon\u2019s insistence that she did not conduct her government\u2019s Covid response through informal messaging. On Thursday morning the inquiry was shown exchanges between Sturgeon and Liz Lloyd, who served as her chief of staff and strategic adviser between 2015 and 2023, in which Sturgeon described the former UK prime minister as \u201ca fucking clown\u201d. Sturgeon went on the dismiss the UK government\u2019s Covid communications strategy as \u201cawful \u2026 we\u2019re not perfect but we don\u2019t get nearly enough credit for how much better than them we are\u201d. Lloyd, who described herself as Sturgeon\u2019s \u201cthought partner\u201d, was shown several exchanges, including one regarding the numbers allowed to attend weddings and another suggesting \u201ca good old-fashioned rammy [quarrel]\u201d with the UK government over furlough policy. There was a furious response last week from bereaved families and opposition politicians when the inquiry heard that Sturgeon \u201cretained no messages whatsoever\u201d, while Scotland\u2019s national clinical director, Jason Leitch, joked in a group chat that WhatsApp deletion was his \u201cpre-bed ritual\u201d. Sturgeon has since clarified that the inquiry does have messages relating to the pandemic, although they were not retained on her device, and has said: \u201cTo be clear, I conducted the Covid response through formal processes from my office in St Andrew\u2019s House, not through WhatsApp or any other informal messaging platform.\u201d Questioning Yousaf about how decisions were made at that time, Dawson asked him if the Scottish cabinet was a decision-ratifying rather than decision-making body. Yousaf said he disagreed with that assessment, but also spoke to concerns raised in his initial written statement that decisions made by Sturgeon were not \u201ccascaded\u201d to the rest of the cabinet. He said the pandemic had not been \u201cnot normal times\u201d but that there were occasions when Sturgeon and her \u201cgold command\u201d, a select group of senior advisers and ministers, made often time-sensitive decisions that were not discussed at cabinet level. Asked by Dawson if it was correct that these gold command meetings were not minuted, Yousaf said it was \u201cmy understanding that they should have been\u201d. Yousaf, who has provided the inquiry with his own WhatsApp messages, was asked about an exchange with Leitch that took place on his first day in his role as health secretary. Leitch referred to a meeting and \u201csome FM \u2018keep it small\u2019 shenanigans as always \u2013 she actually wants none of us\u201d. Dawson asked if this was an example of Sturgeon wanting to make decisions alone, but Yousaf said this was a \u201cclassic example of Jason over-speaking\u201d. Yousaf was also asked about a WhatsApp exchange which Leitch was challenged on earlier this week, where he asked whether he needed to wear a face mask at an indoor dinner event when he was standing up talking to other guests. Leitch had advised Yousaf to \u201chave a drink in your hands at all times, then you\u2019re exempt\u201d. But Yousaf denied that he had been asking Leitch for \u201ca workaround\u201d.

            "title": "Day by Michael Cunningham review \u2013 living through the pandemic",
            "date": "2024-01-25T07:30:15Z",
            "content": "The day of the title is a composite of three days: a morning in 2019, a locked-down afternoon in 2020, and an evening in 2021, when it is possible to travel and gather again. On 5 April in each of these years, Michael Cunningham takes his samplings, or specimen hours, minutely observing the lives of the people he finds in a Brooklyn apartment. A quarter century after The Hours, with its three Mrs Dalloways in different times and cities, Cunningham returns to a solidly tripartite structure across which contrasts and connections build. And he returns, with undiminished faith, to the project that united modernists as different as his heroes Joyce and Woolf: the effort to articulate the vast inner lives of a few unexceptional people on a single day. Before, during, after: that\u2019s the basic movement, though \u201cbefore\u201d is suffused by a sense of lateness as a couple drift in their marriage, trying to recapture youth. Dan and Isabel, reaching middle age, have changed to accommodate each other, changed with parenthood, and they\u2019re not the couple who fell in love. Isabel is yearning to get out long before the virus shuts her in. Scanning departure boards, \u201cthinking of the women who abandon everything\u201d, she is kin with Laura Brown, the quietly desperate woman in The Hours who cannot go on making perfect birthday cakes. For the moment, Isabel sits on the stairs, \u201cparalysed by her own triviality\u201d, and imagines never moving; future residents of the apartment will have to edge past the blockage. Around her, the novel\u2019s mid-life characters scrutinise their feelings, wondering where they\u2019ve failed, monitoring their emotional effect on each other so continually that there is little opportunity to concentrate on anything else. By the time six-year-old Violet pleads with her family to close the windows, fraught with fear for those she loves, Day has already evoked many kinds of airlessness. Everyone, including the reader, wants the company of Isabel\u2019s younger brother, who has the gift of lifting the inertia and making joy with whatever materials he finds. Isabel and Dan both feel themselves more \u201cin love\u201d with Robbie than with each other, and we get portraits of two further partnerships: one between ardently, indefinably devoted brothers-in-law (this is territory Cunningham explored in 2010\u2019s By Nightfall), and one between siblings. In this, his eighth novel, Cunningham renews his long commitment to writing about intimate, domestic love of many kinds: straight, gay, motherly, brotherly and avuncular love, and the love between old friends, to name a few, though the writing works against discrete categorisations. A heterosexual couple with children is one model of family among many others. None is more heroic or erotic or inherently complex than the others. And so, broadening the panorama of emotional attachments in a few square feet of Brooklyn, in comes the woman who has had a baby with sperm donated by Dan\u2019s brother \u2013 and then here\u2019s the brother, too. Variously separating people or trapping them together, the events of 2020 put their shifting relationships under pressure. By the end of the novel each has been reconfigured, though they will go on changing. This is not the first time Cunningham has written about an epidemic. In The Hours he gave the shell-shocked soldier of Mrs Dalloway a modern counterpart in the figure of a poet dying of Aids. It was a daring move and he managed it without flattening or conflating the different tragedies involved. In seeking a form for his novel of the Covid years, he has again made himself Woolf\u2019s student (with George Eliot prominent on the reading list as well). The outlines of To the Lighthouse keep becoming visible: the three-part shape Woolf found for the story of a family before and after a period of dispersal, darkness and loss. Cunningham measures his material against hers. We might have done without the elegiac scene in an empty house, where a rock band T-shirt hangs on the hook in memory of Mrs Ramsay\u2019s cloak. But the reassembly of the family around a central absence is powerfully rendered: this third section has a contemporary and idiosyncratic life of its own while catching echoes of other times and other survivors. Day is written with caressing attention to its characters, a kind of long massage that seeks out tiny subcutaneous knots. Only a lover would keep telling us that Dan \u2013 beautiful specimen of ordinary, ageing man \u2013 is one of the missing figures in art, unappreciated by the Greeks and everyone after. Anything too minor for comment in life receives its due here. Every shade of emotion is registered. Such vigilance gives rise to one of the novel\u2019s most intriguing dynamics. It replicates the overanalysed relationships that the women, at least, need a rest from. They are tired of being so tenderly read. The liveliest and most memorable portrait is of the little girl, Violet, already a shrewd performer in every moment, dutifully pre-empting the responses of her devoted but exhausted audience. Reading Violet, we might remember the visionary child Lucas in Cunningham\u2019s wilder, weirder 2005 novel Specimen Days. No one had time to understand Lucas as he fed himself into the giant machine of the Industrial Revolution and emerged maimed. Now here is Violet, twirling in her dress, abundantly cared for. Cunningham allows her to be sad, nonetheless, to feel the weight of a difficult world on her shoulders, and occasionally to turn away from human feelings to animals and stars. There\u2019s a loving kind of licence in that. \u2022 Day by Michael Cunningham is published by HarperCollins (\u00a316.99).

            "date": "2024-01-22T17:30:33Z",
            "content": "Whether it is jumping up at strangers, tugging on a lead or disappearing into the distance, the UK\u2019s pandemic puppies are still in the doghouse, a survey has revealed. Research by the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) has added to growing concerns that many owners who acquired a puppy during the height of the Covid pandemic were struggling with their dogs\u2019 behaviour as they reached 21 months. Among other findings, a fifth of owners surveyed reported their dog had eight or more problem behaviours at that age, such as pulling on the lead, clinginess or aggression, while 33% of owners found training their dog harder than expected \u2013 something that was more common among first-time owners. Dr Rowena Packer, a lecturer in companion animal behaviour and welfare science at the RVC, and lead author of the study, said a key problem was that many people did not do enough research, and were unaware of the level of responsibility involved in training their dog. She said: \u201cI think a lot of new owners go in with very high hopes [of] their dog\u2019s behaviour and then when they realise actually training is quite tough, that\u2019s where a third of them were really struggling.\u201d Another problem, said Packer, was the trend to project human thoughts and feelings on to dogs \u2013 for example labelling certain behaviours as naughty. \u201cDogs don\u2019t come off the shelf ready to know how to spend a day walking around on a lead meeting other dogs, going into social spaces with other people \u2013 all these things need to be taught,\u201d she said. However, not all struggling owners are inexperienced. Phil Wright, 59, from Southport, owned a number of labradors before he welcomed sisters Scout and Harper into his home as puppies in February 2020. He said: \u201cI didn\u2019t anticipate any problems. But I didn\u2019t anticipate lockdown either.\u201d Both his black labradors have severe separation anxiety, with Scout howling if Wright leaves the house, as well as problematic behaviour on the lead such as barking \u2013 particularly if they see a small dog. \u201cThey can pull me over,\u201d said Wright. \u201cThe separation anxiety definitely stems from me being around so much during lockdown. Likewise the behaviour on lead [is] due to lack of socialisation during lockdown,\u201d he added. According to UK Pet Food, in 2023 there were about 12 million pet dogs in the UK, with some data suggesting there was a surge in puppy ownership during the height of the Covid pandemic. However, the RVC survey reveals Wright is not alone in facing difficulties. Out of more than 1,000 UK dog owners, 97% reported their dog had at least one problem behaviour from a list of 24, while on average owners reported five problems. The most common problem was pulling on the lead \u2013 reported by about two-thirds of participants \u2013 with jumping up and poor recall in second and third place respectively. Overall, control problems were the most common type of trouble \u2013 being reported by 84% of participants \u2013 however 25% reported their dog had aggressive behaviours. The latest results are part of a project by the RVC that follows a group of dogs bought as young puppies in 2020, during the Covid pandemic. While the study was not able to compare the prevalence of problem behaviours among pandemic puppies with their prevalence among dogs acquired before or after the pandemic, Packer said comparisons with other datasets suggested a general elevation of issues among the pandemic puppy cohort. The team added one area of concern was that, while 96% of owners used positive reinforcement such as praise to train their dog, 82% used one or more punishment-based methods such as choke chains, shouting or pushing their dog \u2013 methods that can cause further behavioural problems. Such approaches, they note, appeared to be more common in owners who had not attended online puppy classes during the pandemic. Packer added owners reported turning to friends, family or even social media for advice on dog training, but that many of the latter advocated punishment-based techniques. \u201cThese owners are struggling but they\u2019re not actually reaching out to professionals for help,\u201d she said. The RVC advises those who are struggling with behaviour problems in their dog to take their pet to the vet, as difficulties can cause health problems, while those who missed out on puppy classes can still get help with behaviour from experts registered with the Animal Behaviour Training Council. Wright added that despite the challenges, he would not be without his dogs. \u201cThey are great, beautiful, friendly, but just a nightmare when they are out on a lead,\u201d he said."

The RTS,S vaccine \u2013 662,000 doses of it \u2013 will be administered to children in the west African country, the first to be vaccinated after successful trials of the drug in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi between 2019 and 2021. It marks a scaling up of the fight against malaria in Africa, where 95% of deaths from the disease occur, most among children under five. \u201cWe are not just witnessing but actively participating in a transformative chapter in Africa\u2019s public health history,\u201d said Dr Mohammed Abdulaziz, the division head at the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, headquartered in Ethiopia, at a joint online briefing with the World Health Organization. \u201cFor a long time we have been waiting for a day like this \u2026 it brings more than just hope, it brings a reduction in the mortality and morbidity associated with malaria.\u201d Public health experts say communication with the public will be crucial to the vaccine\u2019s success \u2013 to ensure that it is trusted, that people bring their children back for all four doses, and that people understand it will be most effective when combined with other measures, such as sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets. \u201cWe need messaging, we need communication, and we need to use trusted voices,\u201d said Abdulaziz. \u201cWe need to use health workers who are very close to the community. We need to listen to the community, to what they are saying and also monitor how we are being received.\u201d Kate O\u2019Brien, the director of the WHO\u2019s immunisations and vaccines department, said that based on the trial data, RTS,S \u2013 also known as Mosquirix \u2013 would saves tens of thousands of lives. Another 19 African countries plan to introduce the vaccine this year, with hopes that 6.6 million children could be reached. Deliveries are due for Burkina Faso, Liberia, Niger and Sierra Leone. Mbianke Livancliff, from the Cameroon nonprofit Value Health Africa, said there has been excitement in the country since the vaccines were delivered in November. The organisation has held community meetings and open discussions to introduce people to the vaccine and its approval process, to deal with people\u2019s concerns and stave off any potential hesitancy. \u201cIt has been an exciting moment. Families are excited, they are happy to have this major development and they are saying this is effective and this is what we have been waiting for,\u201d Livancliff said. In the Cameroon city of Douala, at the private Angels Clinic, six-month-old Nobah Adel screamed as she was scratched by the needle administering her first dose of the vaccine on Monday morning. \u201cEven if she cries, I\u2019m very happy today,\u201d said her mother, Dani Widal, who heard about the vaccine campaign a week ago. \u201cI have three children and all are always sick with malaria. I hope that the vaccine will finally help her not to be sick like her brother and her sister.\u201d Widal had queued with her daughter for three hours to get the vaccine. \u201cI live in a neighbourhood where there are a lot of mosquitoes. I spend more than 30,000 francs [\u00a339] every three months because of malaria.\u201d Kamela Isabelle Madjouwou, a nurse at the centre, said a malaria vaccine was \u201cessential\u201d. Cameroon recorded more than 6m cases in 2022 and malaria accounted for 12% of deaths among children under five in 2021. \u201cThe vaccine will reduce mortality and the consequences of this terrible disease,\u201d she said. Thomas Breuer, the chief global health officer at GlaxoSmithKline, which produced the vaccine said it was a significant development: \u201cAfter more than 35 years of dedicated work with our partners to develop the world\u2019s first malaria vaccine, Mosquirix, it\u2019s rewarding to see it in routine use for the first time. We\u2019re excited that more malaria-endemic countries are preparing to introduce the vaccine over the coming months.\u201d A second malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M, produced by the University of Oxford, is due to be rolled out later this year."

            "content": "An assertion by Florida\u2019s politically appointed surgeon general that Covid-19 vaccines can contaminate human DNA has been dismissed as \u201cscientific nonsense\u201d by public health experts, who say he is putting lives at risk by wanting to block distribution. Dr Joseph Ladapo, who was handpicked by the state\u2019s far-right governor and fellow vaccine-skeptic, Ron DeSantis, to be the state\u2019s top public health official, called for a halt in the distribution and use of mRNA Covid boosters, in an official bulletin published on Wednesday by the Florida health department. His assertion that components of the shots \u201cpose a unique and heightened risk of DNA integration into human cells\u201d, potentially causing cancer, is the latest in a series of false claims by Ladapo, a prominent anti-vaxxer previously found to have manipulated data on vaccine safety. Dr Ashish Jha, a former White House Covid-19 response coordinator and dean of Brown University\u2019s school of public health, said Ladapo\u2019s position has no merit. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this pattern from Dr Ladapo that every few months he raises some new concern and it quickly gets debunked,\u201d he told the Washington Post, referring to an erroneous claim in September that the latest release of Covid boosters had not been tested on humans. \u201cThis idea of DNA fragments, it\u2019s scientific nonsense. People who understand how these vaccines are made and administered understand that there is no risk here.\u201d Dr David Gorski, professor of surgery and oncology at Wayne State University and managing editor of Science-Based Medicine, which debunks misinformation in medicine, told the newspaper: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a state health authority parrot anti-vaccine disinformation as a justification for stopping the use of a vaccine that has saved so many lives before.\u201d The Harvard-educated Ladapo is aligned with a rightwing group called America\u2019s Frontline Doctors, which has pushed bogus Covid-19 cures according to a Time investigation, and has been accused by colleagues at the University of Florida of sullying the name of its flagship medical school. Other critics have accused him of \u201cnormalizing medical quackery\u201d. In the health bulletin, Ladapo says the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had not properly assessed a risk that \u201cDNA fragments\u201d in popular mRNA vaccines manufactured by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech can cause \u201ccontaminate integration with human DNA\u201d. Conspiracy theories that the shots contain dangerous DNA sequences including the monkey virus Simian Virus 40 cited by Ladapo are popular with vaccine skeptics, but have been widely debunked. In an email to the Associated Press, a spokesperson for Pfizer dismissed the claim that its Covid-19 vaccine contained contaminant DNA fragments. \u201cThe vaccine is a completely synthetic vaccine. There were preclinical animal challenge studies utilizing rhesus macaques; however, no part of our vaccine or studies utilized green monkeys. The claim that the vaccine includes monkey DNA is inaccurate,\u201d Pfizer\u2019s statement said. The Associated press contributed reporting"

            "content": "Though measles had been eradicated in the US in 2000, the disease is expected to continue a nationwide spread primarily because of vaccine skepticism, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said. Measles, one of the most transmissible diseases, has been found in recent weeks in some north-eastern US states, according to the CDC. The health agency warned healthcare workers about an uptick in measles infections and urged them to be on alert for new cases. An email from the CDC sent to healthcare workers last week said the agency was notified of 23 confirmed US cases of measles between 1 December 2023 and 23 January 2024. Most of these infections were in children and teenagers who had not gotten their measles vaccines despite being eligible. So far, measles cases have been found in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and the Washington DC area. Taylor Nelson, a University of Missouri healthcare center infectious disease physician, said to the news station KRCG that measles would probably spread to the midwest and the west coast given the situation laid out by the CDC. If measles cases are discovered, healthcare workers are asked to isolate patients, immediately notify local and state health departments, test patients with nose or throat swabs, and ensure all patients are vaccinated against the disease, especially if traveling internationally. The CDC email said measles cases often originate from unvaccinated or undervaccinated people who travel internationally and then transmit the disease to others who are not vaccinated against the disease. \u201cThe increased number of measles importations seen in recent weeks is reflective of a rise in global measles cases and a growing global threat from the disease,\u201d the email said. Although measles is highly contagious, vaccines are effective in preventing the disease, which has caused a surge in cases in Europe, according to the World Health Organization. Measles became a national problem in the US in the early 1900s. But once a vaccine for the disease was created in 1963, the number of cases drastically reduced over the next few decades. An effective nationwide vaccination campaign successfully saw the vaccine routinely given to people as they began school, and by 2000 the campaign had prevented continuous transmission. But measles is spreading again because of a growing number of unvaccinated people. Measles symptoms include fatigue, a runny nose, coughing, fever, red or watery eyes, and eventually a full-body rash. In some of the worst cases, measles can lead to death. Those who have received at least one dose of the measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine are 93% protected against measles. But two doses are recommended for maximum protection. Those who have already had measles at some point in their life are also protected against the disease. Measles is especially dangerous for infants and young children. Once measles is contracted, health experts say the disease must run its course since no antiviral treatment targeting the disease exists."

            "title": "UK less prepared for pandemic than pre-Covid, former vaccine chief warns",
            "date": "2024-01-24T18:37:36Z",
            "content": "The UK is less prepared for a pandemic than it was before the Covid crisis after driving away jab manufacturers and relying on a narrow range of shots, according to the country\u2019s former vaccine chief. Dr Clive Dix, who chaired the UK\u2019s vaccine taskforce, told MPs on Wednesday there had been \u201ca complete demise\u201d of work to ensure the UK was better equipped with vaccines for the next pandemic, noting that all the activities were \u201cliterally gone\u201d. The vaccine taskforce is widely regarded as a rare highlight in Britain\u2019s Covid response. It was led by the venture capitalist Kate Bingham and Dix, who took over as chair in December 2020, when Britain became the first country to roll out Covid jabs. Speaking to the Commons science, innovation and technology committee, Dix said he and Bingham gave ministers a set of \u201cstrong recommendations\u201d to make sure Britain was better prepared when the next pandemic hit, but these were not adopted or published. \u201c[There were] activities already going on that were stopped,\u201d he added. Another big concern, Dix said, was the UK\u2019s reliance on mRNA vaccines, the approach behind the Pfizer and Moderna Covid shots, to tackle future outbreaks. \u201cThat\u2019s really scary,\u201d he told the hearing. \u201cThe mRNA vaccines are not the be-all and end-all. They will only work if we know what the virus is and know the antigen,\u201d he said, referring to the part of the virus that triggers the immune system. Beyond failing to invest in a range of vaccine technologies, the UK also drove vaccine manufacturers away by treating them so poorly, Dix added, leaving the country in an even worse position than before Covid. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is a whole list of incompetent decisions,\u201d Dix told MPs. \u201cWe have less resilience now because a lot of the manufacturers have walked away from the UK because of how badly they were treated at the tail end of the vaccine taskforce.\u201d He raised the case of Valneva, a French firm that mothballed a vaccine facility it had built in Scotland after the government cancelled its contract during final stage clinical trials. On scrapping the deal, former health secretary Sajid Javid said the UK would not have approved the vaccine, but the medicines regulator duly approved the shot. Dix called the comments \u201cincompetence at the highest level\u201d. A statement read to the MPs from the Pandemic Sciences Institute at Oxford University echoed concerns about a lack of resilience, noting that Britain was not prepared for the recent mpox outbreak and \u201cremains unprepared for an avian influenza outbreak\u201d. Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, who gave evidence alongside Dix, said the danger was in preparing for a future pandemic exactly like Covid. While Covid vaccines took nearly a year to develop, they built on years of crucial research on coronaviruses. Work on dozens of other potential pandemic pathogens lagged far behind, he said. \u201cFor me, we are really unsafe at this moment for future pandemic threats because we just don\u2019t have that knowledge base that you need to even start the gun as we did in 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd even then it took 11 months to have a vaccine.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-16T14:00:02Z",
            "content": "The man who launched Pfizer\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine in the UK three years ago \u2013 when 90-year-old Margaret Keenan in Coventry became the first person in the world to receive one \u2013 is now overseeing the construction of a manufacturing and research centre in Oxfordshire for rival US jab maker Moderna. The company\u2019s Harwell site is Britain\u2019s first centre dedicated to the production of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against new Covid variants and other illnesses, and part of the UK\u2019s \u201c100 days mission\u201d initiative \u2013 the ambition for governments to be able to respond to future pandemics within 100 days of a threat being identified. Moderna and others are using mRNA \u2013 which teaches cells how to make a specific protein that triggers the body\u2019s immune response against disease \u2013 to develop therapies for various conditions, including cancer, HIV, norovirus and rare diseases, particularly those in children. Darius Hughes, who trained as a pharmacist and worked for Pfizer for 17 years before being poached by Moderna in 2021 to set up its UK operation as general manager, says: \u201cThe flexibility of the messenger RNA platform means that within about 100 days of any mutation, we can have a vaccine reformulated and on the market ready for vaccination into people. That\u2019s a lot quicker than a traditional vaccines platform.\u201d With Moderna working on combined flu and Covid shots, he says, \u201cthe Department of Health can come to us and request a specific UK mix for UK patients. We can combine a lot of messenger RNAs together so that you can make it very simple for the NHS to deliver.\u201d Moderna developed one of the world\u2019s first two Covid jabs based on mRNA during the pandemic \u2013 Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech were behind the other \u2013 and both were quick to adapt their shots to the Omicron variants in 2022. However, the virus remains a problem for the NHS, which has come under pressure in recent weeks from a surge in the number of Covid and flu admissions to hospital. Nevertheless, Covid shots are now only given by the NHS to over-65s, those with underlying health conditions, health workers and carers. Moderna plans to make its Covid jab available privately in the UK later this year. It is expected to cost between \u00a350 and \u00a3100 \u2013 versus \u00a39 to \u00a320 for a flu shot \u2013 but pharmacies and private clinics will set their own price, Hughes says. The company\u2019s Spikevax jab can already be bought over the counter in the US for about $120 (\u00a3100). Pfizer is also exploring selling its Comirnaty Covid jab privately in the UK. Moderna is also focusing its mRNA knowhow on rare diseases in children and personalised cancer vaccines. \u201cIn rare diseases, what we\u2019re doing is an intravenous injection,\u201d says Hughes. \u201cWe are putting in some messages there that help the body to produce a protein that is missing in the children.\u201d The illnesses targeted include inherited metabolic disorders in which the body cannot break down certain proteins and fats. In skin cancer cases, Moderna takes a part of the tumour cells that have been cut out during surgery, sequences the patient\u2019s DNA and makes mRNA signals. These are injected into the body and tell the body to produce antibodies to attack the cancer cells. \u201cUnlike normal cancer therapy, which kills everything fairly indiscriminately, these are like targeted missiles,\u201d says Hughes. Bigger late-stage clinical trials led by Moderna\u2019s partner Merck (known as MSD outside the US) are beginning in the UK and elsewhere, and according to Moderna the vaccine could be launched under accelerated approval in some countries by 2025. Another late-stage trial for non-small-cell lung cancer is also under way. Moderna hopes to launch a combined flu and Covid vaccine next year, followed in 2026 by a triple shot including not only flu and Covid but also respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which can cause severe illness and hospitalisation in children and older people. The company has submitted a new RSV vaccine for regulatory approval, but is lagging behind UK rival GSK and Pfizer, whose RSV vaccines are already on the market. Meanwhile, a recent Sanofi and AstraZeneca trial indicated its jab could cut RSV hospital admissions of babies and young children by 80%. Harwell will be Moderna\u2019s biggest base outside the US: the lab is already in place and will open later this year. About 150 people will work at the site, including 50 scientists. The factory is expected to produce up to 100m vaccine doses a year from 2025, which could be ramped up to 250m doses by running three shifts a day, seven days a week, if there were another pandemic \u2013 \u201cplenty for the UK and beyond\u201d, Hughes says. He describes himself as a \u201cfailed doctor\u201d, having been good at science and maths at school in his home town of Poole in Dorset but failing to get the grades for medical school. In the end he \u201cloved\u201d studying pharmacy at Portsmouth University. After a six-month stint in the NHS, he worked for Boots for 15 years and then joined the pharmaceutical industry, with various roles at Pfizer, including a two-year spell in Paris and seven years running the UK and Ireland vaccines division. After delivering 15m Covid shots for Pfizer in the early part of 2021, Hughes was exhausted, having worked long hours, seven days a week, for a year. So when he received a call from Moderna asking him to be their first commercial employee in the UK, he was ready for a change. While looking promising, personalised cancer vaccines throw up challenges with clinical trials and regulatory approval because they are \u201cindividual to a particular person\u201d \u2013 but Hughes believes they are the future. \u201cMedicine is going personalised, and it\u2019s not just in vaccines and in cancer,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be at the forefront of this.\u201d He says the government did not offer any incentives in return for Moderna establishing Britain\u2019s first mRNA vaccine hub. However, the UK has committed to buying Moderna\u2019s therapies over the next decade and ordered 60m doses of its Covid vaccine in December 2021; a tranche of these are being delivered during the current booster campaign. Globally, Moderna has delivered more than 1bn doses of its Covid vaccine \u2013 its only commercial product \u2013 but has been criticised for its high pricing, which resulted in sales of $18.4bn in 2022. They have since declined, to $6.7bn last year after the US declared the pandemic over, and are predicted to fall to $4bn this year. The firm wrote down unused doses and made a $4bn loss before tax in the nine months to 30 September. Its goal is to break even in 2026. As part of its 10-year partnership with the government, Moderna is building up a UK supply chain, including vials and needles, to ensure Britain is prepared for the next pandemic. The company has launched 17 clinical trials in the UK since 2021, including Covid, flu and RSV studies, and more trials for rare diseases and combination vaccines are planned to take place in Britain. One of Moderna\u2019s investors is the hedge fund Th\u00e9l\u00e8me Partners, of which Rishi Sunak was a founding partner, before quitting in 2013 to go into politics. It is unclear whether he retains a stake in the fund. \u201cWe are not privy to information about individuals who have contributed into the Th\u00e9l\u00e8me hedge fund,\u201d Moderna says.

            "content": "A coroner has issued a warning to Southampton University over the \u201cawareness, understanding and curiosity\u201d of academic staff around the mental health of students after a student killed himself on the day his exam results were due. Christopher Wilkinson, the senior area coroner for Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton, said interruptions to academic work and to the rhythms of normal student life during and after the pandemic had had a significant impact on mental health. The coroner issued a preventing future deaths report to the Russell Group university after the death of Matthew Wickes, an engineering student, in June 2022. An inquest in Winchester concluded that 21-year-old Wickes took his own life while suffering from an acute anxiety crisis. Wilkinson said: \u201cI am concerned about the level of awareness, understanding and curiosity of academic staff around the mental health of students, particularly in the post-pandemic climate where interruptions to their study and dysregulated student life have had a significant impact on their mental health.\u201d A number of universities have been criticised over the support provided to struggling students, among them Bristol University, which was ordered to pay damages to the parents of Natasha Abrahart, 20, who died a day before she was due to give a \u201cterrifying\u201d oral exam in front of teachers and fellow students. A coroner strongly criticised the University of Exeter over the suicide of another student, Harry Armstrong Evans, claiming it failed to respond effectively to his \u201ccry for help\u201d after a disastrous set of exam results. During Wickes\u2019s inquest, Southampton University said all staff were offered training on mental health management and provided with guidance on how to support students. But Wilkinson said: \u201cI am concerned that aspects of this are not made compulsory for academic staff \u2026 It remains unclear as to who or how many staff have actually viewed or undertaken the online training around student mental health.\u201d The coroner accepted that the university had taken steps to plan an \u201cearly warning system\u201d for students. \u201cHowever, I do have concerns that there remains an evident gap between the academic assessment of students and the pastoral support that they receive,\u201d he said. Wilkinson continued: \u201cWhere academic absence or performance issues are identified, I am not convinced, on the evidence heard at this inquest, that enough has yet been done to also consider how \u2018reaching out\u2019 to such students can be most effectively achieved.\u201d He said: \u201cThe evidence at this inquest raised concerns over the existence, frequency and accuracy of the recording and minuting of academic meetings with students. It was of concern to me that the university was unable to locate or provide clear minutes of supervisory catchups, progress checks or agreed guidance or actions for Matthew.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "date": "2024-01-15T15:01:24Z",
            "content": "From Cain and Abel and the Brothers Karamazov to Cinderella, the warmth and support provided by siblings has hardly been taken for granted. Now, researchers have found that children who moan about their brothers and sisters may have good reason to complain: the more siblings teenagers have, the more it hits their happiness, they claim. A study of secondary schoolchildren in the US and China found that those from larger families had slightly poorer mental health than those from smaller families. The greatest impact was seen in families with multiple children born less than a year apart. Doug Downey, a professor of sociology at Ohio State University, said previous work in the field had revealed a mixed picture of positives and negatives for children with more siblings, adding that the latest results \u201cwere not a given\u201d. The researchers asked 9,100 eighth graders in the US and 9,400 in China, with an average age of 14, a range of questions about their mental health, though the specific questions varied between the countries. In China, the teenagers with no siblings fared best for mental health. In the US, children who had no siblings or only one were found to have similar mental health. Overall, mental health was worse the more siblings the teenagers had, with greater impacts seen for teenagers with older siblings, and when brothers and sisters were closely spaced in age. Writing in the Journal of Family Issues, Downey and his colleagues argue that the findings are in line with the \u201cresource dilution\u201d explanation, the driving force behind the unwritten formula that states that the number of balls dropped rises, sometimes dramatically, with the number of siblings born. \u201cIf you think of parental resources like a pie, one child means that they get all the pie,\u201d Downey said. \u201cBut when you add more siblings, each child gets fewer resources and attention from the parents, and that may have an impact on their mental health.\u201d That teenagers fared worse when their siblings were a similar age backs up the thinking, the researchers believe. But there are other potential explanations. For example, the teenagers with the best mental health came from families with the highest socioeconomic advantages. In the US, these were often families with only one or two children. In China, it was the families with one child. In line with China\u2019s one child policy, about a third of Chinese children were only children, compared with 12.6% of US children. With the rise of \u201cone and done\u201d families, researchers are increasingly keen to tease out the impact of brothers and sisters on mental health and other factors. Previous studies suggest a slew of positive impacts linked to siblings, suggesting a complex picture of pros and cons. Earlier work by Downey showed that children with more siblings got along better with others at nursery, and were less likely to divorce in later life \u2013 perhaps because they already had some experience at navigating close relationships. Meanwhile, a 2016 study of more than 100,000 Norwegian children found better mental health across the ages in larger families."

Telephone calls ascertained that there were no NHS or private beds locally; nor within the county; nor in any neighbouring counties. I was asked if I would please keep him in my house overnight. He was frightening, ranting, shouting, delusional, hardly sleeping, incontinent with bed sores, and had not eaten for days. I had to say yes.

            "date": "2024-01-19T06:00:22Z",
            "content": "The Home Office spent a six-figure sum on mental health support for frontline Border Force officers after mental health-related absences for staff across the agency increased by 45% as deaths in the Channel rose, a freedom of information request has revealed. Border Force staff were off on average for more than two days a year for reasons related to mental health between the springs of 2021 and 2023, the figures show, up from 1.4 days between spring 2020 and 2021. From spring 2020 to spring 2021, 13,005 working days were lost among the Border Force\u2019s 9,165 staff because of absences related to mental health. Between spring 2022 and spring 2023, the number of staff in the agency jumped to 15,485. Among them, 31,801 working days were lost because of mental-health sick days. The rise in absences came as the number of boats crossing the Channel reached record highs and the number of deaths increased sharply. Since 2021, 59 people have died attempting the crossing. In November 2021, a dinghy carrying 30 people sank, killing 27 of those onboard, including a five-year-old girl and her teenage siblings. It was the deadliest maritime disaster in the Channel for more than 30 years. Last weekend, five people died trying to board small boats heading to the UK from France. In the summer of 2023, the Home Office awarded a contract worth \u00a3133,000 to the Police Treatment Centres, an external charity that provides \u201cintensive, police-specific physiotherapy and rehabilitation, for injured and ill police officers\u201d. The treatment centres provided facilities to send staff to residential rehabilitation for up to two weeks, inclusive of accommodation and food, physiotherapy, psychological assessment and treatment services for frontline officers. Last year, there were almost 30,000 small boat crossings. This followed on from a record year of crossings in 2022, when almost 46,000 small boats crossed the Channel. The year-long contract does not state whether there is a limit on how many people would be able to take advantage of the rehabilitation facilities. The freedom of information data comes after recent criticism of the government from the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, David Neal, over its lack of support for the Border Force. Neal pointed to widespread disaffection within the organisation in his report to the home secretary. Last year, the Guardian revealed that the Home Office was providing border officers with mental health workshops dealing with the small boats issue. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), which represents government workers, said these workshops were offered after fellow trained officers carried out trauma assessments on staff. The assessment is offered to those involved in potentially traumatic critical incidents. Last October, when an immigration centre in Dover was petrol-bombed, the PCS said all staff involved in the incident were offered the assessment. In a letter sent to the Home Office permanent secretary, Matthew Rycroft, last year, the PCS officials James Cox and Peter Wright wrote that promises to \u201cstop the boats\u201d and describing Channel crossings as an \u201cinvasion\u201d had consequences for people working in processing centres. \u201cThese are consequences which potentially put our members at risk,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThere have been demonstrations and some violence around hotels housing migrants. Furthermore, there was the shocking case of the firebombing of the migrant arrival site last year.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cBorder Force officers work tirelessly day in, day out to protect our borders and keep the public safe. \u201cWe recognise that being a Border Force officer is a demanding role. That is why we have introduced additional mental health support to ensure our officers are supported if needed.\u201d"

That was all I knew,\u201d says the Gotham FC goalkeeper Michelle Betos. \u201cSo when I got to the professional ranks and those things existed, I was almost immune to them. I think that was the biggest issue in this league for so long. From youth to professional, that\u2019s all we knew. \u201cTo be in a room of coaches that were talking about that, that were understanding it, that were recognising how important the mental side of this game is for the development of those kids as humans, whatever they go on to do, was emotional.\u201d Betos is among a group of professional players, youth coaches and facilitators to take a moment to step away from last week\u2019s extraordinary four-day mental health retreat in San Diego to talk to the Observer. It was the brainchild of Naomi Girma, a defender for San Diego Wave. A year ago, motivated by the loss of Katie Meyer, her best friend and Stanford University teammate, who died by suicide in March 2022, Girma wrote in her diary: \u201cSet up a mental health thing with Common Goal.\u201d Common Goal is an organisation whereby players, managers and clubs pledge 1% of their income to be put back into the game. Girma says: \u201cI was really wanting to do something in her honour, something I thought could have helped a younger Katie. I didn\u2019t want anyone else\u2019s family, friends or community to have to go through something like this.\u201d That led to Fox Sports committing to making 1% of their 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup coverage to discussing mental health \u2013 it ended up being 6% \u2013 and a viral campaign with the US women\u2019s national team. Now there is the Create the Space retreat, which brought together 20 players, one from each National Women\u2019s Soccer League (NWSL) club in their off-season, and 25 local youth coaches to discuss a multitude of mental health-related topics. Girma first contacted Common Goal\u2019s US executive director, Lilli Barrett-O\u2019Keefe, who says of the 23-year-old: \u201cTo have an idea, write it in your journal, be that intentional, and then be bringing it to life a year later just speaks volumes to what the next wave of NWSL players are going to do. \u201cThey\u2019re reclaiming power, taking back control. They\u2019re no longer pointing fingers at corrupt systems or a lack of policies alone but are saying: \u2018We can create the culture that we want and we have the ability to go back into our communities and our clubs and our systems and demand better and demand different.\u2019\u201d The effect on all involved in the retreat has been profound. \u201cI already know I\u2019m walking away better, more equipped and lighter than when I walked in,\u201d says Betos. \u201cThere\u2019s not much else you could ask for. \u201cMy hope is that we all take this feeling that we\u2019ve been able to experience and bring it to our environments and open this up to a group, so we can create locker rooms that feel safe \u2013 where it doesn\u2019t have to be a choice between prioritising our mental performance and our sports performance, where the two can coexist. For so long it\u2019s been \u2018choose one\u2019, but the sweet spot is both.\u201d Becky Sauerbrunn, the US women\u2019s captain, received a message from Girma on Christmas Eve asking if she wanted to take part. \u201cNaomi\u2019s such an amazing woman and to have such tragedy start something like this is so beautiful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful because it\u2019s also very heavy, there\u2019s a lot of grief here. \u201cTo have Katie\u2019s name attached to something like this and to keep her memory alive and knowing that her story is going to help so many people, it really is a special thing that she\u2019s done.\u201d Myra Sack, one of the retreat\u2019s facilitators, says the event is a \u201ctestament to Naomi\u2019s ability to turn towards something that\u2019s so painful\u201d. She adds: \u201cTo create opportunity and space for coaches and professional athletes to be better for ourselves and others in Katie\u2019s honour speaks to the power of what happens when we pay attention to our pain as opposed to turning away from it.\u201d Sack\u2019s organisation, e-motion, was born out of the life and death of her daughter, Havi, who died of a neurodegenerative disease in 2021. Sack played college soccer and had worked in sports-based youth development for more than a decade and thought not enough was being done to engage with grief in these spaces. \u201cThere are accumulated losses all the time that all of these players are experiencing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt could be death-related, it could be personal or emotional, it could be related to a loss of a home, moving dorms, being benched, being traded or an injury. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to get into the loss Olympics, we don\u2019t need to compare or minimise each other\u2019s losses. We can just connect at the level of pain in each of our humanities and it doesn\u2019t have to be so scary.\u201d Sauerbrunn was worried she would feel uncomfortable sharing her own vulnerabilities but those walls fall rapidly. \u201cIt\u2019s been completely consensual. If you want to share, you can share. Nothing is forced. \u201cGoing into this retreat, what I was really hoping to get from it is that I wouldn\u2019t have to feel so curated in my thoughts and be so diplomatic, that I could really speak to the feelings in my soul and I\u2019ve really been able to do that here.\u201d Sinead Farrelly retired from the game for eight years but returned to play for Gotham FC last year after exposing the sexually coercive behaviour of her former head coach Paul Riley. Riley denied the accusations but they led to a reckoning in the NWSL. \u201cI know first-hand that my choice to be vulnerable and my choice to be supported in something that used to bring me so much shame, and that was traumatic to me, has changed my life,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore that, I was dying inside. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to come back and play soccer. I wouldn\u2019t feel the fulfilment I feel now in other parts of my life. \u201cThese conversations and these safe spaces save lives. There were so many times I didn\u2019t want to live, but it was more that I didn\u2019t want to live the life I was living. Opening up gave me the opportunity to alchemise my past into a way that I could exist in the future and exist happily and in a fulfilled way.\u201d Girma\u2019s inclusion of youth coaches alongside NWSL players in Create the Space has profoundly affected all involved. She wanted to do that because of \u201chow big of an impact a coach has on a kid\u2019s life, far beyond their soccer careers\u201d. South Bronx United\u2019s director of football, Andy Jenkins, believes not enough emphasis is placed on mental health in coaching badges, especially given how few that are affected will go on to be professional players. \u201cCoaching badges teach you content, knowledge, tactics, how to develop players. They don\u2019t teach you how to develop human beings, they don\u2019t tell you how to work with human beings, how to motivate human beings, how to be a role model, how to be an advocate for them, how to be a supporter, how to be approachable \u2013 all the qualities that are the true qualities that make someone an excellent coach,\u201d he says. \u201cThe emphasis within our system is wrong, both here in the US and in the UK, that in order to build great soccer players we have to teach them technical skills rather than such important transferable life skills which will serve them in soccer and in school and life beyond that.\u201d Goalkeeper Carly Nelson, who is excited by the prospect of helping shape the environment at the new NWSL club Utah Royals, highlights the effect these coaches have on the top of the game as much as the bottom. \u201cMental health in soccer has been neglected for so long. As professional athletes it\u2019s not new, it\u2019s affected us since youth levels,\u201d she says. \u201cSeeing youth coaches take this conversation in their own hands and get the tools and the resources to start conversations and work on empowering kids to feel safe has been incredibly inspiring.\u201d Create the Space will continue to provide avenues for people to talk, including setting up webinars and workshops for those who could not attend, and work with the 45 at the retreat throughout the year. They plan to expand the project. What would the players like to see? Sauerbrunn says in the NWSL, which has felt \u201csuch trauma\u201d, they are \u201conly beginning to scratch the surface mental health-wise\u201d when it comes to \u201ctraining for staff and those in charge, but also training for the players as well. Our hope is that we can have that progress quicker so that we are making sure the youth have all the tools but also that players like me, at 38 years old, have these tools because these are lifelong things that we can use.\u201d Betos would like to see the retreat\u2019s aims broaden beyond the players. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing almost 13 years and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been in a club yet that\u2019s doing it all right,\u201d she says. \u201cI would love to see head coaches doing something like this. \u201cMental health is also very important and an issue for people in their shoes, but it\u2019s also important they understand the impact they can and do have on us.\u201d Sauerbrunn agrees: \u201cIt would be beneficial for everyone to be able to have a space like this, to learn these tools and be able to apply them into whatever workspace or life space they\u2019re in. If that starts next with coaches and people that are in direct control of some people\u2019s livelihoods? That\u2019s wonderful.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-13T19:23:18Z",
            "content": "A prolonged conflict in the Red Sea and escalating tensions across the Middle East risk having devastating effects on the global economy, reigniting inflation and disrupting energy supplies, some of the world\u2019s leading economists warn this weekend. Before a statement expected on Monday by Rishi Sunak in the House of Commons about UK and US airstrikes on Houthi sites in Yemen, economists at the World Bank say the crisis now threatens to feed through into higher interest rates, lower growth, persistent inflation and greater geopolitical uncertainty. After a second night of strikes against the Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen, President Joe Biden said that the US had sent a private message to Tehran that \u201cwe\u2019re confident we\u2019re well prepared\u201d. Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn on Saturday, on his way to Camp David, Biden declined to go into further detail. But there is now growing concern in government circles in London and Washington that as Sunak and Biden fight for re-election, events in the Middle East could dash what had looked like improved prospects for economic recovery and therefore their chances at the ballot box. While the airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen have broad cross-party support at Westminster, Sunak will face questions from anxious MPs about a prolonged conflict and the longer-term plan for Middle East peace. Some leftwing Labour MPs are expected to put Keir Starmer under pressure over why he backed the military strikes having said that he would only support such action after parliament had voted in favour of it. Biden also faced pushback from progressives in his own party, already deeply opposed to US military support for Israeli action in Gaza. California congressman Ro Khanna said: \u201cThe president needs to come to Congress before launching a strike against the Houthis in Yemen and involving us in another Middle East conflict.\u201d In its latest report on global economic prospects, the World Bank says the Middle East crisis, with the war in Ukraine, has created real dangers. \u201cConflict escalation could lead to surging energy prices, with broader implications for global activity and inflation,\u201d it says. \u201cOther risks include financial stress related to real interest rates, persistent inflation, weaker than expected growth in China, further trade fragmentation and climate change-related disasters.\u201d It adds: \u201cRecent attacks on commercial vessels transiting the Red Sea have already started to disrupt key shipping routes, eroding slack in supply networks and increasing the likelihood of inflationary bottlenecks. In a setting of escalating conflicts, energy supplies could also be substantially disrupted, leading to a spike in energy prices. This would have significant spillovers to other commodity prices and heighten geopolitical and economic uncertainty, which in turn could dampen investment and lead to a further weakening of growth.\u201d John Llewellyn, a partner at Independent Economics and a former chief economist of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), said: \u201cThis has escalated to become a serious problem.\u201d He put the probability of serious disruptions to world trade at 30%, up from 10% a week ago: \u201cThere is a horrible and inevitable progression that could see the situation in the Red Sea spread to the strait of Hormuz and the wider Middle East.\u201d An economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Ben Zaranko, told the Observer the crisis underlined the perils of the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, using limited fiscal headroom to promise tax cuts. \u201cIf we have learned anything over the last few years it is that bad shocks can and do come along,\u201d Zaranko said. \u201cSpending every single penny of \u2018headroom\u2019 on tax cuts leaves him no room for manoeuvre if a nasty shock comes along and the outlook deteriorates.\u201d The conflict in the Middle East widened on Thursday when dozens of British and US strikes hit Houthi sites in Yemen. The strikes were in retaliation for attacks on vessels passing through the Red Sea, which have paralysed shipping in one of the world\u2019s most important maritime channels. The Houthis say they are targeting only Israel-affiliated vessels, in an effort to support Palestinians in Gaza, but many of their targets had no known links to Israel. They have also fired missiles at Israel\u2019s territory. A US strike on a radar site in Yemen on Friday night prompted Houthi threats of a \u201cstrong and effective response\u201d to international attacks, and fuelled fears of regional escalation in a conflict already playing out across multiple borders. Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had had no significant impact on the Houthis\u2019 ability to prevent vessels from passing through the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. The top UN official for Yemen, special envoy Hans Grundberg, warned of \u201cserious concerns\u201d about stability and the fragile peace efforts in Yemen, which has endured years of civil war. The Houthis are just one of several Iran-aligned groups across the region, including in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon, which are attacking targets either inside Israel, or which they say are linked to Israel. Hezbollah in Lebanon represents perhaps the most severe threat. Farea Al-Muslimi, from the Chatham House Middle East programme, said: \u201cThe Houthis are far more savvy, prepared and well-equipped than many western commentators realise. Their recklessness, and willingness to escalate in the face of a challenge, is always underrated.\u201d William Bain, the British Chamber of Commerce\u2019s trade expert, said: \u201cAbout 500,000 containers were going through the Suez canal in November and that had dropped 60% to 200,000 in December.\u201d Ships are taking different routes, but that has raised costs, with a container that cost $1,500 in November rising to $4,000 in December. \u201cIf things get worse, it only adds to the disruption, and the cost of containers will go up and global trade will fall further,\u201d he said. Economists, many of them arriving in Davos this week for the annual World Economic Forum, have become increasingly worried that many of the world\u2019s major economies may now suffer a recession this year. They fear that central banks will make only modest cuts to borrowing costs, adding to the cost of living crisis faced by millions of households. The prospect of higher oil prices could convince central banks to hold firm and maintain high interest rates for a longer period than currently expected. Liam Byrne, chair of the Commons business and trade select committee, said: \u201cThere\u2019s now a real risk that a Red Sea battle will push up prices, just as inflation was beginning to fall. The World Bank is already warning that global supply chains are once more in peril \u2026 not least because this new struggle in Suez comes as drought is cutting trade through the Panama canal. Two of the world\u2019s five keys to trade are now in real jeopardy.\u201d"

            "content": "The pace of US economic growth slowed in the last three months of 2023, but far less than had been expected, underlining the continued resilience of the economy. The commerce department reported on Thursday that US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of economic health \u2013 grew at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the final quarter of the year, down from 4.9% in the previous quarter but in line with pre-pandemic growth, and well ahead of the 2% economists had expected. Robust consumer spending and government outlays contributed to the growth. The Federal Reserve has been attempting to cool economic activity in order to bring down inflation. Since March 2022 the Fed has increased rates to a 22-year high and held them there. Inflation has fallen from a high of 9% in June 2022 to 3.4%. The rate rises have increased the cost of borrowing and many \u2013 including the Fed \u2013 had expected a subsequent slowdown in economic activity to lead to layoffs. But so far the Fed appears to be on course for what it has termed a \u201csoft landing\u201d. Hiring has remained robust \u2013 unemployment hovers at close to a 50-year low \u2013 and while growth has slowed, consumers have continued to spend, the US economy has weathered the rate rises and stock markets have hit record highs. \u201cThe Fed \u2013 so far \u2013 has managed to strangle inflation without strangling the economy,\u201d said Dan North, senior economist with Allianz Trade Americas. North said the Fed rate rises were still working their way through the economy and he expected 2024 to be a year of slow growth \u201cbut we are not using the recession word yet\u201d. Polling since the end of the pandemic shutdowns has consistently shown that consumers are pessimistic about the state of the economy. There are signs that the gloom may be lifting. Last week the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched monthly consumer sentiment index rose 9.1 points to 78.8, its biggest monthly advance since 2005. \u201cConsumer views were supported by confidence that inflation has turned a corner and strengthening income expectations,\u201d said Joanne Hsu, the University of Michigan\u2019s director of surveys."

            "content": "Growing concern that heightened geopolitical tension could damage an already shaky global economy has dominated the start of the annual gathering of the world\u2019s business and political elite in Davos, Switzerland. Three potential flash points \u2013 Ukraine, the Middle East and Taiwan \u2013 threatened to overshadow the meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) aimed at rebuilding trust after the series of setbacks suffered in the past four years, including war, the Covid-19 pandemic and the cost of living crisis. Meanwhile, a study of global business leaders to mark the start of the gathering in the Swiss mountain resort showed UK chief executives embracing generative artificial intelligence more rapidly than their peers in other countries. France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, are all scheduled to address the WEF this week, as is Argentina\u2019s new president Javier Milei. With Middle East tensions rising, the US is sending its secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the its national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, to Davos. Israel\u2019s president, Isaac Herzog, is also attending, as are the prime ministers of Iraq, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, and Jordan, Bisher al-Khasawneh, and Iran\u2019s minister of foreign affairs, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian. The UK chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, and his Labour shadow, Rachel Reeves, are both speaking at this year\u2019s event. Hunt\u2019s predecessor, Kwasi Kwarteng, is also attending. Artificial intelligence will dominate Davos, with OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman due to appear on a panel. AI is seen by its proponents as a possible way of boosting growth, but the WEF said in last week\u2019s global risks report that it could be misused by hostile states and other malign forces. Interviewed by CNBC, Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that without measures to shape its use AI would lead to greater inequality. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s arriving \u2013 do not close your eyes or put your head in the sand. AI requires preparation.\u201d In its annual survey of chief executives, the accountancy firm PwC said almost half (42%) of those running UK companies had implemented the new technology in the past year, compared with 32% in other countries. The survey of 4,702 CEOs in 105 countries found the UK was one of the frontrunners in adopting the generative AI that runs chatbots such as ChatGPT and image generators such as Midjourney. Only 9% of German chief executives and 20% of French CEOs had adopted GenAI, along with 38% of US CEOs and 25% of China\u2019s CEOs. Only Norway, (53%), Japan (50%) and Finland (49%) had been faster. Kevin Ellis, a senior partner at PwC UK, said: \u201cAfter an uphill trek against economic headwinds, UK chief execs are seeking gamechanging opportunities. GenAI presents a \u2018move or lose\u2019 moment \u2013 implemented with care, it offers huge benefits for efficiency, competitiveness and ultimately profitability. \u201cThe UK\u2019s service-based economy makes it ideally placed for the GenAI revolution \u2013 building tech is only half the battle, ensuring people and businesses can use it is key.\u201d The PwC survey found UK chief executives upbeat about the prospects for the global economy, with 61% expecting it to improve this year \u2013 a threefold increase on the poll conducted in 2023. After almost two years in which the economy has moved sideways, UK business leaders were markedly less confident about the prospects for the UK than they were about the global economy. Only 39% expected it to improve in 2024, although PwC said this was up from 9% a year ago. At the Davos opening ceremony on Monday night, the WEF presented its annual crystal awards to architect and educator Di\u00e9b\u00e9do Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9, the Oscar-winning actor Michelle Yeoh, and the musician and producer Nile Rodgers. Yeoh, star of many hit films including Tomorrow Never Dies; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; and Everything Everywhere All At Once, was recognised for her work raising awareness and mobilising support for the United Nations\u2019 sustainable development goals, and for promoting sustainable fashion, disaster-preparedness and road safety. K\u00e9r\u00e9 received the award for \u201chis exemplary leadership\u201d helping Burkina Faso\u2019s Gando community create a socially, economically and ecologically sustainable future through projects that focus on education, health and the environment. The WEF also recognised Rodgers\u2019 humanitarian work, including fighting systemic racism, inequality and injustice, championing young people, and co-founding the We Are Family Foundation to promote cultural diversity after 9/11."

            "date": "2024-01-22T00:01:42Z",
            "content": "The UK economy will benefit from falling inflation and lower interest rates in the second half of the year, boosting growth and allowing the government to offer pre-election giveaways, according to a study by a leading forecaster. Handing Rishi Sunak a new year boost, the advisory business EY Item Club, which is sponsored by the accountancy firm EY, said its winter forecast showed that a long period of economic stagnation \u201cshould begin to fade this year as falling inflation, potential interest rate cuts and tax reductions create momentum for growth in 2024 and 2025\u201d. Sunak and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, hinted last week that a budget statement in March was likely to include tax cuts, building on the reduction in national insurance that was promised in last November\u2019s autumn statement and which took effect on 6 January. Further tax cuts could feature in the 2024 autumn statement before a general election expected before the end of the year, if the recovery proceeds as predicted. The report shrugged off the likelihood of a recession in the second half of last year and the possibility of a further three months of negative growth in the first quarter of 2024, saying the underlying signs of a recovery would soon take effect. An increase in gross domestic product of 0.7% in 2024 made in the firm\u2019s autumn forecast was upgraded to 0.9%, while the UK economy is now forecast to grow by 1.8% in 2025, up from the 1.7% predicted in October. Last year\u2019s growth was downgraded from 0.6% to 0.3%, emphasising a loss of momentum in the second half of the year owing to persistently high inflation and sharply higher interest rates. Yet a recession is still possible if the economy is shown to have in the fourth quarter of 2023 after contracting by 0.3% in the third quarter. Several economists said last week that a surprise 3.2% drop in retail sales in December revealed a level of weakness in consumer spending that could drag the economy backwards in the fourth quarter. Financial markets expect the situation to improve once inflation \u2013 which averaged above 6% in 2023 \u2013 falls as expected to 2% by April, and for the Bank of England to begin cutting interest rates in June. A report by Lloyds Bank found that seven out of 14 sectors of the economy reported growing demand, as measured by new orders, in December 2023, more than twice as many as in November 2023. A bounceback in the moribund property market, high levels of demand for flights and holidays and rising disposable incomes after a long period of decline were all credited with giving business a lift in confidence. \u201cBusiness optimism reached the highest level since May as 12 out of 14 sectors reported higher confidence levels about their output prospects for 2024 compared to the same time the year before,\u201d the report said. Simon French, chief economist at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said that despite fears of a recession last year and weak Christmas shopping figures, the UK\u2019s economic outlook had \u201cimproved markedly\u201d over the last 12 months. The EY Item Club said interest rates should fall from 5.25% to 4% by the end of the year. Martin Beck, the club\u2019s chief economic adviser, said: \u201cAlthough it remains possible that the UK may have slipped into a technical recession in the fourth quarter of 2023, the mood music around the economy is justifiably improving. \u201cHigh inflation and expensive borrowing costs have been two of the biggest obstacles to growth recently and, with both showing encouraging signs of subsiding, prospects for late 2024 and beyond appear brighter.\u201d However, he warned there were risks that his forecast could be undermined by global events. \u201cOngoing geopolitical tensions could push up energy prices, which may slow the decline of inflation and increase costs for households and businesses. \u201cPlus, while the Bank of England is expected to reduce interest rates this year, the timing and extent of these cuts remain uncertain and continued high rates could prolong financial strain. The first half of 2024 should tell us a lot about the UK\u2019s prospects of returning to growth over the medium to long term.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-07T09:00:16Z",
            "content": "Deep in the mountains of Hsinchu county in north Taiwan, a few dozen residents of Smangus are holding their daily morning meeting in a weatherboard hut, overlooking the towering peaks nearby. The remote Indigenous village, home to about 200 Atayal people, is preparing for Saturday\u2019s presidential election. They take it very seriously, running their own polling station since 2008, and discussing candidates with all the residents. \u201cWe normally don\u2019t talk about politics [at the meeting] but the presidential election is a big deal,\u201d says Lahuy Icyeh, a community leader. \u201cThe village elders encourage the tribe to choose who is best for Taiwan.\u201d The vote will be Taiwan\u2019s eighth direct presidential election since martial law ended in the late 1980s. The current president, Tsai Ing-wen, must step down due to term limits, and her current deputy, Lai Ching-te, is running to keep the Democratic Progressive party (DPP) in power. He\u2019s up against Hou Yo-ih of the national opposition Kuomintang (KMT), which ruled during the decades of authoritarianism, and the Taiwan People\u2019s party (TPP), led by founder Ko Wen-je. The campaign has been dominated by the Chinese Communist party\u2019s threat to annex Taiwan, but surveys have shown it is economic issues that are the main concern of voters, including low wages, housing affordability, energy security and inflation. In 2022, wages had the steepest yearly decline in 10 years, while housing in some Taiwanese cities ranks among the world\u2019s most expensive relative to income. Inflation was lower than many other countries in 2023 \u2013 2.48% \u2013 but a series of extreme price rises on individual products such as eggs worsened perception of the cost of living. Care for children and the elderly, corruption, judicial reform, education and rights for minorities are also immediate concerns. All three presidential candidates have made pledges addressing most big-ticket items but many of them are quite similar.Dafydd Fell, director of the Centre of Taiwan Studies at Soas University of London, says this has neutralised most debates except on the contentious future of Taiwan\u2019s nuclear power plants. Publication of polling \u2013 which could show any potential impact of these pledges \u2013 is banned in the 10-day blackout period prior to the vote. The Smangus community has clear asks: better assistance for elderly care, road improvements, and land rights and transitional justice for Indigenous tribes. But the village, which operates a kibbutz-style economy, including shared land and housing, and a flat-salary jobshare system, is protected from some of the economic issues. For them, the presidential election is about big picture themes, says Yarah Pihu, Smangus\u2019s Presbyterian minister and a community leader. \u201cWe want a president with an international perspective and a sense of Taiwanese identity.\u201d Masay Sulung a Smangus community leader, said: \u201cI expect 90% of Smangus to vote for Lai Ching-te. We have high expectations for Lai, he has a clear vision for the country.\u201d At a DPP rally in Taipei, 20-year-old university students surnamed Huang and Chen say they support the DPP\u2019s stance on gender issues, Taiwanese identity, and care for the elderly. But there are signs that young people \u2013 who make up about 16% of the voting public \u2013 are moving away from the DPP, which is now seen by them as the establishment. At a KMT rally, a 34-year-old man surnamed Liu says he\u2019s switching from the DPP because he thinks governments should change frequently. In Guanxi township, Hsinchu province, one woman surnamed Lee, feels the same, but she doesn\u2019t like Hou or Ko, so she\u2019s just not going to vote. Corruption is another major issue for most Taiwanese voters. Fell says political corruption is often the \u201cmost stressed issue in Taiwanese elections and has been the most influential issue in a number of local and national elections\u201d. \u201cAfter eight years in office, you would expect the DPP to be threatened by this issue, and the KMT has made a number of accusations. But it is not entirely clear which side owns this issue.\u201d Candidates have flung a dizzying range of accusations at each other, from plagiarism to illegal housing structures, dodgy income streams, and other forms of corruption. Past local elections have seen allegations of vote-buying, bribery, voter intimidation and political links with organised crime. \u201cTaiwan\u2019s local politics has been long dominated by \u2018electoral machines\u2019 - a system of voter mobilisation through networks of patronage and local political factions \u2013 ever since the authoritarian era,\u201d says Kevin Luo, assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThe entrenchment of the KMT party machine in Miaoli is a good example.\u201d According to the Taiwan Anti-Corruption and Whistleblower Protection Association, 11.6% of 1,677 city councillor candidates in 2022 had criminal records \u2013 more than 20% of them in the county of Miaoli, New Bloom Magazine reported. On a Friday night, independent candidate Tseng Wen-hsueh is rallying a crowd of people at a temple in Miaoli county on Taiwan\u2019s west coast, on a platform of anti-corruption and political change. Party loyalty runs deep here among a diverse mix of ethnic groups and a high proportion of state-run employers in its large natural resources sector. In 72 years, Miaoli has never voted against the KMT, regardless of national trends. A popular joke refers to it as \u201cMiaoli Nation\u201d. \u201cMiaoli\u2019s closed political environment allows those in power to do whatever they want,\u201d Tseng tells the Observer. Most people struggle to imagine change after so long without it, he says. \u201cSo most of the people tend to continue to choose KMT for the sake of stability in their own lives. \u201c[But] if someone wins for the first time, the public will have confidence when they vote, this is the most important thing. The public will understand that this vote in hand can really bring about changes.\u201d Once known as Taiwan\u2019s most remote village, Smangus only got electricity in 1980, and a road to neighbouring villages in 1995. That road \u2013 a trail of switchback turns and fuel-sucking inclines, punctuated by the remnants of frequent landslides \u2013 is now busy with campaign trucks and candidate advertising. But in Smangus the vote is largely decided. Since at least 2008, the village has voted for the DPP in almost direct inverse proportions to the pro-KMT region it sits in. But the main thing is that they will vote. \u201cWe enjoyed democracy later than other places,\u201d says Icyeh. \u201c It\u2019s important to choose someone who can protect and lead Taiwan and appreciate our hard-won democracy.\u201d"

The police received information that activists with the Palestine Action group were allegedly planning to stop the LSE from opening for trading on Monday by \u201clocking on\u201d to the building, and causing damage. Met officers, alongside officers with the Merseyside police, arrested a 31-year-old man in Liverpool on suspicion of conspiracy to cause criminal damage on Sunday morning. Later, officers arrested two more people in Liverpool, women aged 28 and 26, as well as a 29-year-old woman in Brent, north London, a 23-year-old man in Tower Hamlets, east London and a 27-year-old in Brighton. \u201cWe believe this group was ready to carry out a disruptive and damaging stunt which could have had serious implications had it been carried out successfully,\u201d said the Met police Det Supt Sian Thomas. \u201cMindful of the suggestion that this was one part of a planned week of action, we are in contact with the City of London police as well as other forces across the UK to ensure that appropriate resources are in place to deal with any disruption in the coming days.\u201d Thomas thanked the Daily Express, who supplied the information, for \u201ctheir willingness to provide the information gleaned from their own investigation\u201d. All six individuals remain in custody. The group reportedly hoped to cause \u201chuge economic damage\u201d by climbing on top of two revolving doors at the front of the building, armed with red paint-filled fire extinguishers, before locking their necks to the glass entrance using bike locks. Other activists would lock themselves together in front of the main and back entrances, while fake bank notes, painted red to represent blood, were fired from \u201cmoney guns\u201d. The allegations come after a two-month investigation during which a reporter posed as a member of the group, the Express reported. The Palestine Action group told PA: \u201cThe London Stock Exchange raises billions of pounds for apartheid Israel and trades shares in weapons manufacturers, which arm Israel\u2019s genocide of the Palestinian people. \u201cWhile Britain remains complicit in the brutal colonisation of Palestine, our direct action campaign will not be deterred.\u201d"

The software giant reported revenue of $62bn, up 18% year-over-year, surpassing anticipated earnings of $61.1bn. Its year-over-year net income rose 33% to $21.9bn. CEO Satya Nadella said: \u201cWe\u2019ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale. By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we\u2019re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.\u201d Microsoft Cloud revenue rose 24% year-over-year. Revenue from its Xbox content and services division increased 61% driven by the Activision Blizzard acquisition, according to the earnings report. Activision boosted the company\u2019s overall revenue by 4%. Microsoft, which recently overtook Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable company, last week became only the second business in history to reach a stock market valuation of $3tn. Microsoft is seen as a leading player in the realm of AI, both via its own efforts and its close ties to ChatGPT maker OpenAI, of which it is the largest shareholder. In November, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella played a key role in the return of Sam Altman as CEO of OpenAI after Altman\u2019s stunning ouster. Microsoft holds an observer seat on OpenAI\u2019s board. \u201cThe company\u2019s recent financial performance, marked by a remarkable 18% revenue surge in today\u2019s earnings release, signals a potent blend of innovation and strategic foresight,\u201d said Insider Intelligence/eMarketer senior director of briefings Jeremy Goldman. \u201cWhile peers like Alphabet and Meta navigate the AI landscape, Microsoft is firmly establishing itself as a frontrunner in the AI race.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s influence on the development of AI has grown so quickly as to attract scrutiny from regulators and those outside the tech industry. Investors shrugged off concerns over the growing headwinds as shares rose 10% over the past month. The US Federal Trade Commission announced last week that it had begun an investigation into the company\u2019s $10bn investment in OpenAI, as well as deals made by Google, Amazon and AI startup Anthropic. The United Kingdom\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority is likewise examining the deal. European Union regulators have said they may open similar investigations. The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in early December, alleging copyright infringement by ChatGPT. This quarter also marks the first time Microsoft reported earnings with Activision Blizzard, the A-list gaming studio behind hits like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, under its roof. In October, Microsoft completed its acquisition of the video game maker for $69bn following a lengthy back-and-forth with regulators. Citing redundancies within the two companies, Microsoft laid off 1,900 employees last week across its gaming division, including Activision employees as well as some working on the Xbox console."

            "content": "Kazakhstan\u2019s national airline has announced plans to float on the London stock market, bringing a potential windfall to BAE Systems, which has been an investor for more than two decades. Air Astana, which is 49% owned by the British defence company, hopes to list in London and Kazakhstan and raise $120m (\u00a394m). The airline, which is majority owned by the Kazakh sovereign wealth fund, did not say how much of the company would be floated and is yet to confirm an expected valuation range. The float, which has been years in the making, could offer a cash boost to BAE Systems, which manufactures fighter jets, submarines and warships, and acquired its stake via an unusual route. The company was pursuing a deal to sell its radar systems to the Kazakh military in 2001 and as part of the deal it agreed to help fund the launch of Air Astana through a $8.5m agreement. The radar deal fell through, reportedly under pressure from Russia, but BAE\u2019s interest in the airline remained, and the investment was valued at \u00a363m by the company last year. The listing offers a rare bright spot for London\u2019s stock market, which has experienced a dearth of floats in recent years. The City is struggling to compete with overseas rivals to land big flotations, and one of last year\u2019s biggest, the natural soda ash producer We Soda, was abandoned because of a disappointing valuation. Air Astana intends to use the proceeds of the twin listing to invest in expanding in its fleet and putting on more flights. It already flies to destinations across Europe, the Middle East and Asia, including key transport hubs such as London, Amsterdam and Seoul. Its board is chaired by Nurlan Zhakupov, a Kazakh citizen who was previously the managing director of the Kazakh mining company Tau-Ken Samruk and later chief executive of the Kazakhstan Investment Development Fund. The company has three Britons on its board, including its chief executive, Peter Foster, who ran Royal Brunei Airlines before taking over at Air Astana in 2005. Foster said: \u201cWe are confident that the initial public offering will accelerate the next stage of growth for the Air Astana Group, and we see significant opportunities to thicken our existing routes and expand into new geographic areas, supported by our continued fleet expansion plan and initiatives to increase operational flexibility.\u201d The former Soviet country has privatised a number of state-owned assets over the last decade, including national oil and gas, electricity and nuclear entities. If the listing is completed, it will bring a payday for bankers working on the deal at Citigroup and Jefferies."

            "content": "Peruse an online marketplace like Craigslist, and you\u2019ll find coded classified ads for \u201cStudy Help\u201d and \u201cStudy Hall\u201d, or calls looking for a \u201cStudy Buddy\u201d. Despite the scholarly language, these aren\u2019t people looking for pre-final cram session. They\u2019re plugs for Adderall: the trade name for a combination of amphetamine salts long prescribed as a first-choice treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It\u2019s a drug that is, of late, in perilously short supply. The US National Institute for Mental Health estimates that ADHD affects 4.4% of adults between the ages of 18 and 44. The number of adults treated for ADHD has increased in recent decades, attributable to the wider destigmatization of diagnosing the disorder in adults as well as the Covid-19 pandemic and its knockback effects on adult mental health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that adult prescriptions for ADHD medication increased by 7.9% between 2020 and 2021, compared with a 1.4% average annual increase between 2016 and 2020. In 2021, doctors authorized in excess of 30m prescriptions for Adderall, serving nearly 4 million patients. But over the past two years, many of patients have been unable to procure their prescription, due to manufacturing shortfalls. With the delta between demand and supply widening, some adults with diagnosed ADHD are forced to forsake CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and other drug retailers, and turn elsewhere. Smith (not his real name) is a lawyer in his mid-40s. He splits his time between New York City and Toronto, Canada. He was first prescribed Adderall in his 30s, while employed in the tech industry, work that demanded what he calls \u201csustained periods of concentration\u201d, to which he was unaccustomed. Between transitioning careers, and moving between countries (and healthcare systems with different best practices for prescribing amphetamines), he let his prescription lapse. \u201cMy ADHD is not so bad that I need to take something every day. But occasionally you just need it. You need it right now,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not difficult to find, if you know what to look for.\u201d Smith is familiar with those online black markets, and all the coded slang. In addition to looking for \u201cstudy help\u201d and \u201cstudy aids\u201d, search terms such as \u201cNFL\u201d and \u201cfootballs\u201d \u2013 a 30mg Adderall pill is typically pressed in orange, oblong tablets, vaguely resembling a regulation American football \u2013 also prove effective. There has always been an illicit market for Adderall, and similar drugs. Recreational amphetamine, typically called \u201cspeed\u201d, has been used for an array of purposes: as a performance enhancer for athletes; an appetite suppressant; a club drug stimulant, used to temper (or extend) the effects of alcohol and drunkenness. But increasingly, it seems that illicit amphetamines are being used for their stated \u201con-label\u201d effects: improving focus and concentration by tweaking the brain\u2019s production and regulation of the chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine. Smith says his typical contact is a \u201ca student in their mid-20s; not someone who typically takes part in drug trafficking. Just someone who has a script, and knows that people are willing to pay for it.\u201d He has made a habit of only buying a few pills on initial meetings, in order to guarantee the pills are bona fide, while also, in his terms, \u201climiting loss\u201d. But legitimacy is a huge issue with purchasing prescription amphetamines, or any drug, on the illicit market. In the months since the shortages began affecting the production and distribution of ADHD medications, pills have popped up underground that appear to be prescription drugs, but are anything but. The anonymous drug-testing database DrugsData.org has found \u201cAdderall\u201d pills circulating that contain straight methamphetamine, in cities from Boston to San Francisco to LA. In September of 2022, the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s (DEA) New England office seized a record 660,000 Adderall pills, which were laced with methamphetamine. (The Los Angeles Times also recently reported on an elaborate counterfeiting operation in Mexico, which repackages meth as Adderall, Vyvanse and other name-brand ADHD medications, in an attempt to fleece pharma-tourists seeking help south of the border.) Some experts have compared the increase of illegal meth in the underground Adderall supply to the opioid epidemic, which has seen diminishing reserves of oxycodone replaced with cheaper, and more dangerous, synthetic substitutes. Acetaminophen, aspirin, the antidepressant duloxetine and caffeine have also circulated illicitly, either pitched as, or pressed to resemble, legitimate Adderall. \u201cThe number of counterfeit generic Adderall analyzed by DrugsData was steady in the last 24 months,\u201d a spokesperson explains over email. \u201cThe big jump happened between 2021 and 2022.\u201d Gordon (also not his real name) is 40 and works in journalism. He was diagnosed with ADHD in his 20s, but always struggled with Adderall. An ex-girlfriend told him that the drug made him \u201can asshole\u201d. He confesses that, while taking Adderall, he could be \u201creally annoying\u201d. He had a stint selling cannabis, which put him in contact with underground retailers selling prescription ADHD meds. When there\u2019s a shortfall, he says, most illicit dealers tend to fit the profile described by Smith: prescribed users who \u201choard it in case of a shortage\u201d. Facing a dwindling supply \u2013 his local pharmacist told him: \u201cWe never have it\u201d \u2013 Gordon went to his doctors and switched prescriptions to methylphenidate, which is sold under the brand names Ritalin and Concerta (an extended release version). The switch-up has worked for him, especially because he retains a certain wariness about dealing and trading on the illegal market, given the widespread issues of quality and toxicity that have increased as a result of the opioid epidemic. \u201cGoing on the black market is very scary right now,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d rather just stay away from it, when things are so crazy.\u201d Other would-be buyers might not be as cautious as Gordon, or as savvy as Smith, and Adderall shortages look set to continue as drug manufacturers have production strictly limited by the DEA. The DEA has tried to reform its processes allowing drug manufacturers to apply for revised allotments on a quarterly (as opposed to yearly) basis. \u201cDEA is committed to ensuring that patients who need stimulant medications have access to them,\u201d Anne Milgram, the DEA administrator, wrote in a memo late last year. But for now, limited production remains a consistent problem, with supply falling short of demand by an estimated 1bn doses.

            "date": "2024-01-16T12:52:07Z",
            "content": "Pay growth in the UK slowed more than expected in November, in a sign that inflationary pressures have weakened more than the Bank of England was expecting when it issued its latest forecasts. Average pay growth was 6.5% in November, down from 7.2% in the previous month, according to the Office for National Statistics, as the UK jobs market weakened in response to high interest rates and stagnation across much of the economy. Economists polled by Reuters had expected total average earnings of 6.8% in November. Job vacancies tumbled at the fastest rate on record in December, the ONS said, in a further sign the UK labour market was now cooling. The ONS said despite the drop in wages growth, recent falls in inflation meant real wages grew for the fifth month in a row, easing the pressure on household disposable incomes. It added that overall, the jobs market remained stable with employment down only marginally and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.2%. The pound fell after the weaker than expected wage data prompted traders to raise bets that the Bank of England would start cutting interest rates in the spring. Sterling was down by 0.6% against the dollar at $1.2642. The central bank is expected to re-examine its outlook for the economy when officials meet next month. Most analysts expect the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee to hint at several interest rate cuts this year after acknowledging the weakening labour market and recent falls in inflation as indications of further stagnation. James Smith, the developed markets economist at ING, said it was probably a little early to expect a major change of direction by the Bank, \u201cbut recent data could lay the groundwork for a May cut as long as it continues to comply\u201d. He added: \u201cThe bottom line is that both wage growth and services inflation, the datasets that are guiding monetary policy right now, are below Bank of England projections.\u201d Financial markets expect five interest rate cuts this year by the Bank, taking interest down from 5.25% to below 4%. One of the Bank\u2019s key barometers, regular private sector pay growth, dropped further from a revised 7.2% in October (7.3% previously) to 6.5% in November, leaving it comfortably below the Bank\u2019s prediction for it to still be at 7.2% in December. Falling energy and fuel prices and the slowing economy have brought the headline rate of inflation down from 4.6% in October to 3.9% in November and are expected to exert further downward pressure in December when figures are released tomorrow. Samual Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said there was likely to be some concern inside the Bank that the steady picture for employment showed much of the jobs market remained tight, limiting further falls in wages and vacancies. The number of vacancies soared during the Covid pandemic as many older workers took early retirement, the number of workers signed off sick increased and younger workers opted to go back into education, but the ONS said vacancies fell for the 18th consecutive month in the three months to December, by 49,000 to 934,000. Analysts have also become increasingly concerned about recent global shocks from conflict in the Middle East that could harm trade and push shop prices back up again. The ONS figures on Tuesday showed that workers in the private and public sectors received almost the same level of pay rise, including bonuses, up by 6.4% and 6.6%, respectively, in the three months to November. In the private sector, restaurants, hotels and retailers offered the biggest pay rises of 7.2% on average, followed by City and finance workers, who received 7% on average. Construction workers were at the bottom of the pay league table with rises averaging 4.5%, reflecting the severe downturn across the building industry. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cIt has been tough for many families recently, but with inflation now falling and the economy gradually returning to growth today\u2019s continuing rise in real wages will offer further relief. \u201cOn top of this the cut in national insurance contributions will get more people back into the jobs market, not just supporting economic growth but saving a typical two-earner household about \u00a31,000 this year.\u201d"

            "content": "Inflation went in the wrong direction at the end of 2023. It might seem like a small, possibly insignificant, reversal of a downward trend, but December\u2019s rise in the consumer prices index (CPI) to 4% in December from 3.9% in November is a blow to the government and the Bank of England in their battle against rising prices. Setting aside the quirks in the figures, such as the rise in tobacco prices after a sharp increase in duty, the real problem was how businesses continue to charge each other ever-larger bills for their services. Last year, they had good reason to put up prices. They had higher gas and electricity prices to pay and workers had begun to play catch-up in annual wage demands to prevent a potentially huge drop in their living standards. Those pressures are ebbing away now, but still services firms are charging ever higher amounts for their work, and that is being passed on to consumers. Competition is supposed to prevent this happening. And while it seems to be influencing sectors such as food, where price inflation is coming down, in the areas of the economy most of us cannot see \u2013 the myriad of buying and selling for business and financial services \u2013 competition is failing to work its magic. Core inflation, which excludes items such as energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, was unexpectedly unchanged at 5.1% and services inflation increased from 6.1% to 6.2%. There are analysts who believe the Bank of England will be influenced by the latest figures to caution against any predictions of interest rate cuts. Before Wednesday\u2019s CPI release, financial markets had expected five rate cuts this year starting in May, taking the cost of borrowing down from 5.25% to below 4%. That timeline has since shifted slightly, with investors now forecasting June to be the start date for perhaps just four rate cuts this year. France, Germany and the US have seen the same blips in the downward path of inflation and officials at the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which covers the 20 members of the eurozone, have made more cautious speeches in recent days about the path of interest rate reductions. The UK is expected to see a small rise in January\u2019s figures when they are published next month, which economists are ready to put down to dramatic falls in energy price inflation last year that declines over the subsequent 12 months could not match. A rise in CPI for December and again in January will certainly make the Bank think twice about signalling sharp cuts in rates. It could judge that services companies need more harsh medicine in the form of high interest rates to force them to bring down prices. If that is the Bank\u2019s solution, Jeremy Hunt\u2019s plan to boast of sharply falling interest rates during an election campaign will be toast. There are still 1.5m households waiting to remortgage this year and their finances will look burned as well. Then again, much-predicted declines in the CPI during February, March and April, taking inflation down to 2% \u2013 notwithstanding an escalation of the Middle East conflict and its effect on shipping \u2013 could prove financial market bets to be more savvy than they currently look."

            "content": "Households across England are facing an inflation-busting \u00a32bn council tax raid this spring despite Rishi Sunak\u2019s promise of pre-election giveaways to save his premiership. In a deal to address the worsening financial crisis hitting town halls across the country, officials in Michael Gove\u2019s levelling up department have told local authority bosses they expect the maximum possible 4.99% increase to be applied to council tax in April. The increases are likely to add about \u00a3100 to a typical band D council tax bill, adding to the financial pressure on families, with inflation currently at 4%. It comes as Sunak prepares to put cuts to income tax at the heart of the Tories\u2019 re-election strategy, with a raft of measures expected to be announced in the spring budget, to be paid for by \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d to limit spending on public services and welfare. Local government leaders and experts warned that by raising council tax, the burden of the financial crisis in councils was being shifted to the poorest households. David Phillips, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said it would hurt the poorest households most because council tax forms a larger share of their monthly outgoings than that of a wealthier family. \u201cIncreasing council tax while cutting most direct taxes \u2013 for example, national insurance, income tax and especially capital gains tax and inheritance tax \u2013 would be regressive,\u201d Phillips said. Last week Gove announced an injection of an extra \u00a3600m into local government funding in England to stave off the threat of a Commons rebellion by Tory MPs worried about cuts to services in their constituencies. He told MPs: \u201cTaking into account this new funding, local government in England will see an increase in core spending power of up to \u00a34.5bn next year, or 7.5% in cash terms, an above-inflation increase, rising from \u00a360.2bn in 2023-24 to up to \u00a364.7bn.\u201d However, in details glossed over by the government, almost half of the \u00a34.5bn boost is based on the assumption that every local authority in England applies the maximum allowable council tax rise. If it was frozen, the package would be worth a rise of about 4%, matching the current rate of inflation. Roger Gough, the Tory leader of Kent county council, said: \u201cThat spending power means us taxing the residents of Kent more. Or at least the government\u2019s expectations are based on that.\u201d James Lewis, the Labour leader of Leeds city council, said: \u201cPeople are paying more council tax each year and getting a lower level of service, as it stretches to cover reduced government grants.\u201d He said the share of his city\u2019s budget that was funded by Westminster had fallen from about 36% a decade ago to about 5%, after cuts worth \u00a32.5bn in total. \u201cBut we\u2019re still expected to cover that gap, largely through savings, council tax increases and money we make through fees and charges for services.\u201d Figures from the Institute for Government show councils have raised 30% more from council tax in real terms since 2010, in an attempt to fill a gaping hole from cuts to grant funding of about 40% during the Tories\u2019 first decade in power. Stuart Hoddinott, a senior researcher at the thinktank, said: \u201cIt\u2019s just shifting it to another place. You\u2019re replacing centralised taxation with localised taxation. It\u2019s as much of a burden on individuals as a rise in income tax, it\u2019s just one that\u2019s attributed to councils as opposed to central government. [But] if it allows the chancellor to announce they can cut tax by X at the budget, I can see why that would be appealing.\u201d Ben Bradley, the Conservative MP who is also leader of Nottinghamshire county council, welcomed last week\u2019s funding increase for councils, but said: \u201cThere\u2019s almost no point chopping \u00a3100 off tax bills nationally if you\u2019re adding on to it with council tax. There is support out there and polling that people are keen to see investment in public services as a priority. There is scope to do both.\u201d Council tax increases are capped at 4.99% each year unless a local referendum approves a higher amount, which has never happened. Only one referendum has ever been held, in Bedfordshire in 2015, when a majority of residents voted against it. Several troubled councils have been granted bigger increases of up to 15% by Gove in response to \u201cexceptional\u201d financial circumstances, including Croydon, Thurrock and Woking. Others, including Birmingham and Somerset, are seeking approval for 10% increases. The rises come amid growing calls for changes to council tax, which remains based on 1991 property valuations despite a vast increase in house prices over the past three decades. Council tax was introduced in 1993 to replace the community charge, known as the poll tax. Last week the Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP), the group founded by George Osborne to promote economic growth in northern England, said changes to council tax could help address the worsening \u201cemergency in local government\u201d for those authorities in less affluent areas with the lowest tax bases. The NPP said a household living in a house in Hartlepool worth \u00a3150,000 was paying more than \u00a3200 a year more in council tax than someone in Westminster in a property worth \u00a38m. A government spokesperson said: \u201cCouncils are responsible for their own finances and set council tax levels but we have been clear they should be mindful of cost of living pressures. We continue to protect taxpayers from excessive council tax increases through referendum principles.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-10T09:03:46Z",
            "content": "Greggs has hailed easing inflationary pressures after the UK\u2019s biggest bakery chain rang up bumper Christmas sales amid less travel disruption and enthusiasm for seasonal specialities such as festive bakes and chocolate orange muffins. The company said sales at established stores had risen 9.4% in the three months to 30 December as it attracted more customers with extended opening hours and by offering online ordering. Better weather and fewer transport strikes than in the same period in 2022 also contributed to growth, the chain said, as did higher prices on some items \u2013 although at a lower rate than earlier in the year. Extending its ranges had also helped sales, it said, with festive bakes, chocolate orange muffins and Christmas lunch baguettes \u201cin high demand\u201d, while pizza sales continued to perform strongly. Greggs said it had increased prices by between 5p and 10p on a some items last month but had held down the cost of bestselling items such as sausage rolls. Roisin Currie, the chain\u2019s chief executive, said the price rises were to help fund a pay increase for workers implemented this month, with store staff getting a 9.6% rise to at least \u00a311.62 an hour, ahead of the new legal minimum wage of \u00a311.44 from April for those 23 or older, but behind the independently verified living wage of \u00a312. She said Greggs had \u201cno plans\u201d to increase prices across its ranges as it expected a more stable cost base over the year ahead. Currie added that any further price rises would be \u201cminimal and would protect our value proposition\u201d. The strong Christmas topped off a good year for the Newcastle-based business, with sales rising by almost 20% to \u00a31.8bn in the year to 30 December as it bounced back with the return to high streets after the coronavirus pandemic. The company plans to step up the pace of growth and open up to 160 shops in the year ahead, having opened a net 145 last year, taking the total to 2,473. Greggs shares rose 8.5% in early trading on Wednesday. Currie said: \u201cI am proud of our teams, who did a fantastic job serving more customers as we continue to grow our shop estate and offer greater availability through digital channels and extended trading hours. \u201cWe enter 2024 with plans to continue to invest in our shops and expand supply chain capacity to deliver the growth strategy, supported by our strong balance sheet.\u201d The company added in a statement that while wage inflation remains, \u201cinflationary pressures are reducing and with good forward cover on food, packaging and energy we anticipate a more stable cost base in the coming year\u201d. It added that while higher rates of pay added to the bakery chain\u2019s costs, increased wages across the economy would also support shoppers\u2019 incomes."

            "title": "Eurozone inflation rises to 2.9% after increase in energy costs",
            "date": "2024-01-05T13:13:40Z",
            "content": "Inflation across the eurozone rose in December after an increase in energy costs, reversing six months of consecutive falls and easing the pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut interest rates. Figures from the EU statistical agency Eurostat showed consumer prices across the 20-country bloc rose at an annual rate of 2.9% last month, up from 2.4% in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a slightly higher reading of 3% for December. The increase in the headline rate comes after the end of government support for utility costs, alongside a smaller annual decline in energy prices in December than in November connected to last year\u2019s one-off subsidy in Germany. In the flash estimate for December, inflation in food, alcohol and tobacco prices continued to moderate, easing some of the pressure on households across the bloc as the rate across those categories dipped from 6.9% in November to 6.1% last month. The figures come amid speculation the ECB will begin cutting interest rates within months amid a worsening economic slowdown across the eurozone, having increased borrowing costs to the highest level since the launch of the euro. Financial markets widely expect the world\u2019s largest central banks to slash interest rates this year as inflation falls back after the shock from the Covid pandemic and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, while there are growing fears of recession in several advanced economies. Economists said December\u2019s inflation data was unlikely to dramatically shift the timing of the ECB\u2019s first cut in interest rates because an increase in the headline rate had been widely expected after energy support schemes expired. \u201cSome investors will undoubtedly be concerned that this spike in inflation may put the ECB off cutting interest rates sooner rather than later,\u201d said Michael Field, the European market strategist at Morningstar. \u201cHowever, central bankers were always aware of the potential for this spike in inflation, thus it shouldn\u2019t factor in on their decision-making process. All eyes are on next month\u2019s inflation release, and whether we can get back to that all-important downward trend.\u201d Financial markets are betting the ECB will cut rates six times this year, with the first move coming as early as the spring. However, the central bank\u2019s president, Christine Lagarde, has warned it remains too early to \u201cstart declaring victory\u201d over inflation, while arguing that rates would need to remain high for a lengthy period to ensure inflation falls back to its 2% target. Jack Allen-Reynolds, the deputy chief eurozone economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the jump in December was \u201cjust a blip\u201d and that inflation across the 20-nation bloc would probably continue to fall over the coming months. \u201cPast declines in food producer prices have not yet fully fed through to consumer prices. Core goods inflation should keep falling as the impact of improved global supply conditions and lower energy prices continues to be felt.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-30T12:18:10Z",
            "content": "The 20-nation eurozone has narrowly avoided recession after the region\u2019s economy flatlined at the end of 2023, official figures show. Zero growth in the single currency zone in the final quarter of last year followed a 0.1% economic contraction in the third quarter, meaning that recession \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 was just averted. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the eurozone\u2019s economy to shrink by 0.1% in the fourth quarter. The eurozone\u2019s two biggest economies both performed poorly in late 2023, with Germany contracting by 0.3% and France posting no growth for a second successive quarter, according to Eurostat, the EU\u2019s statistical agency. There was better news from the other two members of the eurozone\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d. Italy, which had been expected to stagnate, recorded growth of 0.2%, while Spain expanded by 0.6% \u2013 three times the 0.2% forecast. Of the smaller eurozone economies, Portugal grew by 0.8% in the final quarter, Austria expanded by 0.2%, while Ireland\u2019s economy contracted by 0.7% \u2013 its fourth successive quarterly fall in 2023. Eurostat said that the broader 27-nation European Union also posted no growth in the fourth quarter. From the fourth quarter of 2022 and the final quarter of 2023, the eurozone expanded by just 0.1%, while the EU grew by 0.2%. \u201cThe eurozone economy escaped recession by the skin of its teeth by the end of 2023,\u201d Diego Iscaro, head of Europe economics at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said. \u201cThe outlook for 2024 continues to be challenging amid faltering demand and increasing geopolitical tensions.\u201d The eurozone\u2019s stagnating economy will further pressurethe European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the countries in the monetary union, to start cutting borrowing costs. Bert Colijn, a senior economist at ING bank, said: \u201cA technical recession has just been avoided in the eurozone. Still, the eurozone economy has now been broadly stagnating since late 2022 and has lost substantial ground to the US in terms of GDP in recent years. After the buoyant post-pandemic reopening phase, the economy has now entered a phase of prolonged weakness.\u201d Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago, the eurozone has been struggling to cope with higher energy and food prices, and the damage caused to business and consumer confidence. The ECB raised interest rates last year to their highest level since the euro was launched in 1999. Nicola Mai, economist at asset manager Pimco, said: \u201cDespite a resilient early start in 2023, the eurozone economy was weak through much of the year, and we anticipate that this fragility will persist in 2024. \u201cThe reasons for this ongoing weakness are clear. Europe is still recovering from a lingering energy shock and has not experienced the same degree of fiscal stimulus as the more resilient US economy in recent years. The region\u2019s shorter debt maturities also mean that interest rate hikes have been felt more quickly.\u201d"

            "title": "IMF warns Hunt against tax cuts; eurozone avoids recession \u2013 as it happened",
            "date": "2024-01-30T15:59:44Z",
            "content": "Time for a recap The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has \u201cadvised the UK against further tax cuts\u201d. In its latest assessment of the world economy, the IMF said the government should prioritise preserving public services and investment, while keeping debt levels under control. An IMF spokesperson said: \u201cPreserving high-quality public services and undertaking critical public investments to boost growth and achieve the net zero targets, will imply higher spending needs over the medium term than are currently reflected in the government\u2019s budget plans. \u201cAccommodating these needs, while assuredly stabilising the debt/GDP ratio, will already require generating additional high-quality fiscal savings, including on the tax side.\u201d The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, hit back, saying: \u201cThe IMF expect growth to strengthen over the next few years, supported by our introduction of the biggest capital investment tax reliefs anywhere in the world, alongside National Insurance cuts to improve work incentives. It is too early to know whether further reductions in tax will be affordable in the Budget, but we continue to believe that smart tax reductions can make a big difference in boosting growth.\u201d The IMF also lifted its forecast for global growth, and said that a \u201csoft landing\u201d was in sight for the world economy. But there was gloom in the UK, with corporate insolvencies in England and Wales hitting their highest level since 1993 last year. In a busy day for economic data, the eurozone has narrowly avoided recession. GDP across the euro area was flat in October-December, despite a 0.3% contraction in Germany. France stagnated, while Italy, Spain and Portugal all grew. Here\u2019s the rest of today\u2019s news: There\u2019s been drama in the energy market today, with Saudi Arabia abandoning plans to grow its crude production capacity by 1m barrels a day. The world\u2019s biggest exporter signalled a big change in policy by ordering the state oil company, Saudi Aramco, to drop plans to expand its maximum production capacity to 13m barrels a day by 2027. US job openings unexpectedly rose in December to the highest level in three months, suggesting America\u2019s labor market remains strong. The latest JOLTS report shows that vacancies increased to 9 million at the end of December, from 8.9 million reading in the previous month. The report also shows fewer Americans quit their jobs in December. Over in the US, consumer confidence has risen to a two-year high as the slowdown in inflation cheers households. The Conference Board\u2019s Consumer Confidence Index rose in January to 114.8, up from 108.0 in December. The reading was the highest since December 2021, and marked the third straight monthly increase. Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, says: \u201cJanuary\u2019s increase in consumer confidence likely reflected slower inflation, anticipation of lower interest rates ahead, and generally favorable employment conditions as companies continue to hoard labor.\u201d The IMF has also given a thumbs-down to the free market policies of Argentina\u2019s new president, Javier Milei. The Fund has cut its growth estimate for Argentina, forecasting South America\u2019s second-largest economy will shrink by 2.8% this year, following a 1.1% contraction in 2023. Back in October, the Fund forecast 2.8% growth in 2024. Milei is making wide-ranging reforms to Argentina, deregulating the economy and removing regulations covering housing rental market, export customs arrangements, land ownership, and food retailers. He is also pushing through a wave of privatisations, ferocious spending cuts, a major expansion of presidential powers, and a scaling back of workers\u2019 rights and the right to protest, and proposing tax amnesties. But unions are resisting, holding nationwide strike action. The IMF\u2019s intervention comes less than two weeks after Jeremy Hunt hinted that he could deliver big tax cuts in his March budget. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in mid-January, Hunt told UK journalists that he wanted to take the UK in the direction of the faster-growing economies in North America and Asia which tend to have lower taxes. A week later, the latest public finances showed a drop in borrowing in December, giving Hunt up to \u00a320bn of fiscal headroom to lower taxes. The IMF, though, wants him to use that wriggle-room to keep the national debt in check, while also preserving public services and making critical investments. Some early reaction to the IMF\u2019s position: The last time the IMF intervened in UK government policy was September 2022, when it openly criticized then-Prime Minister Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget, points out Bloomberg. That mini-budget, which contained unfunded tax cuts and lacked independent assessment from the Office for Budget Responsibility, caused turmoil on financial markets and knocked the pound to a record low. Relations have improved under Rishi Sunak, who reversed most of the unfunded tax cuts proposed by Truss, but the fund\u2019s latest stance places it at odds with the government\u2019s clear ambition, Bloomberg adds. The IMF have confirmed that are advising the UK not to lower taxes further. They\u2019re holding a press conference now on their latest World Economic Outlook, released 40 minute ago, where chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas has been quizzed about their advice to the UK. Gourinchas explains that the IMF expects the UK to grow by 0.6% this year, rising to 1.6% in 2025 \u2013 which would be a return to \u201csome level of normalcy\u201d. And the IMF\u2019s message to the UK, and a number of other countries, is that they need to put in place medium-term fiscal plans that will accommodate a \u201cvery significant increase in spending pressures.\u201d In the case of the UK, Gourinchas says, that could include spending on health care and modernising the NHS, spending on social care, and on education. There is also the need for critical public investment to address climate issues, and also to boost growth. This means it is \u201cvery important\u201d to have medium term fiscal plans in place that accommodate this pressures, and ensure that debt dynamics remain remain \u201cstable and contained\u201d, Gourinchas explains. That requires a combination of tax and spending measures, so the government can allocate resources where they are needed while preventing your debt levels from increasing. Gourinchas adds: \u201cIn that context we would advise against further discretionary tax cuts as envisioned and discussed now.\u201d Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has responded to the IMF\u2019s warning, saying it\u2019s \u201ctoo early\u201d to know if he\u2019ll be able to cut taxes in the budget: \u201cThe IMF expect growth to strengthen over the next few years, supported by our introduction of the biggest capital investment tax reliefs anywhere in the world, alongside National Insurance cuts to improve work incentives. It is too early to know whether further reductions in tax will be affordable in the Budget, but we continue to believe that smart tax reductions can make a big difference in boosting growth.\u201d The timing of the IMF\u2019s warning against UK tax cuts is \u201cincredibly inconvenient\u201d for chancellor Jeremy Hunt, says ITV\u2019s Joel Hills. He writes: The IMF suggests there\u2019s a strong case for putting taxes up, given that, it believes the pressures on the public finances in Britain will only increase in the years ahead. An IMF spokesperson said: \u201cPreserving high-quality public services and undertaking critical public investments to boost growth and achieve the net zero targets, will imply higher spending needs over the medium term than are currently reflected in the government\u2019s budget plans. Accommodating these needs, while assuredly stabilising the debt/GDP ratio, will already require generating additional high-quality fiscal savings, including on the tax side.\u201d The global economy is gliding towards a \u201csoft landing\u201d after coping with the impact of tough central bank interest-rate action to reduce inflation, the International Monetary Fund has said. Revising up its growth estimates for 2024, the IMF said a number of major economies \u2013 including the US, China, Russia and India \u2013 had posted stronger than expected performances in 2023 and it was surprised by the resilience shown. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor said: \u201cThe clouds are beginning to part. The global economy begins the final descent toward a soft landing, with inflation declining steadily and growth holding up.\u201d Announcing details of the interim World Economic Outlook (WEO), Gourinchas said the IMF expected global growth to be 3.1% in both 2023 and 2024, upward revisions of 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points respectively. But he stressed the pace of expansion \u2013 which compares with an average of 3.8% during the 2010s \u2013 remained slow and there was a risk of turbulence ahead. More here. The IMF has warned UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt against cutting taxes, an intervention that is unlikely to be welcomed by the government ahead of the budget in early March. Instead of tax giveaways, the IMF argues the UK needs to curb public borrowing, rebuild its fiscal buffers, and prioritise spending in areas such as health, education and tackling climate change. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, IMF chief economist, told the Financial Times the UK\u2019s focus should be on \u201cthe path towards a fiscal consolidation\u201d despite expectations that Hunt will cut taxes at his spring Budget. Gourinchas says: \u201cWe would rather wish they would not do this type of tax cuts, and that they would instead focus on both addressing the spending needs and on the path towards a fiscal consolidation.\u201d More here. The IMF has cut its forecast for eurozone growth, in its updated World Economic Outlook. It now expects euro area GDP to grow by 0.9% this year, down from the 1.2% forecast in October. Expected growth in 2025 has been trimmed to 1.7% from 1.8%. It has also revised down Germany growth forecast to 0.5% in 2024, down from 0.9% expected in October. Newsflash: the International Monetary Gund has raised its forecast for global growth this year to 3.1%, up from 2.9% forecast in October. And in news that will cheer investors, the IMF believes that the much-hoped-for \u201csoft landing\u201d is in sight, in its latest update to its World Economic Outlook. The IMF\u2019s chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, says: \u201cWe find that the global economy continues to display remarkable resilience and we are now in the final descent toward a \u2018soft landing\u2019 with inflation declining steadily and growth holding up. But the base of expansion remains on the slower side and there might be turbulence ahead.\u201d Gourinchas warns, though, that overall growth and global trade are still lower than the historical average. Eurozone GDP will continue to stagnate in 2024 Q1, with growth below trend during 024, predicts Aline Schuiling of ABN AMRO Financial Markets Research. Schuiling explains: Growth will continue to be limited by the high level of interest rates. Moreover, fiscal policy will be restrictive as well, with energy-support measures for households and companies being unwound. On the other hand, the combination of a drop in inflation and still elevated wage growth will support household income. Besides, the upcoming start of interest rate cuts by the main central banks has resulted in some easing of financial conditions and has also lifted consumer and producer confidence, which should support domestic spending. No sharp rebound in growth is expected, however, and we do not expect growth to gain momentum and rise above the trend growth rate until around the end of the year Away from the eurozone, Mexico\u2019s economy only managed modest growth at the end of 2023. Government statistics show that Mexico\u2019s economy grew 0.1% in the fourth quarter, weaker than the 0.4% growth expected by economists. On an annual basis, Mexico grew by 2.4%, below the 3.1% expected. Today\u2019s GDP report shows that Ireland\u2019s GDP contracted in each of the four quarters of 2023, shrinking by 1.9% in Q1, 0.4% in Q2, 1,9% again in Q3 and then 0.7% in Q4. Ireland\u2019s Central Statistics Office says this is due to a decrease in the \u201cmultinational dominated sectors of Industry\u201d \u2013 ie large international corporations who base themselves in Ireland, partly for tax reasons. Ireland\u2019s GDP readings can be volatile due to the large multinationals based in the Republic, and isn\u2019t really a good tracker of its econony. The eurozone\u2019s refusal to fall into recession (yet, anyway) takes some pressure off the Euroepan Central Bank as it assesses when would be safe to start cutting interest rates. Alex Livingstone, head of FX and trading at Titan Asset Management, says: \u201cThe Q4 2023 growth numbers for the Euro Area revealed stagnant 0% growth, surpassing the -0.1% consensus for the quarter. Because growth isn\u2019t crumbling under the pressure of higher rates like some thought it might, this latest data print will buy [Christine] Lagarde some more time for inflation to return to the ECB\u2019s 2% target before cutting rates. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom for the eurozone, insists Michael Field, European market strategist at Morningstar: Field points out that growth among Europe\u2019s peripheral countries helped the eurozone avoid a recession, while the Big Two members struggled. Here\u2019s his take on this morning\u2019s GDP data: \u201cEuro area GDP was flat in the last quarter of 2023, coming in better than expectations of a 0.1% fall. This means that for the entire year, growth in the euro area economy was essentially steady. There are two ways to look at this. On the negative side, 2023 was effectively a dead year with zero growth, but on the positive side, despite record high interest rates and high inflation levels not seen since the 1970\u2019s, the euro area economy successfully managed to avoid a recession. \u201cA rebound in the peripheral economies of Belgium, Spain, and Portugal, registered the highest level of growth at 0.8% in the fourth quarter. While not blistering, this growth helped mitigate depressed growth in Europe\u2019s two powerhouse economies of Germany and France. \u201cLack of growth in the euro area contrasts uncomfortably with the over 3% growth in the US over the same period. The negative implication of this is that it makes regional investment decisions for international firms all that much easier to make, with Europe looking much less attractive at this point in time. This situation is reflected in economic sentiment readings released today, which declined month on month. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s not all doom and gloom in Europe. Inflation is within touching distance of central banks\u2019 targeted levels, meaning interest rates should decline over the course of this and next year. This brings much welcome relief to businesses and indeed consumers\u2019 pockets.\u201d Today\u2019s data shows that the eurozone fell further behind the United States at the end of last year. Data last week showed that US GDP rose by an annualised rate of 3.3% in Q4, which means a quarter-on-quarter increase of around 0.8%. Rather more impressive than the eurozone\u2019s 0% growth. That means the US grew as fast as the quickest-growing eurozone country in Q4, Portugal. We find out next month how the UK performed in Q4. The broad picture is that the eurozone has stagnated over the last year. GDP rose by just 0.1% in both Q1 and Q2 2023, before shrinking by 0.1% in the third quarter and stalling (as we just learned) in Q4. The eurozone economy \u201cescaped recession by the skin of its teeth\u201d by the end of 2023, says Diego Iscaro, head of Europe economics at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence Iscaro also fears thar that eurozone will struggle to grow in the first half of this year, after stagnating in the final quarter of 2023. He explains: Declining activity in Germany was offset by stronger than expected growth in Spain, while the French economy stagnated. The outlook for 2024 continues to be challenging amid faltering demand and increasing geopolitical tensions. The expected fall in inflation should help to support households\u2019 finances, although this positive impact will be at least partly offset by less supportive fiscal conditions. Similarly, we expect labour market conditions to gradually become less positive, although we currently project a modest increase in the unemployment rate this year. All in all, we think that eurozone activity will remain virtually stagnant during the first half of 2024. Among the eurozone member states for which data are available so far, Portugal (+0.8%) recorded the highest growth in Q4 compared to Q3, followed by Spain (+0.6%), Belgium and Latvia (both +0.4%). Declines were recorded in Ireland (-0.7%), Germany and Lithuania (both -0.3%). The year on year growth rates were positive for six countries and negative for five, Eurostat adds. Newsflash: the eurozone has avoided falling into recession, despite Germany\u2019s economy contracting and France stagnating in the last quarter. GDP across the eurozone, and the wider European Union, was flat in the fourth quarter of 2023, data from Eurostat shows. That follows the 0.1% contraction in the third quarter, and means Europe has narrowly avoided a technical recession (two negative quarters in a row). The growth reported in Italy (_0.2%), Spain (+0.6%) and Portugal (+0.8%) this morning will have helped keep the eurozone away from another contraction. Nick O\u2019Reilly, restructuring and recovery director at accountancy firm MHA, predicts there will be more large administrations in 2024: Following the news that England and Wales saw the most company insolvencies since 1993 last year, O\u2019Reilly says: \u201cThroughout 2023 we saw a steady rise in the number of reported corporate and personal insolvencies which we saw reflected on the ground in our work. This growth has been primarily driven by smaller businesses having difficulty paying back government COVID support leading to an uptick in the number of Creditor\u2019s Voluntary Liquidations. \u201cHowever, as we head further into 2024, we are likely to see more large-scale administrations compared to 2022 and 2023, as the impact of high interest rates begins to bite even further. This year is likely to be the busiest 12 months for insolvencies since 1993 as similar challenging conditions to 2023 will prevail \u2014 ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, falling house prices, still low levels of consumer confidence \u2014 combined with the lack of availability of interest payment holidays. This is highly likely to lead to some high-profile casualties.\u201d Newsflash: the number of company insolvencies in England and Wales has hit a thirty-year high. The Insolvency Services there were 25,158 registered company insolvencies in England and Wales in 2023. This is the highest annual number of company insolvencies since 1993, as firms across the country were hit by high interest rates and the squeeze on consumer spending. Last year there were 20,577 creditors\u2019 voluntary liquidations (CVLs), in which a company is voluntarily wound up after running out of money, plus 2,827 compulsory liquidations, 1,567 administrations, 185 company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) and two receivership appointments. One in 186 active companies (at a rate of 53.7 per 10,000 active companies) entered insolvent liquidation in 2023. So, as there are more companies in existance than 30 years ago, the 2023 rate remained much lower than the peak rate of 94.8 insolvencies per 10,000 active companies during the 2008/09 recession. Back in the UK, there\u2019s a small pick-up in the number of mortgages being agreed. The Bank of England reports that 50,500 loans for house purchases were agreed in December, up from 49,300 in November. And in a boost to borrowers, the \u2018effective\u2019 interest rate \u2013 the actual interest paid \u2013 on newly drawn mortgages fell by 6 basis points to 5.28% in December. This is the first drop since November 2021. The GDP data keeps coming\u2026 with Portugal reporting that its economy grew by 0.8% in the last quarter of 2023. Statistics Portugal adds that GDP grew by 2.2%, year-on-year, in Q4 2023, explaining: The contribution of domestic demand to the year-on year growth rate of GDP remained high in the fourth quarter, with an acceleration in private consumption and a slowdown in investment. The contribution of net external demand to the year on-year rate of change of GDP became positive, with Exports of Goods and Services in volume increasing more intensely than Imports. Germany\u2019s economy remains stuck in \u201cthe twilight zone between recession and stagnation\u201d, says Carsten Brzeski, ING\u2019s global head of macro. Following the news that Germany shrank by 0.3% in October-December, Brzeski argues that the country is probably in a shallow recession: The year 2023 was the first full year since 2020 in which the German economy contracted (by -0.3% year-on-year). The GDP numbers from previous quarters were revised. As a result, the German economy has just avoided a technical recession (ie two consecutive quarters of contraction). But with an average quarterly growth rate of 0% QoQ since the second quarter of 2022, the German economy is anything but fast-growing. The best way to describe the state of the German economy is probably that it is in a shallow recession. In fact, the economy remains stuck in the twilight zone between recession and stagnation. While Germany and France struggle, Italy has beaten expectations! Italy\u2019s economy grew by 0.2% in the fourth quarter of last year, statistics body ISTAT reports, beating expectations for no growth in Q4, despite weak domestic demand. On a year-on-year basis, GDP in the euro zone\u2019s third largest economy was up 0.5%. Istat reports: The quarter on quarter change is the result of a decrease of value added in agriculture, forestry and fishing and of an increase in that of both industry and services. From the demand side, there is a negative contribution by the domestic component (gross of change in inventories) and a positive one by the net export component. Newsflash: Germany\u2019s economy contracted in the final three months of last year, putting Europe\u2019s largest economy on the brink of recession. Statistics body Destatis reports that German GDP shrank by 0.3% in Q4 2023, in line with forecasts. That follows flat GDP in both the second and third quarters of last year (Q3 has been revised up from a 0.1% fall). Destatis says: After the German economy more or less stagnated in the first three quarters, economic performance decreased in the fourth quarter of 2023. Compared with the previous quarter, there was a marked decline, in particular, in gross fixed capital formation in construction and in machinery and equipment after price, seasonal and calendar adjustment Charlotte de Montpellier, ING\u2019s senior economist for France and Switzerland, says there are \u201cfew indicators\u201d that suggest the French economy will pick up strongly in the first quarter of 2024. De Montpellier writes: In fact, we expect stagnation to persist. We expect the French economy to recover only gradually in the course of 2024, with growth picking up slightly in the second quarter and then accelerating in the second half of the year. This recovery should take place thanks to more dynamic consumption against a backdrop of falling inflation and slightly improved purchasing power. Added to this will be the impact of a tight labour market. We expect growth to be even weaker in 2024 than in 2023, at 0.5% compared to 0.8%. Back in the UK, the slowdown of grocery price inflation has stalled this month, according to data from data provider Kantar. Kantar reports that supermarket prices were 6.8% more expensive than a year ago in January, slightly lower than the 6.9% drop in the year to December. The Czech economy grew by 0.2% in the fourth quarter versus the previous three months. That\u2019s in line with expectations, and shows a return to growth after Czech GDP shrank by 0,6% in Q3. On a year-on-year basis, the economy fell 0.2% in real terms, according to a flash estimate by the Czech Statistics Office. Over in Austria, the \u201cdownward trend in the domestic economy observed last year\u201d was halted in the final few months of 2023, statistics body WIFO says. WIFO reports that Austria\u2019s economy grew by 0.2% in Q4 2023, better than the 0.2% contraction expected. That follows two quarters of negative growth \u2013 -1.1% in Q2, and 0.5% in Q3 \u2013 meaning Austria has escaped a technical recession. WIFO reports that Austria\u2019s industrial economy expanded by 0.4% in Q4, while the services sector stagnated and construction shrank by 1%. For 2023 as a whole, Austria\u2019s economy shrank by 0.7%. Spain\u2019s economy minister, Carlos Cuerpo, has said the pick-up of growth in Q4 2023 is a good starting point for this year. Reuters reports: Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said that trend was expected to continue into 2024. The fourth-quarter reading \u201cprovides a good starting point to meet our target of 2% growth in 2024,\u201d Cuerpo said in a recorded video message. Newsflash: Spain\u2019s economy grew at a faster pace in the final quarter of 2024. Spanish GDP expanded by 0.6% in the October-December quarter, up from growth of 0.4% in July-September. That\u2019s faster than the 0.2% growth forecast by economist, which may mean today\u2019s eurozone GDP report is a little stronger than expected\u2026. On an annual basis, Spain\u2019s fourth-quarter economic output expanded by 2%, beating the average estimate of 1.5% in a Reuters poll. Here\u2019s a chart showing French GDP over the last three years: Here\u2019s economist Julian Jessop on this morning\u2019s French GDP report: In the City, Diageo, the world\u2019s top spirits maker, has missed first-half sales estimates this morning, following a sharp fall in demand in Latin America. Diageo has reported that organic net sales fell by 0.6% in the second half of 2023, driven by a $310 million or 23% decline in the Latin America and Caribbean region. Europe performed slightly better, with organic net sales growing 3%, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Turkey and high single-digit growth in Great Britain and Ireland (partly due to strong growth in Guinness). Diageo\u2019s brands also include Johnnie Walker, Tanqueray, Baileys, Smirnoff, Captain Morgan, Crown Royal and Don Julio. Debra Crew, Diageo\u2019s CEO, says: The first half of fiscal 24 was challenging for Diageo and our sector, particularly as we lapped strong growth in the prior year and faced an uneven global consumer environment. Excluding LAC, our group organic net sales grew 2.5%, driven by good growth in Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa. While North America delivered sequential improvement in line with our expectations, we are focused on returning to high-quality share growth as consumer behaviour continues to normalise in our largest region. As previously announced in November 2023, materially weaker performance in LAC, driven by fast-changing consumer sentiment and high inventory levels, significantly impacted total business performance. Newsflash: The Bank of England has fined HSBC bank \u00a357.4m for failing to protect some customer depositors for several years. The BoE\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority said in a statement the bank failed to accurately identify deposits that were eligible for Britain\u2019s Financial Services Compensation Scheme - which protects customer cash up to 85,000 pounds. The failings occurred for HSBC Bank (HBEU) between 2015 and 2022, and for HSBC UK Bank between 2018 and 2021, says the PRA, This is the second highest fine imposed by the PRA, which it says \u201creflects the seriousness of the failings.\u201d Sam Woods, Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation and CEO of the PRA, said: \u201cThe serious failings in this case go to the heart of the PRA\u2019s safety and soundness objective. It is vital that all banks comply fully with our requirements around preparedness for resolution. HBEU fell far short of its obligations in this area, and failed to disclose its failings to us in a timely manner. These failures led to today\u2019s action, including the significant fine.\u201d The news that France\u2019s economy failed to grow in the fourth quarter of 2023 comes as French farmers hold protests being dubbed the \u201csiege of Paris.\u201d Farmers argue they are being hit by regulations, taxes and falling pay. Yesterday, a tractor strike stopped traffic on eight main motorways into the capital, prompting the French government to warn farmers that any action to block access to Paris\u2019s main market for fresh food would be crossing a red line. President Emmanuel Macron held a crisis meeting with key cabinet ministers, on what was being called \u201cOperation Paris Siege\u201d. Prisca Thevenot, a government spokesperson, said announcements would be made on Tuesday. \u201cThe whole government and the president are mobilised,\u201d she said. Newsflash: France has avoided falling into a technical recession, after stagnating in the last half of 2023. Statistics body INSEE has got eurozone GDP day (details here) up and running by reporting that France\u2019s economy was stable in October-December, with growth of 0.0%. Trade supported the French economy, while its domestic economy struggled. INSEE explains: Final domestic demand (excluding inventories) contributed negatively to GDP growth this quarter (\u20110.1 points after +0.4 points in Q3 2023), due to the decrease of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF, \u20110.7% after +0.2%) and of household consumption (\u20110.1% after +0.5%). Conversely, foreign trade recovered in Q4 2023 and contributed positively to GDP growth (+1.2 points after \u20110.1 points). Imports fell sharply (\u20113.1% after \u20110.4%), while exports remained virtually unchanged (\u20110.1% after \u20110.6%). Finally, the contribution of inventory changes to GDP growth was negative again this quarter (\u20111.1 points after \u20110.3 points in Q3 2023). France\u2019s GDP for the third quarter of 2023 has been revised up too, to show zero growth, not the 0.1% contraction previously reported. Over 2023 as a whole, France\u2019s economy grew by just 0.9%, down from 2.5% growth in 2022. If it\u2019s poor, today\u2019s eurozone GDP data could prompt the European Central Bank into starting to cut interest rates this year, perhaps as early as April. Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets, explains: The French economy is predicted to improve modestly to 0% in Q4 from -0.1% in Q3, however there is considerable downside risk to this estimate if recent PMI numbers are any guide. In Italy the picture looks little better with a stagnation also expected, and a modest slowdown from 0.1% in Q3, while in Germany the economy is expected to be in recession with a -0.1% contraction in Q3 followed by a bigger -0.3% contraction in Q4. The only silver lining is Spain where the economy is expected to grow by 0.2%, however that is unlikely to be enough to prevent the bloc sliding into a technical recession with another quarterly contraction of -0.1% following a similar contraction in Q3. Inflation across UK shops has fallen to its lowest level since May 2022, as households benefitted from a slowdown in price rises of food and other goods. Annual shop price annual inflation eased to 2.9% in January, new data from the British Retail Consortium and NielsenIQ show. That\u2019s down from 4.3% in December, meaning prices are still rising, but at a slower rate. Food inflation decelerated to 6.1% in January, down from 6.7% in December, helped by a fall in the price of tea and milk, Alcohol, though, remained more expensive than a year ago due to increased duties, the BRC says. Fresh food inflation dropped to 4.9%, down from 5.4% in December, while non-food inflation eased to just 1.3% in January, down from 3.1% in December. This may cheer the Bank of England, which is due to set UK interest rates at noon on Thursday. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: \u201cSome New Year cheer as January shop price inflation slid to its lowest level since May 2022. Non-food goods drove the fall, as many retailers offered heavily discounted goods in their January sales to entice consumer spend amidst weak demand. Good news for the morning brew as the price of tea and milk fell, while evening tipples remained more expensive on the back of increased alcohol duties. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. We get a major healthcheck on Europe\u2019s economy this morning, as new GDP data for across the eurozone is released. Growth figures for France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria and Portugal will be released over the next few hours, culminating in the first estimate of eurozone growth in the final quarter of 2023. And it may show that the eurozone is in recession. Economists predict that GDP in the single-currency bloc shrank by 0.1% in Q4 2023. If so, that would be the second quarterly contraction in a row (GDP fell 0.1% in July-September), meeting the technical definition of a recession. The eurozone economy has been weighed down by high interest rates, and the cost of living squeeze caused by the jump in energy and food prices after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The euro weakened yesterday ahead of today\u2019s data, as Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG, explains: EUR/USD is trading lower at 1.0832 (-0.18%) ahead of the EA flash GDP data, expected to show a second consecutive quarter of contraction (-0.1% exp) and confirm the Euro Area entered recession. Also coming up today In a busy morning for economic data, we\u2019ll also learn if UK grocery inflation fell in the last month, and whether lenders approved more, or fewer, mortgages. The US economy, which has been doing rather better than Europe, will also be in focus, with the latest JOLTS report into job vacancies, a consumer confidence report and a house price index. We also get a healthcheck on the global economy, with the International Monetary Fund releasing an update to its world economic outlook this afternoon. There will also be disruption on UK railways today, as members of the Aslef union at Southeastern, Southern/Gatwick Express, Great Northern, Thameslink and South Western Railway strike in an ongoing pay dispute.

            "date": "2024-01-15T12:00:33Z",
            "content": "Germany is on track for its first two-year recession since the early 2000s after its economy shrank in 2023 amid the impact of higher energy costs and weaker industrial demand. The German national statistics office said \u201cmultiple crises\u201d affecting the economy had contributed to a 0.3% fall in gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023, compared with the previous year, as higher interest rates and elevated living costs took their toll. \u201cDespite recent price declines, prices remained high at all stages in the economic process and put a damper on economic growth,\u201d said Dr Ruth Brand, the president of the statistics office, at a press conference in Berlin on Monday. \u201cThe German economy did not continue its recovery from the sharp economic slump experienced in the pandemic year of 2020.\u201d Germany\u2019s economy was 0.7% higher in 2023 than in 2019, the year before the pandemic began. However, analysts said Europe\u2019s largest economy was on track for another year of stagnant growth in 2024 at best, with a heightened risk of a second consecutive year of negative output. Carsten Brzeski, the global head of macro research at the Dutch bank ING, said: \u201cThere is no imminent rebound in sight and the economy looks set to go through the first two-year recession since the early 2000s. \u201cWe expect the current state of stagnation and shallow recession to continue. In fact, the risk that 2024 will be another year of recession is high.\u201d After adjustment for calendar effects, the decline in economic performance in 2023 amounted to 0.1%, the statistics office said. It added that in the final quarter of last year the German economy shrank by 0.3%, compared with the third three months, when output had stagnated. Germany\u2019s dominant industrial base, excluding construction, fell by 2% over the course of the year, as higher energy costs and dwindling demand at home and from abroad weighed on factory output. Reflecting the impact of higher energy bills and borrowing costs on consumers, household consumption fell 0.8% on the previous year, while government spending fell 1.7%. As well as having one of the worst performances among advanced economies last year, Germany is expected to experience one of the weakest performers in 2024, with EU forecasts published in November predicting growth of 0.8%. Experts said the country\u2019s economy was in \u201cpermanent crisis mode\u201d as supply chain frictions, persistent inflationary pressures, weaker global demand for manufactured goods and higher interest rates weighed on national output. Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe recent fall in inflation should provide some relief for households, but residential and business investment are likely to contract, construction is heading for a steep downturn and the government is tightening fiscal policy sharply. We forecast zero GDP growth in 2024.\u201d Separate figures on Monday showed industrial production across the wider eurozone fell for a third consecutive month in November, with a slump of 0.3% on the month as declines in Italy and Germany were offset by growth in France and Spain."

            "content": "Time to wrap up\u2026 here are today\u2019s main stories: In other travel news\u2026. Eurostar traffic has returned to pre-Covid levels with a 22% rise in passenger numbers in 2023. The cross-Channel train operator has announced that booming demand from London drove growth of 25% for journeys to Paris and more than a third on Eurostar routes to Brussels and Amsterdam, as total passenger numbers reached 18.9 million. Eurostar also said it had found a partial solution to allow it to maintain a limited service to the Netherlands during work at Amsterdam station, which had threatened to halt the popular route in 2024. The RMT union has announced that cleaners employed on TransPennine Express trains have suspended their strike action following an improved pay offer. Bidvest Noonan. which employs cleaners to work on TPE services, has agreed to implement a \u201cliving wage\u201d of \u00a312 an hour, as part of a pay deal, plus staff travel facilities which will save cleaners \u00a31,000 a year for rail travel. Back at the UK parliament, the top civil servant at the Treasury has rejected comments by the head of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that public spending forecasts last year were a \u201cwork of fiction\u201d. James Bowler, the Permanent Secretary at the Treasury, was asked about Richard Hughes\u2019s comments yesterday, and said he disagreed with them. Bowler told the Treasury Committee: I don\u2019t agree with what excellent head of the OBR said and I don\u2019t agree with the language he used. There\u2019s nothing new here. \u201cYou set out your spending plans, we have a three year spending plan, they\u2019re due to finish in just over a year\u2019s time and then you have an assumption as to what spending will be thereafter. \u201cThat\u2019s not a new, nothing\u2019s changed in that, so I don\u2019t particularly recognise that there\u2019s anything different. \u201cIt\u2019s very good that we have multi-year spending plans. As you go through a multi-year spending plan as you get further towards the end of it, the closer you get to setting new plans so it is the case that in just over a year\u2019s time that runs out, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s new.\u201d Hughes told the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords that the OBR\u2019s forecasts were based on \u201cquestionable assumptions\u201d that lead people to call his efforts a work of fiction, due to a lack of support from the government about its public spending plans. Over in New York. British billionaire Joe Lewis has pleaded guilty to insider trading charges on Wednesday, and apologized to a judge for his conduct. Lewis, 86, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and two counts of securities fraud, as part of an agreement with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan. As part of the plea deal, Lewis has the right to appeal in the event he is sentenced to prison time, his lawyer David Zornow said. Lewis, whose family trust controls a majority of the Tottenham Hotspur soccer team, was charged in July 2023 with passing inside information on his portfolio companies to two of his private pilots as well as friends, personal assistants and romantic partners, enabling them, according to prosecutors, to reap millions of dollars of profit. Addressing U.S. District Judge Jessica Clarke, Lewis said he knew at the time that what he was doing was wrong. Lewis said: \u201cI am so embarrassed and I apologize to the court for my conduct.\u201d Lewis was charged with 16 counts of securities fraud last July, which he denied, accusing prosecutors of making an \u201cegregious\u201d mistake. Over at the Post Office inquiry today, a former investigator has maintained that a branch owner-operator who had his conviction for embezzlement overturned last year was guilty. Raymond Grant, an investigator involved in the prosecution of the post office operator William Quarm, who died in 2012 not knowing he would eventually be cleared years later, had to be legally forced to appear to give testimony at the public inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal. He told the inquiry on Wednesday he had a \u201cclash of priorities\u201d and wanted to focus on his current job at the Salvation Army. Encouraging economic news from the US: American companies are growing their output at the fastest rate for seven months. Data provider S&amp;P Global reports that its Flash composite US PMI has risen to 52.3, from 50.9 in December, showing faster growth. But, as in the UK, the growth was driven by the services sector \u2013 while factories suffered from supply chain problems. S&amp;P Global explains: Businesses in the US signalled a stronger upturn in activity at the start of the year, as output growth quickened to the sharpest rate in seven months. The expansion was driven by service providers, as manufacturers continued to see a drop in production amid intensifying supply issues. The report also shows that the prices charged by firms are rising at the slowest rate since May 2020, which may show that inflationary pressures are easing. It\u2019s done it again\u2026 Also at PMQs, Rishi Sunak claimed that the Government\u2019s \u00a3500m rescue package for Tata Steel has saved 5,000 jobs and prevented the closure of its Port Talbot plant. The Prime Minister insisted the UK Government\u2019s intervention would also protect further workers in the South Wales\u2019 steelworks supply chain, Sunak said he knows it\u2019s an anxious time for steel workers, and claimed criticisms of the support package were \u201cchurlish\u201d. That\u2019s likely to go down like a steel balloon with workers at the Port Talbot site, who learned on Friday that up t0 2,800 jobs are at risk through the closure of two blast furnaces. Instead, Tata is building an electric arc furnace \u2013 partly funded by the UK \u2013 which will melt scrap steel, rather than producing virgin steel from iron ore. The owner of the Port Talbot steelworks has also been accused of \u201cgross hypocrisy\u201d, because it is prepares to open a new blast furnace in India, which will be one of the largest blast furnaces in the world. This morning\u2019s report from Ofcom into Royal Mail\u2019s universal service obligation is causing ructions in Westminster. Liam Byrne MP, chairman of the Business and Trade Committee, is urging the government to engage with the issue, saying: \u201cToday\u2019s report demonstrates once and for all that Government and Royal Mail must now get round the table to agree how the Universal Service Obligation works now and for the future. \u201cLet\u2019s be absolutely clear: the USO is a vital public service which is why we\u2019ve called for Government to get serious about talks with Royal Mail to agree a plan to secure its future.\u201d But prime minister Rishi Sunak told MPs he is committed to Royal Mail\u2019s universal service obligation \u201cremains as it is\u201d, after Ofcom suggested the six-days-a-week letter delivery requirement could be cut to five, or even three days. Asked at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions in the Commons if under his watch there will be no reductions in postal services provided by Royal Mail, Sunak said: \u201cI agree about the importance of the Royal Mail\u2019s universal service obligation, and as you will have heard from the minister this morning, we remain absolutely committed to ensuring that it remains as it is.\u201d Over in Argentina, the popularity of President Javier Milei\u2019s austerity blitz will be tested today as unions stage a general strike. Bloomberg has the details: The protest Wednesday organized by the CGT, one of the South American nation\u2019s oldest and most powerful union groups, will help set the tenor of debate as the libertarian economist attempts to slash the size of the state in a bid to tame triple-digit inflation. \u201cDepending on how many people they mobilize, the union will be able to demonstrate how much weight it carries at the negotiating table,\u201d political analyst Raul Timerman said in an interview. Milei won power last year promising a dramatic shake-up of Argentina\u2019s moribund economy amid rampant inflation and widespread poverty. He has already issued a decree deregulating vast swaths of the economy, while a so-called omnibus bill of austerity measures is making its way through the Argentinian parliament. Milei startled Davos last week with a fiery speech hailing free enterprise capitalism and claiming that the Western world was in danger having fallen to socialism. Eliminating cervical cancer across the UK would save thousands of lives and is estimated to save the economy \u00a32.6bn, according to a new report, following a pledge by the NHS in England to end the disease by 2040. Around 3,200 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in the UK every year \u2013 nine women every day, according to Cancer Research UK. It says 99.8% of them are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), which means that nearly every case is preventable. The UK could save \u00a32.6bn by achieving the WHO global targets for cervical cancer by 2046, according to a report from the Office for Health Economics, which was funded by cervical vaccine maker MSD. It will be launched in parliament at 1.30pm today. The World Health Organisation has set a target of four cases of per 100,000 women, by ensuring that 90% of girls are vaccinated by age 15, 70% of women between 35 and 45 are screened, and 90% of women with cancer are treated. The report said the UK would hit these targets by 2046, but warned that progress is not guaranteed, and called on governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to follow England\u2019s lead in pledging to eliminate cervical cancer by 2040. Vaccination and screening rates have worsened, according to the latest data published yesterday. This shows a one-dose coverage rate of 75.7% in year 9 girls in England, down from 82.2% in 2021/22. Of women aged 25-49, 65.8% received age-appropriate screening \u2013 down from 67.6% in 2021/22. Cervical cancer in the UK is associated with a lifetime cost of \u00a3208,086 per case. There are six licensed cervical cancer vaccines globally \u2013 MSD\u2019s Gardasil and GSK\u2019s Cervarix as well as jabs made in China and India. The NHS used Cervarix in the routine immunisation programme for girls aged 12-13 from September 2008; from 2012 it was replaced by Gardasil. Both vaccines protect against infection with HPV-16 and HPV-18, which cause the majority of HPV-associated cancers. Gardasil also protects against HPV-6 and -11, which cause genital warts. Metro Bank\u2019s white knight investor \u2013 the Columbian billionaire who helped rescue the bank in early October \u2013 has clinched a seat on the lender\u2019s board. Metro confirmed that the 65-year-old banking tycoon Jaime Gilinski Bacal would become a non-executive director, months after ploughing \u00a3100m of emergency funds into the lender in exchange a 53% stake. Metro Bank\u2019s chair, Robert Sharpe, said: \u201cJaime\u2019s appointment underscores the commitment he has long shown to the bank as a supportive, long-term shareholder. He brings decades of banking expertise and experience which will prove invaluable on the next stage of the bank\u2019s journey.\u201d As part of his rescue agreement, Bacal has been given the green light to appoint up to three directors in total to the board. However, he already leveraged his position into a boardroom seat for his daughter Dorita Gilinski in autumn 2022. Bacal said in a statement: \u201cThere are many opportunities for Metro Bank to grow and I am looking forward to playing a part in the evolution of the bank as we build on the solid foundational work undertaken to date.\u201d Economic storm clouds are also gathering over Germany. This morning, Germany\u2019s Ifo institute downgraded its 2024 economic growth forecast to 0.7%, down from 0.9%. Ifo cited uncertainty caused bya constitutional court ruling that has left the government scrambling to revamp this year\u2019s budget. And there could be worse ahead, if geopolitical tensions worsen. The Bundesbank has estimated today that an economic crisis in China would knock some 1.5% off German economic growth. According to its simulations, real German GDP would be 0.7% lower in the first year of the crisis and just under 1% in the second year. UK factories aren\u2019t the only parts of the economy finding January tough. Revolution Bars slashed its outlook for the year, telling shareholders that \u201cJanuary trade has started softly as guests recover from the expense of Christmas.\u201d Revolution is also facing higher wage bills, with the minimum wage set to rise by almost 10% in April, while customer numbers have been hit by Aslef train strikes. Rob Pitcher, CEO of Revolution Bars Group, says last Christmas was the best in four years, adding, It was pleasing to see our Revolution guests experience their first uninterrupted Christmas since 2019, driving growth for the brand. Revolution\u2019s younger guests are however still feeling the disproportionate effect of the cost-of-living crisis. Looking forward, both business rates and national living wage will increase materially in April 2024 and therefore we have had to take the view that, with inflation remaining high, the recovery for the Revolution business, our largest brand, will take longer than we had previously forecast. Newsflash: British manufacturers have been hit with a fresh drop in orders and have scaled back their investment plans, new data from the CBI shows. The CBI\u2019s industrial trends survey shows a contration in orders \u2013 its quarterly order book balance dropped to -13 in the three months to January, its lowest since July 2020. The survey also shows firms expect to cut back on investment in tangible assets such as buildings, machinery and equipment. It also shows a rise in costs \u2013 which may be due to the Red Sea crisis disrupting supply chains, as this morning\u2019s PMI report showed. CBI Deputy Chief Economist Anna Leach says: \u201cConditions in the manufacturing sector deteriorated unexpectedly at the start of the year, with output falling and order books at their weakest since the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d Worryingly, the report also shows manufacturers are cutting back on their headcounts: The pound has strengthened against the US dollar, after this morning\u2019s PMI report showed supply chain disruption was pushing up costs. Sterling has hit $1.277, the highest in over a week, suggesting a dialling-back of interest rate cut expectations\u2026. The UK PMIs point to brighter growth outlook but stubborn inflation, says ING developed markets economist James Smith. \u201cThe UK service sector, which accounts for the lion\u2019s share of economic output, edged further into growth in January, according to the latest purchasing manager\u2019s index. What\u2019s particularly interesting is that this extends a recent trend whereby UK service sector growth is apparently accelerating at a time when the equivalent eurozone index is edging further into contraction (though Europe\u2019s manufacturing sector appears to be bottoming out). Before last autumn, the UK\u2019s services PMI had largely tracked what was happening in its closest neighbours. This is another signal that the consensus among economists going into this year, which suggests the UK will underperform most major European economies in 2024, looks a bit too gloomy. While the recent sharp fall in market rates is good news for all economies, in the UK it makes a particular difference to the mortgage squeeze given the relatively high share of households due to refinance this year (around a fifth). Over in the eurozone, business activity in the euro area fell at the slowest rate for six months in January. The eurozone Composite PMI Output Index has risen to 47.9, showing the smallest monthly contraction in six months (but below the UK\u2019s 52.5, which showed growth). And although disruptions to shipping in the Red Sea caused eurozone supply chains to lengthen for the first time in a year, manufacturing input costs continued to fall on average, S&amp;P Global reports. Today\u2019s Flash PMI report on the UK economy (see 9.44am) shows that price pressures remain high, points out Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics. And that may worry the Bank of England, and make policymakers less keen to consider cutting interest rates. Webb explains: The services output prices balance nudged down from 58.6 to 57.3. But that remains consistent with services CPI inflation easing only gradually from 6.4% in December to around 5.0% in about six months\u2019 time. What\u2019s more, the shipping disruptions in the Red Sea led to the steepest lengthening in suppliers\u2019 delivery times since September 2022 and caused the input prices balance of the manufacturing PMI to rise from 47.5 to 53.5, to its highest level since March 2023. The further small rise in the composite activity PMI, from 52.1 in December to 52.5 in January, suggests that \u201cthe economy has improved\u201d, Webb adds. Newsflash: the Red Sea crisis is hitting UK manufacturing supply chains and pushing up input costs. Data firm S&amp;P Global reports that its flash UK Manufacturing Output Index, which tracks factory production, has fallen to a three-month low of 44.9. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction. S&amp;P Global\u2019s survey of UK purchasing managers has found that manufacturing supply chains suffered from longer wait times for container freight during January in the wake of the Red Sea crisis. With supplies taking longer to arrive, firms have been running down their inventories. S&amp;P Global explains: Supplier delays were overwhelmingly linked to longer international shipping times as vessels rerouted away from the Suez Canal. At the same time, preproduction inventories fell to the greatest extent since last August as safety stocks were depleted. These longer delivery times are adding to costs, with S&amp;P Global predicting UK inflation will remain \u201cstubbornly higher\u201d in the 3-4% range in the near future (it rose to 4% in December). The better news is that services companies are growing at the fastest rate in eight months, with the UK Services PMI rising to 53.8. That helped the wider recovery in private sector output gains momentum in January, lifting the overall UK PMI Composite to a seven-month high of 52.5. That should help the economy avoid recession, they say. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence said: \u201cUK business activity growth accelerated for a third straight month in January, according to early PMI survey data, marking a promising start to the year. The survey data point to the economy growing at a quarterly rate of 0.2% after a flat fourth quarter, therefore skirting recession and showing signs of renewed momentum. Businesses have also become more optimistic about the year ahead, with confidence rebounding to its highest since last May. Business activity and confidence are being in part driven by hopes of faster economic growth in 2024, in turn linked to the prospect of falling inflation and commensurately lower interest rates. Shares in Royal Mail\u2019s parent company, International Distributions Services, have now jumped 3.4% in London, as traders ponder the savings it could make from fewer deliveries. That\u2019re up 9p at 270p, adding to their earlier gains. Royal Mail shares floated at 330p in 2013, and swiftly surged over 500p. But they\u2019ve had a choppy ride since, hitting record lows below 120p early in the pandemic before receiving a boost from parcel demand. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, points out that there is opposition to Ofcom\u2019s suggested improvements to the Royal Mail universal service obligation: Royal Mail has long had its calls to scrap the government\u2019s USO rejected. Now it looks like the tide could potentially be turning. Although there is still considerable opposition including from the Communication Workers Union (CWU) which argues a three day service would \u2018destroy\u2019 the company, as well as the Postal Affairs Minister Kevin Hollinrake who said the government is committed to a six-day service. The company owned by International Distribution Services, has been facing a series of painful setbacks like the postal strikes, a fine from Ofcom for missing delivery targets and a cyber security incident. It has also been struggling with heavy operating losses on the back of a long-term structural decline in letter demand and the loss of its 360-year-old monopoly on delivery parcels from Post Office branches. Ofcom said letter volumes have halved since 2011, raising existential concerns about the future of Royal Mail and prompting calls for a drastic overhaul of the business to revitalise its finances and operations to ensure it doesn\u2019t become \u2018unsustainable.\u2019 Shares in IDS are trading higher today reflecting optimism towards the regulator\u2019s openness towards change at the embattled postal business. But shares are still sharply lower than the recent highs seen in 2021 during covid.\u201d Shares in easyJet have jumped 5%, despite the budget airline taking a \u00a340m hit from the conflict in the Middle East. EasyJet reported that there was a temporary slowdown in flight bookings for the wider industry after the 7 October attacks, as well as an ongoing pause on flights to Israel and Jordan. But, it says, demand and bookings have recovered strongly from late November. This allowed it to narrow its pre-tax loss in the last quarter, to \u00a3126m, from \u00a3133m in October-December 2022. Over in China, policymakers are cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in their reserves, to stimulate the economy. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) has announce it will cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for all banks by 50 basis points (bps) from 5 February. This is the first RRR cut this year, and should free up 1 trillion yuan (\u00a3110bn) to support lending. China\u2019s stock markets rose today, with the CSI 300 index up 1.4%. Mining stocks are rallying in London too. Kevin Hollinrake, the minister for postal services, believes Japanese IT firm Fujitsu should pay \u201chundreds of millions of pounds\u201d in compensation for its role in the Post Office scandal. Speaking to the Today programme, Hollinrake said: This will cost the taxpayer a billion pounds, maybe more than that. He added that Fujitsu, which supplied the flawed Horizon software, should pay \u201ca significant proportion\u201d of that bill. Last week, Fujitsu Europe\u2019s boss admitted the firm has a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to contribute to compensation for sub-postmasters who were wrongly prosecuted due to Horizon reporting that money was missing from their branches. The inquiry into Horizon also heard last week that some Horizone bugs were known about as early as 1999, but this information was kept from the courts. Hollinrake says what has happened is \u201cabsolutely disgraceful\u201d and a \u201chorrendous scandal\u201d, in terms of both its scale and depth, and the impact on people\u2019s lives. There\u2019s bad news for workers at asset manager Abrdn this morning. Abrdn is stepping up its cost-cutting programme, and today announced it will strip out another \u00a3150m of costs in 2024 and 2025, mainly across its group functions and support services. The plan will eliminate around 500 jobs. Abrdn says: The programme includes the removal of management layers, increasing spans of control, further efficiency in outsourcing and technology areas, as well as reducing overheads in group functions and support services. Citizens Advice are calling for proposals to tackle the causes of Royal Mail\u2019s \u201cpersistent failings\u201d. Morgan Wild, interim director of policy at Citizens Advice, says simply cutting services won\u2019t automatically make deliveries more reliable: \u201cGiven Royal Mail has failed to meet its targets for nearly half a decade, it\u2019s clear the current Universal Service Obligation (USO) is falling short of its fundamental purpose: safeguarding consumers. Any changes must prioritise their needs, not Royal Mail\u2019s bottom line. \u201cWe agree that improving reliability is essential. Late post has real consequences - people miss vital medical appointments, legal documents and benefit decisions. \u201cCutting services won\u2019t automatically make letter deliveries more reliable, so we must see proposals to tackle the cause of Royal Mail\u2019s persistent failings. Ofcom and the government have to spell out how any revised USO will start to deliver for the millions of us who rely on it.\u201d Shares in International Distributions Services, Royal Mail\u2019s parent company, rose by 1.8% at the start of trading in London, as traders digest Ofcom\u2019s report into its USO. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) have said a three-day delivery service would \u201cdestroy\u201d Royal Mail. CWU general secretary Dave Ward said the union could not support such a plan: \u201cWe are not resistant to change, but we will not sign up to a three-day universal service obligation, which would destroy Royal Mail as we know and would impact on thousands of jobs. \u201cRoyal Mail has the biggest fleet in the country, a presence in every community, and boasts and unrivalled infrastructure. \u201cThis is the bedrock that a serious growth agenda, and the future of the company, can be built.\u201d Ofcom CEO Dame Melanie Dawes is on Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme now, to discuss the regulator\u2019s report into Royal Mail\u2019s Universal Service Obligation. Q: Why should politicians make Royal Mail\u2019s job easier? They\u2019re failing to meet their current targets, and have terrible industrial relations\u2026. Dawes agrees that Royal Mail is not delivering. It needs to improve their quality of service. But there\u2019s also been a \u201chuge shift\u201d in the postal markets, with letter volumes falling and parcel demand rising. We have to respond to that, Dawes says, otherwise the service becomes too expensive, or worse, unsustainable. Q: Are you saying that Royal Mail could go bust if their obligations don\u2019t change? Dawes replies that Royal Mail is currently loss-making, and has a big transformation ahead. She adds that Ofcom fined them \u00a35.5m, just before Christmas, because of their poor service (missing delivery targets). Dawes adds: We will remain absolutely vigilient in making sure they deliver what they are supposed to do at the moment. But the regulator is also identifying where change is needed in the future, and wants to have a debate about this. Q: So, Royal Mail could scrap Saturday deliveries, and maybe other days as well? Dawes says some other countries already have an every-other-day service. But that needs to be combined with a really good overnight service, for deliveries that are urgent. Dawes says she isn\u2019t proposing a third class of service, on top of 1st and 2nd class \u2013 (implying, I think, that 1st class would be a guaranteed overnight delivery). Postal Affairs Minister Kevin Hollinrake said that Government was committed to a six-day service from the Royal Mail (as flagged earlier). Speaking after Ofcom suggested letter delivery days could be cut to five, or even three, Hollinrake told Times Radio: \u201cThe Prime Minister been very clear on this, six-day delivery is really important for many people in this country, many of our citizens, but also for many of our businesses.\u201d Questioned over whether the six-day model for letters remained sustainable, Hollinrake said: \u201cRoyal Mail made significant profits in previous years. They\u2019ve had a couple of difficult years not least because of some of the industrial action they\u2019ve been subjected to. But nevertheless we are keen to see Royal Mail become more efficient.\u201d He added: \u201cI believe the Royal Mail can build a sustainable model. But that sustainable model must be based on a-six day service.\u201d The UK\u2019s Communication Workers Union says Ofcom\u2019s report into the Royal Mail\u2019s Universal Service Obligation is \u201ccompletely dead in the water\u201d. The CWU is planning to produce its own report on the future of Royal Mail: CWU general secretary Dave Ward says: \u201cThe response to the leaked information over the week showed that CWU members, the public and politicians are united against the deliberate, manufactured destruction of the postal service. \u201cIn the ongoing debate, Ofcom now have no credibility whatsoever, and their views are an irrelevance to the discussion that must take place between postal workers, businesses and customers. \u201cTo produce a report without any input whatsoever from frontline workers or their union is an attempt to railroad through the failed agenda of the previous Royal Mail management team. \u201cThe CWU will not stand for that. We will now launch an extensive engagement exercise and produce our own report on the future of Royal Mail, taking on board the views of our members and customers. \u201cThis will be a blueprint for a sustainable Royal Mail that can grow our economy and our communities. Royal Mail could save up to \u00a3650m if it delivered letters just three days a week and \u00a3200m by stopping Saturday deliveries, the communications regulator has said (see 6.52am). The watchdog said a reduction from six to five days a week would save \u00a3100m to \u00a3200m, and going down to three days \u00a3400m to \u00a3650m, my colleague Alex Lawson reports. In a much-anticipated review, Ofcom laid out a series of options for the future of the universal service obligation (USO), which requires Royal Mail to deliver nationwide, six days a week, for a fixed price. The regulator began gathering evidence to show how the future of the service may be reformed to better suit consumers\u2019 needs, amid a long-term decline in letter volumes and a surge in the number of parcels sent as online shopping has grown. It has conducted consumer research and modelled Royal Mail\u2019s finances in the review, and will seek views with a further update planned later this year. More here: Ofcom want to hear your views to its suggestion that Royal Mail could deliver letters slower, or less often. The regulator is inviting views from interested parties by 3 April 2024, to understand the potential impact on people and businesses. This includes vulnerable people, those in rural and remote areas of the UK\u2019s nations, as well as large organisations who use bulk mail services. Ofcom will hold events around the country to discuss the evidence and options, and after considering feedback it will provide an update in the summer. Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom\u2019s chief executive, says: \u201cPostal workers are part of the fabric of our society and are critical to communities up and down the country. But we\u2019re sending half as many letters as we did in 2011, and receiving many more parcels. The universal service hasn\u2019t changed since then, it\u2019s getting out of date and will become unsustainable if we don\u2019t take action. \u201cSo we\u2019ve set out options for reform so there can be a national discussion about the future of universal post. In the meantime, we\u2019re making sure prices will remain affordable by capping the price of Second Class stamps.\u201d Ofcom argues that most people\u2019s needs could still be met if Royal Mail delivered letters less often. Having conducted market research, it says: Nine in 10 people (88%) say reliability is important for letter deliveries, compared to 58% for delivery on Saturdays (down from 63% in 2020).[7] Most participants in our research were also open to reducing some services and standards \u2013 particularly for letters \u2013 in the interests of keeping prices down and only paying for what was required. Similarly, there was strong acknowledgement that most letters were not urgent, but people still needed to have a faster service available for the occasional urgent items, even if that meant paying a premium for it. What about a possible subsidy for Royal Mail, as some other countries provide? Ofcom reckons it\u2019s preferable to change the specification of the universal service, rather than using taxpayer funds to maintain the existing levels of service and products. Ultimately this is a decision for Government, it adds. Ofcom is also not proposing downgrading Royal Mail\u2019s delivery targets \u2013 saying this is not an option for reform. It adds: In fact, it will be important to consider whether additional safeguards are necessary to ensure people\u2019s needs are fully met. Any changes must improve existing levels of reliability. Ofcom estimates that Royal Mail could achieve a net cost saving of \u00a3100m-\u00a3200m if letter deliveries were reduced to five days; and \u00a3400m-\u00a3650m if reduced to three days. If the large majority of letters were delivered within three days, it could achieve net cost savings of \u00a3150m-\u00a3650m, the regulator adds. NEWSFLASH: Ofcom is calling for the UK\u2019s universal postal service to modernise, as it publishes its review of Royal Mail\u2019s universal service obligation (see opening post). The regulator is inviting views on a range of options for redesigning the universal postal service to secure its future, while ensuring it reflects the way people use it. Ofcom points out that letter volumes have halved since 2011. And it says options for reform include changing letter delivery speed or the number of delivery days, as other countries have done, but not downgrading delivery targets. That could include cutting letter deliveries to just three days a week! Ofcom says it is proposing two primary options: Making changes to existing First and Second Class and business products so that most letters are delivered through a service taking up to three days or longer, with a next-day service still available for any urgent letters. Reducing the number of letter delivery days in the service from six to five or three. This would require Government and Parliament to change primary legislation. Ofcom does not have the power to scrap Saturday letter deliveries, as the six-days-a-week service is part of the universal service requirement stipulated by law under the Postal Services Act 2011. Changing the obligation would require primary legislation, and a vote by MPs in the Commons. Ahead of Ofcom\u2019s announcement, my colleague Alex Lawson has examined how other countries run their own postal operations: The chair of Royal Mail\u2019s parent company says its universal service \u201cneeds help to survive\u201d. Keith Williams, chairman of International Distributions Services, argues against \u201cnostalgia for a bygone era\u201d when assessing the future of Royal Mail. Writing in The Times this morning, Williams says there needs to be an \u201chonest conversation\u201d about how to protect the one-price-goes-anywhere postal service. He says: The number of letters we deliver has fallen from 20 billion to 7 billion. We only deliver about four letters per address, per week. This means we have to walk more than three times as far to deliver the same number of letters as we did before, increasing the cost per letter of each delivery. Williams warns that Royal Mail is currently \u201cstuck in a vicious spiral\u201d \u2013 without reform of the regulatory system, or a subsidy \u2013 leading to \u201cheavy losses and an unsustainable service\u201d. And on the possibility of Saturday letter deliveries being scrapped, Williams says there are other options\u2026 He says: There has been a lot of discussion about dropping letter deliveries on a Saturday, while retaining daily parcel deliveries, to tackle the problem of declining letter volumes and Royal Mail\u2019s material financial losses. The truth is there are a range of other options, including ways we can ensure a reliable service for time-critical mail such as hospital appointments and weekly magazines. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial market and the world economy. Royal Mail\u2019s future is in the spotlight today, with UK communications regulator Ofcom expected to release the findings of its review into its universal service obligation (USO). Currently, Royal Mail is legally obliged to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week, for a fixed price, something the postal operator insists is unaffordable. Ofcom\u2019s review will outline various options for the future of the USO, reflecting changes in the postal market as letter volumes fall, and parcel demand rises thanks to online shopping. Possible changes to the legal requirements of the British postal service could include changing its first and second class delivery targets (which it has strugggled to hit), or higher stamp prices. It\u2019s also possible Ofcom could recomment changing the current six-day USO, paving the way for the axing of letter deliveries on a Saturday. That should please Royal Mail\u2019s parent company, International Distributions Services, which warned last week that the six-day USO was \u2018simply not sustainable\u2018. But that would be controversial, not least with prime minister Rishi Sunak. Earlier this week, Sunak\u2019s spokesman said the PM \u201cwill not countenance\u201d scrapping postal deliveries on Saturday, as they provide \u201cflexibility and convenience\u201d for customers and are \u201cimportant for businesses and particularly publishers\u201d. Ofcom itself has said its review will set out evidence and options on \u201chow the universal postal service might need to evolve to more closely meet consumer needs\u201d. They added: \u201cWe will be inviting views on this, not consulting on specific proposals. \u201cIt would ultimately be for the UK government and parliament to determine whether any changes are needed to the minimum requirements of the universal service.\u201d The agenda 7am: Ofcom expected to publish its review into the Royal Mail\u2019s universal service 9am GMT: Eurozone flash PMI report into company growth in January 9.30am GMT: UK flash PMI report into company growth in January 11am GMT: CBI industrial trends survey of UK manufacturing"

            "title": "Retail slump raises spectre of recession as Hunt looks more Truss-like by the day",
            "date": "2024-01-19T09:27:02Z",
            "content": "The UK economy was probably in recession during the second half of 2023 if the latest retail sales figures were anything to go by. A surprise 3.2% slump in the level of sales in Great Britain during December appeared to show the cost of living crisis was continuing to hurt household finances despite a rise in wages that gave many consumers a bit more spending power. It will be a mild technical recession should the gross domestic product readings for the third and fourth quarters of last year prove to be negative when the latest data is released next month. But the R-word alone would undermine Jeremy Hunt\u2019s claims that the UK is on the right track and make his assertions that tax cuts are the main route out of stagnation look more Truss-like by the day. Hunt was probably unaware when he made his comment in Switzerland on Thursday of the dire situation on the high street (shops make most of their profits in the \u201cgolden quarter\u201d of October to December) after City analysts forecast only a 0.5% month-on-month drop. The downturn reported by the Office for National Statistics was unexpected after most of the big supermarket chains reported a healthy festive season and many large high street retailers \u2013 Next, for instance \u2013 said the same. Only the luxury brands such as Burberry were supposed to be having problems shifting their gear in the last month of the year. Analysts expected sales to remain largely steady after a 1.4% increase in November that was tied to Black Friday and forecast a small uplift in shoppers looking for pre-Christmas bargains. Now it seems those November sales simply stole from December, and rocketing prices, which have pushed up inflation by more than 16% over two years, took their toll. Food sales were down, along with sales of clothing and fuel. It was as if everyone stayed at home and did not drive anywhere in December, or at least not as much as they had for several years. Alex Kerr, an economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said Friday\u2019s figures would subtract about 0.15 percentage points from economic growth in December, \u201cwhich increases the chances the economy may have ended 2023 in the mildest of mild recessions\u201d. Looking back further, the ONS said a 3.4% annual fall in the volume of sales in 2022 was compounded by a further 2.8% drop in 2023. \u201cThis put annual sales volumes at their lowest level since before the pandemic in 2018,\u201d it said. Kerr said: \u201cLooking ahead, some of the drag from higher interest rates on existing mortgage holders may result in a further modest decline in real consumer spending in the first quarter of 2024. \u201cBut interest rate cuts from June and the further boost to real household incomes from falling inflation will support a recovery in real consumer spending in the second half of this year.\u201d The figures will turn up the heat on Hunt to address rising business rates, which were cut during the coronavirus pandemic but will rise again in April. The British Retail Consortium, which represents most of the large shop chains, said earlier this week that retailers would face a number of extra costs this year that it fears could increase the already rising level of insolvencies. Ominously, it said: \u201cWith an election in the next 12 months, it is time political parties understand the value of retail to the wider economy and set out a clear and cohesive plan for retail in their manifestos.\u201d"

            "content": "The welcome but belated recognition by MPs of the terrible injustice done to subpostmasters needs reflection after more urgent issues are addressed (Horizon scandal: hundreds of post office operators to have convictions quashed, 10 January). We should accept that failures will happen, but our political institutions are poorly suited to handling this inevitability. Instead, trivial party point-scoring takes precedence over serious scrutiny. Two decades ago, this resulted in Labour boasting of the speed with which it was introducing Horizon. On 15 February 2001, the then competitiveness minister, Alan Johnson, told the Commons: \u201cHorizon is not outdated technology. We are wiring up 40,000 serving positions at 18,500 post offices at a rate of 300 a week. It has been extremely successful \u2026 Number of post offices computerised under the previous government \u2013 nil. Number of post office computerised under this government so far \u2013 17,560.\u201d On 24 March 2004, the then secretary of state for trade and industry, Patricia Hewitt, said: \u201cWe decided that there was no point in rescuing that absurd out-of-date Conservative proposition for a benefit payment card. Instead, we invested the best part of \u00a3500m in the Horizon platform ... Thanks to the investment and the decisions that we have made, the Horizon platform and the automation of the post offices have now modernised post offices.\u201d These claims were not made because Johnson and Hewitt were bad people or mendacious. Speed of progress was mistaken for effectiveness and, as today\u2019s politicians, they worked in a culture in which transparency and accountability for public contracts was absent. Mike Sheaff Plymouth \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff (A TV drama is finally triggering action for Post Office victims. Why did it take so long?, 8 January) and your editorial (8 January) make valid points in relation to the underlying issues in the scandal. What seems to have been missing from the commentaries is an exploration of the wider context of new computer systems in the 1990s. A lot of organisations were switching to large-scale computer systems during this decade and many of them were not fit for purpose. Wessex Health Authority and the London Stock Exchange come to mind. Unfortunately, the scapegoating nature of our society makes it difficult for individuals to own up to mistakes and put their reputations and jobs on the line. The public sector department I worked in had a similar problem, introducing a complex system that had already failed in a neighbouring local authority. Due diligence often gave way to glib sales pitches and the political desire to be seen to be ahead of the game. Fortunately, common sense prevailed in our case because of management\u2019s willingness to listen and learn, and a corporate approach was adopted with the in-house development of a replacement system, which was publicised as an updated version of the original rather than a completely new system. Reputations and jobs saved, as well as a much-improved service. Name and address supplied \u2022 One aspect of this appalling saga that deserves highlighting is the fact that these were private prosecutions. Having spent a career working within the criminal justice system, I recognise that alleged offences investigated by the police and prosecuted independently by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) are far from immune to miscarriages of justice. But when the powerful claim to be financially wronged and can then investigate and prosecute ordinary people in the criminal courts with no equality of arms, the chances of a miscarriage increase significantly. Only the mega wealthy and organisations with deep pockets can afford private prosecutions. They should be scrapped, and the police and CPS (Serious Fraud Office, etc) properly resourced to investigate alleged fraud. The police investigation into individuals within the Post Office and Fujitsu and their lawyers must leave no stone unturned. All prosecutors, public and private, including the Post Office, have clear duties to disclose materials to the defence which undermine their case. Did that happen here? Alan Fox Northop Hall, Flintshire \u2022 Paula Vennells is indeed heavily implicated in the Post Office scandal (Former Post Office chief hands back CBE as Horizon scandal intensifies, 9 January), but it is worth noting that the first prosecutions of postmasters occurred long before she joined the Post Office, and the aggressive denials of wrongdoing continued well after she had left. This is a case of corporate and government lies and corruption, and should uncover guilty people all the way from Fujitsu and the cover-up of the faults in the Horizon system, through to the managers and auditors who failed to investigate any of the software problems reported by hundreds of users, the directors and CEOs of the Post Office who continued to take, collectively, huge sums from their defenceless staff, and the government officials and MPs who turned a blind eye to the devastating consequences for their constituents. It\u2019s not easy to feel sorry for Vennells, but so far she seems to have been the only person to have suffered any consequences at all for a scandal which was perpetrated by very many people over many years. Hilary Lang Frome, Somerset \u2022 If any good can come out of the Post Office/Horizon IT scandal, besides the exoneration of and compensation to the many victims, it will be in the end of \u201cnew managerialism\u201d. This system, inspired by neoliberalism (Thatcher et al), sees individuals as in need of management, surveillance and control. However, this performance management has clearly shown itself to have devastating consequences. The collective stories of the many victims can lead to new cultural narratives with the potential to reform and recuperate the resources currently ploughed into surveillance and control in so many of our public and private organisations. David White Reading \u2022 Jobs, homes, savings and reputations lost over more than a decade. People wrongly detained and worse. Unaffordable legal costs. Crucial evidence missing. Unfulfilled assurances to both parliament and an independent investigation. Hundreds still waiting for proper compensation and justice. Many have died before getting either. I look forward to the next ITV series, about the Windrush victims (Letters, 9 January). John Rhodes London \u2022 It has taken an ITV drama, watched by 9 million people to get government action on the Post Office scandal. This illustrates the power of drama to engage public opinion. It also indicates that nothing is as effective in galvanising politicians as embarrassment.

            "date": "2024-01-26T17:51:07Z",
            "content": "Israeli officials have accused the international court of justice of antisemitic bias and expressed dismay that a South African case alleging that the war in Gaza amounts to genocide was not thrown out altogether, after the court issued an emergency interim ruling. The ruling on Friday said Israel must take \u201call measures in its power\u201d to prevent acts of genocide in the Gaza Strip but stopped short of calling for a full ceasefire. It ordered six so-called provisional measures to be implemented to protect Palestinians, including orders for Israel to prevent death and destruction and enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian aid to the strip\u2019s trapped population. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in response that his country was committed to upholding international law as well as defending its people. \u201cThe vile attempt to deny Israel this fundamental right [to self-defence] is blatant discrimination against the Jewish state and it was justly rejected,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe charge of genocide levelled against Israel is not only false, it\u2019s outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it.\u201d While Israel is often dismissive of the UN, alleging that the international organisation is biased against it, the country took the ICJ case very seriously, sending a robust legal team to The Hague that argued it had a right to defend itself after the 7 October Hamas attack. Yoav Gallant, Israel\u2019s defence minister \u2013 who was cited by the court president for calling Palestinians \u201chuman animals\u201d at the start of the Israeli offensive \u2013 said: \u201cThe international court of justice went above and beyond when it granted South Africa\u2019s antisemitic request to discuss the claim of genocide in Gaza, and now refuses to reject the petition outright.\u201d Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel\u2019s far-right national security minister, tweeted: \u201cThis court does not seek justice but rather the persecution of the Jewish people. Decisions that endanger the continued existence of the state of Israel must not be listened to. And we must continue defeating the enemy until complete victory.\u201d ICJ decisions are binding but the court has no power to enforce them. Recent interim rulings related to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and Myanmar\u2019s treatment of the Rohingya people. The full investigation into Israel\u2019s conduct is likely to take years. While Palestinians expressed disappointment that the panel of 17 judges did not issue a binding order to stop the hostilities in the three-month-old war, the ruling still carries significant legal ramifications that could amplify international political pressure on Israel. Hamas, the militant group that seized control of Gaza in 2007 and killed 1,140 people in its unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October, welcomed the ruling. The senior official Sami Abu Zuhri said on Friday: \u201cThe international court of justice ruling is an important development that contributes to isolating the occupation [Israel] and exposing its crimes in Gaza. We call for compelling the occupation to implement the court\u2019s decisions.\u201d The West Bank-based Palestinian foreign minister, Riyad al-Maliki, said in a video statement that the ICJ order was \u201can important reminder that no state is above the law\u201d, adding that the ruling \u201cshould serve as a wake-up call for Israel and actors who enabled its entrenched impunity\u201d. Daniel Machover, a co-founder of Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights, called the ruling \u201cmassive and historic\u201d. He said: \u201cThe judges fell at the last hurdle by not ordering a ceasefire, since stopping further loss of life was the combined aim of the South African application \u2026 the court could have ordered Israel to use policing methods to protect from attack. \u201cHowever, there has now been an authoritative international ruling that there is a plausible risk of genocide in Gaza and states have a legal obligation now to act to prevent that. Those measures could include things like halting arms sales.\u201d South Africa said the decision amounted to a ceasefire in all but name. \u201cIsrael will have to halt fighting in the besieged Gaza Strip if it wants to adhere to the orders of the international court of justice,\u201d Naledi Pandor, the South African minister of international relations, said after the ruling. \u201cHow do you provide aid and water without a ceasefire? If you read the order, by implication a ceasefire must happen,\u201d she told reporters on the steps of the seat of the court in The Hague. South Africa filed a case against Israel before the court in December alleging that it was in breach of the UN\u2019s genocide convention, signed in 1948 in response to the Holocaust. While acknowledging the particular gravity of bringing genocide charges against the Jewish state, founded in the aftermath of the second world war, Pretoria\u2019s legal team said South Africa\u2019s own history of apartheid was a key factor in the decision to file the case. Lawyers for South Africa argued that the devastating loss of life in the Israeli campaign \u2013 now at about 26,000 people \u2013 as well as the forced displacement of 85% of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million-strong population and the denial of adequate healthcare, food and water, amounted to the \u201cdestruction of Palestinian life\u201d."

            "date": "2024-01-25T18:17:49Z",
            "content": "The mother of a Nottingham stabbing victim said \u201ctrue justice has not been served\u201d after the killer was sentenced to indefinite detention in a high-security hospital. Emma Webber, the mother of 19-year-old Barnaby Webber who was killed alongside fellow student Grace O\u2019Malley-Kumar in the violent attacks that left three people dead last year, also said the assistant chief constable of Nottinghamshire police had \u201cblood on his hands\u201d over the force\u2019s failure to arrest the killer in the months before the killings. \u201cWe as a devastated family have been let down by multiple agency failings and ineffectiveness,\u201d she said, adding that they had been \u201crushed, hastened and railroaded\u201d into accepting Valdo Calocane\u2019s manslaughter pleas. Calocane, 32, who goes by the name Adam Mendes, denied murdering Webber, O\u2019Malley-Kumar, 19, and Ian Coates, a 65-year-old school caretaker, but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. He also admitted the attempted murder of three other people who he ran over in a van. After the crown accepted his pleas, Calocane was sentenced at Nottingham crown court on Thursday. Mr Justice Turner told Calocane: \u201cYou committed a series of atrocities in this city which ended the lives of three innocent people. Your sickening crimes both shocked the nation and wrecked the lives of your surviving victims and the families of them all.\u201d The judge said Calocane would \u201cvery probably\u201d be detained for the rest of his life after \u201cdeliberately and mercilessly\u201d stabbing his victims. He said Calocane\u2019s condition was \u201cresistant to treatment\u201d and could not be cured, and he \u201cremained dangerous\u201d. Speaking outside court after sentencing concluded, the victims\u2019 families expressed anger that Calocane had not been prosecuted for murder. \u201cThe premeditated planning, the collection of lethal weapons, hiding in the shadows and the brutality of attacks are of an individual who knew exactly what he was doing. He knew entirely that it was wrong but he did it anyway,\u201d said Webber. It was revealed this week that a warrant for Calocane\u2019s arrest was outstanding at the time of the attacks, after he failed to appear in court nine months earlier for an alleged assault of a police officer while he was being sectioned. Webber said: \u201cTo the assistant chief constable, Rob Griffin, I say you have blood on your hands. If you had just done your job properly, there\u2019s a very good chance my beautiful boy would be alive today.\u201d Griffin said he had \u201cpersonally reviewed this matter\u201d and concluded the force \u201cshould have done more to arrest him\u201d. \u201cIn my opinion it is highly unlikely that he would have received a custodial sentence for the alleged assault,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, an arrest may have triggered a route back into mental health services, but as we have seen from his previous encounters with those services, it seems unlikely that he would have engaged in this process.\u201d James Coates, the son of Ian Coates, said Calocane had \u201cmade a mockery of the system\u201d. \u201cIf this man was not stopped when he was this could have been one of the most catastrophic attacks this country has ever seen,\u201d he said. \u201cThis man is a killer. Murder was the only thing he cared about and he fulfilled this in horrific fashion. All we can do is hope in due course some sort of justice is served.\u201d Sanjoy Kumar, the father of O\u2019Malley-Kumar, said the family had never questioned Calocane\u2019s diagnosis, but the \u201cmissed opportunities\u201d to divert his actions would \u201cforever play on our minds\u201d. \u201cWe will look for answers regarding missed opportunities to intervene and prevent this horrendous crime,\u201d he said. Janine McKinney, of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said the expert medical evidence was \u201coverwhelming\u201d and concluded Calocane\u2019s actions \u201cwere substantially impaired\u201d by psychosis caused by his paranoid schizophrenia. This gave him a legal right to put forward a partial defence to murder and offer manslaughter pleas, which the CPS accepted \u201cafter very careful analysis\u201d of evidence, she said. \u201cThe prosecution\u2019s case has been that Calocane was criminally responsible for what he did, as well as being impaired by his mental health.\u201d The prime minister declined to say whether he would order a public inquiry into the matter, while saying it was an \u201cabsolutely awful case\u201d. Speaking to reporters in Yorkshire, Rishi Sunak said it was right Calocane would \u201cspend very probably the rest of his life\u201d in a high-security hospital, adding: \u201cI also think it is important that all the relevant agencies look back to ensure that all reasonable steps that could have been taken were taken and if there are any lessons to be learned that we do so.\u201d Calocane, who studied mechanical engineering at Nottingham University, stabbed O\u2019Malley-Kumar and Webber in the early hours of 13 June last year when they were walking home from a night out. He went on to stab Coates, who was driving to work, before stealing his van and driving it into pedestrians in the city centre. Wayne Birkett, Marcin Gawronski and Sharon Miller sustained serious injuries but survived. CCTV footage released by police showed officers tracking down Calocane in the van minutes later and using a stun gun on him as he sat in the driver\u2019s seat before arresting him. There was an outpouring of grief across Nottingham after the attacks, with thousands of people attending vigils at Nottingham University and in the city centre to pay tribute to the victims. Ifti Majid, the chief executive of Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS foundation trust, which treated Calocane between May 2020 and September 2022, said it had \u201crobustly reviewed\u201d how it handled his case, adding that staff \u201calways aim to care for people in the least restrictive way\u201d. Calocane was sectioned four times before the killings. After he was discharged from hospital in 2022, several attempts were made to contact him but no response was received. Webber concluded: \u201cThere is so much more to say and clearly serious questions regarding this case and events leading up to this monster being out in society.\u201d With her voice breaking, she added: \u201cFor today, our darling son, his dear friend Grace and a wonderfully kind grandfather, Ian, have been stolen from us forever and let down by the very system that should have been protecting them.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-23T13:32:04Z",
            "content": "This week, the long-running public inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal will take evidence on the case of Bill Quarm, a father of five who ran a post office in Scotland\u2019s Outer Hebrides. Quarm did not live to see his conviction quashed last year, after pleading guilty to a charge of embezzlement in 2010 to avoid a prison sentence, but his widow, Anne, has described the shame that overwhelmed her husband in the aftermath of his prosecution. While about 900 post office workers across the UK were prosecuted on the basis of evidence from the faulty digital accounting system, estimates of those affected in Scotland have fluctuated between 54 and 100. But what is certain is that only 17 have thus far come forward seeking review of their convictions. MSPs supporting post office operators are raising serious concerns about the more complicated and daunting route to justice facing Horizon victims in Scotland. Indeed, Calum Greenhow, chief executive of the National Federation of SubPostmasters and a post office operator for 22 years in the village of West Linton, south of Edinburgh, has accused Scotland\u2019s chief prosecutor of \u201cplacing further obstacles in the road to justice\u201d. In Scotland, the cases were investigated by the Post Office but they were prosecuted by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS), the state prosecutor in Scotland, in contrast to England and Wales where the Post Office pursued the vast majority of cases directly. Dorothy Bain, the lord advocate who heads the COPFS, gave a statement to the Scottish parliament last week in which she raised the possibility that \u201cnot every case in which Horizon evidence is present will represent a miscarriage of justice\u201d \u2013 setting her at odds with the first minister, Humza Youaf, who has said his government would work with UK counterparts to adopt Rishi Sunak\u2019s pledge of blanket exoneration. Greenhow said: \u201cDown south, it looks like the judiciary is willing to work with the prime minister to have these convictions quashed irrespective of whether the individuals have come forward or not. But the lord advocate have argued that due process must be followed, with prosecutors coming to the appeal court to explain why they are no longer relying on a conviction. \u201cI understand Bain saying that the court can\u2019t have a kneejerk reaction, but her tone and language were not empathetic to what people have endured over decades.\u201d Michael Marra MSP, who hosted a group of post office operators at Holyrood last summer, believes there are a variety of reasons why Scottish Horizon victims may not have come forward. He said: \u201cSome have moved on, some are too traumatised by their experience to return to it, and there is an ongoing lack of trust with the post office.\u201d He added: \u201cThe Lord advocate\u2019s statement to parliament last week added further uncertainty to the process, at points contradicting what the first minister had previously said. People feel they are being asked to re-engage with an arduous process but serious doubts remain as to whether the outcome will be any different.\u201d In September 2020, the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission, which continues to encourage potential victims of injustice to come forward, wrote to 73 individuals who may have been wrongly convicted by Horizon evidence, undertaking extensive follow-ups given the difficulties of locating those involved in what are largely historic cases. Since then, 17 individuals have sought s review of their cases, resulting in seven referrals to the high court, four of which have resulted in convictions being overturned. Last week, Bain said the Crown Office had been reviewing about 100 potential Horizon cases, which had since been reduced to 54. The SNP MSP Michelle Thomson last week asked Bain what consideration had been given to how the potential for retraumatisation could act as a barrier to some people applying for a review. Bain said this was a legitimate point. Thomson also pointed to the complex and time-consuming nature of claim forms that applicants who already feel poorly served by the legal establishment are expected to fill out. She asked: \u201cAre different treatment and timescales in Scotland really sustainable?\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-08T14:17:01Z",
            "content": "The ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office has brought the Post Office scandal back under the spotlight and also drawn attention to how justice can be delivered to those affected. Here the Guardian outlines some of the remedies suggested by campaigners and experts: 1) Quash all convictions relating to the Horizon IT system The Horizon compensation advisory board, an independent body set up to oversee compensation related to the Post Office scandal, has renewed its call for all Post Office-driven convictions in the relevant period to be collectively overturned. The board\u2019s chair, Prof Chris Hodges, wrote last month to the lord chancellor, Alex Chalk, advising such an approach and, on Monday, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that such an outcome could be achieved through an act of parliament. Proponents believe that the alternative, of individuals having to go through the Criminal Cases Review Commission, is too cumbersome given the magnitude of the scandal. Despite the number of unsafe convictions numbering more than 700, only 93 people have had their convictions quashed to date. Some victims and lawyers have expressed concern that such an approach could lead to guilty people also being exonerated and amount to political interference in the judicial system. In his letter to Chalk, Hodges said \u201cit would be worth acquitting a few guilty people (who have already been punished) in order to deliver justice to the majority\u201d. He has also suggested the judiciary would not mind given the unique circumstances. 2) Give compensation to all affected Despite three different compensation schemes that have been set up since the scandal came to light, many of those affected have not been compensated, prompting criticism of the Post Office and government. Last November, ministers promised that every branch owner-operator whose wrongful conviction had been overturned would receive \u00a3600,000 in compensation from the government but less has been paid out than expected because fewer people than anticipated have brought and won appeals. Hodges, emeritus professor of justice systems at Oxford University, told the BBC\u2019s Today programme that everyone entitled should receive compensation but it was dependent on all convictions being quashed and both of those things should be possible with \u201cpeople having to do as little as possible\u201d. 3) Prosecute those to blame As further damning evidence has emerged from the public inquiry into the scandal, it has added to frustration that no one has yet been held accountable. When overturning 39 convictions at the court of appeal in 2021, Lord Justice Holroyde said the Post Office, which brought the prosecutions itself, \u201cknew that there were serious issues about the reliability of Horizon\u201d and that there were failures of investigation and disclosure so egregious as to constitute \u201can affront to the conscience of the court\u201d. The Metropolitan police have been investigating for years two former experts at Horizon supplier Fujitsu, who were witnesses in the trials of Post Office workers, on suspicion of perjury and perverting the course of justice. On Friday, in the wake of the screening of Mr Bates vs the Post Office, police confirmed for the first time that it was also investigating the Post Office. Kevan Jones MP, who sits on the Horizon compensation advisory board, told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain that evidence heard in public suggested \u201cumpteen charges \u2026 could be laid against a number of individuals\u201d. 4) Strip Paula Vennells of her CBE When Vennells, the former Post Office chief executive, left her role after seven years in 2019, she had made \u00a35m and been awarded a CBE for \u201cservices to the Post Office and to charity\u201d. Just 10 months later, the Post Office reached a settlement with 555 workers over the problems with the Fujitsu-developed IT system, admitting it \u201cgot things wrong\u201d. A petition calling for her to lose her CBE has attracted more than 1m signatures and, on Monday, Rishi Sunak\u2019s spokesperson said the prime minister would \u201cstrongly support\u201d the honours forfeiture committee if it decided to look at revoking her honour."

            "content": "The leader of Reform UK has accused the Conservatives of trying to mimic his policies by planning a controversial \u201cBritish homes for British workers\u201d scheme, as the rightwing populist party edges higher in the polls. Both parties will go into the next general election with the same promise to give British people priority access to social homes, it has emerged. As Reform hit 13% for the first time in a national poll, its leader, Richard Tice, chided the Conservatives for trying to copy the rightwing party after the Guardian revealed the government is considering a plan to give UK citizens higher priority for social housing. Officials will launch a consultation in the coming weeks into how they can give British citizens faster access to social housing, a move designed in part to bolster the prime minister\u2019s reputation for being tough on immigration. Reform UK said it was planning to campaign on a similar policy that would \u201cprioritise local people\u201d. The policy will state that, in parts of the UK, almost half of all lead tenants in social housing were born overseas. It adds: \u201cThose who have paid into the system for years must come first. Foreign nationals must go to the back of the queue. Not the front.\u201d Tice said: \u201cThe Tories are desperately trying to steal our clothes, whether we are wearing them or not.\u201d The Conservatives\u2019 move has prompted anger from some in government, who warn it could further boost support for Reform. The latest government figures show that 90% of the lead tenants in social housing are British citizens. In certain areas, however, that figure is much lower. Olivia Blake, a Labour MP and co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on migration, described the government\u2019s plans as \u201cvile scapegoating of some of our most vulnerable communities in a desperate bid to hold on to power. The solution to the housing crisis is to build social housing.\u201d Helen Morgan, the Liberal Democrat housing spokesperson, said: \u201cThe Conservative party are stealing straight from the Nigel Farage playbook. \u201cThis policy is not just totally unworkable and baseless, it risks playing into the hands of the far right and those who want to divide our communities. \u201cInstead of sowing the seeds of division to distract from their own failures, the government should be focusing on building the affordable and social homes the country needs.\u201d Rules around who can access social housing are already strict. According to guidance set out by Westminster, local authorities should give first priority to people who are homeless, moving from another social home, living in squalid or cramped conditions, or who have medical reasons to need one. Foreign citizens are not allowed to apply for social housing unless they have been granted indefinite leave to remain, meaning they are permanently settled in the UK. Those seeking asylum are treated like any other foreign citizen: they only qualify if their refugee status is approved and they are granted settled status. In the final years of Gordon Brown\u2019s government, Labour added a new rule: if a council has to choose between two families of roughly equal need, it could take into account how long they have lived in the area and what local connections they have. The scheme was billed by critics as \u201cBritish homes for British workers\u201d, though that was not a term Labour ministers used. Those who were in charge of implementing Brown\u2019s policy said they maintained the guidance stipulating that need should trump local connections, and that they built significantly more social homes than the current government. If the Tories did want to change the guidance, the simplest way would be to exclude those with refugee status, or even all those with indefinite leave to remain, from accessing social homes. The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said he did not want to get drawn into \u201cspeculation\u201d, but added: \u201cIt\u2019s important that we have a policy that is fair for everyone. We want to build more homes and boost social housing supply and obviously we keep any policies under review.\u201d A YouGov poll on voting intention for the Times has put seven points between the Tories, on 20%, and Reform UK, on 13%. Will Jennings, a professor of public policy at the University of Southampton, said it was not clear whether the polls were overstating the support for Reform UK but it was unquestionable that the party was a growing threat to the Conservatives. \u201cThat\u2019s why they [the Conservatives] are doubling down on issues like migration and small boats because that\u2019s where they currently see a real existential threat to their vote,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2024-01-13T19:00:07Z",
            "content": "Plans to overhaul the growing \u201ccottage industry\u201d of private prosecutions are already being urgently examined by ministers in the wake of the Post Office scandal, including measures that could see untrustworthy bodies barred from pursuing them. Labour is also understood to be drawing up its own reform package this weekend after the outcry prompted by the Post Office\u2019s use of private prosecutions against more than 700 post office subpostmasters. It means that there is growing scope for a cross-party commitment to complete any reforms after the election. A new inspection regime for private prosecutors, a binding code of standards and the creation of a new power to strip an organisation of its power to conduct them are all being discussed in Whitehall. It follows one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British history, as subpostmasters were imprisoned, vilified and left bankrupt by incorrect prosecutions based on the Post Office\u2019s unreliable Horizon accounting system. Senior Tories said on Saturday night it was now \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d the reforms were needed. The government has already taken the unprecedented step of announcing a plan for the mass exoneration of subpostmasters in England and Wales caught up in the scandal, which captured the public\u2019s attention after the ITV dramatisation Mr Bates vs the Post Office. Ministers committed to look at reforms after the extraordinary saga, and a significant overhaul of private prosecutions is now being contemplated. It is understood that Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, has long held reservations about their use. It has yet to be decided whether immediate changes will be possible or whether the Law Commission will be given the task of holding an official review, likely to report after the election. Ministers are particularly concerned that because the Post Office saw itself as both the victim of a crime and the prosecutor, it lacked the same incentive to disclose all relevant material to those it was pursuing. The reforms now being considered were drawn up by the justice select committee in 2020, but rejected. Bob Neill, its Tory chair, said it was now clear they should be adopted. \u201cThese reforms are all the more important now because it seems absolutely clear from all that we\u2019ve learned about the Post Office saga that there was a gross failure, in both independence and objectivity, in the handling of these prosecutions,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThat\u2019s particularly clear in the systemic and absolutely lamentable failure to disclose relevant material. To make sure that is not repeated, we think it\u2019s critical now that the government does implement these recommendations to ensure the same standards are applied as you\u2019d expect from a public prosecutor. \u201cThat should be backed up by a power to permit the removal of the right to prosecute from organisations who are found not to come up to that standard. That seems to be the only way that we can now guarantee any public confidence in private prosecutions.\u201dThere have also been demands to reform laws that presume a computer system is reliable unless proved otherwise \u2013 another element that contributed to the prosecution of subpostmasters. However, Whitehall officials believe that the reliability of the Fujitsu-developed Horizon system at the heart of the Post Office scandal could be challenged in court without the need to change the law. It comes amid growing concerns about the proliferation of private prosecutions in the past 15 years, with some law firms now specialising in pursuing them. While many private prosecutions are seen as positive, there is growing pressure to address a lack of regulation. Some bodies have statutory powers to prosecute, such as the Civil Aviation Authority and the Food Standards Agency. However, any individual, private company or charity can pursue a private prosecution under the 1985 Prosecution of Offences Act, by first securing permission from a magistrates court. Senior lawyers are also calling for action. Writing for the Observer, Sam Townend KC, chair of the Bar Council, said it was \u201cinevitable that those bringing private prosecutions have some sort of a vested interest in the cases brought\u201d. He said that the justice select committee\u2019s reforms \u201cshould now be revisited\u201d. \u201cAt the very least, parliament should carefully consider introducing enhanced oversight, and possibly formal regulation, to help to ensure the power to prosecute is not abused,\u201d he writes. Jonathan Rogers, associate professor in criminal justice at Cambridge University, also supported an inspection regime for private prosecutions, adding that they should not simply be abolished, as many served a positive purpose. \u201cWe are very sure that private prosecutions have gone sharply up over the past 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cExact data over that period is not kept anywhere. But anecdotally, we can see that they\u2019ve massively gone up. \u201cYou now have law firms which offer specialisms in conducting private prosecutions, which was unheard of 15 years ago. \u201cIt is a cottage industry. But whether it\u2019s a bad thing, of course, really depends on how good their work is. When they do a good job, they are often filling a gap which has been left behind for several years by the police and CPS [Crown Prosecution Service].\u201d A Post Office spokesperson said: \u201cPost Office has had no special authority to bring private prosecutions. The right to bring a private criminal prosecution is available to both companies and individuals in England and Wales as a result of section 6 (1) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. \u201cPost Office has not undertaken any private prosecutions related to Horizon since 2015 and has no intention of doing so. In cases of suspected criminal activity, evidence is referred to the relevant law enforcement agency.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 17 January 2024. An earlier version said that large bodies which can bring \u201cprivate prosecutions\u201d include the Civil Aviation Authority and the Food Standards Agency. To clarify: these bodies are able to bring prosecutions under their statutory powers."

            "date": "2024-01-06T08:00:04Z",
            "content": "It was a week in which speculation that Nigel Farage would make a long-awaited return to frontline British politics reached a new level, before Reform UK\u2019s 2024 policy launch. In the event, dozens of journalists who trooped to a central London hotel on the off chance that the former Ukip leaderwould appear were disappointed. Farage, Reform\u2019s honorary president and its dominant shareholder, was not among the guests alongside the party\u2019s leader, Richard Tice, who mounted an attack on Labour and the Conservatives and dialled up his own anti-immigration rhetoric. It raised awkward questions for Tice, and led to further speculation about Farage\u2019s reluctance to fully commit to Reform. But polling before the event nonetheless confirmed that the populist party now presents a greater threat to the Conservatives than the Brexit party and Ukip in its heyday, according to experts. \u201cThey harm the Conservatives more now than Ukip did in 2015 because the post-Brexit Tories have a lot more \u2018Ukippy\u2019 voters \u2013 who they picked up in 2017 and 2019,\u201d said Robert Ford, a professor of political science at the University of Manchester who is one of Britain\u2019s foremost experts on the behaviour of British voters. Labour and the Liberal Democrats were less threatened by Reform for the same reason, he added. They have far fewer of those voters \u2013 inclined towards Brexit and often hostile to immigration \u2013 than they did in 2010-15. Reform now poses an even bigger threat in Tory seats because its predecessor, the Brexit party, did not stand candidates against sitting Conservative MPs in 2019 in return for commitments made by the then Conservative leader, Boris Johnson. \u201cNew Reform UK candidates will therefore offer an option to voters in those seats that wasn\u2019t there in 2019,\u201d said Ford. As a new political year dawns, Reform\u2019s growing presence is adding to Conservative MPs\u2019 anxiety, as their party continues to languish behind Labour, despite Rishi Sunak\u2019s efforts on Thursday to revive Tory fortunes by emphasising his commitment to tax cuts, immigration controls and management of the economy during a visit to the bellwether seat of Mansfield. YouGov polling released on 1 December put Labour on 45% (+1), the Conservatives on 22% of the vote (-3) and Reform UK on 10% (+1). While few, if any, commentators expect Reform to win any seats \u2013 the party\u2019s confirmation on Thursday that Farage would not stand in any constituency was taken as a hint that it shared this view \u2013 the party\u2019s polling of as much as 11% in recent surveys would be enough to decimate dozens of Conservative majorities and enhance the scale of a Labour general election win. Even before that point, it may play a key role in giving Sunak yet another byelection bloody nose in the upcoming contest in Wellingborough, where splits on the right could help Labour overturn an 18,540 majority. The Northamptonshire seat \u2013 up for grabs on the back of a recall petition triggered by the suspension of Peter Bone \u2013 is one where significant levels of deprivation and past support for Brexit may prove fertile ground for Reform. The party\u2019s Wellingborough candidate, Ben Habib, who is also the Reform deputy leader, said: \u201cThe key for us is to ensure that the Tory voters aren\u2019t so irritated and upset with the whole electoral landscape that they stay at home, and we can encourage them to recognise that what we stand for is actually what they voted for in the 2016 referendum.\u201d But the contest will also be a particular test for a party that has consistently underperformed in byelections, relative to its poll showing, and which is without the alternative springboard that European parliamentary elections provided for Ukip and the Brexit party. More broadly, however, those who are less convinced about Reform\u2019s potency include Michael Crick, author of the 2022 Farage biography One Party After Another, who cites the presence of an insurgent force on the right that stretches all the way back to James Goldsmith\u2019s Referendum party of the 1990s. Crick said: \u201cIn every general election, there\u2019s a sort of expectation that maybe Ukip, the Brexit party or whatever it is at that time is going to cause havoc for the Tories. They do cause problems, undoubtedly in each case, but it\u2019s never quite as bad as everybody says.\u201d But it would cause damage in other ways, he suggested, adding: \u201cThey will win over and attract money that might have gone to the Conservatives, from really rightwing donors, and you may well also find that quite a lot of Tory activists and officials end up voting or even working for Reform.\u201d The latter is already happening, with those on the Tory right complaining about the difficulties of stemming a steady stream of members defecting to Reform. \u201cConservative voters are on strike basically, and the last four byelections have seen 20,000 Conservative voters missing in each one,\u201d said David Campbell Bannerman, a former deputy leader of Ukip who defected back to the Tories in 2011 and later launched the Conservative Democratic Organisation (CDO) as a rightwing group lobbying for members\u2019 rights. That said, he also views the Reform vote as \u201csoft\u201d, arguing that many Conservative voters who are considering the insurgent party would return if Sunak was ousted. But another former Ukip MEP, Patrick O\u2019Flynn, argues that there is an anti-establishment mood that Reform could tap into in a different way. Like some other veterans of the populist tide which preceded Brexit, he also views the language used by Reform \u2013 railing against the supposed \u201csocialism\u201d of the Conservatives and Labour \u2013 as off the mark in terms of connecting with the public mood. Another key ingredient is also missing, of course. \u201cRichard Tice really deserves credit for resilience, leading the party through some infertile periods to a point where the Sunak tilt back towards Cameron-style liberal conservatism has opened up a big chunk of the electorate to Reform,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on the right, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a communicator as good or as seasoned as Nigel Farage.\u201d"

            "content": "\u201cA sinking ship\u201d was how Antonia, an administrator from Middleton, described Britain at the start of 2024. That assessment, while damning, isn\u2019t unusual, with \u201cbroken\u201d, \u201cmess\u201d and \u201cstruggling\u201d the top words used to describe the UK today. But Antonia, and her fellow focus group participants \u2013 former Conservative voters from the \u201cred wall\u201d seats of Heywood and Middleton, Great Grimsby and Dudley North \u2013 weren\u2019t planning on expressing their exasperation with the state of Britain by voting Labour. Instead, they were tempted by the successor to the Brexit party \u2013 Reform UK. Since October, Reform has enjoyed a steady rise in support, hitting 10% in some opinion polls. While unlikely to win seats of their own, by attracting former Tory voters Reform could play the role of spoiler. An analysis by the thinktank More in Common suggests that at present polling levels Reform could enable more than 30 additional Conservative losses. Given that potential to play an outsize role in the election, the focus group aimed to find out what was attracting voters to the shape-shifting party \u2013 and whether these voters would stick with them come election day. Unsurprisingly, immigration was high on their list. Jordan, a technician, felt the UK\u2019s \u201csoft touch\u201d attracted too many immigrants. Darron, a fraud prevention officer, expressed annoyance that people could no longer stay in the hotel where he got married because it is now used to house asylum seekers. Maria, a support worker, was worried after hearing about GP surgery funds being spent on translation rather than patients\u2019 medical care. Their frustration was compounded by a sense that politicians didn\u2019t care or even wanted higher immigration to keep wages low. Asked what they wanted to be done instead to reduce immigration, the group supported an Australian-style points system \u2013 which meant Britain could still attract the seasonal, NHS and care workers they all felt were needed. They seemed unaware or unconvinced that the government had introduced exactly that. Even so, immigration was not their top concern. For this group, as with almost every other, it was the cost of living that dominated; the fall in inflation was of little comfort as they still felt the pinch. Energy costs had become so bad that Dale, a train supervisor, and Steve, a pensioner, had taken to living as much as possible from their beds to reduce heating costs. Jordan worried at the end of almost every month whether his salary would last. There was real anger towards those profiting from misery. Jordan said: \u201cWhen you see the record-breaking profits [of energy companies] it\u2019s like a kick in the nuts.\u201d Darron fumed at \u201cmultinational corporations making billions and billions in profit and hiding their money offshore\u201d and Dale said the public suffer while politicians\u2019 \u201cmates are doing well\u201d. In fact, immigration aside, when this group talked about corporate greed, NHS underfunding or the PPE scandal, you could be forgiven for presuming this was in fact a group of hardcore Jeremy Corbyn supporters, rather than voters tempted to back the populist right. Their biggest dismay was with the UK\u2019s politicians. On Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, they were unsparing, questioning how someone \u201cworth a billion dollars\u201d could understand working people\u2019s concerns. Maria, a support worker, explained she had \u201cbroken ranks\u201d in 2019 to vote Tory but under Sunak the party weren\u2019t \u201clooking after ordinary working-class folk\u201d. They were similarly unimpressed by Sunak\u2019s Labour opponent. While the group expected a Labour victory this year, they dismissed Keir Starmer as \u201cmore of the same\u201d, a \u201cRed Tory\u201d. Others thought (mistakenly) that he had defended Jimmy Savile and couldn\u2019t vote for him as a result. Two politicians did get better reviews. While questioning Boris Johnson\u2019s judgment (\u201chow can you trust someone happy to have Cummings as an adviser?\u201d asked Darron), most shared the view of Maria, who felt that although the former prime minister had been \u201cextremely naughty\u201d she still had a soft spot for him. Lee, a builder, said he was refreshing and that he\u2019d want him \u201cany day\u201d over Sunak. The other politician to meet the focus group\u2019s approval was Nigel Farage. Jordan felt he was \u201cdown to earth\u201d and Emily found it hard to disagree with lots he said. Even Maria, who was disappointed she hadn\u2019t seen the Brexit \u00a3350m, said she\u2019d forgive Farage and give him another chance. That absence of a Boris or Farage figure went to the heart of the group\u2019s worries about voting Reform. No one could name Richard Tice, the current Reform leader, and at least half of the group felt that even if they liked Reform a vote for them would just let Labour in. Others took a different view \u2013 Antonia was happy to waste her vote \u201cto show she didn\u2019t want to vote for other parties\u201d while Maria was \u201cdone with Labour and the Conservatives\u201d. If this group is anything to go by, the success of Reform UK and the damage they ultimately cause to the Conservatives will be determined by which of those sentiments wins out. Can Sunak persuade would-be Reform voters that they\u2019ll be letting Labour in through the back door, or does anger with a \u201crigged system\u201d make even a \u201cwasted vote\u201d a price worth paying to shake up the system?

            "date": "2024-01-21T17:00:32Z",
            "content": "One of the great hushed truths of the state school system is that its pupils are decided by house prices. That well-regarded comprehensive may charge no fees but its intake will be still be selected by parental income, as families pay exorbitantly for a home in the catchment area. As any estate agent knows, a school judged outstanding by Ofsted will push up neighbouring property prices. This is a cruel system that drives families who can afford it to uproot themselves, makes many of those who cannot feel inadequate, and produces and intensifies social segregation. Few would dispute this account. Not the government, which has published papers on the link between house prices and schools, nor academics or analysts: just last week the Sutton Trust published findings showing that 155 comprehensives, supposedly open to all, are more socially selective than a typical grammar. In Scotland, home addresses are assigned one secondary school so that, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies points out, social segregation there is even more marked. Rarely does any of this feature in the discussion around raising school standards. Ministers and policy experts talk about Sats, school curricula, inspections \u2013 rather than bringing down the invisible barriers that go up for children as early as five. Which is why Brighton and Hove is worth watching. On Monday, its Labour-led council will vote to change secondary school admissions. Councillors propose to make local authority secondaries give priority to children on free school meals over pupils from the catchment area. Observers believe that Brighton and Hove will be the first council ever to do this. The move is an attempt to reduce inequality within a highly unequal city, to mix up school populations, and to give pupils access to sought\u2011after schools. For a city that prides itself on being progressive and inclusive, this is a big step towards living those values. A remarkable aspect of this policy is how far it has been driven by a local grassroots campaign. Class Divide is led by independent residents rather than party politicians and is particularly informed by the experience of those living in Whitehawk and other eastern suburbs, only a few miles from the plusher parts of north and central Brighton yet often forgotten. In a series of podcasts released last year, campaigners documented how the schools gap affects locals\u2019 lives: attend a great school and the world may open up; go to a troubled one and you can be left without a launchpad. While fighting in last year\u2019s local elections, Jacob Taylor noted that on the doorstep Class Divide\u2019s campaign kept coming up. Mr Taylor is now one of the councillors behind this new policy. However good a student\u2019s time within the classroom, it does not solve the problems they face outside. Changing schools\u2019 entry criteria is only a small part of tackling inequality, and there will need to be support for the pupils who travel across the class divide, as well as plans for schools that lose students and the funding that goes with them. But for an underfunded local council it is a meaningful step. It is also not without political risk in a city that has tried and failed with admissions reform before. Still, this is a welcome move against one of the big scourges of our time. Sir Keir Starmer and his shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson could take some lessons from the south coast."

            "title": "Dutch Caribbean islanders sue Netherlands over climate change",
            "date": "2024-01-11T13:00:19Z",
            "content": "Eight people from the Caribbean island of Bonaire are suing the Netherlands, accusing it of violating their human rights by not doing enough to protect them from the climate crisis. The group, with Greenpeace Netherlands, filed a formal legal challenge against the Dutch government in The Hague on Thursday, asking the district court to order it to cut its greenhouse emissions much more quickly and to help its most vulnerable territories adapt to the impact of the climate crisis. Located nearly 8,000km (about 5,000 miles) from the capital of the Netherlands, Bonaire has been a Dutch special municipality since 2010. But the Netherlands has been present on the island for about 400 years, and in 2022, the government apologised for enslaving its people. As a low-lying island, Bonaire is likely to experience serious consequences from climate change, including extreme weather and sea-level rise. An October report from the Dutch meteorological institute (KNMI) found that temperatures in the Caribbean Netherlands had already increased by about 0.2C every decade since the 1980s. Rainfall is declining, particularly in the dry season. Experts expect this to worsen if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. Onnie Emerenciana, a farmer living on Bonaire and one of the plaintiffs, said it was already becoming increasingly difficult to grow crops because of the growing heat, wind and unpredictable rain. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming very, very, very hard to plant.\u201d The KNMI report concludes that climate policy that focuses on reducing emissions can make a big difference to the future of Dutch Caribbean islands such as Bonaire. Research by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, commissioned by Greenpeace, shows sea-level rise is likely to permanently submerge parts of the island by 2050, a problem exacerbated by the loss of coral reefs as a natural buffer against the oceans warming and acidifying. The studies also concluded that the climate crisis would exacerbate health problems on the island and could ruin its cultural heritage and tourism industry. Bonaire is a popular diving destination, and the degradation of coral reefs could lead to the loss of the majority of dive sites, which it is estimated will reduce visitor numbers by more than 100,000. The group of islanders, most of whom still live on Bonaire and are Dutch citizens, want the Netherlands to tighten its climate goals, so it contributes its \u201cfair share\u201d to keep global heating below 1.5C above preindustrial levels, which would involve reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 \u2013 10 years earlier than its current target. They also want solid plans, developed with the islands\u2019 inhabitants, to protect Bonaire from the consequences of the climate emergeency, to ensure that islanders can continue to live there, and pass on their traditions and culture to their children. Not doing this, they argue, is a breach of their human rights, particularly their right to life, and respect for private and family life. Eefje de Kroon, the climate justice expert at Greenpeace Netherlands who is working on the case, noted that the Netherlands is known for its advanced water-management strategies on the mainland, but the government has done very little to study how the climate crisis will affect its Caribbean outposts and how they could be protected. The national adaptation strategy excludes the islands completely. The group sent a pre-litigation \u201cletter before action\u201d to the Dutch government last May, hoping to resolve the issue without going to court. In an official response in October, the Dutch finance secretary, Alexandra Carla van Huffelen, said the state shared the islanders\u2019 concerns but maintained that the country\u2019s existing climate targets were appropriate, noting that they were tightened last summer. On adaptation, van Huffelen said a substantial amount of research had already taken place but would benefit from a clear overview that was more accessible to the public. She said a climate plan would be developed for each of the Caribbean Netherlands BES islands this year, informed by a \u201cclimate table\u201d led by islanders as recommended by an advisory report. It has allocated \u20ac1m (about \u00a3861,000) to this project. The plaintiffs have held discussions with ministers but were not satisfied, saying the government had failed to make any concrete changes. Social worker Danique Martis said the Caribbean Netherlands have been forgotten for too long. \u201cIt saddens me to see how, despite knowing their responsibility, the Dutch government has chosen to push our right to safety aside. For this reason, we are going to the court, so they have no choice but to act.\u201d De Kroon said the threat of the lawsuit had already begun to change the government\u2019s approach and raised the profile of the issue. As well as helping Bonaire, she hopes that a positive ruling would benefit those living on other Dutch Caribbean islands. The lawsuit is the latest in a wave of climate litigation in the Netherlands and around the world. In 2019, the Dutch government lost the landmark Urgenda case when the country\u2019s supreme court found it had explicit duties to protect its citizens\u2019 human rights in the face of the climate emergency and was required to undertake at least its fair share in cutting global emissions. This latest case seeks to build on that ruling and show that the country has legal responsibilities to all of its territories. Like other climate lawsuits, such as that brought by Torres Strait islanders (also known as the Zenadth Kes) against Australia, it highlights the particular vulnerability of island communities. \u2022 The subheading of this article was amended on 12 January 2024. An earlier version said that research shows part of the island will be submerged by 2025 instead of 2050."

Previously, most climate deniers pushed the belief that climate breakdown was not happening or, if it was, that humans were not causing it. Now, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) has found that most climate denial videos on YouTube push the idea that climate solutions do not work, climate science and the climate movement are unreliable, or that the effects of global heating are beneficial or harmless. Researchers from the CCDH gathered a dataset of text transcripts from 12,058 climate-related YouTube videos posted by 96 channels over almost six years from 1 January 2018 to 30 September 2023. They also included the results of a nationally representative survey conducted by polling company Survation which found 31% of UK respondents aged 13 to 17 agreed with the statement \u201cClimate change and its effects are being purposefully overexaggerated\u201d. This rose to 37% of teenagers categorised as heavy users of social media, meaning they reported using any one platform for more than four hours a day. The report published on Tuesday shows a shift from the \u201cold denial\u201d \u2013 that climate change is not happening or not anthropogenic \u2013 to the \u201cnew denial\u201d. These new denial narratives that question the science and solutions for climate change constituted 35% of all climate denial on YouTube in 2018, but now represent the large majority (70%). Over the same period, the share of old denial has dropped from 65% to 30% of total claims. The report authors believe that this shift is because the scientific evidence is now more accepted and hard to dispute, so those aiming to win people over to climate denial and delay must discredit the solutions and people pushing for climate action. Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the CCDH, said: \u201cScientists have won the battle to inform the public about climate change and its causes, which is why those opposed to climate action have cynically switched focus to undermining confidence in solutions and in science itself.\u201d This mentality has seeped into UK politics, with rightwing politicians having campaigned for years to persuade the public that net zero is unachievable and too expensive, and that technologies including electric cars and heat pumps do not work. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said recently that climate solutions are too expensive and rowed back on net zero commitments. Young people are particularly heavy users of YouTube \u2013 the Pew Research Center recently found 13- to 17-year-olds use YouTube more than any other social media platform, with 71% using it daily. Examples highlighted by the report of channels which push these new denial messages include the online figure Jordan Peterson (7.64 million subscribers), and channels such as BlazeTV (1.92 million subscribers) and PragerU (3.21 million subscribers). Ahmed added: \u201cYoung people spend a huge amount of time on video-sharing platforms like YouTube. These new forms of climate denial, which have proliferated rapidly over the last six years, are designed to confuse and weaken public support for climate action in the coming decades. \u201cIt is hypocritical for social media companies to claim to be green but then monetise and amplify lies about the climate. \u201cIt is time for digital platforms to put their money where their mouth is. They should refuse to amplify or monetise cynical climate denial content that undermines faith in our collective capacity to solve humanity\u2019s most pressing challenge.\u201d YouTube and Google, which owns the video platform, have been urged to stop promoting climate disinformation on their platforms. The report found that large brands and non-profits had paid-for adverts next to many of the widely viewed videos containing new denial messages. Michael Khoo, a climate disinformation expert at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cBig tech fuels the spread of denial that is stopping climate action. We\u2019ve pressured Google to stop supporting climate denial in the past, but they\u2019ve done little. The New Climate Denial report shows a disturbing shift in the tactics used by bad actors to derail the action needed to avert further disaster. \u201cPlatforms like YouTube have developed technology to monopolise young people\u2019s attention and shouldn\u2019t direct that towards climate denial. All social media companies must stop amplifying and profiting off the climate denial that threatens action on the most pressing crisis of human history.\u201d A YouTube spokesperson said: \u201cOur climate change policy prohibits ads from running on content that contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change. Debate or discussions of climate change topics, including around public policy or research, is allowed. However, when content crosses the line to climate change denial, we stop showing ads on those videos. We also display information panels under relevant videos to provide additional information on climate change and context from third parties.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-14T07:00:22Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak has been accused of trying to avoid scrutiny of his green policies after details surfaced about his government\u2019s failure, over more than 18 months, to appoint a new chair of the independent climate change committee. Senior environmentalists said they believed Sunak may be deliberately trying to avoid appointing a successor to Lord Deben \u2013 who first announced that he was stepping down in July 2022 \u2013 until after a general election, so he does not face criticism for his U-turns on green issues. The Observer can reveal that peer and former Tory minister David Willetts, who had been seen as the clear favourite, was interviewed for the post last summer but has since had no further contact at all from the government about the job and no indication as to whether he is still being considered. It is understood that others who were interviewed for the five-year post last summer \u2013 including former Tory minister Richard Benyon and former head of the environment agency, Emma Howard Boyd \u2013 and the head hunters ministers used to sift applications, have also been left in the dark. A Whitehall source who knows several people who applied for the post said: \u201cNo one seems to know what is going on. There could be a number of reasons. Either Sunak does not want anyone in the job because he wants to avoid being criticised in the run-up to a general election or there is a blockage, a disagreement at high level over who it should be. Whatever it is, it is scandalous that a job like this has not been filled when climate change is supposed to be the most urgent question facing humanity.\u201d In July 2022, it was announced Lord Deben had been asked to continue in the post until the end of June 2023, while a new chair was sought. A year and a half later, the chair is still unfilled, with Prof Piers Forster acting as interim head. The committee suffered another blow last week, when its chief executive, Chris Stark, announced he was standing down after six years. Stark is to join net zero advisory group the Carbon Trust as chief executive. Two weeks ago the Observer reported that the leading UK organisation working on the economic effects of global warming had written to the prime minister condemning the \u201cexcessive delay\u201d in finding a replacement for Lord Deben. Bob Ward, head of policy at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, told Sunak that the holdup was harming efforts to control carbon emissions and damaging the UK\u2019s reputation as a climate change leader. This came amid growing disillusion with Sunak in the green movement. Earlier this year the prime minister astonished environmentalists when he announced an annual system of oil and gas licensing in the North Sea, as well as measures including delaying a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. The Climate Change Committee was set up under the 2008 Climate Change Act to guide national policies on emissions and help the country prepare for the impact of global warming. In the past, it has critcised Britain\u2019s poor performance in areas including flood defences and domestic energy efficiency. One of its key roles is to decide the amounts of greenhouse gas the UK will emit in coming decades. The next carbon budget, the UK\u2019s seventh, will set levels for the period 2038 to 2042. Before the appointment of a new chair can be announced, he or she has to be approved by the devolved administrations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Sources in the Scottish government suggested they had been engaged in discussions over a successor but indicated that no appointment was imminent. A Scottish government spokesperson said: \u201cUnder the terms of the UK Climate Change Act 2008, the appointment of the UK Climate Change Committee (CCC) Chair is made jointly by the UK and devolved governments. \u201cWe would anticipate announcements about the Chair appointment later this year to ensure a smooth transition with the current interim CCC Chair, Piers Forster.\u201d Tessa Khan, co-founder of Uplift, an NGO that supports the transition from fossil fuels, said: \u201cThis delay [in appointing someone to chair the committee] points to a government that is running scared of scrutiny over its climate record. \u201cRather than tracking progress and sticking to the science, the prime minister would rather we just took his word for it, particularly when it comes to new oil and gas production. We know, for example, that developing the Rosebank oil field is incompatible with the UK\u2019s climate targets, yet the government has nodded it through and plans to hand out even more drilling licences. \u201cMeanwhile homes are flooded across the country, energy bills are unaffordable for millions and the UK is losing out on the massive opportunities from the shift to cheaper, clean energy.\u201d Joss Garman, executive director of the European Climate Foundation, said: \u201cSuccessive governments of all persuasion have respected the Committee for its independent, unbiased and expert advice acting on the clear mandate it was given with cross party support by Parliament. It has been so successful and useful that governments around the world have looked to copy the model and build their own versions. \u201cIt is essential it is not now muzzled, or turned into a political football, for cynical, short-term political expediency.\u201d A spokesman for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the government was committed to meeting its net zero targets and would appoint a successor to Lord Deben \u201cin due course.\u201d"

            "content": "Cop29, the next round of UN talks to tackle the climate crisis, will be led by another veteran of the oil and gas industry. Mukhtar Babayev, Azerbaijan\u2019s ecology and natural resources minister, has been appointed the president-in-waiting for the Cop29 climate talks when they take place in the country in November. Before his entry into politics in the autocratic country in western Asia, once a Soviet republic, Babayev spent 26 years working for the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (Socar). Close observers of the Cop process will see parallels with the appointment of Sultan Al Jaber, who moonlighted from his role as the chief executive of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company to preside over the summit when it took place in Dubai last year. Sceptics have already begun to point to Babayev\u2019s appointment as raising questions over the commitment to the global phase-out of fossil fuels in Azerbaijan. The country relied on oil and gas for more than 92.5% of its export revenue last year, according to the US government\u2019s International Trade Administration. But Babayev does have form in environmental protection, having spent three years as Socar\u2019s vice-president for ecology, in which time he oversaw efforts to remediate Azerbaijan\u2019s contaminated soils. The country is wrestling with a number of severe ecological problems, including, after 160 years of oil production, decades-worth of damage from the petrochemical organisations that operate there. Born in Baku while Azerbaijan was still part of the USSR, Babayev served in the Soviet military before studying political science at Moscow State University and then foreign economic relations at the Azerbaijan State University of Economics. He joined Socar in 1994, working in foreign economic relations and marketing until his appointment as the company\u2019s ecology tsar in 2008. According to a US diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks, on his appointment to that role Babayev hosted the first ecology conference in Azerbaijan\u2019s history. In the environment role, he described remediation as the \u201cshared mission and moral imperative\u201d of all Azerbaijanis, but also said that any fall in oil prices could hamper efforts. US diplomats reported him as saying in a subsequent meeting that his mission was to \u201cchange the mentality\u201d of Azerbaijanis about their responsibilities to the environment, and even joking that his new role made him and Socar\u2019s first vice-president \u201cenemies\u201d. But he reportedly emphasised his role was to change Socar\u2019s attitude to the environment while nonetheless continuing to develop Azerbaijan\u2019s oil industry. In 2010, Babayev entered politics, becoming an MP for the ruling New Azerbaijan party, which has won every election in the country since 1993. He was appointed minister for ecology in 2018, in which role he has fulminated against alleged ecological destruction by Armenians living in territories claimed by Azerbaijan. Simon Stiell, the UN climate change executive secretary, welcomed the appointment, exhorting his team to work with Babayev and Yalchin Rafiyev, his lead negotiator, to deliver \u201ca successful Cop29\u201d. The Azerbaijan government has been approached for comment."

            "date": "2024-01-18T11:00:34Z",
            "content": "It hadn\u2019t snowed in New York City for 701 days \u2013 a record \u2013 so when it started to come down on Tuesday, children\u2019s jaws dropped like kids seeing bananas for the first time after the second world war. Older people, if they had lived in New York for more than a few years, promptly ruined the moment by pointing out it wasn\u2019t real snow, there wasn\u2019t enough for school to be cancelled, and it was unlikely to accumulate sufficiently for sledding. Ah, the magic of adulthood. It is alarming to see the environment change in one\u2019s lifetime, and this isn\u2019t anything close to a lifetime. Even a decade ago, New Yorkers were used to the city shutting down for a week at a time when the latest massive snow storm came in. In February 2010, a total of 36in fell in the city, part of a winter of 51in of snow. In 2006, a blizzard dumped 26.9in of snow on the area, a record rivalled 10 years later when so much snow fell across the state that the governor briefly banned travel. The cold front on Tuesday, by contrast, dumped, or rather lightly dusted, Central Park with about an inch of snow, followed almost immediately by rain. By the time schools let out, grumbling parents forced to head to the park watched in amazement as their snow-deprived children screamed with joy at the grey chips of ice. There have, of course, been countless other canary-in-the-coalmine weather moments around the world over the last few years, by which I mean less the dramatic rise in wildfires and flood water than the smaller ambient shifts of, for instance, finding oneself outside in a T-shirt on Christmas Day. These apparently minor fluctuations feel in some ways more sinister, more frogs-in-boiling water (if we want to stick with dead-animal alarm systems), than more seismic, newsworthy shifts. \u201cIt\u2019s not normal,\u201d we say to one another, like bad actors at the start of a disaster movie, and move on, wondering if it\u2019s an anomalous blip. The end of meaningful snow in New York, if that\u2019s what this is, seems of a different magnitude altogether, not least because it interferes with the character of the city at a level that feels vaguely symbolic. From a practical point of view, the absence of large annual snowfall will save the city millions of dollars in snowploughing and general shut-down costs. Lives will probably be saved, although my second biggest New York death anxiety after an air-conditioner falling on my head \u2013 being killed by falling ice \u2013 won\u2019t be affected by the absence of snow. The loss, in the end, is sentimental. Inhabitants of any big city know the wonder of heavy snowfall, the experience of waking up after the blizzard and looking through one\u2019s window at a place transformed. There is almost no quicker route back to the state of being a child, only with the deep added bonus of knowing you can cancel your obligations. Zoom was supposed to nix snow days, but as we all know, snow days are a state of mind; when there\u2019s 6ft of snow outside, no one is doing any work. I miss that feeling of stolen time, and I miss the grandness of a big snow event that always seemed in keeping with New York\u2019s general self-image. When I look at photos from six years ago of pulling my toddlers on a sled up the middle of the street, the cars round-shouldered with snow either side, I miss that particular quality of silence that only comes with heavy snowfall. What thin, miserable winters without it. Maybe it\u2019s a blip. Summers always seem hotter in one\u2019s childhood memories, at least for those who grew up in the UK, when in reality they just got better at irrigating the grass on Centre Court at Wimbledon so it didn\u2019t turn brown. Clearly, I\u2019m romanticising the recent past. The last great snow drought in New York was 400 days long and broke on 21 March 1998, although what followed was proper snow, not this pitiful showing. The sun came out today, and it was one of those beautiful, Arctic days that often follow in the wake of a snow storm. It shone on grey, icy streets and we got on with our day.

            "date": "2024-01-24T14:00:14Z",
            "content": "Wholesale power prices across Australia\u2019s main electricity market almost halved at the end of 2023 compared with a year earlier, stoking hopes households may soon see smaller bills. Spot prices in the National Electricity Market (Nem) that serves the eastern and southern states fell to an average of $48 a megawatt-hour in the December quarter, down 48% on the previous year, the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) said in a report released on Thursday. Carbon emissions also dropped to record lows. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Warmer than average temperatures nudged average electricity demand 1.6% higher to 19,745MW in the Nem, the first increase in the fourth quarter since 2015. That rise in demand came even as rooftop solar output jumped by 17% to average 3,433MW. The split between mainland Nem states widened, with average wholesale spot prices dropping to $26MW/h in Victoria and $33MW/h in South Australia, well shy of the $66MWh for New South Wales and $68MW/h for Queensland. Abundant renewable electricity, particularly during the middle of the day, meant that prices were zero or negative for a record of 20% of the trading intervals during the quarter. Both Victoria at 29% and NSW at 12% set records for the proportion of the quarter that saw wholesale electricity prices at zero or negative levels. Energy analysts including Tim Buckley have argued that retail power prices should fall when the Australian Energy Regulator sets its default market offer for the year from 1 July. Even though wholesale prices make up only about one-third of the bill consumers pay, the drop so far this financial year could provide a \u201cdouble-digit drop\u201d if maintained, Buckley said last week. But the warmer temperatures that nudged demand higher in the final three months of 2023 are continuing this month, sending spot prices sharply higher in Queensland. Demand in the state broke the previous record set last March by almost 10%. The power grid faces fresh strains on Thursday and Friday as the heatwave roasting inland parts of Queensland and NSW extends to Sydney. Aemo issued several \u201clack of reserve\u201d notices for both states late on Wednesday afternoon, calling for additional supply in both states for those days. Authorities often faced the opposite issue, with solar electricity supplies meeting much if not all demand during parts of some days as rooftop systems continued to spread. \u201cEarly in the afternoon of 31 December rooftop solar met 101% of South Australia\u2019s total electricity demand,\u201d said Aemo\u2019s chief executive, Daniel Westerman. \u201cWhile on the afternoon of 24 October rooftop solar and grid-scale renewables provided 72% of all electricity across the east coast.\u201d Renewables took a 43% share of generation during the quarter, Westerman told the ABC on Thursday. \u201cThese events are snapshots of the transition that\u2019s happening, and they are becoming more frequent,\u201d Westerman said, adding: \u201cThis represents a great opportunity for Australia\u2019s energy market.\u201d To seize that opportunity, though, additional storage such as large-scale batteries are needed lest more output from solar farms, in particular, face so-called curtailment when excess generation is wasted. For instance, grid-scale capacity increased more than 600MW from new and existing solar farms but network and other constraints reduced growth in actual power delivered by more than a third, Aemo said. The advance of renewables helped push out coal and gas. Total Nem emissions fell 4%, or 1.1m tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent, to a record low 25.4MtCO2-e. It took 590kgCO2-e to produce 1MWh of electricity, a record low intensity. Black coal-fired generation fell to a new low of 9,189MW even as more capacity was available despite last April\u2019s closure of NSW\u2019s Liddell plant, and coal prices fell. \u201cGovernment policies capping domestic thermal coal prices and improved coal supply conditions collectively contributed to an overall decrease in marginal cost of coal-fired generators, resulting in more volume offered to the market at lower price ranges,\u201d Aemo said. Fossil gas demand for power generation fell slightly, helping to contribute to a sharp drop in east coast wholesale prices. Prices averaged $10.83/gigajoule, almost 40% lower than for the December quarter of 2022."

            "content": "The European Union pumped out 8% less carbon dioxide from the fossil fuels it burned in 2023 than it did in 2022, the Guardian can reveal, pushing these emissions down to their lowest level in 60 years. The fall in planet-heating pollution is the steepest yearly drop on record behind 2020, when governments shuttered factories and grounded flights to stop the spread of Covid-19, according to analysis from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea). \u201cEU CO2 emissions have finally fallen back to levels apparent in my parents\u2019 generation in the 1960s,\u201d said Isaac Levi, an analyst at Crea. \u201cYet, over this time period, the economy has tripled \u2013 showing that climate change can be combated without foregoing economic growth.\u201d More than half of the drop in emissions came from the use of cleaner electricity, the report found. The EU built record levels of solar panels and wind turbines in 2023, according to industry data, and was able to make more electricity from dams and nuclear power plants that had been struck by drought and repair work the year before. The report found that lower demand for electricity, aided by good weather, contributed to 8% of the fall in fossil CO2 emissions. Cuts in sectors such as industry \u2013 where high gas prices have led some firms to become more efficient and others to make fewer goods \u2013 and transport made up the remaining 36%. The figures do not include sectors such as agriculture, dirty chemical processes such as cement-making, or other greenhouse gases such as methane. Analysts say emissions overall are still falling too slowly. \u201cThe 8% reduction in emissions should be celebrated,\u201d said Levi, \u201cbut more must be done to wean the EU off fossil fuels, reduce reliance on petrostates such as Russia, whilst also leaving the world a better place for the next generation.\u201d The EU bears some of the greatest responsibility for having heated the planet and made extreme weather more violent. To keep temperatures under control, it has promised to cut its greenhouse gas pollution by 55% by the end of the decade from 1990 levels before reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Last week, the EU\u2019s own climate advisers said \u201cthe pace of reductions needs to increase considerably\u201d if the bloc was to achieve its 2030 target. The 27 member states need to cut emissions about twice as fast as they have done on average over the last 17 years, according to a report from the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change. The group laid out a list of 13 recommendations that include urgently phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, expanding the European emissions pricing scheme to include agriculture, and passing the final laws in the European green deal. \u201cThe EU has made great progress in recent years to strengthen its climate policy framework,\u201d said Prof Ottmar Edenhofer, the chair of the advisory board, when the report was published. \u201cBut reaching climate neutrality by 2050 is a race against the clock and we cannot afford to lean back now.\u201d Sarah Brown, from the clean energy thinktank Ember, which was not involved in the analysis, said: \u201cThis substantial fall in emissions, particularly from the power sector, shows that the EU is accelerating its shift away from risky and expensive fossil fuels. But with the expected increase in electricity demand due to wider electrification over the coming years, renewables deployment and energy efficiency must keep pace.\u201d"

            "title": "Cookstove carbon offsets overstate climate benefit by 1,000%, study finds",
            "date": "2024-01-23T10:00:44Z",
            "content": "Clean cookstove projects, one of the most popular types of carbon-offset schemes, are probably overstating their beneficial impact on the climate by an average of 1,000%, according to a new study. Every year, an estimated 3.2 million people die prematurely from household air pollution caused by cooking with smoky fuels such as wood, paraffin or kerosene, which produce about 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Such cooking also drives deforestation and habitat loss, as people cut down trees for fuel. By switching from smoky fuels to cleaner alternatives such as electric cookers, cookstove projects in the developing world can have major health, social and environmental benefits: improving air quality, reducing the amount of time people spend collecting wood and slowing the loss of the world\u2019s forests. To fund these initiatives, which are often dubbed \u201cnature-based-solutions\u201d, projects sell on the greenhouse gas reductions as carbon credits. Each credit represents a tonne of carbon dioxide \u2013 which companies then use to \u201coffset\u201d their emissions, sometimes claiming their products and services are \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d. Improving access to clean cooking facilities features in the UN sustainable development goals, and cookstove-based credits have been on the rise. From May to November last year, figures from the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project show cookstove projects issued the most new credits in the market, comprising about 15% of the total. They also registered the most new projects. But a new study published in the journal Nature Sustainability has found that cookstove projects that generate carbon offsets are overstating their climate benefits by 1,000% on average. The findings have been disputed by Verra and Gold Standard, both leading certifiers of carbon credits, which say the evidence in the study does not back the conclusions drawn. While many offsetting schemes said they were funding \u201cclean\u201d cookstoves, most did not meet World Health Organization standards, according to the assessment by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. Analysis of common rules to produce the offsets found that projects were allowed to overstate how often people used the stoves and the resulting benefits for nearby forests, dramatically inflating the benefit to the climate and biodiversity, researchers said. The findings draw on previous research on the impact of cookstove schemes by development economists, who found they often failed to produce their potential benefits in practice. Despite the problems, the researchers said the rules on producing carbon credits could be reformed to provide a meaningful source of climate finance that companies could trust. They offer a method that clean cookstove projects can use to avoid overstating their impact, which some of the cookstove companies have already adopted while the paper has been in peer-review. The lead author, Annelise Gill-Wiehl, a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley, said: \u201cComprehensively assessing the five major cookstove offset methodologies, we find that our sample of 40% of the market is 9.2 times over-credited. Extrapolating to the entire market, we find roughly 10 times over-crediting. \u201cOver-crediting replaces direct emission reduction and other more effective climate mitigation activities, even if some reduction is achieved. Lack of trust weakens the market,\u201d she said. The study comes amid intense scrutiny of the unregulated voluntary carbon market, with concerns that many schemes are producing huge amounts of worthless carbon offsets. Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project, who has been researching carbon credits for 20 years and is co-author of the study, said researchers hoped the quality of credits could be improved. \u201cA carbon credit market built on exaggerations is destined to fail. Our hope is that the specific recommendations we offer can help make clean cookstoves a trusted source of quality carbon credits,\u201d she said. Gold Standard, a major carbon credit certifier, disputed the findings of the study. The researchers found that Gold Standard produced the best-quality method for producing offsets, which directly monitored use of stoves, and was only 1.5 times over-credited. \u201cGold Standard welcomes academic scrutiny and has engaged extensively with the authors of this study,\u201d a spokesperson said, adding that it had already incorporated some of the ideas and changes discussed in the research. \u201cIt must be stressed that the study neither studied, nor found, over-estimation. The evidence provided does not back the conclusions drawn \u2013 which are at odds with the wider academic literature and expert view on this subject.\u201d In a statement, Verra, the world\u2019s largest carbon standard, said it was disappointed to see continued attention on the study. The non-profit organisation is developing a new methodology for cookstoves, and said the findings did not directly relate to its current methods. \u201cAs detailed in a September 2023 open letter from researchers and experts, there are numerous substantive concerns about this research,\u201d it said. Verra said the proposed methodology it was developing included changes that \u201creflect current best practices of project design and implementation\u201d, as well as a number of measuring techniques to check how much the stoves were being used. \u201cCarbon finance is critical for the implementation/sustenance of improved cookstove projects, which provide access to sophisticated cooking methods and a range of other sustainable development benefits to disadvantaged communities,\u201d it said. Ben Jeffreys, chief executive of the cookstove company ATEC, which is working with UC Berkeley to measure the benefits more accurately, said he supported the research. \u201cEnsuring \u2018a tonne of emission reductions is actually a tonne\u2019 is critical if we are to reach the full potential of the cookstove carbon-market sector,\u201d he said.

            "date": "2024-01-18T09:05:44Z",
            "content": "Scientists have long known that bottom trawling \u2013 the practice of dragging massive nets along the seabed to catch fish \u2013 churns up carbon from the sea floor. Now, for the first time, researchers have calculated just how much trawling releases into the atmosphere: 370m tonnes of planet-heating carbon dioxide a year \u2013 an amount, they say, that is \u201ctoo big to ignore\u201d. Over the study period, 1996-2020, they estimated the total carbon dioxide released from trawling to the atmosphere to be 8.5 to 9.2bn tonnes. The scientists described trawling as \u201cmarine deforestation\u201d that causes \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to the climate, society and wildlife. The study \u2013 Atmospheric CO2 emissions and ocean acidification from bottom trawling, written by a global team of climate and ocean experts \u2013 found that 55-60% of the carbon dioxide in the water released from the seabed by trawlers will make it to the atmosphere within nine years. Trawling hotspots in the East China Sea, the Baltic, the North Sea and the Greenland Sea have the largest climate emissions, the study said. Carbon released from the sea floor also causes local acidification, reducing the oceans\u2019 capacity to absorb carbon, the study found. \u201cWe have long known that dragging heavy fishing nets \u2013 some as large as 10 747 jets \u2013 across the ocean floor destroys sea life and habitats,\u201d said Dr Trisha Atwood, an aquatic ecologist at Utah State University and National Geographic\u2019s Pristine Seas. \u201cOnly recently, we have discovered that bottom trawling also unleashes plumes of carbon, which otherwise would be safely stored for millennia in the ocean floor.\u201d Sediment plumes from commercial trawling, not unlike vapour trails left by aircraft, can be seen from space. The study relied on a vessel-tracking database processed by Global Fishing Watch, which shows where trawling took place in 1996-2020. They added data on sea-floor carbon, then used three different internationally accepted models of carbon cycles in the ocean, used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to calculate how much carbon released into the water entered the atmosphere. \u201cOur study is the very first to show that over half the carbon released by bottom trawling eventually escapes into the atmosphere as CO2 over the span of about 10 years, contributing to global warming,\u201d said Atwood. \u201cMuch like destroying forests, scraping up the sea floor causes irreparable harm to the climate, society and wildlife.\u201d The research builds on previous work by some team members, published in 2021, which showed that bottom trawling released as much carbon dioxide into the ocean annually as the entire aviation industry, but the fate of the carbon in the water remained an unknown. The new study, published on Thursday, found that the amount released into the air could double the annual emissions from fuel combustion of the entire global fishing fleet of 4m vessels. Dr Enric Sala, the explorer-in-residence and executive director of Pristine Seas, said the amount of carbon released by trawling into the air, is \u201ctoo big to ignore\u201d and urged countries to include the emissions in their climate action plans. \u201cCountries don\u2019t account for bottom trawling\u2019s significant carbon emissions in their climate action plans,\u201d said Sala. \u201cThe good news is that reducing bottom trawling carbon emissions will deliver immediate benefits. The bad news is, delaying action ensures that emissions from trawling will continue seeping into the atmosphere a decade from now.\u201d The magnitude of trawl-induced carbon dioxide released into water in the original 2021 study \u2013 published in Nature and led by Sala \u2013 was challenged last year by other scientists, writing in the same journal. Sala \u2013 who said the challenge and its conclusions were based on incorrect assumptions, lacked quantitative support and contained larger uncertainty than his own model \u2013 stands by the conclusions of the 2021 paper. \u201cOne thing this new paper shows is that, regardless of the amount of carbon released by bottom trawling, over half will go into the atmosphere within a decade,\u201d Sala said. The estimates of carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere from trawling are conservative, the researchers said, given they have included only trawlers that are publicly tracked, when a Global Fishing Watch study found that 75% of fishing vessels are not."

            "date": "2024-01-24T09:20:59Z",
            "content": "The owner of the Port Talbot steelworks has been accused of \u201cgross hypocrisy\u201d as it prepares to open a new blast furnace in India, while citing a cut in carbon emissions for its decision to close two blast furnaces in south Wales, costing thousands of jobs. Tata announced last week that up to 2,800 jobs would be cut under plans to close Port Talbot\u2019s two huge blast furnaces and replace them with an electric arc furnace. However, union bosses told the Guardian the decision was at odds with a project to build a huge new blast furnace at Tata\u2019s Kalinganagar industrial complex in eastern India, which is entering its closing stages. The job cuts have inflamed tensions between unions and the government, which steelworkers argue should have offered greater financial aid to the company to support domestic manufacturing. On Tuesday, workers gathered outside Westminster to protest against the decision, while Labour vowed to force a vote on the future of the British steel industry. In announcing the redundancies last week, the company said that the overhaul would \u201csecure most of Tata Steel UK\u2019s existing product capability and maintain the country\u2019s self-sufficiency in steelmaking, while also reducing Tata Steel UK\u2019s CO2 emissions by 5 million tonnes per year and overall UK country emissions by about 1.5%\u201d. However, the project at Kalinganagar could increase the company\u2019s overall global emissions. It will be among the largest blast furnaces in the world, with a 5,870 cubic metre capacity, and is due to be completed this year. Unions argue that building a new blast furnace while claiming an emissions cut in Wales represents double standards. The Indian site already houses a vast blast furnace, with a capacity of 4,330 cubic metres, which the company has lauded as the \u201cbackbone of steelmaking\u201d at the plant. The Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: \u201cTata\u2019s actions in India expose the myth that its plan to close the blast furnaces in Port Talbot is due to concerns about climate change. It is nothing of the sort. Tata is simply seeking to boost its global profits. \u201cThat\u2019s why much-needed public investment in green steel should come with job guarantees and a plan for growth.\u201d The Welsh job cuts have been more than a decade in the making, as Britain\u2019s steel industry has struggled to compete with cheaper Chinese imports and European rivals with lower energy costs. Long-running negotiations over government subsidies eventually resulted in Tata announcing a \u00a31.25bn investment, including \u00a3500m from the taxpayer, to switch to an electric arc furnace, which uses electricity to melt scrap metal rather than burning coal and iron ore. But that will be far less labour intensive, resulting in 2,500 jobs being cut at Port Talbot and another 300 at another south Wales site, in Llanwern. Semi-finished steel slabs will be imported from sites in India and the Netherlands before the EAF is operational in 2027. Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, a GMB national officer, said: \u201cThis gross hypocrisy is exactly what GMB has been talking about \u2013 Tata\u2019s plan is centred on importing steel from their plants in India and IJmuiden while the electric arc furnace is built \u2013 and beyond. \u201cThis transition being \u2018green\u2019 is a false flag, allowing foreign entities to profit off the back of GMB members and their communities.\u201d India has been far less proactive than Europe in tackling company emissions and its steel industry is reliant on coal. Britain\u2019s more stringent approach to tackling emissions, and the country\u2019s abundance of scrap steel to feed EAFs, have set the two countries\u2019 industries apart, sources said. The site has also been trialling carbon capture technology and the new blast furnace will have its own gas cleaning plant and a \u201crobust dust extraction system\u201d. Tata has expanded Kalinganagar \u2013 a new town built up in the face of local tribal resistance and taking advantage of iron ore reserves in Tomka \u2013 to become one of the most important assets in its global portfolio. In the early 2000s, a government agency began buying land from the public and courting international steel companies to open operations in coastal Odisha. The site, sandwiched between the crocodile-filled waters of the Bhitarkanika national park and the Tomka iron ore mountain, is one of four huge Tata steelworks in India (including its powerhouse Jamshedpur site). Tata faced opposition from local villagers intent on receiving compensation and rehousing in return for their ancestral lands. The situation came to a head in January 2006, when police opened fire on a group of tribal people protesting against the construction of a boundary wall of the plant on land grazed by cattle, with 13 Adivasi people and a policeman killed. A memorial is held each year. A Tata Steel spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand how difficult this decision is for our workers and our steel communities ... We believe that scrap-based steelmaking is the right solution for our business in the UK \u2013 a country which is currently the second largest exporter of used steel in the world, and one in which renewable energy is developing quickly.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-24T00:01:03Z",
            "content": "Artificial intelligence will make it difficult to spot whether emails are genuine or sent by scammers and malicious actors, including messages that ask computer users to reset their passwords, the UK\u2019s cybersecurity agency has warned. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said people would struggle to identify phishing messages \u2013 where users are tricked into handing over passwords or personal details \u2013 due to the sophistication of AI tools. Generative AI, the term for technology that can produce convincing text, voice and images from simple hand-typed prompts, has become widely available to the public through chatbots such as ChatGPT and free-to-use versions known as open source models. The NCSC, part of the GCHQ spy agency, said in its latest assessment of AI\u2019s impact on the cyber threats facing the UK that AI would \u201calmost certainly\u201d increase the volume of cyber-attacks and heighten their impact over the next two years. It said generative AI and large language models \u2013 the technology that underpins chatbots \u2013 will complicate efforts to identify different types of attack such as spoof messages and social engineering, the term for manipulating people to hand over confidential material. \u201cTo 2025, generative AI and large language models will make it difficult for everyone, regardless of their level of cybersecurity understanding, to assess whether an email or password reset request is genuine, or to identify phishing, spoofing or social engineering attempts.\u201d Ransomware attacks, which had hit institutions such as the British Library and Royal Mail over the past year, were also expected to increase, the NCSC said. It warned that the sophistication of AI \u201clowers the barrier\u201d for amateur cybercriminals and hackers to access systems and gather information on targets, enabling them to paralyse a victim\u2019s computer systems, extract sensitive data and demand a cryptocurrency ransom. The NCSC said generative AI tools already helped make approaches to potential victims more convincing by creating fake \u201clure documents\u201d that did not contain the translation, spelling or grammatical errors that tended to give away phishing attacks \u2013 their contents having been crafted or corrected by chatbots. However, it said generative AI \u2013 which emerged as a competent coding tool \u2013 would not enhance the effectiveness of ransomware code but would help sift through and identify targets. According to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, the UK\u2019s data watchdog, 706 ransomware incidents were reported in the UK in 2022, compared with 694 in 2021. The agency warned that state actors probably have enough malware \u2013 short for malicious software \u2013 to train a specially created AI model that would create new code capable of avoiding security measures. The NCSC said such a model would have to be trained on data extracted from its target. \u201cHighly capable state actors are almost certainly best placed among cyber threat actors to harness the potential of AI in advanced cyber operations,\u201d the NCSC report says. The NCSC added that AI would also work as a defensive tool, with the technology able to detect attacks and design more secure systems. The report came as the UK government set out new guidelines encouraging businesses to better equip themselves to recover from ransomware attacks. The \u201cCyber Governance Code of Practice\u201d aims to place information security on the same tier as financial and legal management, the NCSC said. But cybersecurity experts have called for stronger action. Ciaran Martin, the former head of the NCSC, says that unless public and private bodies fundamentally change how they approach the threat of ransomware, \u201can incident of the severity of the British Library attack is likely in each of the next five years.\u201d In a newsletter, Martin wrote that the UK needs to reassess its approach to ransomware, including by creating stronger rules around the payment of ransoms and giving up on \u201cfantasies\u201d of \u201cstriking back\u201d against criminals based in hostile nations."

            "date": "2024-01-08T18:16:01Z",
            "content": "The top director responsible for safety and security at Sellafield is to leave the vast nuclear waste dump in north-west England, it has emerged. Mark Neate, the Sellafield environment, safety and security director, is to leave the organisation later this year. Neate reports directly to Euan Hutton, the interim chief executive of Sellafield, the nuclear waste and decommissioning site in Cumbria, which is also the world\u2019s largest store of plutonium. Multiple safety and cybersecurity failings, as well as claims of a \u201ctoxic\u201d working culture, were revealed in Nuclear Leaks, a year-long Guardian investigation into Sellafield, last month. The energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, said the reports were \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and wrote to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), the state-owned body which ultimately runs Sellafield, demanding a \u201cfull explanation\u201d. In his response last month, the NDA chief executive, David Peattie, said there had been \u201cnecessary changes to the leadership, governance, and risk management of cyber\u201d and responsibility for its cyber function had been moved. A new head of cybersecurity was due to take up the role this month, which Peattie said would ensure \u201csustained focus and leadership on this matter\u201d. Sellafield said Neate had responsibility for cybersecurity operations until January 2023, when control was shifted to report to its chief information officer. It declined to say whether Neate\u2019s departure was related to cybersecurity and safety failings at the site and said that he made the decision to leave last autumn. Sources claimed the timing of the exit of Sellafield\u2019s longest-serving director was related to the company\u2019s performance in critical areas including safety and security. After the Guardian approached Sellafield for comment on Neate\u2019s departure, the company released a statement saying that Neate would be in post for \u201cseveral more months\u201d and was leaving after a \u201ccareer dedicated to ensuring the safety and security of the Sellafield site and its workforce\u201d. Neate said: \u201cI took stock at the end of the summer break and ultimately decided that 2024 was the right time for me to move on.\u201d Neate joined Sellafield in 2012 and has held a number of roles, including director of security and resilience. He has a military background, including as a strategist during the Iraq war and working with the US army under the then general David Petraeus. Sellafield is yet to confirm an exact leaving date for the executive. In an interview in 2022, Neate said he was proud of Sellafield\u2019s security record, and acknowledged his responsibilities. \u201cIf we sneeze here the whole industry gets a cold,\u201d he said. \u201cI do see it as fun,\u201d he said of his job. Sellafield has \u201cmore work to do\u201d to reduce safety incidents, according to its annual accounts for the year to March 2023 which were published in late December. The accounts showed that annual operating costs at the taxpayer-funded site climbed by \u00a3170m to \u00a32.5bn. Last financial year the company pleaded guilty to a prosecution brought by the Office for Nuclear Regulation under health and safety regulations after an employee was injured falling from a scaffold ladder while carrying out repair work. The company was fined \u00a3400,000 and ordered to pay \u00a329,210 in costs as well as a surcharge of \u00a3190. The GMB trade union last month called on the government and nuclear authorities to take \u201curgent action\u201d to address concerns over safety at Sellafield. Sellafield, which has more than 11,000 staff, was last year placed into a form of \u201cspecial measures\u201d for consistent failings on cybersecurity, according to sources at the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the security services. Sellafield said it did not have evidence of a successful cyber-attack after the Guardian revealed that groups linked to Russia and China had penetrated its networks. A spokesperson for Sellafield said: \u201cMark Neate has made the decision to leave Sellafield following a decade of dedicated service working as environment, safety and security director. \u201cMark has brought significant value to Sellafield over the past decade, including the role that he played in running our response to the Covid crisis, and we are sad to see him go. \u201cHe made the decision in autumn last year to leave the company, and will continue in his role to ensure a smooth transition to his successor.\u201d Sellafield issued a range of responses to the Guardian\u2019s reports into its cybersecurity, safety and cultural issues, which it published online."

            "date": "2024-01-09T12:00:08Z",
            "content": "A federal trial beginning this week in Atlanta could change the way people vote in this year\u2019s election in a key swing state, and potentially affect voters in other states for years to come. The trial, six years in the making, pits a non-profit organization and a handful of Georgia voters against the state, claiming that vulnerabilities in the state\u2019s computerized voting machines place a voter\u2019s choices at an unacceptable risk of being altered, infringing on their constitutional rights. Georgia\u2019s current system prints a ballot after voters use touchscreens on what is called a \u201cballot-marking device\u201d (BMD), and the ballot has a barcode that a scanner reads to record each voter\u2019s choices. Associates of Donald Trump hacked the system in early 2021, according to last year\u2019s Fulton county indictment. The solution, plaintiffs have argued since 2017, is for voters to mark paper ballots by hand \u2013 as about 70% of voters do in the rest of the country. The ballots would then be scanned and a tool known as a risk-limiting audit used to verify results. Judge Amy Totenberg will decide in the coming weeks whether to enjoin \u2013 or prohibit \u2013 the state from using its voting system, which would then probably lead to Georgia voters choosing candidates by pen and paper in this year\u2019s election. Less than 12 months from the 2024 presidential election, the trial\u2019s outcome is \u201cextreme and urgent\u201d, said Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a North Carolina-based non-profit organization and one of the suit\u2019s plaintiffs. \u201cIt\u2019s the ability to satisfy winners, losers and their supporters [in 2024] that Georgia\u2019s election was legitimate and verifiable.\u201d Georgia is one of a handful of battleground states considered vital to deciding this year\u2019s election. In a sign of what\u2019s at stake, it took a last-minute federal court of appeals decision on Friday to clarify whether Georgia\u2019s top elections official, the secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, would be compelled to testify. The three-judge panel issued a decision only four days before the trial\u2019s start, releasing him from the responsibility. Georgia is one of few states to use the touchscreen voting machines at the center of the case for all of its nearly 8 million registered voters \u2013 meaning any problem, whether due to hacking or human error, could affect all of them. Other states tend to use a patchwork of systems. Last year, Marks\u2019s group uncovered the efforts by associates of Donald Trump in early 2021 to download the Georgia system\u2019s software and other data from rural Coffee county\u2019s election department; the breach is mentioned more than 50 times in the indictments Trump and 18 others are facing in Georgia and has led to several guilty pleas to date. The software and other information remains in the hands of an unknown number of persons. But the coalition\u2019s efforts have exposed a series of vulnerabilities in Georgia\u2019s system since the case\u2019s beginning. In August 2016, Logan Lamb, a \u201cfriendly hacker\u201d and former federal cybersecurity researcher, gained access to the state\u2019s system, including instructions and passwords for election workers to use on election day. Seven months later, Lamb\u2019s colleague Christoper Grayson discovered he could still access the same information. They both tried to force the state to remedy its cybersecurity problems, to no avail. Marks filed suit in June 2017. A year later, Judge Totenberg listened to former Georgia governor and attorney for the state Roy E Barnes claim the state had taken measures to improve the system\u2019s security. The judge called the state\u2019s explanation of those same measures \u201coblique\u201d. J Alex Halderman, a computer science professor at the University of Michigan, testified on behalf of plaintiffs about the system\u2019s weaknesses, and while he correctly forecast future breaches of the system, he misidentified where the threat would come from. \u201cWhen I began my research in 2006,\u201d he told the judge, \u201c\u2026 we were thinking about threats such as dishonest candidates. Everything changed in 2016. Threats by nation-states are now much more serious.\u201d Halderman testified only months after media outlets revealed that Russia had attempted cyber-attacks on election systems in 39 states before the 2016 presidential election. He could not have known that Trump and colleagues would be indicted five years later in Georgia. Still, Totenberg decided at the time it was too late for Georgia to change systems due to fast-approaching midterm elections. A year later, in 2019, the judge gave an unprecedented order, directing the state to stop using its machines altogether, which led the then secretary of state, Brian Kemp, to form a commission on choosing a new system. The commission ignored its sole cybersecurity expert, Georgia Tech computer science professor Wenke Lee, who counseled against implementing a new touchscreen system except where needed for voters with disabilities, and in favor of using hand-marked paper ballots \u2013 mirroring the position of plaintiffs in the current case. Instead, the state spent close to $150m on the computerized system currently in use, made by Dominion. Meanwhile, Marks and fellow plaintiffs amended their complaint more than once. In July, 2021, Halderman and Drew Springall, a computer science professor at Auburn University, completed a 96-page report that found \u201cvulnerabilities in nearly every part of the system that is exposed to potential attackers\u201d which could allow votes to be changed, potentially affecting election outcomes in Georgia, according to Halderman\u2019s summary. The report\u2019s findings were of such concern that Totenberg ordered it sealed. A year later, in June 2022, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa), part of the homeland security department, corroborated Halderman\u2019s work. In June last year, a redacted version was released. During the same two-year period, the effort by Trump\u2019s associates to enter Coffee county\u2019s elections department and breach the state\u2019s system also occurred, followed by differing statements from Raffensperger and other state officials about when they learned of the incident and what they would do about it. \u201cThe kneejerk reaction is to circle the wagons and present an implausible response \u2026 either because they don\u2019t understand [the technical issues] or because they think no one else will,\u201d said Richard DeMillo, founder of the cybersecurity program at Georgia Tech. He has filed amicus briefs in the case. The pattern has continued with Halderman\u2019s findings and the Coffee county incident; the state has described both as being of little concern given the state\u2019s security practices and procedures. Halderman\u2019s report benefited from court-ordered access to the Dominion touchscreen machines used in Georgia \u2013 resulting in what he described in writing as the first study in more than a decade to assess the cybersecurity of a widely used US voting machine. Nonetheless, Mike Hassinger, a spokesperson for Raffensperger, told the Guardian in a June email that addressing Halderman\u2019s findings \u201cforces me into the Dumb and Dumber paradox. Every time I describe something as \u2018theoretical but highly unlikely\u2019, your response is, \u2018So, you\u2019re telling me there\u2019s a chance!\u2019 It\u2019s a no-win situation.\u201d Hassinger went on to conflate the work of Halderman, an experienced computer scientist, with the opinions of Trump-following election deniers. In the upcoming trial, \u201cthe federal court could clarify for the public \u2026 what the real science and technology is, versus what some group says,\u201d DeMillo said. If Totenberg decides to enjoin the state from using its computer touchscreens in the upcoming (and future) elections, \u201cthe result could be used to throw out BMDs in counties across the country,\u201d the veteran computer scientist added \u2013 \u201cplaces like Pennsylvania, Texas, California and Colorado.\u201d Such a decision could also affect places that are considering using such technologies, said Marks. \u201cThey will think twice, and ask themselves, \u2018Do we really want to hold an election that a federal court said is unconstitutional?\u2019\u201d"

            "date": "2024-01-27T23:00:05Z",
            "content": "Who is the hacker being linked to the Medibank cyberattack? The government has named 33-year-old Aleksandr Gennadievich Ermakov, a Russian citizen, IT worker and alleged cybercriminal, in new sanctions legislation in connection with the most damaging cyberattack on Australians in 2022. When the UK, the US and Australia announced sanctions against him this week over the ransom attack, they released details of several aliases he operated under. Experts have now pieced together the online history of the accounts said to be linked to Ermakov, revealing a broader picture of his alleged cybercrime activity in the years leading up to the Medibank attack. Cybercrime-for-hire The hack on Medibank resulted in the personal details of 9.7 million current and former customers \u2013 including 5.1 million Medibank customers, 2.8 million ahm customers and 1.8 million international customers \u2013 being published on the dark web. Additionally, health claims for about 160,000 Medibank customers, 300,000 ahm customers and 20,000 international customers were accessed. The information included service provider names and codes associated with diagnosis and procedures. While the Optus hack drew the bulk of media attention in 2022, the Medibank was much worse in terms of the kind and scale of data exposed. It\u2019s unclear from government information what exactly Ermakov\u2019s alleged role was, but experts suggest he may be one of a group of attackers. When the Australian government published its sanction notice under its relatively new Magnitsky-type powers, it listed four usernames Ermakov was also known as: GustaveDore, aiiis_ermak, blade_runner and JimJones. Cybersecurity firm Intel471 pieced together the online history of the accounts, finding they had been active on cybercrime forums and in the cybercrime-for-hire economy, both as buyers and providers of ransomware. Intel471 said that an account named JimJones advertised a malware development service on the Exploit forum in September 2020 and sought investors for ransomware development, claiming they would provide \u201cready-to-use\u201d malware, with Jimjones taking 5% of ransoms paid. Although it is the same username it is not clear whether Ermakov himself was behind the account or these posts and the Guardian has been unable to contact him for comment. Intel471 say they found evidence that the account also began seeking to hire unethical penetration testers \u2013 security workers who are hired by businesses to find network weaknesses before hackers do \u2013 specifically seeking the supply of login credentials that would allow ransomware attacks to be launched. The home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, alleged this week that Ermakov was believed to be a member of the REvil Russian ransomware group. However, it is unclear what ties he may have had to the group. Intel417 analysed ransomware used by JimJones and associated threat actors and found it was ransomware developed by REvil, and the dark web blog where Medibank ransom demands and data were posted was one that had once been controlled by REvil. But the 2022 Medibank breach happened after the Russian security agency, the FSB, cracked down on REvil and the group\u2019s activities ceased online. Intel471 suggested this meant the Medibank hacker was likely an associate of that group, rather than a member. The hackers were allegedly seeking US$10m from Medibank but the ransom was never paid. The Australian government launched a \u201chack the hackers\u201d taskforce, and the Australian Signals Directorate, the Australian Federal Police and companies such as Microsoft and CyberCX worked quickly to identify who they believed to be behind the attack. In late 2022, due to what the acting director general of ASD, Abi Bradshaw, told Nine News this week was \u201csloppy tradecraft\u201d, they identified the alleged hacker. The AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, said in November 2022: \u201cWe know who you are.\u201d The organisation sought the cooperation of Russian law enforcement, but it would take more than a year before the sanction was announced. Naming and shaming CyberCX\u2019s chief strategy officer, Alistair MacGibbon, told Guardian Australia it was appropriate that police attempt to get cooperation from Russian authorities in the first instance. He said the next step could be criminal charges against Ermakov, albeit in absentia. In the meantime, sanctions make it illegal to provide assets to Aleksandr Ermakov, or to use or deal with his assets, including through cryptocurrency wallets or ransomware payments. Bradshaw said on Tuesday the naming would harm his ability to do business. Intel471 analyst Jeremy Kirk said sanctions make things much harder. \u201cNaming-and-shaming actions like the government did in this case also raise [alleged] cybercriminals\u2019 profiles,\u201d he said. \u201cEven in countries that are a safe haven for [alleged] cybercriminals, being prominently identified as one isn\u2019t desirable. It makes continuing operations more difficult, as others in the cybercriminal world are reluctant to starting working with someone who is closely monitored.\u201d MacGibbon said it would hurt Ermakov outside of Russia. \u201cThe[y] hope to be able to have assets and holidays and other things in other locations,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this dramatically reduces the utility of whatever money [Ermakov] has made.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a significant move in the right direction by Australia to put pressure on him.\u201d MacGibbon said if criminal charges are later made against Ermakov, it would be harder to travel. \u201cThe criminal law doesn\u2019t have to necessarily reach into Russia for this guy to get caught at some stage because if he goes outside Russia and he goes to a cooperating third country, which often people do, and the Australian government and its allies find out he will be in a world of hurt.\u201d MacGibbon said the decision to name the alleged cybercriminal showed a maturity in the Australian government\u2019s handling of cybersecurity. \u201cWe celebrate that the Australian government has taken this action \u2026 for far too long people seem to think is just some guy in a basement with a hoodie on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt actually gives a sense of comfort that people can be identified.\u201d"

            "content": "The Republican primaries are under way and \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 the candidates have been ganging up on Bidenomics. Spoiler alert: they don\u2019t like it. Fact check: they are wrong. To a man \u2013 and one woman \u2013 the Republican candidates all say that the US economy is bad and that Americans are struggling financially. They\u2019re warning about sky-high deficits, over-the-top government spending and a potentially catastrophic level of national debt. They point out that interest rates are at a 20-year high and the costs of core things like food, gas and housing are significantly more than they were just a few years ago. They point to a downturn in manufacturing and falling small business confidence. \u201cBidenomics is crushing American families,\u201d said the Republican candidate Nikki Haley. \u201cWe\u2019re paying more for gas, groceries and other basic necessities.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll rip up Bidenomics on day one of my presidency,\u201d the Florida governor and presidential challenger Ron DeSantis warned. Yes, prices and rates are up. But really? Is the economy so bad? I\u2019m a Republican and a small business owner with hundreds of clients in many industries and honestly the economy isn\u2019t that bad. In fact, it\u2019s been really, really good. Just ask Donald Trump, who implicitly admitted this when he recently said he hoped for a \u201ccrash\u201d and that it would \u201cbe in the next 12 months because I don\u2019t want to be Herbert Hoover\u201d. If you don\u2019t believe me, just look at the numbers. Last quarter\u2019s gross domestic product showed growth of 5.2%. That\u2019s a number that dwarfs all other pre-Covid recovery numbers in recent memory. Unemployment is at a record low. Each month the economy is adding hundreds of thousands of new jobs. There are millions of more open jobs available today compared with 2019. Yes, prices are higher, but inflation is down from a 9% annual rate to about 3%, so whatever the Federal Reserve did to offset the treasury\u2019s spending on fiscal programs seems to be working. The stock market is near all-time highs, as is household wealth. Credit card delinquency rates are lower than they\u2019ve been for the past 30 years as are delinquencies on all loans across the banking system. Holiday retail sales were strong and online sales boomed. Plenty of capital is available for businesses that need it and corporations have more cash on hand than in any year before the pandemic. I speak to dozens of industry associations each year and here\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing: just about everyone had a good 2023. The CEOs of our major banks reported strong earnings, after taking into consideration special assessments and one-time charges. Retailers and restaurants have recovered from the pandemic. Convention traffic in Vegas is back to normal. There are almost as many travelers through the airports as there were before Covid. Businesses in the service industries recorded their 12th consecutive month of growth. Sure, there are struggles. Businesses in the real estate industry are challenged by high housing prices and a 13-year low in home sales. Manufacturing has been in contraction for the past 14 months. Media companies are flailing. Technology firms are struggling to find financing. The cost of capital is slowing down financing for small businesses. However, we live in a giant country. California\u2019s economy is as large as that of the entire United Kingdom. North Carolina\u2019s economy is bigger than Sweden\u2019s. Texas\u2019s is bigger than Canada\u2019s. Not every business is going to be doing well in an economy this size. There will always be those that are struggling, be it because of their location, their industry, or the makeup of their customer and supplier base. There are plenty of things that could knock things off course in 2024. Wars. Oil prices. A terrorist attack. Another pandemic. If you want to find the bad in the economy you can do it. And that\u2019s what all the Republican candidates are doing and fair enough, it\u2019s an election year. It\u2019s also true that Bidenomics may not be the reason behind our strong economy. But saying the US economy is bad just isn\u2019t true no matter who you vote for."

            "date": "2024-01-24T14:08:02Z",
            "content": "This November\u2019s presidential election ought to be a doddle for Joe Biden. Fears of recession have receded. More Americans have jobs than ever before. Inflation is on a downward trend. Interest rates will be cut soon. The US economy is comfortably the fastest growing in the G7 group of leading industrial nations. Share prices are at a record high. It is the sort of record Rishi Sunak would die for. Yet here\u2019s a strange thing. As the prospects for the economy have brightened over the past 12 months or so, Biden\u2019s approval ratings have steadily fallen \u2013 from 53% to just under 40%. The polls suggest Donald Trump \u2013 who won the support of Republicans in the New Hampshire primary \u2013 is on course to return to the White House. When he was advising Bill Clinton during the 1992 presidential race, James Carville famously said: \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d \u2013 and back then it was. The then sitting president, George Bush Sr, was struggling because the US had been in a mild recession on his watch and he had raised taxes after promising not to do so. But there has been no recession under Biden. By almost every yardstick, the US economy is in pretty good shape, yet Americans don\u2019t seem in the least bit grateful to their president. It is too early to write off Biden. He is only just behind Trump in the national opinion polls, and the incumbency factor should give him a boost as election day approaches. As things stand, a Biden-Trump race (assuming that is the eventual contest) looks like it will be a lot closer than the one between Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer. Even so, Biden is clearly struggling to get his message across and it is worth exploring why that is. One obvious explanation is that the US, like just about every other developed country, has been through a cost of living crisis that has resulted in sharply higher interest rates from its central bank, the Federal Reserve. The US was less exposed than western Europe to the higher energy prices prompted by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, but it still cost a lot more for motorists to fill up their tanks. Food prices also rose sharply, as did the cost of a mortgage. The upshot of all that was that Americans felt they personally were worse off last year. Even though the economy was growing, it didn\u2019t feel like that to individuals paying more for life\u2019s basics. The US annual inflation rate peaked in the summer of 2022 at 9.1% and \u2013 despite the odd bump in the road \u2013 has been falling ever since. It currently stands at 3.4%, prompting speculation on Wall Street that the Fed will start to cut interest rates in the spring. Falling inflation has started to affect consumer confidence. Voters are starting to feel more upbeat about the direction of the economy and, while that has yet to translate into a more favourable opinion of the president, Biden will be hopeful that he will reap a political benefit. But he may not. Perception matters, and the perception many Americans have is that inflation is rising not falling and they are becoming worse off when the opposite is true. Negative feelings about the economy are much more pronounced among Republicans than Democrats, which suggests that views about the economy are being formed by non-economic factors. If you think Biden is too old and unfit to be president, then how can the economy possibly be doing well? Britain\u2019s election looks like it will take place around the same time the US will be deciding who should be its president, and there are lessons for both Sunak and Starmer from Biden\u2019s travails. Of the two, the prime minister clearly has the bigger and more urgent problem. While a lot can happen between now and the autumn \u2013 the most likely date for a UK general election \u2013 Sunak is much further behind in the polls than Biden and has a much less impressive economic record to put to voters. To take one obvious example, in the third quarter of 2023 \u2013 the latest period for which data is available \u2013 the US economy grew at an annual rate of just over 5%. The UK economy contracted. According to official figures, things are starting to improve. As in the US, UK inflation is well below its peak of 11.1% and currently stands at 4%. Wages are rising faster than prices, which means living standards for the country as a whole are on the up. For the first time in two years, the spending power of households has increased. Yet unless there is a wholly improbable boom between now and polling day, the average Briton will be worse off at the end of this parliament than they were at its commencement. If Biden is struggling to be re-elected, imagine how much more difficult it will be for Sunak. The state of the economy currently tops the list of voter concerns in the UK, but they are also worried about other things \u2013 such as the NHS, migration and housing. Taxes might be at their highest level since the 1940s, but looking at the shabby state of the public realm voters don\u2019t think they are getting enough for their money. And that\u2019s the lesson for Starmer. His pitch to the electorate is that Labour under his premiership will increase the economy\u2019s growth rate, freeing up resources and obviating the necessity for tough choices on tax. But even if he pulls off this devilishly difficult trick, the message from the other side of the Atlantic is that growth on its own is not enough.

            "content": "Wall Street has opened flat to slightly higher after stronger-than-expected US jobs data. The Dow Jones was little changed while the Nasdaq edged 0.2% higher and the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.3%. Over here, the FTSE 100 index is 0.4% lower while the German and French markets are down 0.3% and 0.6% respectively. The US workforce added 216,000 jobs last month, more than expected by economists, capping another robust year of growth in the face of higher interest rates. Policymakers, weighing when to start cutting borrowing costs, are closely monitoring the strength of the labor market as they try to guide the world\u2019s largest economy to a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d, where price growth normalizes and recession is avoided. American employers had been expected by economists to add about 164,000 jobs in December. Recruitment across the public, healthcare, social assistance and construction sectors helped drive growth as 2023 drew to a close. However, the increases in US jobs in October and November were revised lower by a combined 71,000. Inflation across the eurozone rose in December after an increase in energy costs, reversing six months of consecutive falls and easing the pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut interest rates. Figures from the EU statistical agency Eurostat showed consumer prices across the 20-country bloc rose at an annual rate of 2.9% last month, up from 2.4% in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a slightly higher reading of 3% for December. The increase in the headline rate comes after the end of government support for utility costs, alongside a smaller annual decline in energy prices in December than in November connected to last year\u2019s one-off subsidy in Germany. Thank you for reading the blog. Have a great weekend! We\u2019ll be back next week. \u2013 JK NatWest Group chairman Sir Howard Davies has released a sort of mea culpa, a statement to clarify his earlier remarks that it\u2019s not \u201cthat difficult\u201d to buy a home and people just have to save for it. He said he \u201cdid not intend to underplay the serious challenges\u201d people face buying homes. The interview on radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning provoked outrage, including from campaign group Generation Rent. Critics said his claims showed he was out of touch with the reality faced by many people trying to buy a home. Clarifying his remarks, Davies said: Given recent rate movements by lenders there are some early green shoots in mortgage pricing and while funding remains strong, my comment was meant to reflect that in this context access to mortgages is less difficult than it has been. I fully realise it did not come across in that way for listeners and as I said on the programme, I do recognise how difficult it is for people buying a home and I did not intend to underplay the serious challenges they face. People have to save much more than they did in the past and that is tough for first-time buyers. The role for banks in today\u2019s environment is to lend responsibly and support customers to build a savings habit and move towards home ownership. Torsten Bell, who runs the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the time required to save for a typical first-time buyer deposit has spiralled in recent years. The dollar has given up the gains made since the US jobs numbers were released, as people realised they are not as strong as it first seemed. The greenback is now flat against the pound and the euro, after jumping 0.5% and 0.6% respectively when the data came out just under an hour ago. While employers hired 216,000 people in December, more than the 170,000 expected by Wall Street, the November and October increases in jobs were revised down by a total 71,000. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7%. Axel Merk, founder of Merk Investments, said: Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: There are a few vital signs officials can monitor when trying to diagnose the health of the economy, and the labour market is a crucial one. Developments show that the US labour market isn\u2019t losing steam, ultimately suggesting that economic activity will need a heavier hand to slow it down. That could see interest rate cuts across the pond pushed further out than hoped \u2013 bad news for the market, which until recently was pricing in heavy cuts this year. The data has short-term implications, but the bigger question looks to the future. The resilience shown by the US labour market has been markedly stronger than predicted, which makes bringing things in line without triggering a rock-hard landing becomes a much more delicate task. 2023 overall was a bumper year for the labour market, and the overall temperature is still too hot to be fully comfortable. There\u2019s every chance the Federal Reserve will demand a run of softer macro readings before hitting the rewind button on rates. It shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that the rate of labour growth is slowing, which is a step in the right direction, but there\u2019s work to be done. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said: The slightly bigger-than-expected 216,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in December coupled with a second consecutive 0.4% m/m gain in average hourly earnings means that this labour market report will trigger a further paring back of expectations for a March rate cut. At this stage, however, all that really matters for the Fed is the CPI and PPI data, due next week, which we expect to be more supportive of early action from the Fed. The 216,000 gain last month, was not quite as good as it looks at first glance. Gains in the preceding two months were revised down by a cumulative 71,000. The increase in December was once again concentrated in only a few non-cyclical sectors, with government employment rising by 52,000 and health &amp; social assistance employment up by 59,000. To the extent that it is still a leading indicator of broader employment trends, the 33,000 decline in temporary jobs is also a concern. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.7%, but only because a 676,000 drop back in the size of the labour force almost kept pace with a 683,000 decline in the household survey measure of employment. Those declines more than offset the big gains in November, meaning that both are now below the October levels. With the unemployment rate still muted, December brought a second consecutive 0.4% m/m gain in average hourly earnings, which was enough to push the annual rate back up to 4.1%, from 4.0%. The dollar jumped after the stronger-than-expected increase in US jobs in December, as this suggests the Federal Reserve won\u2019t be in a rush to interest rates. The dollar index hit 103.10, a fresh two-week high, and is now at 102.75, up 0.3%. The greenback strengthened as much as 0.5% against sterling and 0.6% against the euro. It is now trading 0.2% higher against the pound at $1.2650 and against the euro at $1.0917. Some 52,000 new jobs were in government while 164,000 came from the private sector. Here is our full story on the figures: However, Peter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, tweeted: NEWSFLASH: The US economy added 216,000 jobs last month, more than expected, although the November and October increases were revised lower. Economists had expected an increase between 150,000 and 170,000. November\u2019s rise was revised to 173,000 from 199,000 while the October figure was also revised lower, to 105,000 from 150,000, according to the US Labor Department. The unemployment rate stayed at 3.7%, while analysts had expected an uptick to 3.8%. In the meantime, shares in London-listed Revolution Bars have plunged nearly 20% after the company said it would shut eight of its worst-performing bars to reduce future site losses. The company\u2019s bars and pubs trade under the Revolution, Revoluci\u00f3n de Cuba and Peach Pubs brands. The closed bars are: Revolution Bars in Beaconsfield, Derby, Reading, St Peters Liverpool and Wilmslow, Revoluci\u00f3n de Cubas in Sheffield and Southampton and the Playhouse in Newcastle-Under-Lyme. Negotiations for five of the eight bars have already begun for them to be transferred to other operators or their leases rescinded. The closures come despite a 9% rise in like-for-like sales in the four weeks from 4 to 31 December, the group\u2019s best festive period since 2019. But it is worried about the current macro-economic conditions. Like-for-like sales for the first half, including New Year\u2019s Eve, were on an improving trend but remained negative, with a decline of 2.8%. Rob Pitcher, chief executive of Revolution Bars Group, said: We have had the best festive trading period for four years with all of our brands recording positive like for like sales and Revoluci\u00f3n de Cuba being the standout performer. However, our younger customers are still feeling the disproportionate effect of the cost-of-living crisis and the national living wage will increase materially in April 2024. Therefore, we have taken the difficult yet ultimately beneficial step for the Group to close several bars which are unprofitable. Less than 10 minutes to go until non-farm payrolls, a key US jobs report, for December. We are expecting an 150,000 increase in jobs after November\u2019s 199,000. The dollar is rising ahead of the data, heading for its steepest weekly rise since May, as traders are scaling back expectations of early US interest rate cuts this year. The dollar is up 0.2% against a basket of currencies, after touching a fresh three-week high. The index is up 1.3% this week so far, its strongest performance since the week to 15 May. The chair of NatWest Group, Sir Howard Davies, has been criticised as being out of touch, after he said it was not \u201cthat difficult\u201d buy a house at the moment. The campaign group Generation Rent said Davies\u2019s comments were \u201castounding to hear from a senior banker\u201d. Here is our full story: Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank, tweeted: If your home has been flooded, here\u2019s the ABI\u2019s six flood recovery steps: Step 1 - Contact your insurer as soon as possible. They will advise you on arranging emergency accommodation if necessary (or any temporary alternative trading premises if you are a business with business interruption cover), the information they will need from you to support your claim, and how to go ahead with the immediate clean-up and repair process. Step 2 - Assessing the damage and finding temporary accommodation. A loss adjuster will be appointed to assess the claim. An initial assessment of the damage will be done, the repair process explained and the options for alternative accommodation outlined. You should expect to hear from your loss adjuster after contacting your insurer and they will get in touch if they need to arrange a visit to your home. Step 3 - Cleaning and stripping out. Your loss adjuster will organise the cleaning and stripping out of your home. This work should start within four weeks of discussing it with your loss adjuster. Step 4 - Disinfecting and drying your home. Your insurer or loss adjuster will appoint a drying company to disinfect and dry out your home. This can take from a few weeks to several months. Your loss adjuster will give you a timetable and keep you informed. Step 5 - Repair and reconstruction. Repair work should begin shortly after you get your drying certificate from the drying company. Your loss adjuster will appoint a builder to do the repair and reconstruction work and will keep you updated on expected timeframes. Step 6 - Moving back into your home. Your insurer or loss adjuster will discuss with you when you can return home. Depending on how badly damaged your home is, this can be between a few weeks and a year or more after the flood. Some insurers will provide \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d which offers homeowners the chance to install Property Flood Resilience measures up to the value of \u00a310,000 when repairing their properties after a flood. Speak to your insurer about whether you are eligible. The ABI\u2019s guide is here. Here is some insurance advice for homeowners and businesses who have been affected by flooding and storm Henk, from the Association of British Insurers. Damage caused by floods and storm is covered by most standard home insurance and commercial business policies, and comprehensive motor insurance. Louise Clark, general insurance policy adviser at the industry body, said: Insurers expect bad weather to strike at any time and events such as this are exactly what your insurance is for. Their priority right now is to help any affected customers recover as quickly as possible. If you have been affected by flooding, contact your insurer as soon as you can and they will be able to offer help and advice. If you have suffered storm damage: \u00b7 Contact your insurer as soon as possible. Most will have 24-hour emergency helplines to ensure you get advice on what to do and arrange repairs as quickly as is possible. \u00b7 If necessary, arrange temporary emergency repairs to stop any damage getting worse, but speak to your insurer first. If you have to arrange emergency repairs yourself, tell your insurer and keep any receipts, as this will form part of your claim. \u00b7 Do not be in a rush to throw away damaged items, unless they are a danger to health, as these may be able to be repaired or restored. Your insurer will advise. If your home is uninhabitable while repairs are being carried out your insurer will arrange for, and pay the cost of, any alternative temporary accommodation you may need in line with your policy. Commercial polices will cover damage to premises and stock. Business interruption cover (which may be included or purchased separately) will cover additional trading costs, such as hiring temporary alternative trading premises if necessary. Here is the guidance in full. The downturn in the UK\u2019s construction sector eased last month to the slowest rate of decline since September, according to a survey. A sustained slump in house building was the main factor holding back construction output, which firms linked to elevated interest rates and subdued confidence among clients. The headline purchasing managers\u2019 index, which tracks changes in industry activity, rose to 46.8 in December from 45.5 in November. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction. Improving supply conditions meant delivery times for construction items shortened for the tenth month in a row. Price discounting among suppliers contributed to a moderate fall in average cost burdens across the construction sector at the end of 2023. Tim Moore, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, which compiles the survey said: Construction companies experienced another fall in business activity at the end of 2023 as weak order books meant a lack of new work to replace completed projects. House building was the worst-performing area of construction activity, but even in this segment there were signs that the downturn has started to ease. \u201c Elevated borrowing costs and a subsequent slump in market confidence were the main factors leading to falling sales volumes across the construction sector in the second half of 2023. Survey respondents also continued to cite worries about the broader UK economic outlook, especially in relation to prospects for commercial construction. However, expectations of falling interest rates during the months ahead appear to have supported confidence levels among construction companies. December data indicated that 41% of construction firms predict a rise in business activity over the course of 2024, while only 17% forecast a decline. This contrasted with negative sentiment overall at the same time a year earlier. Industry expert Noble Francis tweeted: The December uptick in eurozone inflation will prove temporary, says Nicola Nobile, chief Italy economist at Oxford Economics. As anticipated by yesterday\u2019s national numbers, eurozone inflation rate increased in December. But this was mainly driven by the energy component. German energy inflation, up to 4% was the main culprit as energy inflation was impacted by a strong base effect from the one-off gas price break in December 2022. Apart from energy, all the other components continued their disinflationary trend. Although some of the components, such as food remain elevated and subject to some volatility, the disinflation dynamic is still quite clear. Food inflation (which also includes alcohol and tobacco) was at 6.1% in December, down from around 10% in the summer. Moreover, the second monthly increase in unprocessed foods inflation was very likely driven by unfavourable weather conditions and hence should soon readjust downwards. Core inflation dropped to 3.4%, from 3.6% in November, driven by a decrease in non-energy industrial goods inflation. Services inflation remained at 4% over the year, but also in this area the monthly dynamic offers some optimism. The 0.7% m/m increase in services inflation is a touch lower than the 2010-2019 average December monthly increase\u2026 Overall, apart from the monthly volatility, this was another encouraging inflation report and further confirms that a quick disinflationary process is underway. But today\u2019s print will not offer any major insights on the ECB easing cycle. We expect that the January inflation print will be much more informative, as large price adjustments typically happen at the start of the year, with this year\u2019s January print also impacted by the end of the energy-related fiscal measures in some countries. We will follow up on this specifically in forthcoming research. Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at ING, said: The increase in headline inflation was mainly driven by energy base effects in Germany. The core inflation rate dropped from 3.6 to 3.4%, indicating that the underlying trend in inflation remains relatively benign for the moment. Food inflation also continued to trend down rapidly. Inflationary pressures made way for disinflation over the course of 2023 as demand weakened and supply shocks faded. This has brought inflation down more than expected at the start of last year. Currently though, base effects from easing supply shocks are moderating and some new inflationary concerns are surfacing. Think of the increased supply chain concerns related to the Red Sea. Besides that, German government measures are also adding to inflation for 2024. The European Central Bank\u2019s mantra has always been that the last leg is the hardest. Is this what we are currently witnessing? Don\u2019t overestimate the inflationary pressures for now though. Demand remains weak, which is a very important disinflationary driver right now. Also, inventories are high, making current supply chain concerns much less inflationary than the ones from 2021. And even though energy price shocks related to the Middle East are a clear risk to the outlook, oil prices are currently still below US$80 per barrel. So overall, the outlook for inflation continues to be quite benign and we expect eurozone inflation to be around 2% again by the end of the year. And what does this mean for interest rates? Current inflationary developments therefore seem to support our view that recent market expectations of a first-quarter hike are premature, but don\u2019t think that we\u2019re back to \u2018higher for longer\u2019 either. We expect the ECB to start cautiously cutting rates from June onwards, with 75bp in total for 2024. Sir Howard Davies, chair of NatWest Group, has caused a bit of a stir with his comments this morning that it\u2019s not \u201cthat difficult\u201d for people to get on the housing ladder. He said on BBC radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that difficult at the moment [to buy a house]. You have to save, and that\u2019s the way it always used to be\u2026 But what we saw in the financial crisis was the risk of having people being able to borrow 100% In order to get onto the property ladder and then suffering severe falls in the equity value of their houses and having to leave and having a bad credit record etc. So there were dangers in very, very easy access to mortgage credit. So I totally recognise that there are people who find it very difficult to start the process. They will have to save more. But that is, I think, inherent in the change in the financial system, as a result of the mistakes that were made in the last global financial crisis and we have to accept we\u2019re still living with that. The number of new cars registered in the UK has jumped by nearly 18% but electric vehicle demand is flatlining, prompting the industry to call for a VAT cut to stimulate sales. Annual figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) on Friday show 1.9m new cars were registered last year, well up on the previous year\u2019s figure of 1.6m and the highest level since the 2.3m registrations of 2019. The increase is a boost for the automotive industry after the pandemic led to supply chain problems and a shortage of vital computer chips that slowed production. Across the year, 315,000 new battery electric vehicles were sold. That was 50,000 more than 2022, but the number being bought as a share of total registrations failed to grow as expected. They represented just 16.5% of the total, slightly down on last year\u2019s 16.6%. Inflation in the eurozone has risen again and could go higher in the coming months, which makes early interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank less likely. Inflation across the 20-nation bloc rose to 2.9% in December from November\u2019s two-year low of 2.4% because of a reduction of government subsidies on gas, electricity and food. The data are in line with the ECB\u2019s expectation that inflation bottomed out in November. The central bank is projecting that price growth will range between 2.5% and 3% through 2024, well above its 2% target, before slowing again next year. However, underlying inflation \u2013 price growth excluding food and energy which tend to be volatile \u2013 eased to 3.4% from 3.6%. The ECB, which next meets on 25 January to discuss monetary policy, pushed back against investor expectations of imminent rate cuts last month. It wants to see wage pressures cool first to ensure infation is on track to fall back to its target. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Finalto Financial Services, said: European stock markets slipped in early trading, pushing the main indices firmly into the red in the first week of trading in 2024 as the data paints a picture of weakening economic activity and higher inflation. Weak PMI data for the euro area was confirmed, whilst German consumer inflation surged higher as energy subsidies faded. German\u2019s inflation hit 3.8% in December, up from 2.3% in Nov. Final inflation data for the Eurozone as a whole is due at 10am, expected up to 3.0% from 2.4%. Meanwhile FOMC minutes earlier this week suggested the Fed is not quite so close to cutting rates; the US 10-year Treasury yield broke above 4%, helping the dollar hit its highest since the middle of December and keeping the pressure on risk assets. Shares in London, Frankfurt and Paris all retreated on Friday morning, with the US jobs report in focus. The Nasdaq notched its fifth straight daily decline on Thursday, whilst the S&amp;P 500 dropped for a fourth session in a row with Apple suffering again on another downgrade. For the week, the FTSE 100 is off about three-quarters of a percent, held up relative to peers with oil firmer, whilst the Dax is down 1.4% and CAC is 2% lower with luxury taking a bit of a bashing on China fears. On the financial markets, stocks are falling while crude oil prices have risen more than 1% amid tensions in the Middle East. Brent crude futures are up 87 cents at $78.46 a barrel while US light crude is 97 cents ahead at $73.16 a barrel. US secretary of state Antony Blinken is heading to the Middle East for a week of diplomacy to try and prevent the Israel-Gaza conflict from widening. You can read more here: Attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen on commercial ships in the Red Sea have also triggered supply concerns. On the stock markets , the FTSE 100 index has fallen nearly 67 points, or 0.9%, to 7,656, as optimism about interest rate cuts fades. Germany\u2019s Dax is down 105 points, or 0.6%, at 16,513 while France\u2019s CAC has lost 66 points, a 0.9% drop to 7,384. Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has shed 184 points, or 0.6%, to 30,221. Sir Howard Davies, who chairs NatWest, has warned that we we could see a \u201crather slow reduction in interest rates\u201d this year because \u201cwage expectations are quite high\u201d. Speaking on radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he explained why lenders have already started to cut mortgage rates in a fierce price war. As financial markets are now expecting a series of rate cuts from the Bank of England this year, therefore you can, as a bank, fix your interest rate at a slightly lower level than you could even a couple of months ago. And it\u2019s that fixing of the rates in the market that determines what we can offer to customers. So the market expectations of rates are falling, therefore, we can pass that on to people who want a new mortgage. He said because the Bank of England was criticised for being slow to raise interest rates when inflation shot up mainly due to higher energy and food prices, policymakers will be careful when they reduce borrowing costs. Even at the last meeting in December, three of the nine members of the [rate-setting] committee still voted for a further increase in rates. So they\u2019re quite a long way away at the moment from a majority in favour of a reduction in rates. And there is a risk of that, having been burned once by reacting too slowly. They are now going to be rather cautious in coming down. It\u2019s likely that we will see a rather slow reduction in rates during the year. They will of course be influenced by what is going on in retail prices, not rising anything like as rapidly as they were, but still wage expectations are quite high and that if you read the recent speeches from the Bank of England, thats what\u2019s worrying them the most. Here\u2019s a lookahead to what 2024 might bring in the housing market: The EY Item Club forecasting group said the 1.1% month-on-month rise in the Halifax measure of house prices in December capped off a year when values proved much more resilient than forecasters had expected. An average of the Halifax and Nationwide measures was down 1.5% in the fourth quarter on a year earlier, in contrast to consensus predictions last January of a fall of 6.5%. Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the group, said: Two factors have led to a modest correction. Firstly, unemployment has remained low. Secondly, the rise in mortgage interest rates has been much more protracted than in the past, reflecting a shift in the mortgage stock from variable to fixed rate. Both factors have kept forced sales down and limited supply. The closing months of 2023 saw a recovery in demand for properties, albeit from a low level. Mortgage approvals in December rose to a six-month high. This was probably aided by falling mortgage rates, as investors have priced in a substantial series of rate cuts by the Bank of England this year. The EY Item Club thinks this recovery should continue as mortgage rates continue to drift down and lower inflation makes for a likely more predictable macroeconomic outlook. The fact that the ratio of house prices to average earnings is down by over a tenth since the 2022 peak, reflecting a fall in prices alongside strong growth in wages, should also support demand. This can cause a lot of stress and sleepless nights. My colleague Jedidajah Otte has talked to homeowners who fear a sharp rise in mortgage payments as they come off fixed-rate deals this year. However, mortgage costs are still much higher than they have been in recent years after the Bank of England raised interest rates to 5.25% to fight stubbornly high inflation. (Financial markets expect it to cut rates to below 4% by the end of the year.) As a result, homeowners are facing a \u00a319bn increase in mortgage costs as millions more fixed-rate deals expire and borrowers are forced to renegotiate their home loans after the toughest round of interest rate increases in decades, writes our economics correspondent Richard Partington. Despite an escalating price war between lenders cutting the cost of remortgaging in recent days, economists at the US investment bank Goldman Sachs said many UK households would still experience a dramatic leap in repayments compared with the deals they were leaving behind. In what has been described as a Tory mortgage timebomb by Rishi Sunak\u2019s critics, just over 1.5m households are expected to reach the end of cheaper deals in 2024 \u2013 with an increase in annual housing costs of about \u00a31,800 for the typical family, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank. As fixed-rate deals expire and households absorb the biggest hit to their finances in the postwar age, with inflation and tax rises taking their toll on spending power, borrowers are turning to a range of measures to cope with the increased costs, from renting out rooms in their homes to drawing down pensions early and even postponing having children. Anthony Codling, housing analyst at RBC Capital markets, said: The demise of the UK housing market is somewhat over reported. The Halifax reported today that house prices rose by 1.7% in 2023, an increase of \u00a34,800. Most, including us, thought house prices would fall during 2023, and most think they will fall in 2024, but not us. With rising wages, falling inflation, falling mortgage rates, and increasing talk of election related housing stimulus packages we expect house prices to rise in 2024. Our pessimism was misplaced in 2023, and we don\u2019t want to make the same mistake twice. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. House prices in the UK rose for the third consecutive month in December, reflecting a shortage of properties on the market, according to mortgage lender Halifax. It added that with mortgage rates easing, confidence among buyers may improve in the coming months. The cost of an average home rose by 1.1% to \u00a3287,105, just over \u00a33,000 more than in November and the highest level since March, Halifax said. This comes after monthly gains of 0.6% and 1.2% in November and October. Compared with December 2022, values were up 1.7%, the first annual growth in eight months, following a 0.8% drop in November. Kim Kinnaird, director of Halifax Mortgages, said: The housing market beat expectations in 2023 and grew by 1.7% on an annual basis. The average property price is now \u00a34,800 higher than it was in December 2022. Whilst it\u2019s encouraging that we saw growth in the last three months of the year, this was preceded with property price falls for six consecutive months between April and September. The growth we have seen is likely being driven by a shortage of properties on the market, rather than the strength of buyer demand. That said, with mortgage rates continuing to ease, we may see an increase in confidence from buyers over the coming months. Across all the UK regions, Northern Ireland recorded the strongest house price growth in 2023, as properties increased in value by 4.1% to \u00a3192,153. Scotland saw property prices increase by 2.6% to \u00a3205,170. At the other end of the scale, the south east fell most sharply, houses there now average \u00a3376,804, a drop of \u00a317,755 or 4.5%. Halifax expects prices to fall by between 2% and 4% this year as many still struggle to afford the sharply higher mortgage costs compared with recent years following a series of Bank of England rate hikes. The question is when will the central bank start cutting rates? Financial markets are betting that the first reduction will come by May. Kinnaird explained: As we move through 2024, the UK property market will continue to reflect the wider economic uncertainty and buyers and sellers are likely to be naturally cautious when considering making a move. While wage growth is now above inflation, helping to ease cost of living pressures for some and improving housing affordability, interest rates are likely to remain elevated for as long as inflation remains markedly above the Bank of England\u2019s target. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: The housing market saw a remarkably strong finish to the year, as buyer and seller confidence was boosted by three consecutive interest rate holds and the growing belief that the next move in rates will be downwards. Increased competitiveness among lenders leads to lower mortgage rates and we find ourselves in the midst of a price war. With HSBC launching the headline-grabbing 3.94% five-year fix and reductions from Halifax, NatWest, TSB and other lenders, the gloves really are off. With 2023 being a disappointing year in terms of amount of business done, lenders are keen to get this year off to a cracking start. Increased competition, rates aside, may also lead to lenders broadening criteria to attract business with longer mortgage terms or greater flexibility to allow certain variable incomes. Although those remortgaging this year will still see an increase in their payments, the pain will not be as bad as it could have been. Later today we will get the US non-farm payrolls report for December, which is expected to show that the economy added 150,00 jobs following November\u2019s 199,000 increase.

            "content": "European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde has said that policymakers agreed at today\u2019s meeting that talk of interest rate cuts is \u201cpremature\u201d. Last week, she told Bloomberg in Davos that the bank could start cutting rates in the summer. The pace of US economic growth slowed in the last three months of 2023, but far less than had been expected, underlining the continued resilience of the economy. Growth slowed to an annualised rate of 3.3% from 4.9% in the third quarter. The economy grew by 2.5% in 2023, its best performance since 2021. Lloyds Banking Group is cutting around 1,600 jobs across its branch network as it shifts more services online to save money. It will also create around 830 jobs elsewhere in the bank. Britain\u2019s next government faces some of the toughest tax and spending choices for generations as it will be forced to grapple with the impact of weak growth and high debt interest payments, a leading thinktank has said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned that Jeremy Hunt\u2019s much-predicted budget tax cuts risked being reversed or paid for by spending cuts, and urged the Conservative and Labour parties to \u201clevel\u201d with voters before polling day. Our other main stories: Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Bye! \u2013 JK The government and the Bank of England will press ahead with the design of a digital pound without pledging that a \u201cBritcoin\u201d will become available to the British public. Officials at the Bank and the Treasury said a consultation exercise last year showed there was an appetite for a new method of transferring money electronically. Responding to concerns that the Bank and the government would have access to users\u2019 personal data, officials said primary legislation would safeguard digital currency users in the same way bank accounts are protected at the moment. The Treasury said it would also maintain cash in circulation after a strong backlash from among the 50,000 respondents to the consultation, including MPs, who feared paper banknotes and coins would be phased out. More than 40 countries are understood to be pursuing the development of a digital currency that is expected to rival the crypto currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are valued on independent exchanges. Supporters of the scheme, which could be launched before the end of the decade with the Bank acting as the backstop or custodian of the new digital currency, said it will allow innovation in the UK financial services sector, keeping firms in financial centres across the UK at the forefront of a global market place. Critics, including members of the House of Lords economic affairs committee, have said they have \u201cyet to hear a convincing case\u201d for why the UK needs a central bank digital currency (CBDC), while some MPs asked whether the plan is \u201ca solution in search of a problem\u201d. Simon Youel, head of policy and advocacy at research and campaign group Positive Money, said the government needed to respond to the rise of private crypto currencies. The huge response to the consultation highlights the importance of a genuinely inclusive national conversation on the future of our money, which is presently facing a rapid privatisation as cash gets replaced by electronic bank money. Colin Finlayson, fixed income investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, says the ECB may have to start cutting rates earlier than the summer. The ECB kept policy unchanged at 4%, as widely expected. Although Ms Lagarde attempted to push back on the current market expectations of rate-cuts in the coming month, she did have to concede that both underlying inflation and inflation expectations have continued to fall. With the ECB current growth outlook characterised as having risks to the downside, the market paid little attention to her attempts to dampen rate-cut enthusiasm. The ECB are guiding towards the summer at the earliest for any rate cuts to begin but we feel that they may not have the luxury of waiting that long. On the Lloyds job cuts, here is a statement from the bank: As more customers choose to manage their day-to-day banking online, it\u2019s important our people are available when it matters most. We\u2019re introducing a number of new roles and making changes to our branch teams so our customers can see us how and when they want to. Lloyds is cutting 1,600 jobs as part of a shift to more online services but is also creating 830 jobs elsewhere \u2013 \u201cin an expanded relationship growth team \u2013 part of our consumer relationships business \u2013 where colleagues will work to understand our customers\u2019 financial goals and needs and meet them through our products and services\u201d. The Accord union explains the changes in detail on its website: There will be no compulsory role reductions at grades A and B, although grade B colleagues can express an interest in voluntary redundancy. Changes to management structures will mean there will be redundancies at grade C and above. The aim is to achieve most of these reductions through voluntary redundancy. Asked whether she stands by her forecast made in December that the eurozone will avoid recession, Lagarde said the most recent PMI surveys are encouraging for the economy. People can challenge PMI numbers and they do but at least we are seeing numbers that are either to the upside or or stable\u2026 We recognise the weakness of of growth and that weakness obviously applies to Q4. You know there are multiple ways to define what is a recession, the technical terminology, two quarters in a row that that are negative is one way to look at it. I remember discussing that with my colleague and friend Janet Yellen, where the US had two quarters in a row that were negative. And when I said well, Janet, you must be in a recession and she said: \u2018What! With those unemployment numbers, forget it. We are not in recession.\u2019 So I think we have to be attentive to all sorts of data signals and understanding of the economy. This concludes the press conference. Back at the ECB in Frankfurt, chief Christine Lagarde is asked whether her comments mean that a rate cut in April is unlikely. She said: In terms of an overall evaluation of our policy trajectory, which many of you are after, we need to be further along in the disinflation process before we can be sufficiently confident that inflation will actually hit the target in a timely manner and in a sustainable way at target. So it\u2019s a disinflation process in which we are, it is working, but we need to be more advanced. and we need to be further along in that process, to be confident that inflation will be at target sustainably. So I\u2019m giving you a little indication about what I call the trajectory, but it\u2019s not forward guidance, it\u2019s trying to give you the mechanics that we will apply in our considerations when we look at data in the next few weeks. Just in: Lloyds Banking Group is cutting around 1,600 jobs across its branch network as it shifts more services online to save money. It will also create around 830 jobs elsewhere in the bank. Banks are keen to cut costs amid tough economic conditions and pressure on profit margins from competition and peaking interest rates. Rival Barclays also slashed thousands of jobs last year, with the majority in the bank\u2019s back office support division. Lagarde also said the ECB is keeping a close eye on developments in the Red Sea, where attacks on ships by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have led to ships being rerouted, and concerns about shipping delays and higher costs, which could push inflation up. We are observing very carefully because we are seeing that shipping costs are increasing, delivery delays are increasing. And while we all know that there is more shipping capacity than there was in in 2020 and 2021, we also know that costs and fees are increasing. The Q&amp;A has started. The first question is whether the governing council discussed a rate cut at today\u2019s meeting. Lagarde said: The consensus around the table of the Governing Council was that it was premature to discuss rate cuts. One other thing, which was very much a consensus around the table was that we had to continue to be data dependent. Lagarde summed up the risks to inflation: Upside risks to inflation include the heightened geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term, and hamper global trade. Inflation could also turn out higher than anticipated if wage wages increase by more than expected or profit margins prove more resilient by contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampens demand by more than expected or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsens unexpectedly. Moreover, inflation could decline more quickly in the near term if energy prices evolve in line with the recent downward shift in market expectations of the future path for oil and gas prices. Turning to inflation, ECB president Christine Lagarde said: Inflation is expected to ease further over the course of this year as the effects of past energy shocks, supply bottlenecks and the post pandemic reopening of the economy fade and tighter monetary policy continues to weigh on demand. Almost all measures of underlying inflation declined further in December. The elevated rate of wage increases and falling labour productivity are keeping domestic price pressures high, although these two have started to ease. And the growth outlook: Looking now at the risk assessment, the risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. Growth could be lower if the effects of monetary policy turn out stronger than expected. A weaker world economy or a further slowdown in global trade would also weigh on euro area growth. Russia\u2019s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East are key sources of geopolitical risks. This may result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted. Growth could be higher if rising real incomes mean spending increases by more than anticipated or if the world economy grows more strongly than expected. The pace of US economic growth slowed in the last three months of 2023, but far less than had been expected, underlining the continued resilience of the economy. The commerce department reported on Thursday that US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of economic health \u2013 grew at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the final quarter of the year, down from 4.9% in the previous quarter but in line with pre-pandemic growth, and well ahead of the 2% economists had expected. Robust consumer spending and government outlays contributed to the growth. The Federal Reserve has been attempting to cool economic activity in order to bring down inflation. Since March 2022 the Fed has increased rates to a 22-year high and held them there. Inflation has fallen from a high of 9% in June 2022 to 3.4%. The rate rises have increased the cost of borrowing and many \u2013 including the Fed \u2013 had expected a subsequent slowdown in economic activity to lead to layoffs. But so far the Fed appears to be on course for what it has termed a \u201csoft landing\u201d. Hiring has remained robust \u2013 unemployment hovers at close to a 50-year low \u2013 and while growth has slowed, consumers have continued to spend, the US economy has weathered the rate rises and stock markets have hit record highs. \u201cThe Fed \u2013 so far \u2013 has managed to strangle inflation without strangling the economy,\u201d said Dan North, senior economist with Allianz Trade Americas. North said the Fed rate rises were still working their way through the economy and he expected 2024 to be a year of slow growth \u201cbut we are not using the recession word yet.\u201d European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde has kicked off the press conference with a statement on the economy. Looking at the economic activity, the euro area economy is likely to have stagnated in the final quarter of \u201823. The incoming data continue to signal weakness in the near term. However, some forward looking server indicators point to a pickup in growth further ahead. The labour market has remained robust. The unemployment rate at 6.4% in November has fallen back to its lowest level since the start of the euro and more workers have entered the labour force. The US economy expanded more than expected in the fourth quarter, powered by consumer spending. GDP rose at a 3.3% annualised rate, according to the government\u2019s preliminary estimate, down from 4.9% in the previous quarter. This compares with market forecasts of 2.2% growth. In 2023, the economy expanded by 2.5%, its strongest performance since 2021. ECB president Christine Lagarde will hold a press conference at 1.45pm GMT. You can watch it here. The European Central Bank\u2019s governing council has kept interest rates unchanged, as expected. The ECB\u2019s rate on its main refinancing operations, which provide the bulk of liquidity to the banking system, is at 4.5%. Its deposit rate, which is paid on commercial bank deposits, is at 4%. The marginal lending facility, which offers overnight credit to banks, is at 4.75%. The central bank explained: The incoming information has broadly confirmed its previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook. Aside from an energy-related upward base effect on headline inflation, the declining trend in underlying inflation has continued, and the past interest rate increases keep being transmitted forcefully into financing conditions. Tight financing conditions are dampening demand, and this is helping to push down inflation. Ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s interest rate decision at 1.15pm GMT, Germany\u2019s 10-year bond yield rose to its highest level since early December. Germany\u2019s 10-year yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, touched a high of 2.371% earlier. Yields move inversely to prices. The central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged but investors will be looking for any hints on when borrowing costs will start to come down. The ECB\u2019s deposit rate, which is paid on commercial bank deposits, was last raised in September to 4% \u2013 the highest since the euro was launched in 1999. The rate on its main refinancing operations, which provide the bulk of liquidity to the banking system, is at 4.5%. The marginal lending facility, which offers overnight credit to banks, is at 4.75%. Jeroen Blokland, founder of Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund, tweeted: On the markets, shares are drifting lower while oil prices have risen and the pound is little changed. The FTSE 100 index is trading 14 points, or 0.2%, lower at 7,513. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 0.4%, while France\u2019s CAC is down 0.45% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has slid nearly 1% ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s interest rate decision. In the oil market, Brent crude, the global benchmark, is $1.07 higher at $81.10 a barrel, a 1.3% gain. US light crude has gained $1.11 to $76.2 a barrel, up 1.5%. Oil prices rallied after data showed US crude stockpiles fell more than expected last week, and the Chinese central bank\u2019s cut in banks\u2019 reserve requirements (the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve) raised hopes of more economic stimulus to kickstart the economy. Retail sales across the UK fell at the fastest pace in three years this month, according to an industry survey. The Confederation of British Industry\u2019s monthly retail sales balance, which measures sales volumes versus a year ago, fell to -50 in January from -32 in December, the weakest since December 2021 when Britain was in a Covid-19 lockdown. The balance measures the number of retailers who said sales volumes rose minus those who said sales fell. February won\u2019t be much better, the survey suggests. The volume of sales for this time of the year was -47, the lowest reading since May 2020. Martin Sartorius, the CBI\u2019s principal economist, said: Looking ahead, demand conditions in the sector will remain challenging as higher interest rates continue to feed through to mortgage payments and household incomes. Official figures published last week showed British retailers suffered the biggest drop in sales for almost three years in December, raising the risk that the economy slipped into recession late last year. Domino\u2019s Pizza shares have dived, wiping more than $1.5bn from the company\u2019s market value. A trifecta of problems facing the international operations of Domino\u2019s Pizza Enterprises sparked a 30% plunge in the share price of the Australian-owned company on Thursday. Domino\u2019s, which holds the branding rights in several countries of the American pizza chain, disclosed that net profit before tax for the recent six-month period was expected to be between $87m and $90m, down from almost $105m a year earlier. The shareholder response to the trading update was ruthless. Managing director Don Meij convened a call with analysts and investors, and sought to explain the troubles. \u201cIt\u2019s quite humbling to sit in front of you and to be able to share the disappointing results in part of our business today,\u201d he said on the video conference. \u201cIt really shows a rollercoaster.\u201d Norway\u2019s central bank has kept its benchmark interest rate at 4.5%, as expected, and said the cost of borrowing was likely to stay at that level \u201cfor some time ahead\u201d. The economic prospects for Norway do not appear to have changed materially since December, Norges Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee said. Norges Bank\u2019s governor Ida Wolden Bache said: The committee assesses that the policy rate is now sufficiently high to return inflation to target within a reasonable time horizon. Monetary policy is having a tightening effect, and the economy is cooling down. At the same time, business costs have increased considerably in recent years, and continued high wage growth and the crown depreciation through 2023 will likely restrain disinflation. In December, the central bank raised rates in a surprise move, even though inflation had slowed. Norway\u2019s core inflation was 5.5% in December, a 15-month low, down from a peak of 7% last June, but still above the central bank\u2019s 2% target. Economists are expecting a rate cut between July and September and another one in the final three months of 2024, which would bring the benchmark rate down to 4% by the end of the year. In the UK, the bike and car parts retailer Halfords said sales in December were much weaker than in October and November. It explained that mild and wet weather affected demand for winter products and brought fewer people into its stores, while cash-strapped customers reined in spending in the run-up to Christmas. Sales of car products fell 15.3% in December, after averaging 10.2% in October and November on a like-for-like basis (at stores open at least a year). However in January sales growth returned to those levels as conditions normalised, Halfords said. Group revenues grew by 2% in the 13 weeks to 29 December. However, cycling and consumer tyres were \u201cperforming significantly worse than anticipated and have weakened in Q3\u201d. Sales of bikes and accessories slid 1.2% in the quarter. Halfords said it performed better than the cycling market as a whole, with kids bikes sales up 5% in December. Volumes in the cycling and consumer tyres markets are below pre-pandemic levels by 28% and 14% respectively. The company is cutting costs of \u00a335m this year, more than previously flagged, and announced a partnership with the specialist tyre distributor Bond International. Graham Stapleton, the chief executive, said: Trading in Q4 has begun strongly and we remain focused on everything that we can control, with a number of initiatives underway to achieve further efficiencies within the business, as well as investing in areas where we see real opportunities for future growth. In German manufacturing, business expectations improved but remained pessimistic. Order books continue to shrink, albeit less rapidly than at the end of the year. The business climate in the service sector clouded over considerably while in trade, the index fell to its lowest level since October 2022. In construction, the business climate index also continued to slide. In Germany, business confidence worsened in January, as Europe\u2019s biggest economy remains weak. The closely watched business climate index from the Munich-based Ifo institute fell to 85.2 from 86.3 in December. The institute\u2019s president Clemens Fuest said: Companies assessed their current situation as worse. Their expectations for the months ahead were also once again more pessimistic. The German economy is stuck in recession. Technically, Germany dodged a recession at the end of last year (defined by two or more consecutive quarters of contraction). In the final quarter of last year, the German economy shrank by 0.3%, compared with the previous quarter, when output flatlined. But the economy contracted by 0.3% in 2023 and is on track for its first two-year recession since the early 2000s amid the impact of higher energy costs and weaker industrial demand. The boss of the London estate agents Foxtons, Guy Gittins, hailed a \u201ctransformational year\u201d following a turnaround plan, as it reported higher overall revenues and profits, although revenues in its sales business continued to slide. Sales revenues fell by 14% last year from 2022 while the market slumped by 22%, according to Foxtons. It said it has gone into 2024 with an under-offer pipeline far ahead of last year and expects year-on-year sales revenue growth in the first quarter, and further growth through the year. Things have improved in recent weeks. The firm explained: Buyer demand has grown as mortgage rates have begun to normalise, with good levels of growth seen in recent weeks as the first mortgage products are released with rates below 4% since the September 2022 mini-budget. Any sustained reduction in interest rates is expected to spur significant further growth in buyer demand. Total revenues rose 5% to \u00a3147m last year while adjusted operating profit edged higher to \u00a314m from \u00a313.9m. Gittins, the chief executive, has invested in the lettings business, which makes up 70% of group revenues and grew by 16%, delivering more than \u00a3100m revenue for the first time. In bad news for tenants, \u201crents are expected to stabilise and remain at historically elevated levels.\u201d Gittins, who returned to Foxtons (where he started his career) in September 2022 after running rival Chestertons, said: 2023 has been a transformational year for Foxtons, following the implementation of a refreshed strategy and operational turnaround plan. We have delivered a year of market share growth and have ended the year with revenue and adjusted operating profit ahead of market expectations; our operational upgrades and investment in fee earners, training, data and brand, coupled with a return to driving innovation in the industry, are now consistently delivering material benefits to our competitiveness and market positioning, helping us to end 2023 as the UK\u2019s fastest growing large lettings and sales agency brand. Dr Martens has been hit by lower sales in the US, as cash-strapped consumers refused to splash out for Christmas. The British bootmaker said sales made directly to customers fell 3% in the three months to the end of December, its third quarter, and wholesale revenues tumbled 46%. Overall group revenues were down 18%. The company, which was founded in 1960 in Northamptonshire, is still expecting a decline of nearly 10% over the full year (\u201chigh single-digit percentage\u201d). Kenny Wilson, the chief executive, said: This was driven by a weak USA performance, as expected. Trading in the quarter was volatile and we saw a softer December in line with trends across the industry. Whilst the consumer environment remains challenging, we are taking action to continue to grow our iconic brand and invest in our business. Labour will use its sold-out business conference next week to unveil the party\u2019s City policy plans, the Guardian can reveal, as it tries to win over hundreds of UK executives before a general election. More than 500 bosses from across British finance will gather in London on 1 February for the event, where opposition leaders including Sir Keir Starmer, his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and the shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, plan to \u201cshowcase Labour\u2019s offer to business\u201d. The party is hoping that the conference \u2013 which sold out within two hours in the autumn \u2013 will demonstrate its \u201ccommitment to work hand in glove with the business community\u201d and will use it as an opportunity to reveal its business policy plans after two major industry reviews. The Guardian understands that will include Labour\u2019s much-anticipated strategy for the City and will detail how the party plans to harness the strength of the UK\u2019s \u00a3275bn financial and professional services sector. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial market and the world economy. The next UK government will face the toughest tax and spending decisions in 70 years, according to a leading think tank. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said a combination of high interest rates and weak growth means whoever wins the general election later this year will find it \u201cmore difficult to reduce debt as a fraction of national income than in any parliament since at least the 1950s.\u201d It warned that Jeremy Hunt\u2019s much-predicted budget tax cuts \u2013 he will unveil the budget on 6 March \u2013 risk being reversed or paid for by spending cuts, and urged the Conservative and Labour parties to \u201clevel\u201d with voters before polling day. Chinese stocks rallied after a cut in Chinese bank reserve requirements, releasing about a trillian yuan for lending (nearly \u00a3111bn). The Shanghai Composite rose 3%, after hitting a four-year low on Monday, and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was up 2% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei was little changed. Investors have been selling Chinese equities for months, amid worries about the sluggish economy and the country\u2019s property crisis. The European Central Bank is meeting today and will announce its interest rate decision at lunchtime. It is not expected to change its main interest rate of 4.5%. Minutes from the December meeting showed policymakers were pushing back on aggressive market expectations for rate cuts, and ECB president Christine Lagarde is likely to face questions on their timing during the press conference. Last week, she said the central bank could cut rates in the summer, during an interview with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

            "date": "2024-01-30T12:18:10Z",
            "content": "The 20-nation eurozone has narrowly avoided recession after the region\u2019s economy flatlined at the end of 2023, official figures show. Zero growth in the single currency zone in the final quarter of last year followed a 0.1% economic contraction in the third quarter, meaning that recession \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 was just averted. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the eurozone\u2019s economy to shrink by 0.1% in the fourth quarter. The eurozone\u2019s two biggest economies both performed poorly in late 2023, with Germany contracting by 0.3% and France posting no growth for a second successive quarter, according to Eurostat, the EU\u2019s statistical agency. There was better news from the other two members of the eurozone\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d. Italy, which had been expected to stagnate, recorded growth of 0.2%, while Spain expanded by 0.6% \u2013 three times the 0.2% forecast. Of the smaller eurozone economies, Portugal grew by 0.8% in the final quarter, Austria expanded by 0.2%, while Ireland\u2019s economy contracted by 0.7% \u2013 its fourth successive quarterly fall in 2023. Eurostat said that the broader 27-nation European Union also posted no growth in the fourth quarter. From the fourth quarter of 2022 and the final quarter of 2023, the eurozone expanded by just 0.1%, while the EU grew by 0.2%. \u201cThe eurozone economy escaped recession by the skin of its teeth by the end of 2023,\u201d Diego Iscaro, head of Europe economics at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said. \u201cThe outlook for 2024 continues to be challenging amid faltering demand and increasing geopolitical tensions.\u201d The eurozone\u2019s stagnating economy will further pressurethe European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the countries in the monetary union, to start cutting borrowing costs. Bert Colijn, a senior economist at ING bank, said: \u201cA technical recession has just been avoided in the eurozone. Still, the eurozone economy has now been broadly stagnating since late 2022 and has lost substantial ground to the US in terms of GDP in recent years. After the buoyant post-pandemic reopening phase, the economy has now entered a phase of prolonged weakness.\u201d Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago, the eurozone has been struggling to cope with higher energy and food prices, and the damage caused to business and consumer confidence. The ECB raised interest rates last year to their highest level since the euro was launched in 1999. Nicola Mai, economist at asset manager Pimco, said: \u201cDespite a resilient early start in 2023, the eurozone economy was weak through much of the year, and we anticipate that this fragility will persist in 2024. \u201cThe reasons for this ongoing weakness are clear. Europe is still recovering from a lingering energy shock and has not experienced the same degree of fiscal stimulus as the more resilient US economy in recent years. The region\u2019s shorter debt maturities also mean that interest rate hikes have been felt more quickly.\u201d"

            "content": "When he was the House of Commons speaker, John Bercow developed a combative reputation \u2013 and after his tenure he was found to be a \u201cserial bully\u201d and a liar. But now as he makes his reality TV debut, the man with the famous cry of \u201corder!\u201d is seeking to use his political experience to unleash chaos. \u201cI\u2019m a retired politician,\u201d Bercow said in the season premiere of the US version of The Traitors. \u201cBackstabbing, deception are all part and parcel of the political life.\u201d Bercow joins the Love Island winner Ekin-Su C\u00fclc\u00fclo\u011flu, Tamra Judge of The Real Housewives of Orange County, Maksim Chmerkovskiy of Dancing with the Stars and Marcus Jordan \u2013 son of the basketball legend Michael Jordan \u2013 as one of 21 celebrities competing at a castle in the Scottish Highlands for a cash prize \u2013 the same venue as the UK version, broadcast by BBC. Three of the contestants have been chosen by the host, Alan Cumming, to sow chaos and purposely sabotage the others. While Bercow was not selected as a traitor, several of his fellow contestants suspected he was after he experienced \u201cbreathing difficulties\u201d during the premiere. He blamed the difficulties on asthma, but others doubted his answer. \u201cWhen you took your mask off, you said: \u2018I have asthma\u2019 but you just said: \u2018I was asthmatic as a child,\u2019\u201d said Big Brother\u2019s Janelle Pierzina. She questioned what exactly Bercow told another contestant about his breathing issues, to which he replied: \u201cLook, is asthma a lifelong condition?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not the question I\u2019m asking you,\u201d Pierzina said. \u201cYou\u2019re answering this just like a politician.\u201d In this season, Big Brother\u2019s Dan Gheesling, Phaedra Parks from The Real Housewives of Atlanta and Survivor\u2019s Parvati Shallow are the traitors, but at the end of the first episode Peppermint of Ru Paul\u2019s Drag Race was voted off. A number of the other contestants voted for Bercow, however. Bercow served as Commons speaker for 10 years, with clips of his snarky retorts and cries for \u201corder, order\u201d while arbitrating Brexit debates and PMQs gaining the politician a cult following in the US and across Europe. \u201cNo one on the British island can call \u2018order, order\u2019 more beautifully than John Bercow,\u201d the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant stated in its 2019 profile of the speaker. He quit his Commons role in 2019. An independent inquiry in 2022 found that Bercow was a \u201cserial bully\u201d and a liar and that he should be banned from holding a parliamentary pass. The former speaker was accused of throwing a mobile phone and swearing at officials, with the inquiry upholding 21 out of 35 complaints filed against him by former staff. Before the final report was published, Bercow criticised the way the inquiry was conducted, saying: \u201cTo call it a kangaroo court is unfair to kangaroos.\u201d"

            "content": "In his first speech on the House floor since winning the speaker\u2019s gavel, Mike Johnson recited familiar rightwing talking points regarding undocumented migrants, while again warning that he did not like what he was hearing about measures under discussion in the Senate to tighten immigration policy. That\u2019s a bad sign for a potential deal Republicans have demanded to support Joe Biden\u2019s request for another round of military assistance to Ukraine, and to Israel. In the Senate, Democratic majority leader Chuck Schumer made clear he did not think much of the House GOP\u2019s impeachment of homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, indicating the chamber would acquit him if a trial occurs. Here\u2019s what else happened today: Congresswoman Cori Bush demanded an apology from rightwing lawmaker Troy Nehls, who referred to her husband as a \u201cthug\u201d, and Bush as \u201cloud\u201d. Yesterday, Bush acknowledged she was under investigation by the justice department over allegedly misusing federal funds. James Biden will appear for an interview with a House committee leading the impeachment inquiry into his brother, the president. Nikki Haley says America doesn\u2019t need any more \u201cGrumpy Old Men\u201d. Rob Menendez, a Democratic House lawmaker from New Jersey, accused Republicans of kowtowing to \u201cthe orange Jesus\u201d with their charges against Mayorkas. Taylor Swift is the latest subject of a rightwing conspiracy theory. Later this evening, the House is expected to vote on a bipartisan bill that would extend tax credits for low-income families, as well as restore some tax breaks for businesses. It\u2019s unclear if it will pass the House, but the below comment, captured by Semafor, from Republican senator Chuck Grassley is raising eyebrows nonetheless. Asked about the bill\u2019s chances in Congress\u2019s upper chamber, Grassley seems to imply that passing the legislation would be a bad idea, because measures to assist poor families could boost Joe Biden\u2019s re-election chances: It\u2019s unclear how many Republican lawmakers feel the same way, but the sentiment could bode ill for Congress getting any major legislation passed prior to November\u2019s presidential election. A high-profile lawsuit filed by entertainment giant Walt Disney alleging retaliation by Florida governor Ron DeSantis has been dismissed by a federal judge, but the company appears set to file an appeal, Reuters reports: A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed Walt Disney\u2019s lawsuit against the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, and members of a state board for allegedly retaliating after the company criticized state limits on classroom discussion of sexuality, according to a court filing. \u201cThis is an important case with serious implications for the rule of law and it will not end here,\u201d a Disney spokesperson said. \u201cIf left unchallenged, this would set a dangerous precedent and give license to states to weaponize their official powers to punish the expression of political viewpoints they disagree with. We are determined to press forward with our case.\u201d DeSantis and other defendants had urged Allen Winsor, the US district judge in Tallahassee, Florida, to dismiss the case because Disney could not sue them over constitutionally enacted state laws. The dispute began after Disney criticized the classroom discussion ban, dubbed the \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d law by opponents. DeSantis began repeatedly attacking what he termed \u201cwoke Disney\u201d in public appearances as he geared up for his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, an effort he abandoned earlier this month. State lawmakers stripped Disney of its control over the special development district that since 1967 had given the company virtual autonomy around its theme parks, including the Walt Disney World Resort. In the latest clash between pro-Palestine protesters and the Biden-Harris campaign, two women claim they were kept out of an event with Kamala Harris because they were wearing hijabs. The campaign says they had disrupted other events. Here\u2019s what we know about the incident, from the Guardian\u2019s Gloria Oladipo: Two women have accused Biden-Harris campaign staffers of Islamophobia, claiming they were profiled and disinvited from a campaign event because they were wearing hijabs. Staff with the campaign have since countered that the women were barred after disrupting other events held by Democratic leaders. The incident was captured on video and shared to X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday by an account named Nevadans for Palestinian Liberation. The viral video, which has garnered over 2m views, shows an unidentified staffer for the Get the Vote Out event in Las Vegas on Saturday telling the women that they are not allowed to enter the venue. \u201cWe are choosing who\u2019s going in and out of the event. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d the staffer said. Off camera, one woman responds: \u201cWhy are you choosing us not to go in when we have an invite?\u201d A separate woman, also off camera, says: \u201cYou specifically singled us out.\u201d Speaking of Donald Trump, he\u2019s within striking distance of winning the Republican presidential nomination, but his last remaining rival, Nikki Haley, is not giving up. Today, she launched another salvo at one thing the former president and the current president have in common: their advanced age. Joe Biden is 81, Trump is 77, and both are too old for the presidency, Haley argues. She also debuted a meme that will look familiar to those fluent in early 90s cinema: Atlanta-area district attorney Fani Willis, who indicted Donald Trump and 18 others on charges related to trying to overturn Georgia\u2019s election result in 2020, has been subpoenaed to testify regarding her relationship with a prosecutor she hired for the case, ABC News reports. Ashleigh Merchant, an attorney for co-defendant Michael Roman, earlier this month accused Willis and Nathan Wade, who she hired to work on the case, of having an improper relationship that resulted in financial gain for both of them. Merchant has asked for Willis to be removed, and the indictment dismissed. Here\u2019s more on what the subpoena means, from ABC News: Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and Nathan Wade, one of her top prosecutors in the Georgia election interference case against former President Donald Trump and 18 others, have been subpoenaed to testify at an upcoming evidentiary hearing set to examine allegations that they were involved in an improper relationship while investigating the former president, according to a new lawsuit filed in Georgia this week. The claim that Willis and Wade had been subpoenaed to testify was contained in a copy of the lawsuit, obtained by ABC News, that was filed by the attorney for one of Trump\u2019s co-defendants in the election case, accusing the Fulton county district attorney\u2019s office of \u201cintentionally withholding information\u201d. The lawsuit accuses the office of \u201cstonewalling\u201d the attorney, Ashleigh Merchant, in her efforts to obtain records from the office through public information requests. In a statement to ABC News, a spokesperson for the DA\u2019s office said they had not yet been served the lawsuit, and said, \u201cWe provided her with all the materials she requested and is entitled to.\u201d In a letter sent to Merchant on Friday, provided to ABC News by the DA\u2019s office, the DA\u2019s office pushed back on her allegations that they have failed to meet their obligations, writing they \u201cdisagree with your disingenuous implication\u201d. The issuing of the subpoenas could set up a high-stakes battle for both Willis and Wade, who have remained virtually silent on the issue but may now have to testify under oath during the televised hearing on 15 February, as Trump and other co-defendants seek to use the allegations to have the two removed from the case and the indictment thrown out. Away from domestic politics, the AP is reporting that the US has attributed a drone attack that killed three American troops in Jordan to umbrella group Islamic Resistance in Iraq. James Biden will appear before House Republicans for a private interview next month as lawmakers seek to regain some momentum in their monthslong impeachment inquiry into his brother, Joe Biden, The Associated Press reports. The House Oversight and Accountability Committee announced on Wednesday that the Democratic president\u2019s younger sibling will come to Capitol Hill on February 21. The date was set after months of negotiations between the sides. We look forward to his interview,\u201d the committee posted on X, the website formerly known as Twitter. James Biden\u2019s interview will take place just days before the president\u2019s son Hunter Biden will be deposed in private by the Republican-run committee, which has been investigating the Biden family\u2019s overseas finances for the past year. Both James and Hunter Biden were subpoenaed by the committee in November. So far, the GOP investigation has failed to uncover evidence directly implicating the president in any wrongdoing. A lawyer for James Biden said at the time that there was no justification for the subpoena because the committee had already reviewed private bank records and transactions between the two brothers. The committee found records of two loans that were made when Joe Biden was not in office or a candidate for president. There is nothing more to those transactions, and there is nothing wrong with them. And Jim Biden has never involved his brother in his business dealings,\u201d lawyer Paul Fishman said in a statement in November. Joe Biden kicked his re-election campaign into high gear earlier this month. So, too, have protesters upset over his policy towards Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza, the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington reports: Joe Biden had barely started speaking at a high-profile re-election campaign rally focusing on abortion rights in Virginia last week when the carefully choreographed made-for-TV spectacle exploded into a cacophony of angry yelling. \u201cGenocide Joe!\u201d, a protester holding up a Palestinian flag cried from the back of the hall. \u201cHow many kids have you killed in Gaza? How many women have you killed in Gaza?\u201d Biden looked bemused, blinking silently into the cameras. In all, he was to be interrupted at least 13 more times. \u201cThis is going to go on for a while,\u201d he said at one point. \u201cThey\u2019ve got this planned.\u201d As Biden\u2019s 2024 re-election campaign gets under way, it is becoming increasingly clear that they have indeed got it planned. A decentralized network of pro-Palestinian groups and individuals, including Muslim Americans, Jewish Americans and anti-war organizations, are hounding Biden over his firm support for Israel despite the heavy cost in civilian lives of its war against Hamas. \u201cOur community is going to be active, with actions big or small, until this genocide ends and there\u2019s a permanent ceasefire,\u201d Mohamad Habehh told the Guardian. He was the individual who stood up and shouted: \u201cGenocide Joe!\u201d in Virginia. Habehh said that Biden should expect much more of the same as election year unfolds. \u201cEvery event the president does, no matter where it is, not matter what state or city, there will be Americans who stand against his stance on Gaza.\u201d In his first speech on the House floor since winning the speaker\u2019s gavel, Mike Johnson recited familiar rightwing talking points regarding undocumented migrants, while again warning that he did not like what he was hearing about measures under discussion in the Senate to tighten immigration policy. That\u2019s a bad sign for a potential deal Republicans have demanded to support Joe Biden\u2019s request for another round of military assistance to Ukraine, and to Israel. In the Senate, Democratic majority leader Chuck Schumer made clear he did not think much of the House GOP\u2019s impeachment of homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, indicating the chamber would acquit him if a trial occurs. Here\u2019s what else is going on: Congresswoman Cori Bush demanded an apology from rightwing lawmaker Troy Nehls, who referred to her husband as a \u201cthug\u201d, and Bush as \u201cloud\u201d. Yesterday, Bush acknowledged she was under investigation by the justice department over allegedly misusing federal funds. Rob Menendez, a Democratic House lawmaker from New Jersey, accused Republicans of kowtowing to \u201cthe orange Jesus\u201d with their charges against Mayorkas. Taylor Swift is the latest subject of a rightwing conspiracy theory. Mike Johnson reiterated his attack on the Senate\u2019s immigration policy deal, saying that, though its exact provisions have not been released yet, he does not think it would cut down on migrant arrivals to the degree he demands. \u201cLast Friday, President Biden came out in support of the Senate\u2019s deal, which we haven\u2019t seen yet. There is no text yet. But from what we\u2019ve heard, this so-called deal \u2026 does not include \u2026 these transformational policy changes that are needed to actually stop the border catastrophe,\u201d the House speaker said. He specifically took issue with reports that, under the deal\u2019s proposed terms, the border would be closed once crossings exceeded 5,000 people in a given day: Apparently, we\u2019re concocting some sort of deal to allow the president to shut down the border after 5,000 people break the law. Why is it 5,000? If you add that up, that\u2019d be a million more illegals into our country every year before we take remedial measures. It\u2019s madness. We shouldn\u2019t be asking what kind of enforcement authority kicks in at 5,000 illegal crossings a day. The number should be zero. \u201cAnything higher than zero is surrendering our border, surrendering our sovereignty and our security,\u201d Johnson said. He has now concluded his remarks. This speech by Mike Johnson has thus far amounted to a lengthy attack on the Biden administration\u2019s immigration policy, and migrants themselves. The Republican speaker said he had received a letter from former FBI officials warning of \u201ca soft invasion along our southern border\u201d, and said the migrants trying to enter the United States from Mexico \u201care not huddled masses of families seeking refuge and asylum. These are people coming into our country to do only God knows what and we are allowing it \u2013 the Biden administration is allowing it. And we\u2019ve noted that they\u2019re coming from adversarial nations, from terrorist regions. We have no idea what they\u2019re planning.\u201d Speaking out the House floor, Republican speaker Mike Johnson has again signaled he is not happy with the Senate\u2019s immigration policy negotiations. He kicked off his speech decrying the impact of undocumented immigrants on communities nationwide, before describing the Senate talks as focused on \u201ca so-called border security deal\u201d. That\u2019s not a good sign for the prospects of the deal, if one emerges, in the House, and, by extension, aid to Ukraine and Israel. Republican Mike Johnson is set to give his first speech on the floor of the House since becoming speaker, where he is expected to discuss immigration policy. Johnson has criticized the Senate\u2019s bipartisan negotiations on the border, the success of which Republicans have linked to supporting another round of aid for Ukraine\u2019s military. We\u2019ll let you know what Johnson has to say. Chuck Schumer also said negotiations on immigration policy changes \u201chave not concluded\u201d, and warned that \u201cmany on the hard right are mightily trying to sink the bipartisan work happening here in the Senate\u201d. A bipartisan group of senators has for weeks been bargaining over changes to border policy, which Republicans have demanded in exchange for supporting Joe Biden\u2019s request for military assistance to Israel and Ukraine. Those negotiations have not yet resulted in a deal, but rightwing Republicans, most worryingly House speaker Mike Johnson, have attacked them. In his comments on the Senate floor, Schumer warned that the collapse of talks would imperil two of America\u2019s allies: For months, we have been true to our word, working with Republicans on border security, listening to their proposals, and coming to agreement on a vast range of issues. We have not concluded negotiations, so we will keep going to get this done. Democrats have always been ready and willing to have a debate on the border. We want to get this done, we have continued to work to get this done, and we remain committed \u2013 we remain committed \u2013 to bipartisanship. Both sides will have to give. It is unfortunate, but frankly not surprising, that many on the hard right are mightily trying to sink the bipartisan work happening here in the Senate. But in the Senate, our responsibility is clear: we need to put the needs of our country above the interests of party politics. Because the security of our southern border is on the line. The security of Israel is on the line. The health and safety of innocent Gaza civilians is on the line. The stability of the Indo Pacific region is on the line. And finally \u2013 as every Senator on both sides knows \u2013 the survival of Ukraine is on the line. The Senate\u2019s Democratic leader Chuck Schumer just offered a preview of the reception the articles of impeachment against homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will receive, should they arrive in his chamber. In remarks on the Senate floor, the New York lawmaker called the effort \u201cabsurd\u201d, \u201cunserious\u201d and a \u201csham\u201d: House Republicans have not shown that he has violated the constitution. House Republicans have failed to present any evidence of anything resembling an impeachable offense. Instead, what House Republicans are doing by advancing this sham impeachment effort is denigrating our constitution, all for the sake of appeasing one person and one person only: Donald Trump. And let this be clear: this unserious spectacle by House Republicans does nothing \u2013 nothing \u2013 to secure our border. The House homeland security committee approved the articles of impeachment earlier this morning, and they are expected to be put to a floor vote next week. If they pass, the Senate is expected to hold a trial, but would need the support of two-thirds of its lawmakers to convict Mayorkas. Democrats hold the chamber\u2019s majority, and are unlikely to support the effort. Here\u2019s more from the Guardian\u2019s Gloria Oladipo and Lauren Gambino on Cori Bush\u2019s announcement yesterday that she was under federal investigation: The congresswoman Cori Bush has confirmed that the US Department of Justice is investigating whether the Missouri Democrat misused campaign funds for security services, an accusation she denied as \u201csimply false\u201d. In a statement, Bush said her campaign was \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the investigation and said she had always \u201ccomplied with all applicable laws and House rules\u201d. \u201cI hold myself, my campaign, and my position to the highest levels of integrity. I also believe in transparency, which is why I can confirm that the Department of Justice is reviewing my campaign\u2019s spending on security services,\u201d said Bush, part of a progressive group of Democratic women known as \u201cthe Squad\u201d. She added that the allegations were rooted in \u201cbaseless complaints\u201d raised by rightwing organizations who have long made her a target. In a lengthy statement, Bush, a nurse and Black Lives Matter activist turned lawmaker who represents the St Louis area, said she has endured threats to her \u201cphysical safety and life\u201d since before she took office in 2021. Bush said that as a rank-and-file member of Congress she is not entitled to receive security protection by the House and has instead used campaign funds to pay for security services. \u201cI have not used any federal tax dollars for personal security services,\u201d she said. \u201cAny reporting that I have used federal funds for personal security is simply false.\u201d Cori Bush, a Black Democratic congresswoman from Missouri who is a member of \u201cthe Squad\u201d of progressive lawmakers, yesterday acknowledged she was under justice department investigation over allegations of misusing taxpayer funds. She denied any wrongdoing, but that wasn\u2019t enough for rightwing lawmaker Troy Nehls, who attacked the congresswoman for allegedly funneling money intended for her security to her husband. Here\u2019s what he said, according to CNN: Bush demanded an apology from the Texas Republican for calling her husband a \u201cthug\u201d, and characterizing her as \u201cloud\u201d: Fellow Squad member Ilhan Omar went further, describing Nehls\u2019s remarks as \u201cracist\u201d: Nehls appears in no mood to answer either lawmaker\u2019s demand. He replied to Bush on X today, saying, \u201cYou should apologize to every law enforcement officer across the nation. I\u2019m waiting.\u201d Speaking of conspiracy theories, the Guardian\u2019s Ramon Antonio Vargas reports that a progressive House Democrat once published poems and made other statements questioning the facts of the September 11 attack on his personal blog: Progressive US congressman Jamaal Bowman is seeking to distance himself from conspiracy theories about the deadly September 11 terrorist attacks which he published on a personal blog that he ran before his career in elected office. The New York representative was linked to the blog in question by the Daily Beast on Monday as he faces a substantial primary challenge from a fellow Democrat over his criticism of Israeli military strikes in Gaza in response to Hamas\u2019s 7 October 2023 attack. Bowman was also grappling with the Daily Beast\u2019s reporting after his 2023 fine and misdemeanor guilty plea for apparently pulling a fire alarm at the US Capitol shortly before the US House was supposed to vote on a government funding bill. Though he maintained that the fire alarm pull was accidental, the House censured Bowman, who was accused of trying to delay the funding bill vote. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anything that these cranks have said, and my life\u2019s work has proved that,\u201d said a statement that Bowman distributed to media outlets about the far-right conspiracy theories once featured on a blog. Bowman\u2019s statement alluded to a resolution which condemned the racist white replacement theory that drove a gunman to murder 11 Black people in Buffalo in 2022 and said: \u201cMy life\u2019s work has proved that \u2026 I\u2019ve called out the endless bullshit of the far right.\u201d There\u2019s no escaping politics these days, not even if you\u2019re Taylor Swift, the Guardian\u2019s Adam Gabbatt reports: Taylor Swift is a \u201cPentagon asset\u201d, an \u201celection interference psyop\u201d who, with unnamed left-leaning forces, has conspired to \u201crig\u201d the Super Bowl and then endorse Joe Biden in the presidential election. That\u2019s according to a raft of influential rightwing figures, who have begun to spread a conspiracy theory that Swift, a pop star, is part of a nefarious plot ahead of November\u2019s presidential election. Swift has found herself at the center of the rightwing commentariat\u2019s attention in recent weeks after intense media focus on her relationship with Travis Kelce, a star tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs football team. She has been in the crowd as the Chiefs have progressed through the NFL playoffs: on Sunday, the team won the AFC Championship game, and will play in the Super Bowl on 11 February. The attention their romance has received has led to a number conspiracy theories. \u201cI think \u2013 and I\u2019ve said this, I\u2019ve taken a lot of crap for this online \u2013 I think they\u2019re using Taylor Swift right now,\u201d Jack Posobiec, an influential rightwing conspiracy theorist, said in a video posted on Truth Social on Monday. \u201cThey\u2019re gearing up for an operation to use Taylor Swift in the election against everything: against Trump, for Biden, they\u2019re gonna get her and all you know they call them the Swifties they\u2019re going to turn those into voters, you watch.\u201d For an idea of the vibe during the House homeland security committee\u2019s lengthy hearing into impeaching Alejandro Mayorkas, here\u2019s video of one Democrat accusing Republicans of kowtowing to \u201cthe orange Jesus\u201d with their charges. It was New Jersey\u2019s Rob Menendez who deployed that figure of speech \u2013 \u201cthe orange Jesus\u201d being, of course, Donald Trump: The House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, blasted the impeachment of Alejandro Mayorkas in an interview with MSNBC this morning, saying the charges amounted to a \u201cstunt\u201d done at the behest of the party\u2019s right wing. \u201cHouse Republicans are engaged in another partisan political stunt. They apparently have been ordered to do so by Donald Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene because these are the individuals who are basically running the House Republican Conference, which is why we\u2019ve seen nothing from this do-nothing Republican Congress but chaos, dysfunction and extremism,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cWe should be focused on issues related to the economy, inflation, national security, public safety, fixing the border. There are many challenges that we are ready, willing and able to confront with our Republican colleagues in a bipartisan way, but they\u2019ve basically spent this Congress engaging in reckless political activity designed to distract from their failed agenda.\u201d The House homeland security committee convened at 10am yesterday, but it took them until 1am this morning to finally approve the articles of impeachment against Alejandro Mayorkas, after hours of debate on various amendments offered by both parties. Here\u2019s a recap the marathon hearing, and what happens next: House Republicans voted along party lines after midnight on Wednesday to move toward impeaching the homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, for a \u201cwillful and systematic\u201d refusal to enforce immigration laws as border security becomes a top 2024 election issue. In a charge against a cabinet official unseen in nearly 150 years, the homeland security committee debated all day on Tuesday and well into the night before recommending two articles of impeachment against Mayorkas to the full House. The committee Republicans voted in favor, while the Democrats unified against, 18-15. The partisan showdown reflected the Republicans\u2019 efforts to make the Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump\u2019s hard-line deportation approach to immigration their own. That approach was mirrored on a second front on Tuesday, as Republicans also lambasted the border deal recently brokered between the Joe Biden White House and a bipartisan group of senators, Democrats and Republicans alike. Mayorkas, in a letter sent to the Republican chair of the House committee on homeland security before the hearing began, dismissed the impeachment process against him as \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d. Good morning, US politics blog readers. In the wee hours of this morning, the Republican-controlled House homeland security committee approved the charges against Alejandro Mayorkas by a party line vote and sent them for consideration by the full chamber. House speaker Mike Johnson is expected to hold a vote on impeaching the homeland security chief at some point next week, though with a margin of just one seat (!) it\u2019s going to be interesting to see if any GOP lawmakers defect from the effort. Even the charges are approved, the impeachment is headed for a trial in the Senate that will likely prove futile. Democrats control the chamber, and convicting Mayorkas of the \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d he is accused of requires a two-thirds majority, which is likely unobtainable. The White House is nonetheless peeved by the committee\u2019s action, describing it as petty and noting that Republicans have talked about impeaching Joe Biden and various officials ever since he took office. \u201cIs there anyone House Republicans won\u2019t impeach?\u201d read an email from the White House press team this morning. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye out for the latest on the impeachment, and the broader debate over immigration policy playing out in Congress. Here\u2019s what else is happening today: Johnson is expected to give his first speech on the House floor since becoming speaker at 12pm ET, which will concern immigration. Nathan Wade, the Georgia prosecutor who is in an alleged romantic relationship with Fani Willis, the district attorney who indicted Donald Trump and 18 others for trying to meddle in the state\u2019s 2020 election, will not have to testify today in a divorce case after reaching an agreement with his estranged wife. Defense attorneys have argued Willis and Wade\u2019s relationship represents a conflict of interest, potentially upending the election subversion case. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will take reporters\u2019 questions at 1pm."

            "date": "2024-01-14T16:00:35Z",
            "content": "Albert Herring is one of Benjamin Britten\u2019s more fortunate \u201coutsider\u201d protagonists: he emerges not only alive, but appreciably happier, from an opera whose dissection of class conflict and small-mindedness comes in much fizzier form than Peter Grimes or Billy Budd. Crowned Loxford\u2019s \u201cMay King\u201d in the absence of any local girl sufficiently chaste to be Queen, unworldly Albert\u2019s modest descent from virtue into vice \u2013 a night on the tiles precipitated by some spiked lemonade \u2013 provokes outrage from the pillars of his community; but for the young man himself, and the postwar generation he represents, that hazily remembered pub crawl heralds a new sense of self-possession. Scored for chamber orchestra, the opera is nevertheless one of Britten\u2019s most musically extravagant, brimming with pastiche and stylistic flourishes, and Eric Crozier\u2019s libretto, which transports a Maupassant short story from Normandy to Suffolk, is a similarly dense, colourful affair. Giles Havergal\u2019s production, revived by Elaine Tyler-Hall, wisely resists further embellishment. Staged in the round in the bijou Howard Assembly Room, with characteristically slick designs by Leslie Travers \u2013 plastic grass and fruit crates serving as parlour, shop, and street \u2013 it succeeds instead by drawing its audience irresistibly close, for an intimate view of village politics in all their cacophonous glory. Until Albert finds his voice, it\u2019s the fearsome Lady Billows who dominates, and soprano Judith Howarth is a riot of strop and stridency in the role: Emmeline Lucas meets Lady Catherine de Bourgh. She\u2019s delectably partnered by Heather Shipp\u2019s warmly sung, campily censorious housekeeper Florence, and flanked by her upstanding committee \u2013 vicar, policeman, schoolmistress, mayor \u2013 each of whom navigates Britten\u2019s complex ensembles while making their individual marks: Amy Freston\u2019s skittish, silvery Miss Wordsworth is one standout, as is Paul Nilon\u2019s lavish-toned Mr Upfold. Down on the high street, Dominic Sedgwick brings easy charisma to butcher\u2019s boy Sid, while Katie Bray is outstanding as spirited, self-willed Nancy; her duet with Claire Pascoe\u2019s Mrs Herring, in which they grapple with the possibility of Albert\u2019s death, sees both artists find real humanity in a moment that could easily topple into farce. As Albert himself, Dafydd Jones makes an auspicious company debut, his glossy, high-lying tenor ideally placed for the role, and there\u2019s a dry humour to his portrayal, which makes it clear that this Albert is no \u201cvillage simpleton\u201d at all. A chamber-sized orchestra benefits from the up-close-and-personal approach, too: both players and conductor Garry Walker are in full view at one end of the set, maintaining admirable contact with the cast despite the unconventional set-up, and revelling in Britten\u2019s playful, virtuosic writing. Albert Herring might go to pieces when all eyes turn upon him \u2013 but the forces of Opera North emphatically do not. \u2022 At the Howard Assembly Room, Leeds, until 2 March"

            "title": "The big idea: should we keep politics out of social media?",
            "date": "2024-01-22T12:30:00Z",
            "content": "It may be a long time since social media lost its innocence. But, two decades after Facebook was founded, it can feel as though sharing political views, expressing solidarity or posting cathartic outpourings on personal accounts is an increasingly high-stakes game. This has been thrown into sharp relief by the Israel-Gaza war, with people shedding jobs and friends after making statements online. Gone is any illusion that one\u2019s followers form a neat echo chamber of like-minded humans. It may have felt like that back in 2015, when millions applied a rainbow wash over their profile pictures to support marriage equality, or in 2020, when a similar number Instagrammed a black square to show that black lives mattered. When it comes to issues surrounding the conflict in the Middle East, even within otherwise politically aligned groups, raw divisions have been exposed. They\u2019re stirred up further by algorithms, ignorance (few of us are subject experts), disinformation and minds well primed for the polarising effects of the internet. So would we be better off keeping our views off the stage of social media altogether? James Dennis, who has studied political expression online for 15 years, is struck by an increasing reluctance to get involved due to \u201creputational concerns\u201d. Instead, people are becoming \u201cwhat I describe as \u2018listeners\u2019, who use social media to consume political information but avoid forms of public political expression\u201d. Could this herald a reversion to type? After all, these networks originally attracted mass membership as lighthearted, practical ways to connect with friends and family. But then again, so much has changed. \u201cWe\u2019ve had social media in our lives for about 20 years,\u201d says Debbie Ball, data and society lecturer at the University of Westminster and King\u2019s College London, who researches how platforms are designed to be persuasive and influence user behaviour. \u201cWe\u2019re all \u2026 much more comfortable posting our views online.\u201d She acknowledges, however, that writing about political issues can sometimes lead to dark places, funnelling users into a \u201cwhole ecosystem of bad actors spreading disinformation and political campaigning\u201d. Most social media algorithms are programmed to optimise the spread of inflammatory content, \u201cfuelling the maelstrom of online political debate and, despite what the dominant companies like Meta say, it\u2019s not to champion freedom of speech, it\u2019s all to encourage people to post more, create more content and to keep making money out of people\u2019s data\u201d. In other words, posting about politics can draw disinformation into your feeds, as keywords are liable to be picked up by campaigning organisations and troll factories. You don\u2019t even have to say anything yourself. \u201cIt only takes someone to repost something to further drift into a disinformation environment and get embroiled in something more divisive,\u201d says Ball, whose own timeline has become studded with propaganda related to her posts. X, in particular, she points out, is now a \u201clax information environment with Elon Musk doing away with Twitter\u2019s previous ban on political advertising, as well as sacking much of the moderation team\u201d. All eyes are now on Threads, to see if its policy of deprioritising news does anything to slow the spread of conspiracy theories and the like. Not that users are blind to the risks. When the Pew Research Center asked people across 19 countries about their attitudes towards social media in 2022, it found that a median of 84% believed \u201caccess to the internet and social media have made people easier to manipulate with false information and rumours\u201d. Some 70% thought the spread of false information online was \u201ca major threat, second only to climate change\u201d. Even so, when others start posting on an issue, getting involved can be hard to resist. Analysis of data from Meta in 2015 found that people were more likely to alter their own profile pictures to support a cause if their friends did. This peer pressure was a greater factor than religion, politics or age. Not everyone is susceptible. And, according to Dennis, rather than airing their views publicly, many people are now having discussions on private messaging apps \u2013 \u201cnamely WhatsApp, but also direct messaging on Snapchat and Instagram for younger audiences\u201d. Users view these channels as \u201csafe spaces where they can have challenging conversations with close contacts, such as partners, family members, or friends\u201d. Recently, his research has focused particularly on young people, for whom \u201cthese spaces are incredibly helpful for testing out political ideas\u201d. Sometimes, though, even refraining from public posting can be interpreted as a political act: either you don\u2019t care or worse, you\u2019re concealing or are in denial about your own prejudices. That stance has met with its own backlash: Ball says she has noticed people coming out recently to declare \u201cIt\u2019s OK not to post.\u201d Ultimately, it\u2019s a personal choice. Some people feel strongly that social media is a means of raising awareness about neglected issues, or showing support to those facing injustice. Campaigns and hashtags have at times made a difference, and prompted political shifts in the real world. But in an age of insidious algorithms and ineffective moderation, getting political on platforms that care more about making money than driving change may have to come with a health warning.

It\u2019s time for Republicans to unite behind our party\u2019s clear frontrunner, which is why I am proud to endorse Donald J Trump for president.\u201d Despite facing 91 criminal charges, assorted civil threats and removal from the ballot in Colorado and Maine over his incitement of the deadly January 6 attack on Congress, Trump leads presidential rivals including the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley by vast polling margins. In general election polling, he is competitive or enjoys leads over Biden. Emmer, from Minnesota, followed the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, and majority leader, Steve Scalise (both from Louisiana) and Elise Stefanik of New York, the conference chair, in endorsing the man who sent supporters to the Capitol to try to stop certification of Biden\u2019s 2020 win. Even after rioters attacked the House chamber, 139 House Republicans and eight senators objected to results in key states. But Emmer was not among them and last October, after the far right ejected Kevin McCarthy as speaker, the Minnesotan followed Scalise and Jim Jordan of Ohio in failing to secure the role. At the time, Trump said Emmer had called him and was his \u201cbiggest fan now\u201d but also deemed him \u201ctotally out of touch with Republican voters\u201d, lobbied Republicans to reject him and reportedly boasted: \u201cHe\u2019s done. It\u2019s over. I killed him.\u201d Emmer\u2019s endorsement of his tormentor was therefore widely noted. Rick Wilson, a former Republican operative turned co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, said: \u201cRemember when you were on those anti-Trump calls in 2016, Tom?\u201d Tim Miller, another former Republican strategist turned Trump critic, chose to be more blunt: \u201cWas Tom Emmer \u2013 who was viciously savaged by Trump and his allies during the failed speaker attempt \u2013 wearing a ball gag or a gimp mask when he sent this statement? Need some behind-scenes colour.\u201d Miller\u2019s invective was matched by Trump\u2019s campaign team, which said of Erin Perrine, a former Trump aide now working for DeSantis, \u201cnothing can ever wash that foul stench of shit off her\u201d. But regardless of such Republican infighting, endorsements for Trump kept coming in. The three other House Republicans from Minnesota \u2013 Brad Finstad, Michelle Fischbach and Pete Stauber \u2013 joined Emmer in backing Trump. From the Senate, the Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, once seen as a possible Republican candidate, also gave Trump his backing. \u201cWhen Donald Trump was president,\u201d Cotton said, \u201cAmerica was safe, strong and prosperous.\u201d He did not mention his own, infamous claim that regular troops needed to be used to quash protests for racial justice in 2020, when Trump was in the White House. Overlooking the economic devastation wrought that same year by Covid-19, Cotton continued: \u201cThe economy was booming, working-class wages were growing, our border was secure, and our enemies feared us.\u201d \u201cI endorse President Trump and I look forward to working with him to win back the White House and the Senate \u2026 it\u2019s time to get our country back on track.\u201d"

            "content": "Nikki Haley made the most of the hours remaining before tomorrow\u2019s primary in New Hampshire, crisscrossing the Granite state alongside governor Chris Sununu in a bid to lure votes away from Donald Trump. But polls continue to show the former president with a big lead, underscoring the difficulty Haley will have in overcoming his status as the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination. Trump is expected in New Hampshire later today, after appearing this morning in a New York City courtroom for a hearing in author E Jean Carroll\u2019s defamation lawsuit against him, where he was set to testify. The session was unexpectedly adjourned after a juror felt ill, and one of Trump\u2019s lawyers was exposed to Covid-19. Here\u2019s what else happened today: Kamala Harris assailed Trump for his role in overturning Roe v Wade on the 51st anniversary of the supreme court decision that allowed abortion access nationwide. Nikki Haley has avoided talking much about abortion, even though she has signalled she would be fine with restricting the procedure federally. Some voters who support abortion rights are fine with that. Judge Judy delivered her verdict on the presidential race by stumping for Haley in New Hampshire. Elise Stefanik, who is seen as potential running mate for Trump, said the adjournment of his defamation trial was \u201cblatant election interference\u201d. In reality, it was requested by the former president\u2019s legal team. Someone is making robocalls to New Hampshire voters that sound like Joe Biden and encourage them not to vote in Tuesday\u2019s primary, prompting the president\u2019s re-election campaign to call for an investigation. As she blitzes the state, Nikki Haley talks about keeping taxes low, the military strong and the border secure. One issue she does not mention: abortion. On the 51st anniversary of Roe v Wade, Joe Biden and Democrats across the country are railing against Republicans, calling them \u201canti-abortion extremists\u201d who would impose a federal ban on the procedure if they win back power this fall. Haley calls herself \u201cpro-life\u201d but has promised to seek consensus as president. In Iowa, where evangelical Christians dominate the caucuses, Haley signaled her willingness, if elected, to sign any restrictions that reached her desk. But in comparatively moderate New Hampshire, she has mostly shut down inquiries about what kind of federal limit she would support, insisting that any legislation is purely theoretical without 60 votes in the Senate \u2013 as she told one curious onlooker at a stop in Epping on Sunday. Across the state, several pro-choice independent voters said the risk of a Trump presidency worried them more than Haley\u2019s views on abortion. \u201cI\u2019ve long ago accepted that I can\u2019t agree with a candidate on everything,\u201d said Carole Alfano, an independent who met Haley at the campaign stop in the town of Epping. \u201cWe\u2019ll part ways on that.\u201d Alfano backed Biden in 2020, but plans to support Haley in Tuesday\u2019s primary. In Derry, Marie Mulroy is ecstatic about the prospect of a Haley nomination even though she believes abortion should remain legal. \u201cWe\u2019ll agree to disagree on that,\u201d she said. Can Nikki Haley pull a shock win in New Hampshire out of the bag? She\u2019s the last candidate standing against Donald Trump, after Florida governor Ron DeSantis exited the race and endorsed the former president on Sunday. Host of the Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly America podcast Jonathan Freedland headed out on the campaign trail in the Granite state to find out the answer: Joe Biden\u2019s re-election campaign marked Roe v Wade\u2019s 51st anniversary by debuting an advertisement in which Texas obstetrician-gynecologist Austin Dennard discusses how she had to leave the state to get an abortion after finding out that her fetus would not survive. Who\u2019s to blame? Donald Trump, as Dennard makes clear. Expect to see tons of this sort of messaging coming from the campaigns of the president and other Democrats over the coming months: On the 51st anniversary of the supreme court\u2019s Roe v Wade decision, Kamala Harris attacked Donald Trump for his role in appointing justices who overturned the precedent and allowed states to ban abortion. The vice-president spoke during a visit today to Wisconsin, a battleground state that will be crucial to deciding the outcome of the November election. Democrats plan to campaign on restoring access to abortion, after the 2022 decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization that curtailed abortion access in many states. Harris did not hold back from assailing the former president, citing his comments that he was \u201cproud\u201d of his role in getting three justices confirmed to the court, all of whom voted to overturn Roe. Here\u2019s what she had to say: Joe Biden\u2019s re-election campaign has called on New Hampshire authorities to investigate a spate of robocalls to voters in which a voice that sounds like the president encourages them not to participate in Tuesday\u2019s primary. Biden\u2019s name is not appearing on the primary ballot, since Democrats have decided to hold their first nominating contest in South Carolina next month. But some in the party are encouraging their voters to write in the president\u2019s name, both as a show of support and to pressure the Democratic National Committee to give New Hampshire, which has historically been the second state to vote, a more prominent role in the nominating process. In a statement, Biden-Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said: This matter has already been referred to the New Hampshire Attorney General, and the campaign is actively discussing additional actions to take immediately. Spreading disinformation to suppress voting and deliberately undermine free and fair elections will not stand, and fighting back against any attempt to undermine our democracy will continue to be a top priority for this campaign. David Scanlan, the New Hampshire secretary of state, predicted Republican voter participation in the primaries will reach 322,000, eclipsing 2016\u2019s total, when Republicans set a record of 287,652 votes. In 2020, it was Democrats who saw record turnout for their competitive primary, with 300,368 votes cast. Before a deadline in October, as many as 4,000 registered Democrats changed their party affiliation to \u201cundeclared,\u201d suggesting some plan to vote in the Republican primary. A Monmouth University Poll-Washington Post poll released today found that the number of registered New Hampshire independents who plan to vote in the Republican primary increased from 52% in November to 63%. More than a third of these voters said they voted for Biden in 2020, suggesting there could be a \u201cmeasurable influx of Democratic-leaning independents\u201d who will participate in Tuesday\u2019s primary. In a conversation on Friday, Fergus Cullen, a former New Hampshire GOP chairman and prominent Trump opponent, said he did not see evidence that Haley had \u201clit a spark\u201d among these voters in the way that might foretell \u201csome kind of surge coming her way.\u201d \u201cPeople turn out when they are inspired, or they\u2019re pissed off,\u201d said Cullen, who had seen Haley on the campaign trail four times. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that people are not inspired, and they\u2019re apathetic. And that means that they don\u2019t show up.\u201d New Hampshire\u2019s secretary of state David Scanlan is predicting record turnout in the Republican primary, while governor Chris Sununu is joking that he is cashing in all of his political capital to ensure balmy weather for voters headed to the polls on Tuesday. That would be a stark contrast from Iowa, where arctic temperatures were blamed for the low turnout last week. Recent polling has shown Trump with a double digit lead in the state. But New Hampshire has a record of unpredictability, thanks to the large number of voters who proudly belong to neither party. They are not a monolith, but analysts believe that the more of them who choose to vote in the Republican primary, the better for Haley. \u201cThe only big X factor I see: how big is turnout?\u201d said Dante Scala, a professor of Political Science and International Affairs at the University of New Hampshire. According to Scala, Haley is attempting something novel in New Hampshire. Republican presidential candidates who have pulled off wins in New Hampshire \u2013 such as John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012 \u2013 managed to appeal to the state\u2019s independents while still pulling in a sizable chunk of the party faithful. (Independents, called \u201cundeclared\u201d voters in New Hampshire, can vote in either party\u2019s primary.) This year, Trump has a lock on Republican base voters. To win, or even to come within striking distance of Trump, Scala said Haley will need to run up the score with these independent voters, some of whom could choose to vote in the sleepy Democratic primary or not at all if they feel the contest is a foregone conclusion. Scala said Haley\u2019s test is whether she \u201cinspired enough people to show up, who don\u2019t normally show up, to get a turnout big enough that it swamps the Trump people and your mainstream Republican in New Hampshire.\u201d Joe Biden spoke to UK prime minister Rishi Sunak on Monday about Gaza, Ukraine, and the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, White House spokesperson John Kirby said, AFP reported. From White House correspondent for AFP Danny Kemp: Judy Sheindlin, widely known as Judge Judy, told CNN on Monday that she would endorse Nikki Haley if she \u201cwere a frog\u201d. During the interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Judge Judy was asked if the reason she endorsed Haley was because Haley is a woman. \u201cNo, I would support her if she were a frog,\u201d said the ever-colorful Sheindlin. \u201cShe\u2019s capable. She\u2019s poised,\u201d Sheindlin added. Sheindlin said that neither Trump nor Biden have the \u201cintellectual gravitas\u201d to be US president. According to Sheindlin, she has only endorsed one presidential candidate before \u2013the former New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg, during the 2020 presidential election. Sheindlin has campaigned for Haley ahead of the highly watched New Hampshire primary on Tuesday. Nikki Haley is making the most of the hours remaining before tomorrow\u2019s primary in New Hampshire, crisscrossing the Granite state alongside governor Chris Sununu in a bid to lure votes away from Donald Trump. But polls continue to show the former president with a big lead, underscoring the difficulty Haley will have in overcoming his status as the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination. Trump is expected in New Hampshire later today, after appearing this morning in a New York City courtroom for a hearing in author E Jean Carroll\u2019s defamation lawsuit against him, where he was set to testify. The session was abruptly adjourned after a juror felt ill, and one of Trump\u2019s lawyers was exposed to Covid-19. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: Judge Judy delivered her verdict on the presidential race by stumping for Haley in New Hampshire. Elise Stefanik, who is seen as potential running mate for Trump, said the adjournment of his defamation trial was \u201cblatant election interference\u201d. In reality, it was requested by the former president\u2019s legal team. Someone is reportedly making robocalls to New Hampshire voters that sound like Joe Biden and encourage them not to vote in Tuesday\u2019s primary. Supporters of a campaign to write in his name \u2013 he is not appearing on the ballot, in line with Democratic National Committee rules \u2013 say the calls are meant to undermine them. Donald Trump is clearly smarting from the ongoing defamation lawsuit against him by author E Jean Carroll, and a jury\u2019s verdict last year that he sexually abused her. As the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports, his campaign yesterday barred a NBC News reporter who had pressed his ally Elise Stefanik for her thoughts on the verdict: Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign reportedly blocked an NBC News journalist from covering campaign events in New Hampshire on Sunday. Sunday\u2019s exclusion of NBC News correspondent Vaughn Hillyard came when he was set to serve as a pool reporter. Instead of having a pack of reporters follow a candidate everywhere, campaigns will often allow television, print, and radio news organizations to send a single pool reporter to travel with them \u2013 and those reporters in turn then send a readout to other news outlets. But on Sunday, Hillyard wrote in an email to the pool: \u201cYour pooler was told that if he was the designated pooler by NBC News that the pool would be cut off for the day.\u201d The email, which was subsequently published by several news organizations, added: \u201cAfter affirming to the campaign that your pooler would attend the events, NBC News was informed at about 2.20pm that the pool would not be allowed to travel with Trump today.\u201d Hillyard a day earlier had pressed New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik \u2013 said to be a potential Trump running mate \u2013 on whether she believed the ex-president had sexually assaulted E Jean Carroll. NBC News and Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesperson, did not immediately return a request for comment. You don\u2019t have to be Joe Biden for someone to make a robot of your likeness. As the Guardian\u2019s Dan Milmo reports, Democratic congressman and presidential candidate Dean Phillips has his own AI impersonator: OpenAI has removed the account of the developer behind an artificial intelligence-powered bot impersonating the US presidential candidate Dean Phillips, saying it violated company policy. Phillips, who is challenging Joe Biden for the Democratic party candidacy, was impersonated by a ChatGPT-powered bot on the dean.bot site. The bot was backed by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Matt Krisiloff and Jed Somers, who have started a Super Pac \u2013 a body that funds and supports political candidates \u2013 named We Deserve Better, supporting Phillips. San Francisco-based OpenAI said it had removed a developer account that violated its policies on political campaigning and impersonation. \u201cWe recently removed a developer account that was knowingly violating our API usage policies which disallow political campaigning, or impersonating an individual without consent,\u201d said the company. The Phillips bot, created by AI firm Delphi, is now disabled. Delphi has been contacted for comment. A factor working against Nikki Haley in her quest to win the New Hampshire Republican primary is Donald Trump\u2019s resounding victory in last week\u2019s Iowa caucus. His triumph in the first state to vote in the GOP\u2019s nomination process confirmed his status as the frontrunner for the nomination. But election turnout was low in the Hawkeye state, a fact Haley was keen to remind voters of in New Hampshire: Nikki Haley is spending the final moments before New Hampshire\u2019s make-or-break primary getting out the vote with the state\u2019s popular Republican governor, Chris Sununu by her side. \u201cThis is it. Twenty-four hours to go,\u201d Sununu told the crowd at a packed, dimly lit veteran\u2019s hall in Franklin. \u201cAll the momentum is at Nikki Haley\u2019s back.\u201d He told the voters not to pay any mind to the polls \u2013 unless it\u2019s the ones showing Haley trouncing Joe Biden in a general election \u2013 and reminded them of their fiercely guarded reputation as the state that delivers political upsets. \u201cWe always buck the trend in New Hampshire,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to start tomorrow.\u201d Haley reminded voters of the stakes of tomorrow\u2019s primary \u2013 not that they needed any reminding, since some say they\u2019ve received upwards of 10 campaign mailers a day in recent weeks, in addition to the political ads flooding the airwaves. \u201cDon\u2019t complain about what happens in a general election if you don\u2019t play in this primary tomorrow,\u201d she charged. \u201cIt matters.\u201d Just about every time she speaks these days, Elise Stefanik reminds everybody how badly she wants to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick. Today\u2019s example is the New York Republican congresswoman calling the adjournment in Trump\u2019s defamation trial in New York City today \u201cblatant election interference\u201d because it could mean the former president has to testify tomorrow, the day of the New Hampshire primary. In reality, the postponement was agreed to by Trump\u2019s attorney, who has also requested his testimony take place Wednesday, to accommodate for the primary: New Hampshire voters may not give Nikki Haley what she wants on Tuesday, according to a Washington Post-Monmouth University poll released today that finds her trailing Donald Trump in the state by 18 percentage points. Trump is the clear frontrunner, with 52% support, compared to Haley\u2019s 34%. Ron DeSantis polled at 8% in the survey completed before he withdrew from the presidential race. The Post notes that Haley\u2019s support has doubled from November, largely due to her attracting voters that supported former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who exited the race earlier this month. The survey offers a snapshot of the types of voters who are supporting Trump and Haley, with 71% of the former South Carolina governor\u2019s supporters believing Joe Biden won the 2020 election fairly, and 48% registered with neither party. Forty-nine percent say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and 56% described themselves as moderate or liberal. Among Trump voters, only 14% believe Biden won fairly, 38% were not registered with a party, 29% said they were moderate or liberal and 38% thought abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Judy Sheindlin \u2013 Judge Judy to you \u2013 is famous for weighing on things, and she recently reached her own verdict on this year\u2019s presidential race: Nikki Haley is the best candidate for the job. She campaigned with the former South Carolina governor in New Hampshire yesterday, urging voters to, \u201cbring her home on Tuesday\u201d. Sheindlin\u2019s political allegiances have shifted over the years, and in 2020, she endorsed former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg for the Democratic presidential nomination. We\u2019ll find out soon enough if her verdict on Haley is enough to push her over the top in New Hampshire. If it is not, Sheindlin does not seem ready to campaign for Joe Biden \u2013 she went on CNN to say that she thinks he is too old: With Ron DeSantis\u2019s exit, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley has the two-person race she wants in New Hampshire, the state she has bet her campaign on. But will it be enough to beat Donald Trump on Tuesday? The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino took a look at Haley\u2019s pitch to voters, and if it\u2019s working: Plodding across frigid New Hampshire ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primary, Nikki Haley offered the state\u2019s proudly freethinking voters a tantalizing proposal: choose her and save America from the presidential rematch seemingly nobody wants. \u201cSeventy percent of Americans have said they don\u2019t want to see a Donald Trump-Joe Biden rematch,\u201d Haley exclaimed on Sunday, drawing head nods and murmurs of agreement from attendees packed into a middle school library in Derry. Haley leaned in: \u201cDo we really want to have two presidential candidates in their 80s?\u201d Biden, the 81-year-old Democratic president, is coasting to his party\u2019s nomination and Trump, the 77-year-old former president, is marching toward the Republican one as the field narrows and he consolidates support from across the party. But Haley, who celebrated her 52nd birthday hopscotching the state on Saturday, insisted there was a different \u2013 viable \u2013 path. Haley, the former \u201cTea Party governor\u201d of South Carolina who served as Trump\u2019s first United Nations ambassador, has staked her presidential aspirations on a strong showing in the first-in-the-nation primary. \u201cNew Hampshire is do-or-die for Nikki Haley,\u201d said Mike Dennehy, a veteran Republican strategist in New Hampshire who worked on John McCain\u2019s winning presidential primary campaigns in the state in 2000 and 2008 and is unaffiliated. \u201cShe needs to go all in and speak specifically to independent voters who want change in this country.\u201d Change of plans for Donald Trump: today\u2019s hearing in New York City of the defamation lawsuit brought against him by author E Jean Carroll has been postponed till Tuesday after a juror felt ill, and an attorney for the former president said one of her parents had been exposed to Covid-19. Trump was expected to testify today, but that will now also take place another time. Follow our live blog for the latest on this story: Joe Biden won\u2019t be on the ballot in New Hampshire, but two long-shot Democratic candidates will be, while opponents of Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza are encouraging voters to write in \u201cceasefire\u201d as a show of protest. Here\u2019s more from the Guardian\u2019s Adam Gabbatt on some of the lesser-known aspects of the state\u2019s primary tomorrow: While Donald Trump and Nikki Haley might draw focus, a shadow presidential primary is taking place in New Hampshire, where Joe Biden could stumble at the first hurdle of his bid to run for president again in 2024 following an internal Democratic party feud. As a consequence of the party scrap, Biden\u2019s name will not even appear on the ballot in the Granite state on Tuesday. While the president remains the favorite to win his party\u2019s overall nomination, his absence here has opened a window for Dean Phillips, a Democratic congressman from Minnesota, and Marianne Williamson, an author and self-help guru who ran for president in 2020, to mount longshot presidential bids. The pair have spent weeks campaigning in the state, pitching different visions for the future. Phillips, 55, has touted his reputation as a centrist; his record of working with Republicans to get things done; and the fact that he is 26 years younger than Biden. Williamson, who withdrew from the 2020 race before the Iowa caucuses, is selling more of a deviation from the current administration. A progressive, she would introduce free college tuition, declare a climate emergency and Department of Peace which would be tasked with avoiding war abroad and tackling white supremacy at home. There are reportedly some shenanigans happening in New Hampshire ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primary, though what they amount to is unclear. NBC News reports that Granite state residents are getting robocalls from a fake voice that sounds like Joe Biden and encourages them not to vote tomorrow. The president\u2019s name is not appearing on the ballot in New Hampshire, after the Democratic National Committee opted to make South Carolina the first state in its nominating process. However supporters of the president are encouraging people to write in Biden\u2019s name on their ballots, as a way to show their support and try to win back the state\u2019s spot in the nominating process. In previous years, New Hampshire was the second state to vote after Iowa for Democrats. The robocalls concluded by giving people the phone number for Kathy Sullivan, a former state Democratic party chair who is supporting the write-in campaign. She believes the calls\u2019 intention is to hurt Biden, NBC News reports, and that they are illegal. \u201cI want them to be prosecuted to the fullest extent possible because this is an attack on democracy,\u201d she told NBC. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let it go. I want to know who\u2019s paying for it? Who knew about it? Who benefits?\u201d Money, endorsements, poll numbers: Ron DeSantis had it all, and then he lost it. Was it taken from him by the 800lb gorilla of the Republican party Donald Trump, or did he cause his own downfall? The Guardian\u2019s David Smith untangles the question, and finds that it\u2019s a little bit of both: It began in a glitch-filled disaster on Twitter. It ended with a misattributed quotation on X. Just like Elon Musk\u2019s social media platform, efforts to rebrand Ron DeSantis\u2019s US presidential election campaign could not mask its fundamental flaws. When in May the Florida governor announced his run during a chat with Musk on Twitter Spaces, the platform\u2019s audio streaming feature, there were technical breakdowns that drew comparisons with one of Musk\u2019s space rockets blowing up on the launchpad. Eight months, dozens of staff departures, tens of millions of dollars and one crushing defeat in Iowa later, DeSantis announced he was dropping out in a video posted on the renamed X that quoted Winston Churchill as saying: \u201cSuccess is not final, failure is not fatal \u2013 it is the courage to continue that counts.\u201d According to the International Churchill Society, the British wartime prime minister never said that. Two days before the New Hampshire primary election, DeSantis\u2019s humiliation was complete. \u201cThis is probably the biggest collapse of a presidential campaign in modern American history, if not all American history,\u201d David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida, told the MSNBC network on Sunday. \u201cRon DeSantis had everything going for him.\u201d It was only a few weeks ago that Republicans looking for an alternative to Donald Trump had a veritable cornucopia of big-league politicians to choose from. But, with the exception of Nikki Haley, all of them have dropped out, and yesterday, a big name announced his exit: Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor who once seemed like the best bet to unseat Trump from the helm of the Republican party. His downfall was a mediocre second-place showing in Iowa last Monday, despite pouring everything his campaign had into winning the first state to vote in the GOP nomination process. There was clearly not backup plan for DeSantis, and yesterday, he announced his exit from the race with a video posted on X that included a fabricated Winston Churchill quote. In it, the Florida governor takes one last jab at Trump, who has spent the past months pummeling him with insults, most notably the nickname \u201cRon DeSanctimonious\u201d. DeSantis nonetheless endorsed Trump as he exited the race, and later on Sunday, the former president said the nickname was being retired. Here\u2019s what DeSantis had to say: Good morning, US politics live blog readers. We are coming to you today from Manchester, New Hampshire, the state where former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley is making what may well be her last stand to seize the Republican presidential nomination from Donald Trump. The race winnowed down to two main candidates yesterday, when Florida governor Ron DeSantis dropped out after his disappointing second-place finish in last week\u2019s Iowa caucus. Haley has staked it all on winning in New Hampshire, which will vote in primaries tomorrow, and today, she has five publicly announced campaign events on her schedule. Trump, meanwhile, has one speech planned for 9pm eastern time, and may reportedly spend today testifying to the New York City jury hearing the defamation lawsuit brought against him by author E Jean Carroll. Trump has functioned as a juggernaut in the race for the GOP nomination for more than a year, with polls showing him the frontrunner among Republicans both nationally and in most early voting states, New Hampshire included. While Haley has seen some momentum in polling recently, the gap between her and the former president remains significant. In a survey from the University of New Hampshire released by CNN yesterday, she\u2019s running 11 percentage points behind Trump, who is polling at 50%. It\u2019s quite the deficit to make up, and we expect to hear her give her closing arguments throughout the course of today. Here\u2019s what else is going on: Today is the 51st anniversary of Roe v Wade, the supreme court decision that allowed abortion nationwide, which was overturned by conservative justices in 2022. Kamala Harris is traveling to Wisconsin for a speech to mark the start of what the Biden administration is calling its \u201cFight for Reproductive Freedoms\u201d tour. Senators have for weeks been negotiating a deal to tighten immigration restrictions in order to win the GOP\u2019s support for aid to Israel and Ukraine. If an agreement has been reached, it could theoretically be announced today. Democrats making a quixotic effort to unseat Joe Biden as the party\u2019s presidential nominee will also be campaigning in New Hampshire today, including Minnesota congressman Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson."

            "date": "2024-01-03T01:37:19Z",
            "content": "The woman hoping to be Taiwan\u2019s next vice-president is a self-proclaimed \u201ccat warrior\u201d who says she will be able to deliver the \u201cglobal vision\u201d needed to tackle tensions with China. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) hopes that Hsiao Bi-khim, who until November was the Taiwanese envoy to the US, will be able to convince voters to back the DPP in the high stakes presidential election on 13 January. A political veteran, Hsiao, 52, came up with her own nickname when she was sent to Washington \u2013 with her four cats \u2013 in 2020. The moniker was her response to Beijing\u2019s aggressive \u201cwolf warrior\u201d style diplomacy, which was becoming increasingly combative at that time. Like a cat, Taiwan\u2019s diplomacy would be agile, flexible and comfortable in narrow spaces, she said. The animals are lovable but also independent. Born in Japan to Taiwanese and American parents, Hsiao\u2019s own life reflects the desire felt by many in Taiwan to forge a distinct Taiwanese identity. She grew up in Taiwan speaking Mandarin, English and Taiwanese Hokkien. Her family travelled widely; when she was a teenager, they moved to the US where she went on to study political science at Columbia University; she reportedly successfully fought to have a Taiwan stall at the university\u2019s international festival, against the opposition of students from China. She chooses to use the Taiwanese version of her given name, rather than the Mandarin version or her English second name, Louise. In the words of her father, who wrote an article about her in 2020: \u201cShe wanted a name that would embody her unique background\u201d. Her identity as a mixed-race woman illustrates the gulf between politics in Taiwan and China. She was Taiwan\u2019s first female envoy to the US and, if elected, would be the second female vice-president. In Beijing, the Communist party chief Xi Jinping last year revealed an all-male politburo, meaning that for the first time since 1997 there are no women in the party\u2019s leadership committee. And the prospect of a mixed-race politician in China is vanishingly remote in a system that emphasises ethnic purity as central to its idea of nationalism. Some see her as a contrast to the laol\u00fcnan (old, green, male) style of politics that has traditionally dominated DPP politics (the party\u2019s colour is green). Hsiao argues that her extensive contacts in Washington on both sides of the aisle will help Taiwan to preserve its status quo \u2013 even if that comes at the cost of dialogue with Beijing. China imposed sanctions on Hsiao in 2022 and 2023, meaning that she and her family members cannot enter mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau. All three of the main parties are arguing that their candidate can preserve peace and stability for the self-governing island. For the incumbent DPP, that offer to voters comes in the form of a ticket headed by Lai Ching-te, the current vice-president, and his running mate, Hsiao. Although the DPP does not formally support a declaration of independence, it is widely seen as the party that would try to put the most distance between Taipei and Beijing. Lai has previously described himself as a \u201cpragmatic worker for Taiwan independence\u201d. The main opposition party, the Kuomintang, argues that more dialogue, as well as economic and trade links with China, will help reduce cross-Strait tensions. And the relative newcomer, the Taiwan People\u2019s Party, claims to offer a middle way for voters, although its candidate Ko Wen-je has supported increased links with China. Hsiao, however argues that Taiwan needs to bolster its defences against the \u201cconstant pressures\u201d from China. The DPP hopes she will be able to convince the country\u2019s 19.3 million eligible voters it is the party that can boost Taipei\u2019s standing on the world stage. \u201cShe is very international,\u201d says Bonnie Glaser, the managing director and Taiwan expert at the German Marshall Fund, a thinktank. \u201cThat is part of what the DPP wants to portray itself as, as a party that is connected to the world\u201d. Soon after graduating in the US, Hsiao returned to Taiwan to join the DPP, becoming the party\u2019s head of international affairs at the age of 26. In 2002, she renounced her US citizenship in accordance with Taiwan\u2019s laws about civil servants. Before being appointed to serve in Washington in 2020, she was a member of Taiwan\u2019s Legislative Yuan, and served for a decade in the east-coast county of Hualien, which has a large Indigenous population \u2013 an experience which her supporters say boosts her credentials outside the Taipei elite. In a televised vice-presidential debate on 1 January, Hsiao said that there were three main issues facing Taiwan: the economy, geopolitical uncertainties and global challenges such as climate change. But the question of how to negotiate the relationship between the US and China is dominating the race. In a recent interview with The Economist, Hsiao summed up her, and the DPP\u2019s, approach:\u201cCats have the ability to tread softly but firmly \u2026 You can\u2019t force them to do things they don\u2019t want to. You don\u2019t command cats. You\u2019ve got to be nice to them, and cats will repay your kindness with warmth.\u201d Additional research by Chi Hui Lin"

            "date": "2024-01-24T19:28:46Z",
            "content": "The powerful United Auto Workers (UAW) formally endorsed Joe Biden\u2019s re-election campaign on Wednesday at the union\u2019s national community action program conference in Washington DC. Both the US president and rival Donald Trump have courted the union and supported its successful strike action against the US\u2019s big three automakers last year. Biden became the first president to walk a picket line in support of the union. \u201cJoe Biden bet on the American worker while Donald Trump blamed the American worker,\u201d UAW president, Shawn Fain told the conference. \u201cIf our endorsement must be earned, Joe Biden has earned it. \u201cDonald Trump is a scab. Donald Trump is a billionaire and that\u2019s who he represents,\u201d Fain said. \u201cThis election is about who will stand up with us and who will stand in our way.\u201d The conference is where the UAW\u2019s delegates and leaders develop and shape the 400,000-strong union\u2019s political and legislative priorities. It is the union\u2019s first conference with Fain at the helm since he was elected president of the union on a reform slate in March 2023. Addressing the conference, Biden said: \u201cI honest to God have always believed the union movement in America is important because it produces the best skilled workers in the world. It\u2019s good for everybody.\u201d \u201cOur plan is delivering for the American people, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen Donald Trump was in office, six auto factories closed around the country. Tens of thousands of auto jobs were lost nationwide during Trump\u2019s presidency. During my presidency, we opened 20 auto factories and more than 250,000 auto jobs all across the country.\u201d Fain has been strongly critical of Trump. This week he said Trump was \u201cpretty much contrary to everything we stand for\u201d. But the UAW has many Trump-supporting members and the union had held off on endorsing Biden. Biden has repeatedly touted himself as the most pro-labor president in history and joined the picket line of striking UAW members during the \u201cstandup\u201d strikes at the big three automakers in September, becoming the first sitting president to join a picket line. Last week Sean O\u2019Brien, the president of the Teamsters union, announced he had met privately with Trump in a move that progressive members called \u201ca slap in the face\u201d. Biden has also received the endorsements from the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of unions in the US, and the National Education Association, which represents about 3 million educators, the largest union in the US."

            "date": "2024-01-18T11:45:43Z",
            "content": "Good morning. Israel\u2019s president has told the Davos conference that there is an \u201cempire of evil\u201d emanating from Tehran, which must be faced by a very strong coalition, and that Gaza\u2019s population is entrenched in a network of terror. Billions of dollars, Isaac Herzog said, were being spent to destabilise the world, with Iran funding proxies all around the region to undermine any peace process. Herzog began by telling Davos delegates that Israel\u2019s world had been shattered on 7 October by the Hamas attacks. He cited the example of Kfir Bibas, who turns one in Hamas captivity today after he, his four-year-old brother Ariel and parents, Yarden and Shiri Bibas, were taken hostage. Herzog said at Davos this morning that people who supported Hamas were supporting barbaric terror. He then spoke about the Hamas infrastructure Israel claims to have found in shops, living rooms, bedrooms and schools in Gaza. He said: \u201cWe care, we care, it is painful for us that our neighbours are suffering so much,\u201d adding that they were entrenched in a network of terror, which Israel was determined to remove. What else is happening in the Middle East? The US military has fired another wave of missile strikes against Houthi-controlled sites, marking the fourth time in a week that it has directly targeted the group in Yemen. Meanwhile, Pakistan has launched retaliatory strikes against militants in Iran in response to attacks by Tehran that targeted sites within Pakistan\u2019s borders allegedly belonging to a Sunni separatist militant group. Trump rages in court as E Jean Carroll testifies during defamation trial E Jean Carroll took the witness stand yesterday in her defamation trial against Donald Trump, marking the first time she has confronted the ex-president in a courtroom. Carroll\u2019s testimony so incensed Trump that he had numerous outbursts, prompting the judge to warn that he could be kicked out of court. \u201cI\u2019m here because Donald Trump assaulted me, and when I wrote about it, he said it never happened,\u201d Carroll testified. \u201cHe lied, and it shattered my reputation.\u201d When Carroll first took the stand, Trump could be seen whispering to his lead attorney, Alina Habba. He sat with slightly hunched shoulders as Carroll testified. As Carroll spoke, Trump complained audibly and appeared to double down on defamatory denials, her lawyer said during a morning break in the proceedings. What did her lawyer say? \u201cMr Trump has been sitting at the back table and has been loudly saying things throughout Ms Carroll\u2019s testimony,\u201d said the attorney Shawn Crowley. \u201cIt\u2019s loud enough for us to hear it. [So] I imagine it\u2019s loud enough for the jury to hear it.\u201d What was Trump saying? \u201cHe said it is a \u2018witch-hunt\u2019, it really is a con-job,\u201d Crowley told the judge. Ecuador prosecutor investigating gang attack on TV station shot and killed The public prosecutor who was leading the investigation into the on-air assault on an Ecuadorian television station has been shot and killed in a brazen daylight attack in the crime-ridden city of Guayaquil. C\u00e9sar Su\u00e1rez, who focused on cases involving organized trans-national crime in Guayas province \u2013 one of the country\u2019s most violent areas \u2013 was ambushed in the north of the city on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cThe criminals, the terrorists, will not hold back our commitment to Ecuadorian society,\u201d the country\u2019s attorney general, Diana Salazar, said in a video posted to social media. \u201cWe call on the forces of order to guarantee the security of those who are carrying out their duties.\u201d Her office was conducting a preliminary investigation at the site of the killing, Salazar said, expressing her grief for Su\u00e1rez\u2019s family but giving no further details about the crime. What have the police said? In a statement, police said that the killing had the hallmarks of an assassination, adding that the victim had sustained a number of gunshot wounds, according to Reuters.

CNN\u2019s new chief executive says the company needs to recapture the \u201cswagger and innovation\u201d of its early days \u2013 and that, he says, increasingly means embracing a future outside television. Mark Thompson, appointed CNN\u2019s chief executive last fall, outlined a strategy to his staff yesterday. Don\u2019t miss this: Can \u2018micro-acts of joy\u2019 make you happier? I tried them for seven days I come across the words \u201cBig JOY\u201d while idly scrolling on my phone one morning and it stops me in my tracks, writes Emma Beddington. Who is considering even medium-sized joy, when the horror of world events unfolds around us hourly? But finding joy in hard times, personal or global, is precisely the point of Big JOY, a citizen science project based at the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley. Anyone can take part \u2013 it requires a time commitment of just seven minutes a day for seven days. \u201cMicro-acts of joy focus us on what is good about the life in front of us, and how we can make it better,\u201d says Elissa Epel, a collaborator on the Big JOY project. \u201cThis is critical during these dark times; these are ways we bring in the light.\u201d \u2026 Or this: Guerrilla fighters turned craft brewers: Colombia\u2019s unlikely beer company with a message of peace Doris Su\u00e1rez is one of the many former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), which fought the Colombian government for decades, but since the 2016 peace deal have been trying to forge new paths in civilian lives. Stigma around fighters in the Marxist-Leninist rebel group has made reintegration hard but the Colombian government, determined to stop the country slipping back into guerrilla warfare, has made small pots of money available to support rehabilitation. Suarez and her ex-Farc colleagues set up a brewery called La Trocha in 2019 with the grant. Su\u00e1rez says the brewery has given her a sense of purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s what helps me to wake up every day.\u201d Climate check: Greenland losing 30m tonnes of ice an hour, study reveals The Greenland ice cap is losing an average of 30m tonnes of ice an hour because of the climate crisis, a study has revealed, which is 20% more than previously thought. Some scientists are concerned that this additional source of fresh water pouring into the north Atlantic might mean a collapse of the ocean currents called the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is closer to being triggered, with severe consequences for humanity. Major ice loss from Greenland as a result of global heating has been recorded for decades. Last Thing: \u2018Good boy\u2019 \u2013 dog saves Philadelphia neighborhood from potentially explosive gas leak Some dogs earn the affectionate title of \u201cgood boy\u201d for obeying their owners\u2019 commands to sit or fetch. Others earn it by saving their neighborhoods from a potentially explosive gas leak days before Christmas. Philadelphia\u2019s Kobe the husky belongs in the latter category, according to a viral Instagram video that has vaulted him to the status of internet hero. Kobe\u2019s owner, Chanell Bell, recounts in the video how she noticed her four-year-old dog kept digging in a hole that was in the concrete of her front yard. Bell said she thought to herself: \u201cThis is not like him.\u201d She soon realised that Kobe had discovered a gas leak and workers who came to fix it said it could have blown up Bell\u2019s house, making the importance of Kobe\u2019s alertness crystal clear.
