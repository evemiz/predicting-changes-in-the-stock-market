            "content": "About the election The vote was triggered when the Five Star Movement abruptly withdrew its support for Mario Draghi\u2019s technocratic government, but an election was due next year in any event. The last election, in 2018, brought the Five Star Movement to power, in coalition with Matteo Salvini\u2019s rightwing populist League. Salvini later withdrew from the coalition, and Five Star formed a new government with the centre-left Democratic party. Then, in 2021, almost all parties supported the appointment of Mario Draghi as prime minister. Italy has a truly bicameral parliament, in which the chamber of deputies and the senate have equal influence; any law must be approved by both, and any government must have the support of both. Since 2018, the size of both chambers has been reduced, but electoral law is the same. Two thirds of seats are assigned proportionally, while the rest are assigned in first-past-the-post constituencies. This penalises smaller parties, and leads to the formation of strategic alliances aimed at winning in the single-member constituencies. Electoral alliances have no bearing on parties once members are elected, and won\u2019t necessarily mirror the composition of the next government coalition. Constituencies are broadly based on population, with exceptions to guarantee representation for two semi-autonomous regions, Val d\u2019Aosta and Trentino-Alto Adige, and a small number of seats in each chamber representing Italians who live overseas. These results are the official results as released by the interior ministry, not the projections which broadcasters and others make based on samples of results."

            "title": "Republicans unveil 90s-throwback midterm election agenda",
            "date": "2022-09-23T17:40:28Z",
            "content": "Republicans have unveiled a midterm election agenda heavy on critiques of Joe Biden but light on specific policies \u2013 and with a throwback theme to the mid-1990s. After a primary season dominated by extremist \u201cMake America great again\u201d (Maga) candidates and deniers of the 2020 election result, Friday\u2019s launch also represented an effort to tone down rhetoric and win back independent voters. Kevin McCarthy, minority leader in the House of Representatives, introduced the party\u2019s \u201cCommitment to America\u201d at an event near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground in November\u2019s vote. The memo of principles underlined how Republicans are hoping to make the midterms a referendum on the presidency of Biden rather than his predecessor, Donald Trump, who continues to suck up media oxygen as a target of several criminal and civil investigations. \u201cI challenge the president to join with us \u2013 let\u2019s go across the country and let\u2019s debate what his policies have done to America and our plan for a new direction,\u201d McCarthy told supporters. \u201cAnd let\u2019s let America make the decision for the best way for this country to go forward.\u201d The one-page commitment carried unavoidable echoes of the \u201cContract With America\u201d, a statement of intent in 1994 that helped Newt Gingrich\u2019s Republicans gain the House majority during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, for the first time in more than four decades. But McCarthy\u2019s version offered less detail and, critics said, less ambition. Its defining message was that Democrats have failed the American people. McCarthy, who hopes to replace Nancy Pelosi as House speaker, said: \u201cThe Democrats, they control Washington. They control the House, the Senate, the White House. They control the committees, they control the agencies. It\u2019s their plan but they have no plan to fix all the problems they\u2019ve created.\u201d Taking a leaflet from his jacket pocket, McCarthy added: \u201cSo you know what? We\u2019ve created a commitment to America.\u201d The four pillars are \u201can economy that\u2019s strong\u201d, \u201ca nation that\u2019s safe\u201d, \u201ca future that\u2019s free\u201d and \u201ca government that\u2019s accountable\u201d. The first point reflects Republicans\u2019 hope that stubbornly high inflation will lead voters to punish Democrats on election day. McCarthy said a strong economy means \u201cyou can fill up your tank, you can buy the groceries, you have enough money left over to go to Disneyland and save for a future \u2013 that the pay cheques grow; they no longer shrink\u201d. A safe nation, he added, \u201cmeans your community will be protected, your law enforcement will be respected, your criminals will be prosecuted\u201d. McCarthy also emphasised the scourge of the opioid fentanyl and the need to secure the US-Mexico border, an issue recently dominated by a stunt in which the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, relocated migrants to Martha\u2019s Vineyard in Massachusetts. Indeed, Friday\u2019s launch was notable for what McCarthy did not talk about: abortion rights, voting rights and the climate crisis, all of which are seen as political liabilities for his party. Democrats have been energised by June\u2019s supreme court decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion. McCarthy sought to project party unity despite the uneasy coalition that makes up the House minority. It remains uncertain whether the House Freedom Caucus, including far-right members loyal to Trump, will support McCarthy for speaker. Democrats dismissed the Commitment to America as a Trump platform in disguise. Pelosi said: \u201cToday\u2019s rollout is the latest evidence of House Republicans\u2019 wholehearted commitment to Maga: going all in on an extremist agenda designed to greatly diminish Americans\u2019 health, freedom and security.\u201d The House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, distributed a list of eight questions Democrats have for Republicans about their platform. It took aim at many House members\u2019 staunch defence of Trump. \u201cWho won the 2020 Presidential Election?\u201d the list asks. \u201cLike President Trump, do you believe that the January 6 insurrectionists were engaged in \u2018legitimate political discourse\u2019 and should not be prosecuted for their violent actions? \u2026 Do you support defunding the FBI in retaliation for executing a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago?\u201d The list also seizes on other Republican policies. Hoyer asked:\u201cWill Republicans pursue a nationwide abortion ban? \u2026 If given the chance, will you try again to repeal the Affordable Care Act and strip health-care access away from millions of Americans?\u201d Others joined the criticism. Reed Galen, co-founder of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, said: \u201cThis agenda is meaningless. Kevin McCarthy wants everyone to think he has a positive agenda for America \u2013 which nothing could be further from the truth. \u201cThe ultra-Maga has total control of the party and is only interested in a national abortion ban and impeaching Joe Biden. The GOP is no longer interested in governing, they just want to obtain power and use it to destroy their enemies.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s initiative contrasts with the Senate, where the minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has declined to put forward an agenda, preferring to simply run against Biden. Republicans remain the favourites to win back the House and have history on their side: since the second world war, the president\u2019s party has on average lost 29 House seats in each president\u2019s first midterm election, according to the Council on Foreign Relations."

            "title": "Bannon is not finished: his \u2018precinct strategy\u2019 could alter US elections for years",
            "date": "2022-09-10T06:30:00Z",
            "content": "When Steve Bannon heard that he was, after all, going to face charges last week for allegedly ripping off contributors to a multimillion-dollar fund to build a wall on the Mexican border, he claimed it was a sign of his success. Donald Trump\u2019s former strategist said his arrest on Thursday was an attempt to shut down his War Room pod and video cast because it is driving grassroots support for the former president\u2019s Make America Great Again (Maga) movement and reshaping the Republican party ahead of the midterm elections. \u201cThey are coming after all of us, not only President Trump and myself. I am never going to stop fighting,\u201d he said. That much was apparent from Bannon\u2019s final broadcast before his arrest as he let loose against the Biden \u201cregime\u201d and \u201csocial media oligarchs\u201d he accused of conspiring to fix elections for the Democrats. For Bannon, the endless war is between \u201cpeople in our posse\u201d and Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cglobal attack on Maga\u201d. The audience for this daily assault on reality is not as large as it once was. YouTube blocked the War Room two days after the storming of the Capitol in January 2021 for falsely claiming the presidential election was stolen. Exact numbers of listeners are hard to come by but the programme has been downloaded millions of times and still regularly appears in the top 50 most listened to podcasts in the US, at times reaching No 2 in Apple podcasts about American politics. From there, the War Room appears to be having an impact far beyond the sight of most Americans, as Bannon pushes a strategy for Maga supporters to infiltrate the Republican party before the midterms and 2024 presidential election. But now the 68-year-old architect of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential election victory, and briefly a White House aide, could be stopped in his tracks by his legal problems. Bannon already has a conviction for contempt of Congress under his belt for refusing to testify over his role in the attack on the Capitol that could send him to jail for months when he is sentenced in October. The latest charges put the white nationalist back on the hook for alleged crimes for which he was pardoned by Trump in the last hours of his presidency. That pardon covered only federal crimes and New York state has waded in to accuse Bannon of stealing $1m from donations to the We Build The Wall campaign to help construct an anti-migrant barrier on the US border with Mexico. Two other men have already pleaded guilty in connection with the alleged fraud and face lengthy prison sentences. Madeline Peltz, who has followed Bannon\u2019s broadcasts for the past two years for Media Matters, which monitors conservative and far-right commentators, said that for all his problems, it would be a mistake to write off the populist agitator. \u201cThe big picture shows that you can never really count out Steve Bannon, both because of the trajectory of his career as well as the status of the movement in which he is a prominent figure,\u201d she said. Bannon has maintained that status by keeping the myth of the stolen 2020 presidential election front and centre in his broadcasts as key to engineering Trump\u2019s comeback if he runs again in two years. But Bannon\u2019s most important role at present may be his championing of what is known as the \u201cprecinct strategy\u201d, which seeks to take control of the Republican party from the bottom up, getting Trump supporters to take low-ranking, often vacant, positions within local branches. They are then in a position to select more senior party officials and to influence decisions such as the staffing of elections and selection of candidates, and ultimately to move up the party ranks. Maga activists are also targeting school boards and poll monitoring positions. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take this back village by village \u2026 precinct by precinct,\u201d Bannon said in one of his shows pushing the strategy. ProPublica contacted dozens of Republican party county leaders across the US who reported significant increases in membership applications that appear tied to the precinct strategy. Peltz said that the consequences could be with America for years. \u201cIf Bannon is successful in shoehorning grassroots activists, which it appears that he is, he could have loyalists controlling the levels of power within the Republican party and, even more concerning, in election administration. That could be almost impossible to unwind for years and decades to come,\u201d she said. For all that, Bannon faces challenges. As he sought to remain politically relevant after a brief and turbulent stint as a White House aide at the beginning of Trump\u2019s presidency, Bannon launched a far-right group in Europe, the Movement, that rapidly failed. He also fell out badly with Trump, with the president saying that his former strategist had \u201clost his mind\u201d after Bannon was quoted as describing a meeting between one of the president\u2019s sons and a group of Russians as \u201ctreasonous\u201d. Bannon backed off but the damage was done and it cost him his position running the far-right Breitbart News after a major financial backer withdrew support over the Trump comments. Bannon reingratiated himself in part by launching the War Room from a Washington townhouse three years ago to campaign against Trump\u2019s impeachment. Within a few months, it evolved into War Room: Pandemic to exploit uncertainty and fear about the spread of coronavirus. Eventually, it broadened as a platform for Bannon\u2019s rants about whatever was frustrating him. Bannon\u2019s influence is not without its limits. Most of the candidates he backed in the 2022 Republican primaries lost. Peltz said that he is also financially vulnerable. \u201cA big weakness is that he\u2019s super desperate for money. His billionaire benefactor, Gou Wengui, declared bankruptcy. Since then the whole show has turned into a big rightwing direct-to-consumer ad for a variety of scammy projects, including gold, MyPillow, satellite cellphones, prepper supplies. That\u2019s a sign that he\u2019s not in a good position,\u201d she said. Then there is the prospect of prison. He would not be able to broadcast the War Room from his cell, although others might hold the fort if he was serving a relatively short spell in jail. A longer prison sentence of several years, which is quite possible if he is convicted on the fraud charges, would be a different matter. Still, Peltz said that a prison sentence could bolster Bannon\u2019s credibility on the right. \u201cHe ultimately will be a bigger hero among the Maga crowd than ever, and I think that his sort of profile in American politics could take off from there,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2022-09-23T14:01:31Z",
            "content": "A conservative coalition forecast to glide into power in the Italian general election on Sunday has wrapped up its campaign to a packed square in central Rome, filled with supporters old and new, young and not so young, a smattering of anti-abortion activists and a descendant of the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. The trio \u2013 led by Giorgia Meloni\u2019s Brothers of Italy, a party with neofascist origins, and including Matteo Salvini\u2019s far-right League and Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia \u2013 has experienced loud and robust support over the past months and remained relatively close-knit, in stark contrast to a campaign by its main rival, the centre-left Democratic party, that has been so lacklustre it managed to breathe new life into the populist Five Star Movement (M5S) in southern Italy. The first to take to the stage at the Rome closing rally on Thursday evening was the three-time former prime minister Berlusconi, who rattled off a list of his past achievements. Then came Salvini, who said that in office he would resume a policy of blocking migrants from landing at Italian ports. The most rapturous applause was reserved for Meloni, the 45-year-old from Rome who could become Italy\u2019s first female prime minister. Ask Meloni\u2019s supporters why they like her, and the recurrent reply is: \u201cShe\u2019s coherent\u201d. \u201cThe ideas of Meloni are always the same, they haven\u2019t changed over the years,\u201d said Francesca De Acutis. \u201cTo get this far, she never made compromises.\u201d Maria Rachele Ruiu, a Brothers of Italy candidate who hails from the anti-abortion lobby group Pro Vita, said Meloni has been rewarded for her coherence. \u201cShe can be trusted,\u201d she added. Ruiu said she was running in the elections to help bring forward policies that would \u201chelp women in financial difficulty to carry through their pregnancy\u201d instead of choosing to abort. Caio Mussolini, the great-grandson of the dictator who ran as a candidate for Brothers of Italy in the 2019 European parliamentary elections, was also in the crowd to lend Meloni support. He criticised the left\u2019s campaign, saying \u201cthe ghost of fascism is the only thing they have [\u2026] This has been one of the worst campaigns, filled with insults and attacks because they have no projects or ideas. They are making my great-grandfather immortal. In my opinion, fascism ended with his [death] in 1945.\u201d Final polls before the blackout period two weeks ago forecast a landslide victory for the group. However, more recently there has been a surprise bounce in support for M5S in Italy\u2019s poorer southern regions, where voters have responded to leader Giuseppe Conte\u2019s promise to retain the party\u2019s flagship policy, the citizens\u2019 income for the poor. Meloni\u2019s plan to scrap the controversial policy, which cost the Italian government \u20ac7.1bn in its first year, has been vulnerable to fraud and has not created the jobs it was intended to, has unleashed fury among voters whose livelihoods have come to depend on it. Three million Italians benefit from the income, of whom 70% are in the south. In Sicily, Italy\u2019s poorest region, almost 300,000 families receive the subsidy. During a rally by Meloni in Palermo last week, many voters carried signs that read: \u201cDon\u2019t touch the citizens\u2019 income\u201d. Conte told the Guardian that the income had \u201cset off a social storm\u201d. \u201cWhen people carry signs like that, it\u2019s as if those voters are saying, \u2018our dignity is untouchable, our freedom is untouchable\u2019,\u201d he said. Further north, however, Meloni\u2019s stance over the income has attracted support from employers, especially bar and restaurant owners, who blame the policy for their struggles with hiring staff. Still, experts have been taken back by M5S\u2019s revival in the final stage of the electoral campaign, citing \u201csecret polls\u201d in recent days that forecast a boost for the party to around 15 or 16% of the vote, potentially enough to give the rightwing coalition a thinner majority and tamper with its unity, especially if the League, which polled at around 12% before the blackout period, scores less than M5S. M5S won 32% in the 2018 elections, but support rapidly depleted after a failed government coalition with the League, waning even further during subsequent alliances with the Democratic party and Mario Draghi\u2019s broad unity government. The collapse of Draghi\u2019s government in July was, in fact, triggered by M5S. For the party to stand a chance at reentering government, it would need to again partner with the Democratic party, whose leader, Enrico Letta, swore on Friday \u201cnever again\u201d. The citizens\u2019 income battle could give M5S a boost, but is unlikely to change the course of these elections. Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of the London-based research company Teneo, said the same secret polls also maintained that the rightwing would win with a majority. \u201cThe electoral system doesn\u2019t really play well for a party that has a high concentration of votes only in some regions,\u201d he added."

More than 875 people have been charged with crimes related to January 6, according to an NPR tracker. 370 people have pleaded guilty to crimes so far. Trump also said he was offering financial support to some of those involved in the attack. \u201cI am financially supporting people that are incredible and they were in my office actually two days ago, so they\u2019re very much in my mind,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace what they\u2019ve done to them. What they\u2019ve done to these people is disgraceful.\u201d It was not immediately clear what the extent of Trump\u2019s financial assistance was. In a series of televised hearings this summer, the US House panel investigating the Capitol attack laid out extensive evidence that Trump encouraged the mob to go to the Capitol on January 6 and resisted efforts to quell the violence. The panel is set to continue its work this fall, but the decision over whether to file criminal charges will ultimately be made by the US Department of Justice. Trump has heavily hinted that he will run for the presidency again in 2024, but has so far not confirmed any bid. If he does run, he will automatically be the overwhelming favorite to be the Republican nominee as his grip on the party and its base remains strong. Trump\u2019s comments came the same day that Thomas Webster, a retired New York police department officer, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, the longest sentence issued so far for any defendant in the attack, according to the Associated Press. A jury found Webster guilty after he argued he was acting in self-defense when he assaulted a Washington DC police officer and pulled his gas mask off. \u201cSome of the legal people on the other side, they\u2019re the most cold-hearted people. They don\u2019t care about families. They don\u2019t care about anything,\u201d Trump said Thursday. Amit Mehta, the US district judge who sentenced Webster, said that other than the police officer, the other victim in the attack was \u201cdemocracy\u201d."

            "content": "Kenya\u2019s supreme court has confirmed William Ruto as winner of the country\u2019s disputed national vote, ending weeks of political uncertainty after the opposition \u2013 and election officials \u2013 questioned the count. Ruto was announced winner on 15 August amid a divide within the electoral commission over the declared outcome, which showed that the vice-president had gained 50.5% of the vote, beating the longtime opposition leader, Raila Odinga, and narrowly avoiding a runoff. More than half of the commissioners disowned the vote, terming the process \u201copaque\u201d, and Odinga launched a challenge in the court, alleging fraud, voter suppression and impunity by the commission\u2019s chair, whom he claimed acted unilaterally. It was Odinga\u2019s fifth and likely last attempt at the presidency. The court held that there was no credible evidence of fraud, interference or a failure of the electoral body\u2019s technology. It held that there were valid reasons for the postponement of the gubernatorial elections in certain areas (some of which were perceived Odinga strongholds) and that there were no grounds to conclude that the postponement had affected voter turnout. It said that all electoral commissioners were involved in the process until just before the announcement of results, and that there was no evidence to show that the process was \u201copaque\u201d in a way that compromised the outcome. \u201cWe declare the election of the president-elect to be valid,\u201d said Martha Koome, the chief justice, in a televised ruling. The judgment comes after a nearly two-week standstill as the country awaited the court\u2019s determination on the disputed election. Ruto will be taking over the reins of the east African powerhouse from the departing president Uhuru Kenyatta. Kenyatta had supported Odinga\u2019s bid, over his second-in-command\u2019s, after they had a falling out in their second term. Kenyatta has respected unfavourable court rulings in the past \u2013 including when his first 2017 win was nullified after a botched 2017 election \u2013 and is expected to hand over power to his deputy in the coming weeks. While Ruto\u2019s win is seen as ending a long chokehold on the presidency by powerful dynasties, the new leader\u2019s ultra-religious, conservative stance and poor human rights track-record has raised some concerns among the public. Ruto was charged at the international criminal court with crimes against humanity after the country\u2019s 2007 post-election violence, but the case was terminated amid claims of political interference and an environment judges described as \u201chostile\u201d to the prosecution and its witnesses. But for many, more immediate concerns were at the forefront of the elections. The president-elect is taking over at an economically turbulent time for Kenya, and will be kicking off his term amid high expectations among the country\u2019s poor, who are widely seen as having tided him into power. Odinga still has strong public support, having won 48.8% of the vote, and many hope that he may step back into his role as a significant opposition figure."

We\u2019ve created a commitment to America.\u201d The four pillars are \u201can economy that\u2019s strong\u201d, \u201ca nation that\u2019s safe\u201d, \u201ca future that\u2019s free\u201d and \u201ca government that\u2019s accountable\u201d. The first point reflects Republicans\u2019 hope that stubbornly high inflation will lead voters to punish Democrats on election day. McCarthy said a strong economy means \u201cyou can fill up your tank, you can buy the groceries, you have enough money left over to go to Disneyland and save for a future \u2013 that the pay cheques grow; they no longer shrink\u201d. A safe nation, he added, \u201cmeans your community will be protected, your law enforcement will be respected, your criminals will be prosecuted\u201d. McCarthy also emphasised the scourge of the opioid fentanyl and the need to secure the US-Mexico border, an issue recently dominated by a stunt in which the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, relocated migrants to Martha\u2019s Vineyard in Massachusetts. Indeed, Friday\u2019s launch was notable for what McCarthy did not talk about: abortion rights, voting rights and the climate crisis, all of which are seen as political liabilities for his party. Democrats have been energised by June\u2019s supreme court decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion. McCarthy sought to project party unity despite the uneasy coalition that makes up the House minority. It remains uncertain whether the House Freedom Caucus, including far-right members loyal to Trump, will support McCarthy for speaker. Democrats dismissed the Commitment to America as a Trump platform in disguise. Pelosi said: \u201cToday\u2019s rollout is the latest evidence of House Republicans\u2019 wholehearted commitment to Maga: going all in on an extremist agenda designed to greatly diminish Americans\u2019 health, freedom and security.\u201d The House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, distributed a list of eight questions Democrats have for Republicans about their platform. It took aim at many House members\u2019 staunch defence of Trump. \u201cWho won the 2020 Presidential Election?\u201d the list asks. \u201cLike President Trump, do you believe that the January 6 insurrectionists were engaged in \u2018legitimate political discourse\u2019 and should not be prosecuted for their violent actions? \u2026 Do you support defunding the FBI in retaliation for executing a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago?\u201d The list also seizes on other Republican policies. Hoyer asked:\u201cWill Republicans pursue a nationwide abortion ban? \u2026 If given the chance, will you try again to repeal the Affordable Care Act and strip health-care access away from millions of Americans?\u201d Others joined the criticism. Reed Galen, co-founder of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, said: \u201cThis agenda is meaningless. Kevin McCarthy wants everyone to think he has a positive agenda for America \u2013 which nothing could be further from the truth. \u201cThe ultra-Maga has total control of the party and is only interested in a national abortion ban and impeaching Joe Biden. The GOP is no longer interested in governing, they just want to obtain power and use it to destroy their enemies.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s initiative contrasts with the Senate, where the minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has declined to put forward an agenda, preferring to simply run against Biden. Republicans remain the favourites to win back the House and have history on their side: since the second world war, the president\u2019s party has on average lost 29 House seats in each president\u2019s first midterm election, according to the Council on Foreign Relations."

            "content": "A conservative coalition forecast to glide into power in the Italian general election on Sunday has wrapped up its campaign to a packed square in central Rome, filled with supporters old and new, young and not so young, a smattering of anti-abortion activists and a descendant of the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. The trio \u2013 led by Giorgia Meloni\u2019s Brothers of Italy, a party with neofascist origins, and including Matteo Salvini\u2019s far-right League and Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia \u2013 has experienced loud and robust support over the past months and remained relatively close-knit, in stark contrast to a campaign by its main rival, the centre-left Democratic party, that has been so lacklustre it managed to breathe new life into the populist Five Star Movement (M5S) in southern Italy. The first to take to the stage at the Rome closing rally on Thursday evening was the three-time former prime minister Berlusconi, who rattled off a list of his past achievements. Then came Salvini, who said that in office he would resume a policy of blocking migrants from landing at Italian ports. The most rapturous applause was reserved for Meloni, the 45-year-old from Rome who could become Italy\u2019s first female prime minister. Ask Meloni\u2019s supporters why they like her, and the recurrent reply is: \u201cShe\u2019s coherent\u201d. \u201cThe ideas of Meloni are always the same, they haven\u2019t changed over the years,\u201d said Francesca De Acutis. \u201cTo get this far, she never made compromises.\u201d Maria Rachele Ruiu, a Brothers of Italy candidate who hails from the anti-abortion lobby group Pro Vita, said Meloni has been rewarded for her coherence. \u201cShe can be trusted,\u201d she added. Ruiu said she was running in the elections to help bring forward policies that would \u201chelp women in financial difficulty to carry through their pregnancy\u201d instead of choosing to abort. Caio Mussolini, the great-grandson of the dictator who ran as a candidate for Brothers of Italy in the 2019 European parliamentary elections, was also in the crowd to lend Meloni support. He criticised the left\u2019s campaign, saying \u201cthe ghost of fascism is the only thing they have [\u2026] This has been one of the worst campaigns, filled with insults and attacks because they have no projects or ideas. They are making my great-grandfather immortal. In my opinion, fascism ended with his [death] in 1945.\u201d Final polls before the blackout period two weeks ago forecast a landslide victory for the group. However, more recently there has been a surprise bounce in support for M5S in Italy\u2019s poorer southern regions, where voters have responded to leader Giuseppe Conte\u2019s promise to retain the party\u2019s flagship policy, the citizens\u2019 income for the poor. Meloni\u2019s plan to scrap the controversial policy, which cost the Italian government \u20ac7.1bn in its first year, has been vulnerable to fraud and has not created the jobs it was intended to, has unleashed fury among voters whose livelihoods have come to depend on it. Three million Italians benefit from the income, of whom 70% are in the south. In Sicily, Italy\u2019s poorest region, almost 300,000 families receive the subsidy. During a rally by Meloni in Palermo last week, many voters carried signs that read: \u201cDon\u2019t touch the citizens\u2019 income\u201d. Conte told the Guardian that the income had \u201cset off a social storm\u201d. \u201cWhen people carry signs like that, it\u2019s as if those voters are saying, \u2018our dignity is untouchable, our freedom is untouchable\u2019,\u201d he said. Further north, however, Meloni\u2019s stance over the income has attracted support from employers, especially bar and restaurant owners, who blame the policy for their struggles with hiring staff. Still, experts have been taken back by M5S\u2019s revival in the final stage of the electoral campaign, citing \u201csecret polls\u201d in recent days that forecast a boost for the party to around 15 or 16% of the vote, potentially enough to give the rightwing coalition a thinner majority and tamper with its unity, especially if the League, which polled at around 12% before the blackout period, scores less than M5S. M5S won 32% in the 2018 elections, but support rapidly depleted after a failed government coalition with the League, waning even further during subsequent alliances with the Democratic party and Mario Draghi\u2019s broad unity government. The collapse of Draghi\u2019s government in July was, in fact, triggered by M5S. For the party to stand a chance at reentering government, it would need to again partner with the Democratic party, whose leader, Enrico Letta, swore on Friday \u201cnever again\u201d. The citizens\u2019 income battle could give M5S a boost, but is unlikely to change the course of these elections. Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of the London-based research company Teneo, said the same secret polls also maintained that the rightwing would win with a majority. \u201cThe electoral system doesn\u2019t really play well for a party that has a high concentration of votes only in some regions,\u201d he added."

            "content": "It was a scene that could have been plucked from Brazil\u2019s history books: an enraptured crowd, a sea of flags and, on stage above them, a bearded leftist in a bright red shirt. \u201cThe president of hope is here!\u201d the master of ceremonies roared as the star of the show arrived in a police convoy to address the people whose country he is promising to save. As their champion came into view, the throng chanted back a refrain from old times: \u201cOl\u00ea, ol\u00ea, ol\u00ea, ol\u00e1, Lula, Lula!\u201d Virtually identical spectacles played out two decades ago as Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva prepared to claim a momentous election victory in 2002 that would make him the first working-class president of one of the world\u2019s most unequal nations. But this was September 2022 and the factory worker who became a left-wing legend was battling to complete a sensational political comeback that would return him to the presidency at the age of 77. \u201cGet your new Bermudas ready! Get your new shirts ready! Because on 1 January, I\u2019ll be taking power!\u201d Lula told the thousands of supporters who had come to see him in Nova Igua\u00e7u, a down-at-heel city north of Rio. With two weeks until an election in which Lula hopes to defeat Brazil\u2019s far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro, the leftist is in pole position to achieve that goal \u2013 and the mostly black, working class crowd in Nova Igua\u00e7u is desperate for him to succeed. \u201cBolsonaro is dragging our country into destitution and we\u2019re counting on Lula to change this,\u201d said Isac de Jesus da Silva, a street hawker who was selling blocks of banana jelly outside Lula\u2019s event beneath a forest of electricity pylons. \u201cHe\u2019s the greatest president Brazil has ever had,\u201d added the 38-year-old, one of an estimated 33 million Brazilians struggling to feed themselves as a result of soaring food prices and a Covid crisis that killed more than 685,000 people and brought economic misery. \u201cMy fridge is empty, my friend,\u201d he sighed. \u201cUnfortunately, under Bolsonaro I\u2019m going hungry. We need Lula back in power so we can eat again.\u201d Nostalgia for Lula\u2019s two-term government, when he used a commodities boom to bankroll social programmes that helped millions escape poverty, has played a leading role in his sixth presidential run. On the stump in Nova Igua\u00e7u, Lula promised to empower the urban poor as he did from 2003 to 2010, telling his audience: \u201cWe abolished slavery in 1888 and we no longer want to be anyone\u2019s slave.\u201d \u201cWe are going to build a compassionate, humane and fraternal country where no mother will go to bed seeing her child go hungry,\u201d he declared, to cheers of delight. \u201cWhat would become of us without Lula?\u201d asked Rute Alves, a 60-year-old snack vendor who was there with her family and believed her candidate was set to win outright in the first round on 2 October. That is a possibility, with two recent polls giving Lula a 12 to 15-point lead over Bolsonaro and suggesting he might secure the 50% of votes that would return him to the presidency without a run-off in late October. But Bolsonaro, to whom a third of voters remain loyal, is not without support. Many millions of Brazilians view the prospect of a Lula revival with dread after the corruption scandals that blighted his government. Twenty-four hours earlier, the right-wing radical rallied tens of thousands of devotees on Copacabana beach for a show of strength designed to demonstrate he still has a shot at staying in power. \u201cHe\u2019s doing a good job and we do not want Brazil to become communist,\u201d said Fernanda Laranjeira, a 45-year-old lawyer wearing a bright yellow T-shirt stamped with Bolsonaro\u2019s slogan: \u201cBrazil above everything! God above all!\u201d Would Bolsonaro win? \u201cI want him to win,\u201d Laranjeira said. \u201cIf the results are honest, he\u2019ll win. If he doesn\u2019t win, it\u2019s because the vote was rigged.\u201d Bolsonaro\u2019s relentless questioning of Brazil\u2019s internationally respected electronic voting system \u2013 for which he has provided no evidence \u2013 has become a key plank of his campaign and fuelled fears he may refuse to step down. Some worry the Donald Trump-admiring former army captain will contest the result, as his US ally did after Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory, potentially bringing 6 January-style turmoil to Brazil\u2019s streets. Bolsonaro has said he will concede if he considers the result \u201cclean and transparent\u201d \u2013 yet Brazil\u2019s president has repeatedly suggested it will not be and has dismissed polls showing him trailing Lula as a sham. Last month more than a million Brazilians signed a manifesto warning that their young democracy faced a moment of \u201cgreat danger\u201d given Bolsonaro\u2019s admiration for Brazil\u2019s 1964-85 military dictatorship. Thomas Shannon, the US ambassador to Brazil under Barack Obama, said he doubted Brazil\u2019s armed forces would back an attempt by Bolsonaro to overturn the result by force. \u201cThey would be putting their long-term reputation and their long-term relationship with the Brazilian people on the line for a very short-term product.\u201d Yet the former ambassador did not rule out some key hardline military figures supporting such a rupture to keep Bolsonaro in power. \u201cThe question is specific individuals \u2013 because individuals can always decide to act in ways that are not in the best interests of an institution but are certainly in their best interests,\u201d Shannon warned. Alexandre Padilha, a former minister and key member of Lula\u2019s campaign team, said he was hopeful of a first round victory but expected Bolsonaro to challenge the result. \u201cWe have to be prepared for the most preposterous behaviour from Bolsonaro,\u201d he said, pointing to the president\u2019s \u201coutrageous\u201d response to Covid, his destruction of the Amazon and incitement of political violence. \u201cWe have to be ready for him to question the election result and bring political instability to the country. We have to be ready for everything.\u201d Padilha voiced optimism, however, that Lula would prevail and, on day one of his presidency, launch an immediate war on hunger. Such pledges are music to the ears of people like Isac de Jesus da Silva, who was a teenager when Lula was first elected and is now struggling into middle age. As he waited for the leftist to arrive in Nova Igua\u00e7u, Silva scoffed at Bolsonaro\u2019s efforts to portray himself as \u201ccaptain of the people\u201d. \u201cBolsonaro\u2019s the rich man\u2019s president. And the one who\u2019s fighting for the poor - the Robin Hood of the poor - right now is Lula. He\u2019s the only person who cares about those of us who have nothing,\u201d he said. Silva shrugged off the corruption scandals that saw Lula jailed ahead of the 2018 election that brought Bolsonaro to power. The convictions were quashed last year, paving the way for Lula to write what he hopes will be the final chapter in a storybook four-decade political career. \u201cLots of people say Lula stole. I\u2019ve no idea if he did or he didn\u2019t,\u201d Silva said. \u201cBut if he did, at least he took from the rich to give to the poor.\u201d"

            "content": "About the election The vote was triggered when the Five Star Movement abruptly withdrew its support for Mario Draghi\u2019s technocratic government, but an election was due next year in any event. The last election, in 2018, brought the Five Star Movement to power, in coalition with Matteo Salvini\u2019s rightwing populist League. Salvini later withdrew from the coalition, and Five Star formed a new government with the centre-left Democratic party. Then, in 2021, almost all parties supported the appointment of Mario Draghi as prime minister. Italy has a truly bicameral parliament, in which the chamber of deputies and the senate have equal influence; any law must be approved by both, and any government must have the support of both. Since 2018, the size of both chambers has been reduced, but electoral law is the same. Two thirds of seats are assigned proportionally, while the rest are assigned in first-past-the-post constituencies. This penalises smaller parties, and leads to the formation of strategic alliances aimed at winning in the single-member constituencies. Electoral alliances have no bearing on parties once members are elected, and won\u2019t necessarily mirror the composition of the next government coalition. Constituencies are broadly based on population, with exceptions to guarantee representation for two semi-autonomous regions, Val d\u2019Aosta and Trentino-Alto Adige, and a small number of seats in each chamber representing Italians who live overseas. These results are the official results as released by the interior ministry, not the projections which broadcasters and others make based on samples of results."

The party is a member of fellow far-right leader Giorgia Meloni\u2019s triumphant coalition, but its share of the vote fell to 9% \u2013 an abysmal result for a party that in 2019 was polling at almost 40%. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a new leader,\u201d Roberto Maroni, a former head of the League and ex-Lombardy governor, wrote in a column for the daily newspaper Il Foglio. \u201cI know who should be elected as the new party secretary. But I\u2019m not naming names, for now.\u201d His call came amid reports in the Italian press that Salvini will not be reappointed interior minister by Meloni, a role he had held from 2018 to 2019 while in coalition with the Five Star Movement and used to attempt to block migrants from landing in Italian ports. The reports suggested that Meloni had decided to give the interior minister\u2019s portfolio to a member of her Brothers of Italy in light of the League\u2019s disappointing electoral result and offer Salvini\u2019s League a more marginal role. \u201cThe era of Salvini\u2019s leadership of the League is over,\u201d said Roberto Castelli, a former justice minister and League leader. Former leaders of the League and thousands of supporters accuse Salvini of having distorted the party and its regional roots in a bid to make it a national force. The Northern League, founded in 1989, aimed to assert the interests of northern Italy but in the course of his leadership, Salvini transformed it by abandoning the old autonomist and secessionist claims and embracing the sovereignist and populist currents of the contemporary far right. Calls for Salvini\u2019s resignation follow another disappointing result for the party: the once-secessionist Northern League leader, Umberto Bossi, on Sunday failed to be elected to parliament for the first time in 35 years. Bossi, 81, was top of the League\u2019s proportional ticket for the house in his home town of Varese but the party failed to gain a seat there, reflecting a poor performance, even in its northern heartlands, in the elections where the Brothers of Italy gobbled up much of the League\u2019s former base. Salvini has said he was not satisfied with the League\u2019s election results but had no intention of resigning, saying the outcome had made him even more determined."

            "content": "The far-right Sweden Democrats party was the big winner in the country\u2019s election on Sunday, increasing its share of the vote by two to three percentage points and becoming the second largest party, but the overall result was too close to call as counting continued. With 95% of votes counted, the rightwing bloc had 49.7% of the vote, which would give it a majority of one seat in parliament over the incumbent leftwing bloc. Exit polls on Sunday night at first suggested a narrow victory for the Social Democrats and their centre-left allies. But as the votes were counted the tally swung towards the right. A conclusive result may not be known until votes from Swedes living abroad are counted in the middle of the week, while the closeness of the race may yet complicate the formation of a working government. The leader of the Sweden Democrats said early on Monday that the rightwing bloc was likely heading for victory. \u201cRight now it looks like there will be a change of power,\u201d Jimmie \u00c5kesson said in a speech to party members. The incumbent Social Democrat prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, told cheering supporters on Sunday night: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have a final result tonight\u201d, Andersson, 55, called on Swedes to \u201chave patience\u201d and \u201clet democracy run its course\u201d. The prospect that the far-right Sweden Democrats, who appeared to take more than 20% of the poll, may for the first time achieve direct influence over government policy marks a seismic shift in a country far better known for its liberal traditions. The SD emerged from Sweden\u2019s neo-Nazi movement in the mid-1990s and still struggles to shake off accusations of extremism. It was treated as a pariah by other parties, but three years ago, the centre-right Moderate party embraced cooperation with the far right. The SD has increased its vote at each of the past nine general elections. Its leaders are demanding ministerial office, but the other three parties in the bloc have said they will not invite the party into government itself. However, the SD\u2019s position as the largest party on the right places them in a strong position. \u201cThe SD is currently by far the biggest party in the world with Nazi roots,\u201d said Tobias H\u00fcbinette, lecturer in intercultural studies at Karlstad University and a leading anti-racist. \u201cEven if the party officially condemns its own race ideological roots, this background is today still present in the sense that the SD is still \u2026 seeing itself as the only political force that can save the native white Swedish majority population.\u201d \u00c5kesson told a crowd of cheering supporters on Sunday evening: \u201cOur goal is to sit in government. Our goal is a majority government. It\u2019s looking pretty damn good now.\u201d The party secretary, Richard Jomshof, told public television SVT he \u201cdidn\u2019t believe\u201d other parties would be able to freeze out the Sweden Democrats again and expected to have a strong influence on the country\u2019s politics. \u201cWe are so big now \u2026 it is clear we should have a spot on parliamentary committees,\u201d he said. He said the party had \u201ca chance to be an active part of a government that would move politics in a completely different direction\u201d. At the height of the campaign, the SD billed a metro train decorated in its electoral colours as the \u201crepatriation express\u201d. \u201cWelcome aboard with a one-way ticket. Next stop, Kabul,\u201d tweeted the party\u2019s legal spokesperson, highlighting the SD\u2019s demand to remove non-European immigrants. The election has revealed Sweden to be a nation deeply ill at ease with immigration, with the SD able to exploit fears over violent crime. Voter concerns such as energy price rises, failing schools and long queues for healthcare were drowned out by a relentless focus on immigration and crime. The campaign was punctuated by further incidents of gang violence, the prevalence of which during the past five years \u2013 and the failure of government and the police to prevent them \u2013 has helped the SD to cement support for its central message that immigration is to blame. Two weeks ago, a woman and her five-year-old child were injured after being caught in crossfire in Eskilstuna, west of Stockholm. In Malm\u00f6 a week earlier, a 15-year-old boy shot dead a gang leader in a shopping mall. The number of fatal shootings rose sharply to 34 in the first six months of this year, up from 20 in the same period of 2021. Party leaders on both left and right linked the rise in violent crime with large-scale immigration, which has led to high levels of segregation along ethnic lines in the housing and jobs markets. In the space of a few decades, Sweden has become one of the most multicultural societies in Europe, with more than a third of the population having been born abroad or having a parent who was born abroad. About 30% of children do not have Swedish as their mother tongue, rising to 45% in parts of the cities."

Among Republican candidates for US Senate, Ted Budd in North Carolina, Blake Masters in Arizona, Kelly Tshibaka in Alaska, and JD Vance in Ohio have all refused to commit to accepting the election results this November, according to news reports. Among Republican candidates for governor, Tudor Dixon in Michigan and Geoff Diehl in Massachusetts have also declined to be bound by the election results. It\u2019s one thing to reserve the right to call for recounts if elections are close and irregularities are evident, and to appeal the results through the courts. But that was not the circumstance for Trump in the 2020 presidential election (recounts were taken but they showed the same results; he appealed through the courts but his appeals were rejected), and that\u2019s not what Republican candidates are asserting in Trump\u2019s shameful wake. If these Republican candidates are not bound by the election results, what are they bound to? These candidates are in effect issuing open invitations to their supporters to contest electoral losses in the streets. American democracy is based on our commitments to be bound by the outcomes of elections. These are commitments to democracy over any specific outcome we want. The peaceful transition of power depends on these commitments. Before Trump, these norms were assumed. And at least since the civil war they have been honored. When losing candidates congratulate winners and deliver gracious concession speeches, they demonstrate their commitment to democracy over the personal victory they sought. And that demonstration is itself a means of reasserting and re-establishing civility. It sends an unambiguous message to all the candidate\u2019s supporters that the process can be trusted. Think of Al Gore\u2019s concession speech to George W Bush in 2000, after five weeks of a bitterly contested election and just one day after the supreme court ruled 5-4 in favor of Bush: I say to President-elect Bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside, and may God bless his stewardship of the country \u2026 Neither he nor I anticipated this long and difficult road. Certainly neither of us wanted it to happen. Yet it came, and now it has ended resolved, through the honored institutions of our democracy. Now the supreme court has spoken. Let there be no doubt, while I strongly disagree with the court\u2019s decision, I accept it \u2026 And tonight, for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession. Gore thereby made the same moral choice made by his predecessors who lost elections, and for the same reason: the democratic process \u2013 even one that included the judgments of supreme court justices \u2013 was more important than winning. This all changed in September 2020, when Trump refused to commit to be bound to the results of that year\u2019s presidential election. \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to have to see what happens,\u201d Trump said when asked whether he\u2019d commit to a peaceful transition of power. \u201cYou know that I\u2019ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots and the ballots are a disaster,\u201d he added \u2013 presumably referring to mail-in ballots, which he baselessly claimed would lead to voter fraud. This is when his fascist poison began seeping directly into the bedrock of America. That poison spread deeper and faster after he lost the election and refused to concede \u2013 claiming, again without any basis in fact, that it had been \u201cstolen\u201d from him. The poison came to the surface on 6 January 2021, when a group of his supporters invaded the US Capitol and threatened the lives of members of Congress. Five people died. The same poison has now spread to senatorial and gubernatorial candidates who refuse to commit to November\u2019s election results. The commitment to be bound by the results of an election is the most important pledge in a democracy. It is also the most important qualification for public office. It is the equivalent of an oath to uphold the constitution. Candidates who refuse to commit to being bound by the results of elections should be presumed disqualified to hold public office.

            "date": "2022-09-28T17:49:15Z",
            "content": "Labour membership increased by more than 2,500 over the party\u2019s conference, fuelled by the Conservatives\u2019 turmoil and polls suggesting it is on course for victory. The conference in Liverpool was the most financially successful in the party\u2019s history, according to insiders. A new poll by Deltapoll as the conference closed on Wednesday gave Labour a 13-point lead, as Liz Truss faced calls to sack her chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, following the emergency intervention by the Bank of England after his mini-budget. Angela Rayner closed the conference by predicting activists would be meeting soon under a Labour government. \u201cThink how it will feel meeting here in this hall in a few years\u2019 time after a term of a Labour government,\u201d she said. \u201cBack in power.\u201d The party\u2019s deputy leader added: \u201cToo often when it comes to elections, people feel they have a choice of heart versus head: values or competence. I say to those watching at home: this week we have shown it\u2019s a choice you will never have to make again.\u201d Insiders say the rise in membership has come since the party conference started on Sunday, although the party has lost significant numbers since the height of the Jeremy Corbyn years. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said Kwarteng\u2019s plan to set out his \u201cmedium-term fiscal plan\u201d on 23 November would be too late, as people were \u201cvery, very worried\u201d about the possibility of rising mortgage rates and inflation. On the final day of the conference, Labour announced two new pledges on health and education. The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, said the party would promise face-to-face GP appointments with any patients who wanted them, adding: \u201cThe days of waiting on the phone at 8am to book an appointment with your GP will be over, and we will bring back the family doctor.\u201d Streeting said patients would be able to \u201cself-refer to specialist services where appropriate\u201d where currently patients need permission from a GP. Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said Labour would reform the childcare system for children aged one to 11, starting with the provision of free breakfast clubs at all primary schools. \u201cI can tell you that the next Labour government will build a modern childcare system, one that supports families from the end of parental leave, right through to the end of primary school,\u201d she told party activists. \u201cOne that gives our children the start to their day, and the start to their life, they deserve. One that gives parents time to succeed and our economy the chance to grow. Breakfast clubs drive up standards and achievement. They improve behaviour, and attendance. Because it\u2019s about the club, as well as the breakfast.\u201d Though Labour chiefs are pleased the conference passed without major controversy, Starmer was forced to suspend the whip from the MP Rupa Huq after she described Kwarteng as \u201csuperficially\u201d black at a fringe event. Starmer told LBC her comments were racist and that he backed suspending her from the party. \u201cWhat she said, in my view, was racist. It was wrong and she\u2019s been suspended from the whip in the party and that was done very, very quickly,\u201d he said. The Labour leader said it was not his personal decision to suspend her but \u201cit\u2019s a decision I absolutely agree with\u201d. Huq, the MP for Ealing Central and Acton, apologised for her \u201cill-judged\u201d comments on Tuesday, saying: \u201cI have today contacted Kwasi Kwarteng to offer my sincere and heartfelt apologies for the comments I made at yesterday\u2019s Labour conference fringe meeting. \u201cMy comments were ill-judged and I wholeheartedly apologise to anyone affected.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-09-03T19:00:25Z",
            "content": "Liz Truss suffered a dramatic fall in ratings among people who voted Conservative at the 2019 general election during August, despite being on course to win the party leadership and become prime minister this week. The latest polling by Opinium for the Observer shows that whereas 49% of people who voted Tory in 2019 had believed Truss \u201clooks like a prime minister in waiting\u201d at the beginning of August, this had dropped to just 31% by 30 August. Similarly while 55% said she was competent at the start of August, this had dropped to 35% among 2019 Tory voters by the end of the month. And while 52% of the same voters thought she was likeable at the start of August, only 31% felt that way by the end of the month. The earlier poll, published on 3 August, came after Truss had two weeks of being talked about as the frontrunner having won her way through to the final runoff among party members, against the former chancellor, Rishi Sunak. By contrast the later poll came after weeks of alarming stories about energy bills and a lack of clarity from both Truss and Sunak about how they would help people. In the same period the Labour party had published its proposals to freeze energy bills in the autumn, protecting people from 80% increases, which initially helped its poll standing. While Truss\u2019s ratings on a range of questions had fallen sharply in August, those for Sunak had declined by far less. Remarkably, 35% of 2019 Tory voters said in the later poll \u2013 towards the end of the leadership contest \u2013 that Sunak \u201clooks like a prime minister in waiting\u201d \u2013 while only 31% had that view of Truss. The poll suggests Truss may have benefited from the fact that many party members cast their votes early in August before the decline in her ratings. James Crouch of Opinium said: \u201cIf Liz Truss becomes prime minister on Monday, this will be because she caught the interest of Conservatives at a pivotal point in the campaign. However, she will arrive in Downing Street with much of that initial enthusiasm on the wane, seen even by Conservatives as out of touch and with unpopular views.\u201d Overall Labour lead by 4 points on 38% (-1 on a fortnight ago) while the Tories increased their vote share to 34% (+3) compared with mid-August."

            "title": "Italy elections: Giorgia Meloni hails \u2018night of pride\u2019 as exit polls point to far-right coalition victory",
            "date": "2022-09-26T03:15:20Z",
            "content": "Giorgia Meloni has claimed victory in Italy\u2019s elections and promised to govern for all Italians, after exit polls gave her rightwing coalition a clear majority, putting her on course to create the most rightwing government since the end of the second world war. With full results due on Monday, the Brothers of Italy leader is set to become Italy\u2019s first female prime minister \u2013 and a model for nationalist parties across Europe as she heads one of the EU\u2019s six original member states. The poll, for Italian broadcaster Rai, gave the rightwing coalition 41%-45% against 25.5%-29.5% for the leftwing bloc. The populist Five Star Movement was on 13.5%-17.5%. Meloni\u2019s party, which has neofascist origins, is also set to scoop by far the biggest share of the votes within the coalition, which includes the far-right League, led by Matteo Salvini, and Forza Italia, headed by Silvio Berlusconi. Early on Monday morning, projections based on well over half the votes counted put the Brothers of Italy on almost 26%, up from just 4% in the last national election in 2018, as voters opted for a largely untried figure to sort out the nation\u2019s many problems. By contrast, Meloni\u2019s main ally suffered a disastrous night, with Salvini\u2019s League picking up around 9% of the vote, down from more than 17% four years ago. The other major conservative party, Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia party, also scored around 8%, leaving Brothers of Italy the dominant partner. On Monday Meloni said Italian voters had given a clear mandate to the right to form the next government and called for unity to help confront the country\u2019s many problems. \u201cThis is a night of pride for Brothers of Italy, but it is a starting point, not a finish line,\u201d she said to a crowd of supporters. \u201cIf we are called upon to govern this nation, we will do so for all Italians, with the aim of uniting the people, of exalting what unites them rather than what divides them,\u201d Meloni told reporters. \u201cWe will not betray your trust.\u201d \u201cThis is the time for being responsible,\u201d she said, appearing on live on television and describing the situation for Italy and the European Union is \u201cparticularly complex\u201d. Italy\u2019s main centre-left group, the Democratic party (PD), conceded defeat. \u201cThis is a sad evening for the country,\u201d Debora Serracchiani, a senior PD lawmaker, told reporters in the party\u2019s first official comment on the result. \u201c(The right) has the majority in parliament, but not in the country.\u201d As provisional results came in, Italian daily La Stampa headlined its front page \u201cItaly moves to the right\u201d.. If the exit polls are correct, the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, is expected to hand Meloni a mandate to form a government that, if everything goes smoothly, could be in place by the end of October. Marco Marsilio, Brothers of Italy\u2019s president of the central Abruzzo region, said he had been waiting for this moment all his life. \u201cTwenty or 30 years ago this sounded like madness, let\u2019s hope God forgives us for this madness,\u201d he told Reuters. Meloni, from Rome, began her political career as a youth activist in the neofascist Italian Social Movement but rejects the idea that her politics are fascist, arguing that the Italian right consigned fascism to history decades ago. The coalition\u2019s expected victory, however, raises questions about the country\u2019s alliances in Europe as the continent enters a winter likely to be dominated by high energy prices and its response to Russian aggression in Ukraine. Meloni has sought to send reassuring messages, but the prospect of her as prime minister is unlikely to be welcomed in Paris or Berlin. Germany\u2019s governing Social Democratic party warned last week that her win would be bad for European cooperation. Lars Klingbeil, the chairman of chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s SPD, said Meloni had aligned herself with \u201canti-democratic\u201d figures such as Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Earlier this month, Meloni\u2019s MEPs voted against a resolution that condemned Hungary as \u201ca hybrid regime of electoral autocracy\u201d. One of her first messages of congratulations on Sunday night was from Orb\u00e1n\u2019s political director, Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1n, who said: \u201cIn these difficult times, we need more than ever friends who share a common vision and approach to Europe\u2019s challenges.\u201d Meloni is also allied to Poland\u2019s ruling nationalist Law and Justice party, the anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats and Spain\u2019s far-right Vox party. She travelled in the summer to a Vox rally in Marbella, where she expressed her hardline views on immigration and homosexuality. The 45-year-old received an endorsement from Vox towards the end of her campaign, and in response said the two parties were linked by \u201cmutual respect, friendship and loyalty\u201d while hoping victory for Brothers of Italy would give Vox some thrust in Spain. \u201cMeloni has an ambition to represent a model not only for Italy, but for Europe \u2013 this is something new [for the right in Italy] compared with the past,\u201d said Nadia Urbinati, a political theorist at New York\u2019s Columbia University and the University of Bologna. \u201cShe has contacts with other conservative parties, who want a Europe with less civil rights \u2026 the model is there, and so is the project.\u201d Mattia Diletti, a politics professor at Rome\u2019s Sapienza University, said Meloni would win thanks to her ability to be ideological but pragmatic, something that has allowed her to pip the French far-right leader, Marine Le Pen, to the post of becoming western Europe\u2019s model for nationalism. However, she is unlikely to rock the boat, at least at the beginning, as she wants to secure continuing flows of cash under Italy\u2019s \u20ac191.5bn (\u00a3166bn) EU Covid recovery plan, the largest in the EU. The coalition has said it is not seeking to renegotiate the plan, but would like to make changes. \u201cAmbiguity is the key to understanding Meloni,\u201d Diletti said. \u201cShe\u2019s really interested in compromising with the EU on economic politics. But if the EU pushes her too much on the Italian government, she can always revert back to her safe zone as being a populist rightwing leader. She will do what she needs to do to stay in power.\u201d Salvini\u2019s potential return to the interior ministry will also dampen hopes for a breakthrough in the EU\u2019s long-stalled attempt to reform its migration system by sharing asylum seekers across member states. Salvini, who has close ties with Le Pen, said he \u201ccan\u2019t wait\u201d to resume his policy of blocking migrant rescue ships from entering Italian ports. On Ukraine, Meloni has condemned Russia\u2019s invasion and supported sending weapons to the war-torn country, but it remains unclear whether her government will back the eighth round of EU sanctions being discussed in Brussels. Salvini has claimed the sanctions were bringing Italy to its knees, although he never blocked any EU measures against Russia when in Mario Draghi\u2019s broad coalition government, which collapsed in July. Turnout fell to a historic low of around 64%, about nine points lower than the last elections in 2018. There was a steady flow of voters to a booth in Esquilino, a multicultural district in Rome, on Sunday morning, but the mood was one of despondency. \u201cIt feels as if we\u2019re on a rudderless boat,\u201d said Carlo Russo. \u201cAll we heard during the election campaign was an exchange of insults between the various parties rather than an exchange of ideas. And in moments of confusion such as this, people vote for the person who seems to be the strongest.\u201d Fausto Maccari, who runs a newspaper stand, said he would not vote for the right, but remained unsure. \u201cThe choices are poor,\u201d added Maccari, in his 60s. \u201cFor example, I look at Berlusconi and he reminds me of a comic character. At his age, he shouldn\u2019t be doing politics. It would be like me, at my age, trying to be a footballer like Maradona.\u201d Many Italians who support Meloni are doing so because she is yet to be tried and tested in government, and are attracted by her determination and loyalty to her ideals. \u201cShe presents herself as a capable, but not arrogant, woman,\u201d said Urbinati. \u201cShe gets things done and is dedicated, but without this masculine adrenaline that wants power at all costs.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-09-01T10:15:03Z",
            "content": "America is polarized, but a new study has revealed one issue on which the nation is surprisingly united: mitigating climate change. Yet Americans themselves underestimate the US population\u2019s concern for the state of the climate and support for major climate mitigation policies \u2013 by a whopping 80\u201390%, according to researchers from Boston College, Princeton University and Indiana University Bloomington. In a peer-reviewed article, researchers shared the results of a nationwide survey of 6,000 Americans, for which participants were asked to estimate the percentage of Americans who were \u201cat least somewhat concerned about climate change\u201d. Participants also estimated the percentage of Americans they thought supported specific climate policies including carbon taxes for fossil fuel companies, renewable energy mandates, building renewable energy projects on public lands, and a Green New Deal. Regardless of political orientation, education, age, race, media preferences and income, the study found all Americans vastly underestimate how much their compatriots care about climate change and support green policies. \u201cClimate policy and concern about climate change are much more prevalent than you think in the US,\u201d one of the study\u2019s authors, Gregg Sparkman, told Scientific American. \u201cAnd virtually everyone in the country seems to greatly underestimate how popular climate policy is and to underestimate how concerned their fellow Americans are about climate change.\u201d Despite polls by Yale\u2019s Program on Climate Change Communication showing that a \u201csupermajority\u201d of 66\u201380% of Americans support these climate policies, the average American estimates that only a minority of 37\u201343% of the public are down for the eco cause. Republicans proved especially pessimistic about how much people care about climate change, though virtually half of Republicans are pro-climate policies, says Sparkman. In truth, the issue of securing a livable future appears to enjoy bipartisan support. It turns out that the feeling of being alienated in one\u2019s concern for the environment is as widespread as it is unfounded. In fact, this study captures a phenomenon known as \u201cpluralistic ignorance\u201d, a shared misconception of the thoughts and behaviors of others. In this case, pluralistic ignorance results in what the authors call a \u201cfalse social reality\u201d in which many of us perceive that others aren\u2019t willing to take action on climate issues, and overestimate how many Americans are indifferent to, or in denial of, climate change. Ending the misconception that most Americans don\u2019t care about climate change and truly appreciating how popular eco-friendly policies are could give such measures valuable momentum and support, and encourage politicians to pursue greener agendas. Moreover, understanding that there\u2019s nothing fringe about caring about the environment could help people feel more confident discussing their green politics with peers. The perception that people are unified in the desire for pro-climate legislation is a powerful thing \u2013 it becomes easier to take action when we know that people actually support collective solutions. The reassurance that we are all on the same side when it comes to reducing the effects of climate change could also help us manage climate anxiety and feel more optimistic about the future. Young people are especially struggling with the latter; a 2021 Bath University survey of more than 10,000 teens and young adults across 10 countries found that 75% believe \u201cthe future is frightening\u201d, with researchers linking youth psychological distress to government inaction on climate change. Published in the wake of Democrats\u2019 passing of the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, a $369bn investment in renewable energy and emissions reduction, this research suggests Americans are united in the fight against climate change, and that\u2019s a good thing. Have no misconceptions about it: mitigating climate change will require a collective effort. Adrienne Matei is a freelance journalist"

            "date": "2022-09-23T05:30:26Z",
            "content": "Swiss voters will vote on Sunday on whether to ban factory farming as unconstitutional and end imports of intensively farmed meat. The latest polling shows 52% of voters oppose a ban, and 47% support one. If the factory-farming ballot initiative is passed, Switzerland\u2019s constitution, which already protects the \u201cwelfare and dignity of animals\u201d, would be modified to include an animal\u2019s right \u201cnot to be intensively farmed\u201d, and new laws would lower animal stocking rates to meet organic standards. Under current Swiss law, \u201cyou can keep 27,000 chickens in one barn and their room to move is about the size of an A4 sheet of paper,\u201d said Silvano Lieger, managing director of the animal protection group Sentience Politics, which proposed the vote in 2018. \u201cPigs are kept in barns too, up to 1,500 per farm, with 10 pigs sharing the space of an average parking spot. It is not possible to treat animals in a dignified way in those conditions,\u201d he said. Groups supporting the ban include Switzerland\u2019s Small Farmers\u2019 Association, Greenpeace, Les Vertes (The Green party) and animal protection groups. The only political party in government to support the ban is the Parti Socialiste Suisse (Social Democratic party). A ban would protect the environment by reducing reliance on soya-based animal feed linked to deforestation, said Lieger, who also pointed to the need to reduce the consumption of animal proteins. His team calculates that only 5% of farms would be affected by the potential ban. Although no exact figures exist for the proportion of small farms in the country, the overall number of Swiss farms is declining while farm size is increasing, according to the national statistics office. A campaign against the ban, spearheaded by the Swiss Farmers\u2019 Union (SBV), argues that existing laws limiting farm animal numbers mean intensive farming in Switzerland does not exist. Swiss farmers can keep up to 18,000 laying hens and 27,000 meat chickens, said the SBV\u2019s head of production, market and ecology, Michel Darbellay. If the ban is approved, the maximum number would be 4,000 laying hens and 500 meat chickens, while changes to pig standards would mean a 50% drop in pork production, he said. For pigs and cows, Lieger said, the maximum limits have yet to be defined but animals would be kept in small groups, have indoor and outside space, and the opportunity to play. Opponents of the ban say it will fail to prevent cheaper imports of factory-farmed meat. Swiss welfare laws were already \u201camong the strictest in the world\u201d, said Darbellay, who pointed to existing bans on caged hens and limits on the time pigs can be kept in pens (or logettes, as the Swiss call them), to 10 days compared with several weeks in other countries. However, only 3% of consumers in Switzerland wanted higher-welfare organic poultry and pork, Darbellay claimed. Although a ban would significantly reduce Swiss chicken, egg and pork production, it would not prevent imports nor reduce consumption, he said. About 80% of Swiss meat is produced domestically, but Darbellay expects imports to \u201cincrease massively\u201d if the ballot initiative is passed, while any attempt to enforce a ban would be nullified by existing trade agreements. In 2020, the Swiss ate less meat than the average for the EU, at almost 51kg a head, while consumption of milk and dairy products was higher at 301kg. The latest available data shows average EU meat consumption in 2018 was 69.8kg per capita, while milk and dairy consumption was 600g a day in 2019, or 219kg a year. The lower consumption is meat is largely because it is comparatively much more expensive in Switzerland than the rest of Europe. Import rules make it prohibitively expensive to import large amounts of meat, but consumers can buy small amounts of cheaper meat from neighbouring Germany.

            "content": "Released to coincide with World Cancer Research day, Thomas Meadmore\u2019s tricky yet involving documentary follows two Britons going rogue in search of a better quality of treatment. Grant Branton, from Brighton, is a sometime biologist reeling after early tests spotted tumours in his bowels while missing shadows in his bones; Surinder Paul, landed with breast cancer, hopes to avoid a mastectomy by leaning hard into oils, juicing and cravatted energy healers \u2013 what oncological voice-of-reason Rob Glynne-Jones calls \u201cquackery\u201d. Both have taken their lives into their own hands, which notionally affords them greater control but also obliges them to take critical decisions \u2013 even fashion their own suppositories \u2013 on ever-dwindling energy reserves. It\u2019s tricky because Meadmore largely detaches these subjects from any context beyond the rooms they\u2019re in. (There\u2019s nothing about Branton\u2019s career as a commercials and music video producer, for example.) Emphasis is thereby placed firmly on the individual, but many viewers will want more about Branton and Paul\u2019s precise relationship to the NHS, and \u2013 if they went private \u2013 how and how much they\u2019re paying. (It\u2019s unclear from what is shown, possibly reflecting the blurred lines of modern British healthcare.) As carefully applied voiceover takes pains to establish, these two are outliers: Branton\u2019s Facebook interactions and a troubling encounter with a self-appointed American guru illustrate how close we are to the fringes of anti-science conspiracy theory. Yet both remain compelling figures, eliciting natural sympathy and concern as they eye the enemy within. (No melodramatic \u201cfights\u201d or \u201cbattles\u201d here \u2013 just the humdrum reality of endless tests and meetings to reveal results of tests.) Alpha-adjacent Branton endures horrific coughing fits to reaffirm his love for wife Christine; while Paul has the advantage of a large, loving, supportive family, she\u2019s evidently determined to go her own way. For his part, Meadmore bides ever-more-valuable time, monitoring his subjects\u2019 ebbs and flows, allowing them to make their own choices and us to form our own opinions, before finally ensuring the facts of these poignant case studies speak for themselves. \u2022 The Cancer Conflict is released on 19 September on digital platforms"

Ilya said he quickly packed his bags and departed the next morning for his local recruitment centre in Irkutsk, a city on Lake Baikal in Siberia. \u201cWhen the motherland comes calling, you have to answer,\u201d the 27-year-old bus driver said in a brief phone interview from a training ground near the southern city of Rostov. \u201cI decided that I am not going to dodge the draft and will defend the country.\u201d Vladimir Putin\u2019s mobilisation order has triggered a run for the borders by tens of thousands of men of fighting age who are unwilling to participate in Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. But standing in stark contrast to the mile-long lines to get out are videos of men across the country, to the applause of their wives and mothers, boarding buses that will take them to training centres, in what is likely to be a one-way journey for many. The men are evidence of some public backing for the war in Ukraine and of the growing polarisation in the country, said Denis Volkov of the Levada Centre, an independent polling agency. \u201cThe nation has split, and mobilisation has further exacerbated existing divisions,\u201d Volkov said. \u201cThe western-oriented, more modern, urban segment of the population wants to leave and is against the draft. But there is still a large core of men that will not avoid the draft. They are often less educated, poorer and more reliant on the state.\u201d The Kremlin, seemingly aware of those divisions, has been eager to tap into more rural areas for its mobilisation drive, with authorities reportedly looking to keep recruitment \u201cto a minimum\u201d in regional capitals. A poll published by Volkov\u2019s Levada Centre on Thursday found that the proportion of Russians who \u201cfully\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d support what the Kremlin calls its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d has dropped since Putin ordered the mobilisation, but still stands at 72%. \u201cSociety consolidated when the war started, that will not change overnight,\u201d Volkov said. While some observers have questioned the logic of polling public opinion in a country where information about the war is carefully curated by state television and opposition is punishable with prison time, Volkov said he believed the results were credible. He said a key source of support for the Russian military was the notion \u2013 hammered home daily on state television and held by many in the country \u2013 that Russia is engaged in a broader war with Nato and the United States. Interviews and polls show that some Russians have also accepted the Kremlin\u2019s unfounded claim that Russia is under siege from the west and had no choice but to invade Ukraine. \u201cMy husband is fighting not only against Ukraine but also Nato. We don\u2019t have many allies,\u201d said Lyudmila, whose husband, Sergei, was mobilised this week. Since the start of the mobilisation, Telegram groups have sprung up in which women share tips on how to stay in touch with their partners or sons. Lyudmila, who runs one of the groups, said: \u201cI am proud of my husband. Russia is pinned against the wall and we have to fight back.\u201d For some men, a perceived inability to dodge the draft \u2013 an offence punishable by as much as 10 years in prison \u2013 has led them to reluctantly turn up at recruitment centres. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight, but I can\u2019t hide for ever, it is better to just face what is coming,\u201d said Igor, from St Petersburg, who received his draft papers on Wednesday. But despite many Russians\u2019 continued support for Putin\u2019s invasion, Levada\u2019s poll found that 70% of respondents had reacted with \u201cfear\u201d \u201cterror\u201d and \u201cshock\u201d to the mobilisation orders. It also found that Putin\u2019s approval ratings had dropped by six points, the biggest decrease since the start of the war, with only a quarter of men under the age of 24 in favour of continuing the fighting in Ukraine. According to Andrei Kolesnikov, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a US thinktank, Levada\u2019s latest numbers hint at growing anger over the war among many in Russia. \u201cIt\u2019s just the beginning, discontent is slowly maturing,\u201d he said. The public\u2019s anxiety over mobilisation is only likely to grow after the first videos emerged from training centres this week showing scores of men subjected to poor conditions as they wait to be sent to Ukraine. In one video, a group of men are seen sleeping on the floor in overcrowded army barracks. In other footage, a recently mobilised unit appears to have been dropped off in an isolated field with no shelter or food rations. \u201cThere is fucking nothing here. Like a flock of sheep, we have to self-mobilise,\u201d one of the men grumbles. There are also growing reports that newly mobilised men are tasked with buying their own equipment, ranging from bulletproof vests to sleeping mats and thermal underwear. \u201cWe spent over 30,000 rubles [\u00a3460], my monthly salary, to prepare him for the army,\u201d said Tatyana, a school teacher from the Ural city of Chelyabinsk, whose husband has been mobilised. She said the lack of basic supplies in the army had shocked her, denting some of her previously held beliefs about the state of the country\u2019s military and about the war. \u201cHow can they ask him to fight there when everything is such a mess?\u201d she said. \u201cThe war should stop.\u201d"

            "content": "In her article (Spat at, abused and run off the road: why do some people hate cyclists so much?, 30 August), Helen Pidd writes: \u201cGiven how few of us saddle up in Britain, it can be difficult to understand why we inspire such vitriol.\u201d This is the crux of the problem \u2013 cycling is not normalised here and therefore the car-driving majority simply do not understand it. I have always cycled wherever I have lived and, apart from my time as a student in Edinburgh, have always been seen as unusual, no more so than in Bury St Edmunds, where I live now. I have been shouted at, driven at, and once even poked by an elderly woman with a stick. Cycle rack provision has increased in the town centre, but safety bollards to protect cyclists have been removed after complaints from angry residents. The town centre is congested by ridiculous amounts of traffic, especially around the college where I teach, yet one of my students asked me, \u201cWhy do you go everywhere by bike?\u201d, as if it is some kind of weird behaviour. We desperately need to learn from the example set by many European towns and cities and normalise cycling, changing attitudes towards it. Eleanor Rehahn Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk \u2022 It always bears repeating that cyclists are vulnerable road users and that motorist aggression is a real and serious issue. But the question remains why anti-cycling rhetoric can seemingly gain so much traction. Running red lights, furiously riding on the pavement or riding at night without lights or reflectors is \u2013 like graffiti, litter and urinating in public \u2013 a form of antisocial behaviour. It offends against people\u2019s sense of fair play, as does the lack of any visible enforcement. Perception is all. The cycling lobby would improve its standing with the public by speaking out to clearly condemn the actions of an irresponsible minority. Iain Forbes London \u2022 I confess that I have sworn at cyclists, blocked their way and commented unfavourably on Lycra and its link to brain power. I do not apologise, but then I am a pedestrian, past the first flush of youth and using a walking stick. Cyclists in our neck of the woods regularly cut across pedestrians, islands and pavements as a shortcut round the one-way system. They jump red lights as I try to cross the road, and ring their bells to move me aside because I am in their way on the pavement. At least I have my stick as a defence. I\u2019ll gladly support cyclists against motorists when they stop regarding pedestrians as nuisances on the pavement. Sandy Cowling Wimbledon, London \u2022 Helen Pidd\u2019s article was a welcome tour of the abuse that cyclists face from often highly irrational car drivers. My experience on the roads has improved considerably since I invested in a powerful front light for my bike, which I put on flash mode most of the time now. I get very little grief at road junctions these days as drivers coming in the opposite direction prefer to let me go than be irritated by the flashing light. I was a bit nervous about using this strategy to begin with, but I\u2019ve concluded that, psychologically speaking, I\u2019m unsettling them from their comfort zone inside the armour-plated, airbag-insulated bubble of their chosen mode of transport, and this can only be a good thing. Manufacturers have put so much design energy into insulating drivers from other users and making them feel as if they were at home on the road. My flashing front light disrupts this comfortable illusion and makes them more aware and, surprisingly, not hostile but courteous. Steve Brookes London \u2022 Provided with camera evidence of bad or threatening driving towards cyclists, Avon and Somerset police will contact drivers to warn, fine or prosecute them. After a very frightening pass by a lorry three years ago, I fitted a camera under my handlebars. Since then, four drivers who passed me dangerously too close have been contacted by the police. When the camera was seen by a taxi driver, who for some reason seemed to want to crush me against the kerb, he pulled away. Perhaps drivers would be more careful if more cyclists had cameras, and also if more police forces had efficient websites where dangerous and threatening behaviour on the roads could be easily reported. Michael Richards Bristol \u2022 As a female cyclist, I can rattle off countless examples of abuse that I\u2019ve received on the road \u2013 all from male drivers. I was disappointed that Helen Pidd\u2019s article didn\u2019t go far enough to highlight just how gendered this aggression can be, and how dangerous and depressing that is for younger girls. The disgusting insults that I heard as a teenager and young adult still ring in my ears. Name and address supplied \u2022 As a cyclist, I thought Helen Pidd\u2019s article was great. But it did not mention bikes ridden by food couriers, particularly electric bikes. In my experience, the dangerous riding by some of these cyclists \u2013 running red lights, crossing pavements \u2013 is causing problems for us all. Clearly there is pressure on their earnings and they rush to deliver on time to make more money and avoid penalties. Isn\u2019t it time for the companies they work for to take a more responsible approach? They trot out platitudes about responsible riding, but no one appears to be monitoring them and this puts their riders at risk. Barbara Street Cardiff \u2022 As a horse rider, cyclists terrify me. They pass at speed, often silently and too close. They overtake cars that have slowed for me; they almost touch the back of my horse rather than stop to wait for oncoming traffic to clear. They have their head down, often hellbent on speed and disregarding the risk of endangering riders and handlers by spooking horses. There are also lovely cyclists and it is a pleasure to thank them for their care. The British Horse Society and Cycling UK have collaborated on excellent advice branded as \u201cBe nice, say hi\u201d, but those cyclists who disregard it bring opprobrium on the whole cycling community. So often I hear cyclists complain about other road users, but they never urge each other to ride responsibly. Dr Harry Ziman Tarvin, Cheshire \u2022 Helen Pidd omitted a new player in the already complicated sharing of streets by bicycles, cars and pedestrians: e-bikes. In Geneva they seem to be overtaking pedal bikes in number. They are faster, heavier and quieter, and a lot of their users display the same recklessness as some pedal cyclists: mounting pavements, speeding, careering through red lights and using pedestrian walkways as cycling paths, notably in city parks where cycling is not allowed.

            "date": "2022-09-25T01:00:19Z",
            "content": "The owner of 21 tropical islands off the coast of Papua New Guinea says he never threatened to sell them to China and his main aim is to save the turtles that nest there. Ian Gowrie-Smith, an Australian businessman and investor, bought the Conflict Islands, which lie less than 1,000km from the Australian coast, almost two decades ago. The largely uninhabited atolls are a nesting ground for critically endangered hawksbill and green turtles, whose breeding season begins within weeks. Some then migrate to the Great Barrier Reef. Gowrie-Smith had been talking about selling the islands or developing partnerships to support the conservation work for several years, and hoped the Australian government could work with PNG, or by supporting a charity, to protect the breeding grounds. The \u201catoll custodian\u201d told Guardian Australia he contacted the office of the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, in June to discuss the future of the land, but grew frustrated waiting for a response. \u201cHere\u2019s an opportunity to protect not only the area but the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s conservation \u2013 that in itself should have been enough of a reason for someone to reply and say this is a pretty important site,\u201d he said. In August that frustration led him to appear on A Current Affair, which focused on the \u201cdanger\u201d if the islands should \u201cfall into Chinese hands\u201d. But Gowrie-Smith said any suggestion he was threatening to sell the islands to China was entirely wrong. \u201cI don\u2019t have any intention of selling these islands to the CCP,\u201d Gowrie-Smith said. \u201cThe point that\u2019s been lost is that whomever I might sell it to may in turn decide to sell at some future point in time to a foreign nation that may or may not be friendly.\u201d The islands could theoretically be strategically important for China as there is a deep seaport and an airstrip. The foreign affairs department told Guardian Australia the government was now \u201cengaging directly\u201d with Gowrie-Smith about the islands. Thanks to erosion, climate change and shifting sands, the turtles have struggled to find somewhere to lay their eggs safe from human and animal predators, or from the seas themselves. The Conflict Islands Conservation Initiative has employed rangers to protect and re-home eggs. They scoop the eggs out of danger and carry them in ziplock bags to a safer beach where they are reburied until they hatch. The project, which Gowrie-Smith said cost about $1m a year, has been supported by not-for-profits and by the cruise ships that have brought visitors to the islands. \u201cThat is the dominant activity of the islands,\u201d Gowrie-Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a turtle breeding season starting in a month\u2019s time and we\u2019re underfunded,\u201d he said. When Anthony Albanese was asked if he would talk to Gowrie-Smith about buying the islands, the prime minister said there were more than 500 in the area and Australian taxpayers were not in a position to buy real estate across the Pacific. \u201cThink about the implications if sellers of assets came through the media, saying \u2018I want Australia to buy this or else there\u2019s implications, we\u2019ll sell it to China\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThink about where that ends.\u201d But Gowrie-Smith said he had made it clear he understood it would not be politically acceptable for Australia to buy the islands. He said he would discuss with the government of PNG what should happen to the islands. A Dfat spokesperson said Australia was also \u201cengaged with the PNG government on the future of the Conflict Islands\u201d. \u201cDecisions relating to the Conflict Islands, including their potential sale or further preservation, are subject to relevant PNG laws and ultimately a matter for the PNG government,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe PNG government has recently stated that it is considering declaring the Conflict Islands as a conservation protected area.\u201d PNG deputy prime minister, John Rosso, has said \u201cthere will be no sale\u201d, according to PNG\u2019s Post-Courier newspaper. \u201cThe Conflict Islands \u2026 will remain in PNG hands and also we want to retain it as conservation for the country.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-09-09T17:55:57Z",
            "content": "Writer-director Elegance Bratton makes a promising, passionate narrative debut with The Inspection, a film loosely inspired by his own story as a gay man joining the military, a tough, self-flagellating process for someone who had only experienced his sexuality as punishment. His previous film, the documentary Pier Kids about three homeless LGBTQ+ youths in Manhattan, had already intersected with his own experience as someone who was also queer and homeless but here he zeroes in more acutely, making Ellis (stage star Jeremy Pope) a double for himself at 25, rejected by his cruel, religious mother (Gabrielle Union) and living in a shelter in New Jersey. It\u2019s 2005 and driven by a need to feel like his life matters, he follows wall-to-wall news coverage of the war on terror all the way to the Marine Corps, an act of desperation that he hopes will save him. It was a time when \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d was still in operation and Ellis, now known by his surname French by those around him, was forcing himself back into the closet in order to survive and it\u2019s in that gap between what he wants to be and wants to be seen as that the film finds its groove. The recently released trailer promised some rather obvious melodrama but Bratton\u2019s film is mostly more sensitive than its marketeers would like to have you think. It\u2019s a film light on big moments and big speeches, interested more in the difficulty of the everyday, how a queer man navigates a world of aggressive chest-puffing masculinity when his need to be held might outweigh his need to be accepted. It\u2019s in the film\u2019s queerest moments that things feel most inventive, narratively and visually, as Bratton steps most firmly outside of the hemmed-in army drama formula and finds ways to make his film sit and thrive in the Venn diagram between military machismo and homoeroticism. The physical intimacy, the sweaty over-exertion, how it all can seem one, thrilling touch away from being sexual and the danger within that closeness, how something can be misconstrued by your mind or your body. Purple lighting and a pulsing score suddenly turn the barracks into a gay club and in one bold scene, Ellis\u2019s shower fantasy cruelly intersects with reality and he finds himself erect, surrounded by the other men. It brings things crashing down early, quickly painting Ellis as an outcast, an experience he\u2019s all too used to, but Bratton doesn\u2019t drown us in the misery of it, flashes of humour and sensuality keeping his film light-footed, if not exactly light. Pope\u2019s performance is also key to this, his natural queerness and how he chooses to handle or hide it in a situation like this, adding an extra level of texture to a story that\u2019s already come from a lived-in experience. I don\u2019t believe in the strictness some enforce when it comes to the rule of only queer actors playing queer people but Pope\u2019s delicate and deft work here is an example of why sometimes, the mirroring can work so perfectly. His little hidden asides, when he allows himself to just be, without the survivalist self-censoring, are both amusing and sad, and it\u2019s a film that should propel him into the bigger leagues with ease. The pre-written take on Union de-glamming and knuckling down was that this would be her late-stage Oscar grab, a narrative that works better on paper than on screen. She\u2019s good, especially in her first scene, wielding a stinging severity that some actors would either shy away from or ham up, but there\u2019s too little screen-time, to Bratton\u2019s credit, for it to fall in line with the pipe dream. There\u2019s successful snarling from an ever-dependable Bokeem Woodbine as Ellis\u2019s cruel general and a hard-to-pin-down tenderness from Ra\u00fal Castillo as the good cop to his bad but they mostly exist in the stretches that prove to be far less compelling. Bratton can\u2019t help but fall into tired military convention and there\u2019s too much here that we\u2019ve seen too many times before, with little to distinguish. The breaking down of a young man, the interpersonal man-to-man conflicts with others, the savagery of military life, it\u2019s a story we\u2019re all overly, perhaps boringly familiar with. Like the version we see of his younger self, Bratton\u2019s film is also stuck between these two worlds, one feeling more curious and creative, the other cliched and constructed. His confidence as a film-maker might ultimately outpace his ability as a writer in the last act, but The Inspection still marks him out as one to watch. The Inspection screened at the Toronto film festival; it will be released in the US on 18 November and in the UK on 17 February."

            "date": "2022-09-27T01:14:39Z",
            "content": "A multimillion-dollar spacecraft collided head-on with an asteroid the size of a football stadium on Monday in an unprecedented test of Nasa\u2019s capacity to defend Earth from a doomsday scenario. Nasa\u2019s craft successfully crashed into the asteroid Dimorphos 6.8m miles from Earth. The mission, known as Dart (Double Asteroid Redirection Test), marked humanity\u2019s first attempt at moving another celestial body, with the goal of seeing if a large asteroid hurtling toward our planet could be successfully diverted. The spacecraft collided with the asteroid at 15,000mph at 7.14pm EDT. Livestreamed video showed the asteroid\u2019s rubble-strewn surface looming into focus before the spacecraft hit and cheers erupted in the mission control room. Teams of Nasa and Johns Hopkins University scientists hugged each other as Dart\u2019s successful impact with Dimorphos was confirmed. Shortly after impact, Lori Glaze, Nasa\u2019s planetary science division director, declared it a \u201cnew era of humankind\u201d. \u201c[It\u2019s] an era in which we potentially have the capability to protect ourselves from something like a dangerous, hazardous asteroid impact,\u201d said Glaze. \u201cWhat an amazing thing. We\u2019ve never had that capability before.\u201d Samson Reony, the Johns Hopkins applied physics laboratory mission commentator, was equally exuberant about the \u201cgame-changing\u201d achievement. \u201cThis is when science, engineering and a great purpose, planetary defense, come together, and, you know, it makes a magical moment like this,\u201d he said. The test aims to determine if intentionally crashing a spacecraft into an asteroid is an effective way to change its trajectory. A relatively similar strategy involving a nuclear missile rather than an unmanned spacecraft failed during a key point in the plot of Morgan Freeman\u2019s fictional 1998 planetary disaster film Deep Impact. At a post-mission press conference, Dart scientists described the mission as a success but cautioned that it will be about two months before they know if the spacecraft succeeded in its ultimate objective of altering Dimorphos\u2019s trajectory. They hailed Monday as the \u201cideal outcome\u201d of the first stage of the planetary defense test. Dart scored \u201cbasically a bullseye\u201d on the asteroid, Dart deputy program manager Elena Adams said. \u201cWe knew we were going to hit. All of us were holding our breath. I\u2019m kind of surprised none of us passed out.\u201d She said the craft had landed 17 meters from its target; close enough to represent a complete success. \u201cIt was basically a bullseye. I think, as far as we can tell, the first planetary defense test was a success, and we can clap to that.\u201d Whether the impact had enough force to move the asteroid remains to be seen, and scientists will spend the next weeks monitoring the asteroid\u2019s speed and movements, and making calculations. Even so, Adams said: \u201cEarthlings should sleep better, and I definitely will.\u201d Scientists insisted Dart would not shatter Dimorphos. The spacecraft packed a scant 1,260 pounds (570kg), compared with the asteroid\u2019s 11bn pounds (5 bn kg). Dart\u2019s planned self-destruction posed no threats to humanity, a Nasa spokesperson, Glen Nagle, said. Nagle said Monday\u2019s test was the first of a series of \u201cplanetary protection missions\u201d. \u201cWe want to have a better chance than the dinosaurs had 65m years ago,\u201d Nagle said, referring to the theory that the prehistoric reptiles which once ruled Earth went extinct when an asteroid struck the planet. Nagle added: \u201cAll they could do is look up and go, \u2018Oh asteroid.\u2019\u201d While no known asteroid larger than 459ft (140 meters) in size has a significant chance of hitting Earth for the next century, it\u2019s estimated that only 40% of those asteroids have been identified so far. The $325m planetary defense test was the culmination of a journey that began with Dart\u2019s launch last fall. The opportunity for online earthlings to watch the collision with Dimorphos live, or at least on a few minutes\u2019 delay, came from what Nasa calls the mission\u2019s own \u201cmini-photographer\u201d, the LiciaCube (short for Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging Asteroids). Mission managers expressed their \u201cabsolute joy\u201d at watching the successful impact take place in real time. Ralph Semmel, director of the Johns Hopkins applied physics laboratory, hailed the \u201cgame-changing\u201d nature of what had just been achieved, adding that his team knew they had been successful when the video blacked out. \u201cNormally, losing signal from a spacecraft is a very bad thing. But in this case, it was the ideal outcome.\u201d Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reporting"

            "date": "2022-09-25T07:00:27Z",
            "content": "JD Vance had some explaining to do. After winning a brutal, costly primary to secure the Republican nomination in Ohio\u2019s Senate race, Vance had spent the summer making few appearances on the campaign trail and allowing his Democratic opponent, congressman Tim Ryan, to dominate the airwaves. Now polls showed Vance, a first-time candidate and author of the bestselling memoir Hillbilly Elegy, running neck and neck with Ryan in a race that many Republicans had hoped would be an easy win. \u201cWe have a tough campaign,\u201d Vance said at an event with supporters in Avon, Ohio, last weekend. \u201cI know that a lot of people are frustrated you didn\u2019t see a whole lot of my TV commercials over the summer. Hopefully that\u2019s started to pick up in the last couple of weeks.\u201d Vance\u2019s struggle to establish a clear lead in Ohio mirrors Republican Senate candidates\u2019 missteps in other battleground states that could determine control of the vital upper chamber. Like Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania and Herschel Walker in Georgia, Vance was able to win the Republican nomination after receiving Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement, but he has stumbled in his pivot to the general election. Republicans are now racing to avoid a Democratic victory in Ohio, often at the expense of investing in other close races. If Republicans cannot drag Vance across the finish line in Ohio, it could spell doom for the party\u2019s hopes of flipping the Senate in the midterm elections this November. Although Trump won Ohio by eight points in 2020, recent polls show Vance and Ryan essentially tied. National Republican groups have picked up on the trouble in Ohio and have started devoting more resources to the race. The Senate Leadership Fund, a Super Pac aligned with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, announced last month that it would reserve $28m in TV and radio ads to boost Vance. As the SLF increased its financial support for Vance, the group also slashed roughly $8m of its ad reservations in Arizona, a shift that the Super Pac\u2019s president partially attributed to \u201can unexpected expense in Ohio\u201d. (The SLF announced Tuesday that it was pulling out of the Arizona Senate race entirely.) The SLF\u2019s significant investment to support Vance underscores how Republicans are playing defense in an unexpectedly close race. Even if the SLF\u2019s funding helps Vance hold on in Ohio, the victory would not bring his party closer to a Senate majority, as the seat is now held by a retiring Republican, Rob Portman. The reality is that Vance needs all the financial help he can get. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, Vance\u2019s campaign reported having just $628,000 cash on hand, compared to $3.6m in Ryan\u2019s bank account. Between April and June, Vance raised and spent $1m as he fought in the fiercely competitive Republican primary, while Ryan raised $8.6m and easily captured his party\u2019s nomination. Ryan has used his cash advantage to launch a massive advertising blitz, running commercials that frame him as an independent-minded centrist and attack Vance as an out of touch elite with extreme views. In one of Ryan\u2019s ads, an Ohio mother who lost her son, Joe, to opioid addiction criticizes Vance\u2019s now defunct non-profit for enlisting the help of a doctor with ties to the pharmaceutical industry. \u201cI don\u2019t have words for how betrayed I felt,\u201d the woman says in the ad. \u201cJD Vance has chosen to help the drug companies rather than the people who are struggling like Joe.\u201d In another memorable video, Ryan throws footballs at television screens showing the Republican ads attacking him. \u201cThey say you can know a person by their enemies,\u201d Ryan says in the ad. \u201cWell, here comes their bullshit ads.\u201d Over the summer, Ryan\u2019s ad campaign went largely unanswered by Vance\u2019s team, allowing the Democrat to chip away at his opponent\u2019s advantage in the Republican-leaning state. \u201cHe won the primary thanks to Trump\u2019s help, and it just felt like he went into the witness protection program,\u201d Jessica Taylor, the Senate and governors editor for the Cook Political Report, said of Vance\u2019s summer campaign schedule. \u201cVance took a hit in that really brutal primary, and you need to try to rehabilitate your image.\u201d The Ohio Democratic party reveled in Vance\u2019s absence from the campaign trail and the airwaves, sending out mocking statements each time he left the state to fundraise. \u201cYou have to kind of be here to rally people together, and he\u2019s not been here. He\u2019s literally been almost everywhere but here,\u201d Elizabeth Walters, chair of the Ohio Democratic party, said earlier this month. \u201cThis has to be a tough moment for the party where your standard-bearer and your top candidate can\u2019t be bothered to show up. I think that they\u2019re going have a hard time in the fall of keeping their coalition together.\u201d Even some of Vance\u2019s supporters acknowledge that he has a lot of ground to make up in the race, with less than 50 days to go until election day. \u201cWhat he has to get across is the record of his opponent, not what his opponent\u2019s saying,\u201d Tom Patton, a voter from Avon Lake, said as he left Vance\u2019s event last weekend. \u201cHe has to do more.\u201d Nicolette Allsop, a voter from South Amherst who attended the Vance event with her two sisters, begrudgingly agreed that Ryan has run \u201ceffective\u201d ads in the race. Allsop\u2019s sister, MaryJo Moluse of Avon, added that Ohio feels more competitive this year than it did in 2020. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a tough fight. I really do,\u201d Maluse said. Vance and his allies appear to have woken up to that reality, as the candidate has ratcheted up his campaign appearances and his television ads in recent weeks. In one ad, Vance walks down a street in his home town and laments the country\u2019s recent rise in violent crime, accusing Ryan of insufficiently supporting law enforcement officers. Mike Hartley, who previously served as a senior adviser to former Ohio governor and Republican presidential candidate John Kasich, pointed to the ad as an example of how Vance is successfully rebooting his campaign in the crucial, final stretch of the race. \u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s going to run on, and that\u2019s what he should run on, and I think that\u2019s just going to solidify his advantage,\u201d Hartley said. \u201cI think he\u2019s done a good job of hitting his stride at the right time.\u201d Vance has also kept up a busy schedule of campaign events this month, including an appearance at a rally with Trump last Saturday in Youngstown, which lies in Ryan\u2019s congressional district. The region was once a Democratic stronghold, but it has moved to the right as white working-class voters have drifted toward the Republican party. Vance will need those voters to turn out in November to defeat Ryan, and he used the rally as an opportunity to criticize his opponent for allegedly misrepresenting his record. \u201cThere are two Tims out there,\u201d Vance told thousands of rally goers. \u201cThere\u2019s a DC Tim, who votes 100% of the time with Joe Biden, and then there\u2019s campaign Tim, who pretends he\u2019s a moderate \u2026 We need to kick DC Tim to the curb.\u201d In his long and often meandering speech, Trump echoed that message, praising Vance as \u201can America First warrior\u201d while attacking Ryan as a \u201cfar-left Democrat phony\u201d. Trump also took a moment to dismiss a report that Republican Senate candidates are attempting to distance themselves from him, saying, \u201cJD is kissing my ass he wants my support so bad.\u201d \u201c[Ryan] is lying to your faces, acting as though he\u2019s my friend on policy, pretending to be a moderate so he can get elected and betray everything that you believe in,\u201d Trump told the cheering crowd. \u201cHe is not a moderate. He is radical left.\u201d That attack strategy appears to be resonating with some of Trump\u2019s most loyal fans in Ohio, who helped Vance clinch the Republican nomination in May and could now prove instrumental in carrying him across the finish line in November. \u201cI don\u2019t really care for [Ryan],\u201d Lori Ferguson, a voter from Cortland, said as she waited to enter the venue for Trump\u2019s rally. \u201cI think the way he\u2019s talking now is simply trying to maybe make Republicans think that he\u2019s on their side.\u201d William Fair, a voter from Navarre who was ahead of Ferguson in line, admitted that he did not know much about Vance, but he said Trump\u2019s endorsement was enough to secure his vote. \u201cIf Trump wants him, we\u2019ll get him,\u201d Fair said. Fair\u2019s comments underscore the hefty challenge facing Ryan, despite his campaign\u2019s effective ads and savvy messaging. For many voters, the \u201cR\u201d or \u201cD\u201d next to a politician\u2019s name takes priority over any specific concerns about the individual candidate. That could put Ryan at a disadvantage, given that only one Democrat, Senator Sherrod Brown, has managed to win a non-juridical statewide office in Ohio since 2008. \u201cWe have increasingly seen, really over the past decade and a little more, that even Senate races have become almost parliamentary in nature \u2013 where you\u2019re voting for the party and not necessarily the person,\u201d Taylor said. Like all other Democrats, Ryan is also facing the national headwinds of record-high inflation and Biden\u2019s underwater approval rating. Ryan recently told the New York Times that he would not campaign with Biden, reflecting the president\u2019s unpopularity in Ohio. \u201c[Ryan is] doing what he believes he needs to do to win, and I think they\u2019re executing what I consider a good campaign,\u201d Hartley said. \u201cBut I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be enough \u2026 In my eyes, I think Tim Ryan has clearly peaked, and now JD Vance is going to seal the deal.\u201d Even as national Republicans have swooped in to prop up Vance, Ryan has remained steadfast in his determination to snap Ohio Democrats\u2019 losing streak. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for a rescue squad,\u201d Ryan said of Vance last Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be enough to save him in Ohio because Ohio wants a fighter.\u201d"

            "content": "Nasa has released the first detailed images of its pioneering deep-space \u201cplanetary defense test\u201d in which a spacecraft was crashed into a distant asteroid in an attempt to alter its trajectory. The pictures were taken by what the agency calls its \u201ctwo great observatories\u201d, the James Webb and Hubble space telescopes, which captured Monday\u2019s impact on Dimorphos, moon of the asteroid Didymos, 6.8m miles from Earth. Photographs of the $325m Dart (double asteroid redirection test) mission were combined into two colorful time-lapse animations showing the spacecraft\u2019s approach, and then the brightness of the moment of collision. Alongside the animations, which were posted to Nasa\u2019s website on Thursday, are a number of before and after still images showing the impact and vivid spikes of ejecta, the rocky surface material from the asteroid thrown out by the force of the collision. \u201cWebb and Hubble show what we\u2019ve always known to be true at Nasa: we learn more when we work together,\u201d Bill Nelson, the agency\u2019s administrator and former astronaut, said in a statement accompanying the images. \u201cFor the first time, Webb and Hubble have simultaneously captured imagery from the same target in the cosmos: an asteroid that was impacted by a spacecraft after a 7m-mile journey. All of humanity eagerly awaits the discoveries to come from Webb, Hubble, and our ground-based telescopes, about the Dart mission and beyond.\u201d Mission managers said at a post-impact press conference on Monday that it could be up to two months before it is known whether the force of the Dart impact was enough to move Dimorphos from its regular orbital path around Didymos. Scientists will monitor its movements and speed through ground-based telescopes for any divergence, as well studying data from Webb\u2019s mid-infrared instrument and near-infrared spectrograph. But they were exuberant about the \u201cgame-changing\u201d successful completion of the first part of the mission. The Dart program\u2019s deputy manager, Elena Adams, said the craft struck Dimorphos head on, only 17 meters from its target. \u201cIt was basically a bullseye. I think, as far as we can tell, the first planetary defense test was a success, and we can clap to that,\u201d she said. The Dart mission was marked humanity\u2019s first attempt at moving another celestial body in an unprecedented test of Nasa\u2019s capacity to defend Earth from the doomsday scenario of a large asteroid hurtling towards it."

            "date": "2022-09-23T15:35:40Z",
            "content": "Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s mini-budget will prove \u201cpolitically toxic and economically dubious\u201d, Conservative MPs have said as they lambasted the extra \u00a372bn of borrowing needed to pay for swingeing tax cuts that will disproportionately benefit the very wealthy. The divisions of the Tory leadership campaign roared back to the fore after Kwarteng\u2019s statement, with critics claiming the chancellor was trying to avoid scrutiny by refusing to publish economic forecasts from the independent budget regulator. Kwarteng\u2019s \u201cplan for growth\u201d was also compared by one senior party figure to the ill-fated \u201cBarber budget\u201d of 1972, which emulated a similar aim but ended in boom, soaring inflation and ultimately the demise of Ted Heath\u2019s premiership. \u201cI\u2019ve never known a government that has had so little support from its own backbenches, just four sitting days in,\u201d observed one MP. The normally ebullient benches that roar behind a chancellor as they make a fiscal statement to the Commons were more hushed on Friday. Several present said few order papers were waved and there was only a smattering of comments of \u201chear, hear\u201d, allegedly orchestrated by party whips. \u201cI completely despair, because I\u2019m a member of a party that stands up for the squeezed middle not the very rich. This will be politically toxic and economically dubious,\u201d said another MP present for the statement. In a sign of the level of discontent, several Conservatives rose in the Commons chamber to aim barbed and hostile interventions at Kwarteng. Mel Stride, the chair of the Treasury select committee and former campaign manager for Rishi Sunak\u2019s leadership bid, said there was a \u201cvast void\u201d in the mini-budget. Stride criticised the Treasury\u2019s refusal to publish fresh economic forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility based on the measures unveiled this week, saying the markets were getting \u201ctwitchy\u201d and \u201cnow is the time for transparency\u201d to \u201cprovide a calmness\u201d. As the pound fell further against the dollar, the former attorney general Jeremy Wright said growth depended on confidence, and that would \u201cevaporate\u201d if the benefits of tax cuts were outweighed by mortgage repayments rising due to higher interest rates. Others were gloomy about how the abolition of the highest tax rate and lifting the cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses would play in poorer constituencies, particularly among the so-called red wall. \u201cIt\u2019s the richest we\u2019re helping while the poorest are suffering the most,\u201d was one northern MP\u2019s stark assessment. Liz Truss\u2019s ruthless reshuffle which ousted most Sunak supporters also hung like a dark cloud over the statement. \u201cEverybody is distraught at the reshuffle and the way it\u2019s been handled,\u201d said one person recently ousted from the government. \u201cLooking ahead, you\u2019re going to have a situation where, unless some goodwill is extended, people will look for a cause to lay a marker down to make clear their unhappiness.\u201d Sunak\u2019s supporters said they were more likely to boycott the Conservative party conference and ruminate over WhatsApp with other frustrated colleagues over the following few weeks of recess. Roger Gale, a veteran thorn in the side of Boris Johnson\u2019s administration, said: \u201cFortune favours the brave, but not the foolhardy,\u201d and added that Kwarteng\u2019s \u201cnot-so-mini-budget is certainly brave but also looks very high risk indeed\u201d. However, some Tories were willing to give what they called Truss\u2019s \u201cgamble\u201d a chance. \u201cThis is definitely driven by ideology, and politics is supposed to be \u2013 to some extent \u2013 about ideology,\u201d said one. \u201cShe\u2019s clearly taken the view she doesn\u2019t win from the centre but a clear distinct position.\u201d Ardent Truss backers said it would force Labour into a difficult position of having to oppose the tax cuts and face uncomfortable questions about whether it would then reverse them. They also said it would shore up support on the right among voters who previously floated to support Ukip. Nigel Farage proclaimed it to have been \u201cthe best Conservative budget since 1986\u201d. David Jones, a former cabinet minister who supported Truss for the leadership, said: \u201cCutting taxes was very much called for because we were overtaxed previously. Kwarteng has obviously marked a clear break with the Rishi regime and I personally think he had no option but to do it. If it had been steady as she goes then according to the OECD we would have had zero growth next year.\u201d Opposition parties sought to paint the mini-budget as a giveaway to the ultra-rich that would provide little support for those at the sharp end of the cost of living crisis. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, attacked Kwarteng\u2019s \u201ccasino economics\u201d that she said were \u201cgambling the mortgages and finances of every family in the country\u201d. Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, called it a \u201cbillionaires\u2019 budget\u201d that had shown the Conservatives to be \u201ccompletely out of touch with families struggling to pay the bills\u201d."

            "date": "2022-09-09T17:55:57Z",
            "content": "Writer-director Elegance Bratton makes a promising, passionate narrative debut with The Inspection, a film loosely inspired by his own story as a gay man joining the military, a tough, self-flagellating process for someone who had only experienced his sexuality as punishment. His previous film, the documentary Pier Kids about three homeless LGBTQ+ youths in Manhattan, had already intersected with his own experience as someone who was also queer and homeless but here he zeroes in more acutely, making Ellis (stage star Jeremy Pope) a double for himself at 25, rejected by his cruel, religious mother (Gabrielle Union) and living in a shelter in New Jersey. It\u2019s 2005 and driven by a need to feel like his life matters, he follows wall-to-wall news coverage of the war on terror all the way to the Marine Corps, an act of desperation that he hopes will save him. It was a time when \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d was still in operation and Ellis, now known by his surname French by those around him, was forcing himself back into the closet in order to survive and it\u2019s in that gap between what he wants to be and wants to be seen as that the film finds its groove. The recently released trailer promised some rather obvious melodrama but Bratton\u2019s film is mostly more sensitive than its marketeers would like to have you think. It\u2019s a film light on big moments and big speeches, interested more in the difficulty of the everyday, how a queer man navigates a world of aggressive chest-puffing masculinity when his need to be held might outweigh his need to be accepted. It\u2019s in the film\u2019s queerest moments that things feel most inventive, narratively and visually, as Bratton steps most firmly outside of the hemmed-in army drama formula and finds ways to make his film sit and thrive in the Venn diagram between military machismo and homoeroticism. The physical intimacy, the sweaty over-exertion, how it all can seem one, thrilling touch away from being sexual and the danger within that closeness, how something can be misconstrued by your mind or your body. Purple lighting and a pulsing score suddenly turn the barracks into a gay club and in one bold scene, Ellis\u2019s shower fantasy cruelly intersects with reality and he finds himself erect, surrounded by the other men. It brings things crashing down early, quickly painting Ellis as an outcast, an experience he\u2019s all too used to, but Bratton doesn\u2019t drown us in the misery of it, flashes of humour and sensuality keeping his film light-footed, if not exactly light. Pope\u2019s performance is also key to this, his natural queerness and how he chooses to handle or hide it in a situation like this, adding an extra level of texture to a story that\u2019s already come from a lived-in experience. I don\u2019t believe in the strictness some enforce when it comes to the rule of only queer actors playing queer people but Pope\u2019s delicate and deft work here is an example of why sometimes, the mirroring can work so perfectly. His little hidden asides, when he allows himself to just be, without the survivalist self-censoring, are both amusing and sad, and it\u2019s a film that should propel him into the bigger leagues with ease. The pre-written take on Union de-glamming and knuckling down was that this would be her late-stage Oscar grab, a narrative that works better on paper than on screen. She\u2019s good, especially in her first scene, wielding a stinging severity that some actors would either shy away from or ham up, but there\u2019s too little screen-time, to Bratton\u2019s credit, for it to fall in line with the pipe dream. There\u2019s successful snarling from an ever-dependable Bokeem Woodbine as Ellis\u2019s cruel general and a hard-to-pin-down tenderness from Ra\u00fal Castillo as the good cop to his bad but they mostly exist in the stretches that prove to be far less compelling. Bratton can\u2019t help but fall into tired military convention and there\u2019s too much here that we\u2019ve seen too many times before, with little to distinguish. The breaking down of a young man, the interpersonal man-to-man conflicts with others, the savagery of military life, it\u2019s a story we\u2019re all overly, perhaps boringly familiar with. Like the version we see of his younger self, Bratton\u2019s film is also stuck between these two worlds, one feeling more curious and creative, the other cliched and constructed. His confidence as a film-maker might ultimately outpace his ability as a writer in the last act, but The Inspection still marks him out as one to watch. The Inspection screened at the Toronto film festival; it will be released in the US on 18 November and in the UK on 17 February."

            "date": "2022-09-18T08:00:09Z",
            "content": "Viewed purely in terms of the size of their formations and equipment, Russian ground forces in Ukraine still pose a serious threat on a number of axes. In practice, however, it is highly unlikely the Russian military can recover from its increasingly terminal trajectory on the battlefield, though its defeat will take time and bitter fighting. To understand why, it is necessary to examine the force beyond its equipment and personnel. The US assesses military capability through the abbreviation DOTMLPF. That senior US officers regularly try to roll this off the tongue as an acronym may exemplify military absurdity, but the abbreviation is somewhat redeemed by being fairly comprehensive. It stands for: doctrine, organisation, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities. Looking at the Russian military across these categories reveals why it is underperforming its potential and struggling to regenerate. To begin with, Russian strengths: Russian doctrine \u2013 the theory of how the army should fight \u2013 is clear, precise, well evidenced and conceptually elegant. Russian doctrine is often far ahead of western military theory. This creates a methodological challenge for intelligence assessments of Russian operations, because if they are executed as described in higher military orders, then the conclusion is often that they would succeed. The practice, however, rarely matches the theory. Russian materiel is generally exceptionally well designed and adequately built. To take a specific example, the Orlan-10, which is the primary drone flown by Russian forces, is cheap and simple to operate. It is not sophisticated, but because it flies too high to be targeted by short-range air defences and is too inexpensive to justify the use of long-range air defences, it is designed to be thoroughly awkward to destroy, while giving its operators a sufficient view of the battlefield to identify targets. The weakness of Russian materiel tends to be that it is inflexible \u2013 designed to perform one specified task well \u2013 and that multiple generations of systems being employed simultaneously makes maintenance difficult. This problem has been massively exacerbated in Ukraine as the Russians pull more and more generations of equipment out of storage to replace losses. The Russian military also benefits from its facilities. The Russians have an efficient rail network optimised for the movement of combat equipment. They also have many factories to produce munitions, with the companies involved directly under government control, and access to most necessary raw materials. Where the west has pursued efficiency at the expense of resilience, the Russians still have excess capacity in their production lines. This is far less true for precision weapons, since Russia lacks an advanced microelectronics industry and must therefore import critical components. These strengths, however, do not compensate for the significant shortcomings of the Russian military. To begin with, organisation: Russia\u2019s military was designed to fight short, high-intensity wars. Without full national mobilisation, it is too small, its units lack the logistical enablement and its equipment is ill-suited to a protracted war. When the Russian military issued orders to its troops in the autumn of 2021, it estimated a need for them to be deployed for nine months. They are now reaching that limit. The Ukrainians, by contrast, have been organising their military since 2014 for precisely this kind of war. One of the greatest deficiencies in the Russian military is leadership and education. The leadership culture is dictatorial and enforced by fear. Corruption is structurally encouraged by the Kremlin so that the civilian authorities have the threat of legal action against military commanders. Corruption, however, wreaks havoc on Russian logistics. Fear of punishment has created a military in which soldiers will doggedly implement orders even when they no longer make sense. For example, Russian artillery units routinely prosecute targets in the order that they receive fire missions, with no contextual prioritisation. Even when new intelligence indicates a target has moved, Russian units will often engage the previous location and then the new one, giving the target time to move once more. Poor leadership also means that Russia has serious problems with its personnel. There is a limited career path for long-term soldiers. This leads to retention problems that have caused the Russian military to continue to depend upon conscripts. With a rapidly ageing population, Russia lacks young recruits. The low standard of living in much of the country produces troops unfamiliar with much modern technology. Moreover, in the absence of any clear ideology or strong leadership in units, troops are largely unmotivated, do not work effectively as teams and are unwilling to risk their lives for one another. The Russian infantry have therefore lacked offensive combat power. These problems have become worse as casualties have mounted. Again, this is an area where Ukraine has clear advantages. Perhaps one of the greatest weaknesses of the country\u2019s military system, though, is training. First, it simply does not do enough of it. At the beginning of the war, for example, there were fewer than 100 fully trained Russian pilots bordering Ukraine, despite Russia having at least 317 combat aircraft deployed to the theatre. Second, Russian soldiers tend to receive training that is narrowly bounded to their assigned task. This makes these troops inflexible, lacking situational awareness of what is being done around them and unable to cover one another\u2019s tasks. Third, the Russians do most of their training in their units. As the units are in Ukraine, there is very little capacity to train new recruits before they are sent to war. This severely hampers efforts at mobilisation and the generation of new units. Ukraine struggles with training because, unlike Russia, its facilities are under missile attack \u2013 hence the importance of training in the UK \u2013 but the training provided is far superior. Despite its equipment superiority to Ukraine at the beginning of the conflict, Russia significantly underperformed against its potential. Moreover, the institutional areas of weakness make its military far less adaptable. Now that Russian troops are outnumbered, unmotivated and their equipment is deteriorating, the Kremlin\u2019s prospects are rapidly diminishing.

The procession will have a slow and sombre pace, with drummers beating 75 beats a minute \u2013 something that is proving a particular challenge for the horses. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a tall order to ask them to walk at a slow march pace. Any of our normal parades it\u2019s a natural horse walking pace, which is a bit more forward-going than human pace, so we\u2019re asking them to half that again,\u201d said Sgt Tom Jenks, 30, who is riding the lead horse in front of the gun carriage that will be pulling the coffin. His horse, Cassius, will be retiring after the parade after 12 years\u2019 service, including Margaret Thatcher\u2019s funeral, and has been kept on for his experience. Other horses have been selected for their black colour and calm temperament. Christopher Ghika, the major general commanding the household division, who is leading on the ceremonial aspects of the funeral, said this week\u2019s events represented the biggest and most complicated operation of its kind. Troops have been rehearsing almost non-stop for four days to ensure nothing goes wrong, with many barely sleeping. Those who spoke to the Guardian said they were proud to be involved, despite the sacrifices required. Ghika said there was a \u201cvery personal connection\u201d for troops taking part in the parade, since the Queen was the head of the armed services and recruits had sworn an oath of allegiance to her. \u201cFor everybody on parade it\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It\u2019s a very sad day but it\u2019s our last opportunity to do our duty for the Queen, and our first opportunity to do our duty for the King,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are going to be significant international events, so the eyes of the world will be upon us. I\u2019m expecting for everybody on parade that they will deliver a very spectacular performance which will do tribute to the Queen.\u201d Military personnel are playing a huge range of different roles in the processions on Wednesday and Monday. The senior time-beater Neil Brocklehurst, 46, said he used a metronome stuck to his drum to keep time. He added it was a \u201chuge honour\u201d to take part. \u201cThis is never going to happen again, a sovereign who\u2019s been serving all those years. There are so many people who\u2019ve served under her and we get to do the final thing.\u201d Tara Kelly, 25, a wheel-driver in the mounted procession, said preparations had been similar to those for the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s funeral but with \u201ca lot more\u201d people involved and \u201ca lot of hours\u201d. \u201cWith everything going on, it\u2019s so overwhelming. Everyone\u2019s been very positive, but in a respectful way. Even with the long hours and how tired everyone is, no one\u2019s trying to drag their feet, they\u2019re all working hard and getting on with the job at hand,\u201d she said. Jason Burcham, 53, who will be leading the Royal Marines band in the procession, and who played piano on the royal yacht to reflect the Queen\u2019s \u201ceclectic\u201d taste between 1994 and 1996, said that although troops had had a short time to prepare, \u201cevery time we\u2019re out on parade essentially that\u2019s part of our training for an event of this scale\u201d. Lance corporal Edward Christian Scheepers, 35, part of the Queen\u2019s personal guard and a master tailor, has been working \u201ca lot of late hours\u201d on uniforms for the parade, including plumes, tunics and trimming. \u201cWe inspect everyone so as soon as they leave camp they are looking smart and nobody can be faulted for anything.\u201d Tristan Watson, 28, a diver working on underwater bomb disposal in the marines, has relearned how to march for his first ceremonial role. \u201cMy whole branch is probably going to be watching trying to pick up something I do wrong,\u201d he said. One of the youngest participants is Jack Westworth, 18, an RAF gunner, who said his \u201cvery, very proud\u201d parents would be watching out for him before he is deployed to Iraq this autumn. \u201cI\u2019m very proud to be taking part in such a historic event, and to be front and centre of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is where I wanted to be but I didn\u2019t think I would be taking part in such a high-profile event.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 September 2022 because an earlier version mistakenly referred to Christopher Ghika as a major in the household division. Ghika is the major general commanding the household division."

            "date": "2022-09-21T17:46:18Z",
            "content": "Vladimir Putin cannot admit that he is losing a war, least of all a war he expected to win with such clinical success as to merit only being called a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d. That sinister euphemism, imposed on Russian media by law, will be harder to maintain now that the president has announced a mobilisation of army reservists. Sending hundreds of thousands of civilians to the front is a signal to Russians that Ukraine is more determined and capable in defence of its nationhood than was advertised by Kremlin propaganda. A successful Ukrainian counteroffensive has forced Mr Putin to downgrade his ambitions from regime change in Kyiv to \u201cliberation of the entire territory of Donbas\u201d. (\u201cLiberation\u201d means its opposite in this context.) Alongside the call-up of army reservists, the Kremlin has announced plans for referendums in occupied regions on the Russian border, leading to annexation. A rigged vote to gratify Mr Putin\u2019s territorial appetite is a foregone conclusion. Rebadging Ukrainian territory as part of Russia is part of a strategy to present the war as self-defence, with Kyiv as a front for the aggressor, Nato. That is a monstrous inversion of reality, but one that has a purchase on the Russian nationalist imagination. Mr Putin is trying to mythologise the conflict as a second chapter in a western plot against his country, where the first chapter was the unravelling of the Soviet Union. Paranoid delusion cannot compensate for military shortcomings, which is one reason why Russia\u2019s disoriented infantry is losing to better-motivated Ukrainians on the ground. But the fiction of Russian victimhood is also the basis for Mr Putin\u2019s nuclear grandstanding. His threats have hardly been veiled. Annexations are a step towards Russia complaining that its sovereign territory has come under attack, with the implication that, in the most catastrophic scenario, a nuclear riposte would be justified. That menace cannot be casually dismissed when it comes from a leader of questionable rationality and a dread of losing face. But according to western intelligence assessments (which have been reliable so far in this conflict), Russia\u2019s nuclear sabre-rattling is an escalation of rhetoric, not yet a battlefield mobilisation. The intention is the same as it was when the same threat was issued nearer the start of the war \u2013 to impose a limit on support that Nato will give to Kyiv. It worked, to the extent of making western countries nervous about provoking Moscow. But it failed to prevent Ukraine maximising what help it received with heroic ingenuity. Mr Putin conjuring the nuclear spectre is also a psychological device in a campaign to terrorise Ukraine. Conventional forces are already deployed to that end \u2013 unleashing indiscriminate artillery bombardment, strikes at civil infrastructure, targeting of civilians, kidnapping, torture, rape and murder. The discovery of mass graves near Izium, a city taken in the recent counteroffensive, is a grim reminder of what Mr Putin\u2019s methods mean on the ground, and why his extreme postures must not be allowed to dictate western policy. Solidarity with Ukrainians in their struggle against a barbarous dictator is both a moral and a strategic imperative for the rest of Europe. Putinism represents a profound threat to global security. It must be contained. The Russian president did not expect to fight a long war. Having blundered into one, he is forced to prolong it further, making cannon fodder of his own citizens. It is a desperate strategy that relies on a demoralised, poorly coordinated and corrupt Russian army outlasting Ukraine\u2019s will to fight for its survival. That has been a formula for the humbling of bullying powers in the past. So it is proving again."

            "title": "Putin\u2019s nuclear threat shows a desperate man out of options | Simon Jenkins",
            "date": "2022-09-23T07:00:28Z",
            "content": "Vladimir Putin is ready to use a nuclear weapon in his ongoing attempt to conquer Ukraine. Or so says Vladimir Putin. The reason is that his conquest has been justly defeated so far and he sees no other way forward. The prospect of such an escalation is appalling. A line would be crossed. Nuclear-armed powers round the world would regard it as a licence. It might not be the end of the world, but it might just be the beginning of the end. For all the cheerleading of western politicians over Putin\u2019s humiliation, it is crucial to emphasise how disciplined has been the west\u2019s support for Kyiv. Yes, Nato took a gamble in advancing its borders eastwards after 1991, George Kennan\u2019s \u201cmost fateful error of the post-cold war era\u201d. It taunted Russia\u2019s paranoia and risked the emergence of a belligerent patriot, which is what happened in the case of Putin. But at no point has the west taken up arms against Russia, even when Russia successively attacked and \u201crepatriated\u201d areas of neighbouring Georgia, Chechnya and even Ukraine. Moscow\u2019s spring invasion of Ukraine was on a wholly different scale from the 2014 intrusion into Donbas. It was so blatant and brutal that outside military support for Kyiv was as much humanitarian as strategic. But from the start, Nato did nothing to substantiate Moscow\u2019s lie that the west had taken up arms against Russian territory. There were to be no long-range missiles, no bombers or western troops fighting on the ground. Only with economic sanctions did the west lend plausibility to Putin\u2019s claim that it was attacking Russia itself. Putin has done his nation much harm. He has revealed his army as a Potemkin farce, his generals as incompetent sycophants. Many of his people, proud Russians long supportive of his bombast, are now openly hostile to his mobilisation. Polls show that a quarter to a half of Russians oppose the war. Only the spectacular discomfort caused to the west by Moscow\u2019s retaliatory gas sanctions has afforded the Kremlin some respite. Otherwise Putin is bereft of options. Like many a commander forced into retreat, he is tormented by the choice of escalation or abject defeat. During the cold war, Europe\u2019s civilians were taught how to respond to a potential thermonuclear exchange. The horror of \u201cmutual assured destruction\u201d was so ingrained it fed through into great-power diplomacy and created an infrastructure of back channels and accident aversion. The merest hint of danger, as during the Cuban crisis in 1962 and a radar malfunction in 1983, brought a swift return to sanity. There is no reason \u2013 or should be no reason \u2013 to see the present crisis as a return to the cold war and nuclear confrontation. Great powers are not in existential contention. Even Putin is threatening only tactical nuclear weapons. Given the weakness of his forces on the ground, it is hard to see what gain such weapons would bring him in what is a conventional infantry war over territory. They would be a gesture, and one that would surely lose him support both at home and abroad among his putative admirers in China and India. As for a nuclear \u201cresponse\u201d from the west, it would serve no tactical purpose and merely open the gates to escalation. We are told that if Putin was to fall, even \u201charder-line\u201d figures within his circle would replace him. Russia is like all regimes under sanctions. Besieged elites drive opponents and moderates underground or into exile. They become entrenched and ever less vulnerable to diplomacy and economic pressure. Yet all wars must end. Russia\u2019s in Ukraine has been going on for eight years and has increasingly taken on the colours of a proxy conflict of west against east. Therein lies the danger of Putin\u2019s escalation. Western aid has enabled Ukraine to drive Russia\u2019s troops back towards the 2014 frontiers. Ukraine and the west have been united in defying a brutal and authoritarian regime, and have been largely successful. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, now risks that unity by stating that he wants ever more western aid to drive Russia out of all of Ukraine, including Crimea. While his cause remains just, there must come a point when a war to conquer all of Ukraine becomes one of where to draw a line of armistice, as with Russia\u2019s infringements of its neighbours\u2019 sovereignty in Chechnya, Georgia, Crimea and Donbas. At some point, perhaps after one more forceful Ukrainian drive eastwards, there must come a different effort, to encourage the parties to agree a peace. Recent deals on wheat exports and prisoner exchanges show there are channels in place. That will mean a new challenge. The world of compromises, plebiscites, borders and guarantees may be less dramatic than that of guns, bombs, tanks and drums. But it has to be the world of the future. It has to presage the rebuilding of Ukraine. There is no conceivable interest in reviving the horrors of nuclear conflict between east and west just because one Russian ruler took leave of his senses. Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"

            "content": "\u2018Do you want Total War?\u201d Goebbels demanded of the Nazi faithful as the Second World War went south for Germany in 1943. He depicted a Reich surrounded by evil Jewish cosmopolitan conspirators bent on its destruction and he advocated for total mobilisation and to embrace a glory-in-death ideology. Vladimir Putin delivered his own (partial) version last week. As the Ukraine war goes south for Russia, he claimed the defeats are the result of cosmopolitan conspiracies bent on destroying Russia and he had to announce (partial) total mobilisation. He called on Russians\u2019 sense of historical mission and implied Russia was ready to use nuclear weapons. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a bluff,\u201d he insisted. Putin likes to imitate the worst of 20th-century totalitarian propaganda, but does his message work, at home and abroad? Or is Putin starting to make the same propaganda blunders he made on the battlefield? Russian state propaganda drips with the pathos of martyrdom. Russians are meant to love the pain of proving how tough they are, surviving everything from the Gulag to the extreme weather, as compared with the effete west. The propaganda taps incessantly into the myth of the Second World War, in which Russians are described as unique among nations in their readiness to sacrifice themselves for a greater cause. On the anniversary of that war, the state organises marches where people carry placards of dead veterans, \u201cthe immortal regiment\u201d: death in war brings immortality in the heaven of state propaganda. There\u2019s a suicidal bravura, a \u201clet\u2019s destroy the whole world\u201d implication in the popular catchphrase \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of the world if there\u2019s no place for Russia in it?\u201d. Putin\u2019s nuclear threats are snarled with relish, as if sadistically summoning the Gods of Total Destruction. As with the Nazis, rational self-interest is meant to be swallowed up in the community of the state. But look closer and the picture gets more complicated \u2013 and vulnerable. The myth of martyrdom and resilience is suspect. Ukrainians have a genuine tradition of suffering for the cause of national liberation \u2013 and success through sacrifice. For centuries, Ukrainian poets and rebels proved themselves ready to bear unjust imprisonment, executions and genocide to fight for their national and linguistic rights. Many of Ukraine\u2019s heroes, such as the poets Taras Shevchenko and Vasyl Stus, suffered Russian prisons and tortures, and their underlying spirit of resilience is being proved on the battlefield. Russians have indeed been killed en masse, most often by their own state, but, unlike Ukrainians, they do not celebrate their own dissidents. These are hated and damned in state propaganda and by the public at large. Real courage is derided. Instead, mass oppression has resulted in a society that celebrates passive conformism. Bravura is celebrated on the screen, but as a way to compensate for the way society is actually cowed. You are crushed by the state and then compensated with patriotic heroics on television and sadism towards the weakest in your own society and others (in this case, Ukraine). The great difference with Nazi propaganda is that while the former was geared to action and mobilisation, Putin\u2019s propaganda is geared to demobilisation: sit on the couch, feel strong by watching propaganda and let the Kremlin run things. Beneath the rhetoric of self-sacrifice, Putin\u2019s propaganda has traditionally allowed for self-interest or, at least, self-preservation. You go to war spouting patriotic rhetoric, but really you are in it because it allows for loot and rape. You enjoy the highs of patriotic rhetoric at home, but really your interest is in being allowed to pursue corruption, great and small. Putin\u2019s trick is to dress self-interest in patriotic propaganda. Now those two things are splitting. Going to the front just means pointless death. It\u2019s now clear the \u201cpartial\u201d mobilisation is not partial at all; people are being grabbed on the streets and packed off to war. On social media, the sentiment towards mobilisation is highly negative. In polling, even the most pro-Putin Russians are against it. The war in Ukraine was meant to be a movie, not a personal sacrifice. Putin\u2019s threat of nuclear war may backfire, too. It\u2019s meant to intimidate the west and Ukraine but it can upset his own people more. If there\u2019s one thing Russians fear more than Putin, it\u2019s nuclear war \u2013 and now he\u2019s the one bringing it closer. For both the elite and the \u201cordinary\u201d Russians who I\u2019ve spoken to recently, the calculation is about whether the risk of going against Putin is bigger than the risk of sticking with him. So far, rebelling has seemed the bigger risk; does the nuclear topic change that? Much depends on how the international community reacts. We need to show that the closer he gets to a nuclear threat, the more devastating the reaction will be: military, economic and diplomatic. He will even lose China. Losing public opinion in Russia is not the same as in a democracy. It doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to protests, let alone losing non-existent elections. But being able to show you can control public opinion, through fear and propaganda, is one of the emblems of tsardom. Putin has lost control of the military situation. Losing control of propaganda will show that beneath the shiny fascist boots are feet of clay. Now stamp on them. \u2022 Peter Pomerantsev is the author of Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: Adventures in Modern Russia Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "content": "The defence minister, Richard Marles, has condemned the latest nuclear threat from Russia as \u201cappalling\u201d, and says Australia is preparing to support Ukraine for a protracted military conflict. Speaking on Sunday, the deputy prime minister said the threat from the Russian president Vladimir Putin last week to use the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal as part of its ongoing war with Ukraine could \u201cnot be allowed to stand\u201d. \u201cCertainly the comments cause anxiety, you can\u2019t hide from that,\u201d Marles told Sky News. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard the president make those threats before [and] they are appalling comments to make. \u201cIt is clearly an appalling thing to do, to place that potential on the table.\u201d Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a televised address to the nation last week, Putin said that Russia was positioning itself in response to the threat from the west, which \u201cwants to destroy our country\u201d, as he threatened to use the \u201cvarious means of destruction\u201d it had at its disposal. \u201cWhen the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal,\u201d Putin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bluff.\u201d The comments sparked widespread condemnation and the threat of more sanctions from G7 countries, while the foreign minister, Penny Wong, suggested the government would consider the expulsion of the Russian ambassador in response. Amid the escalation, Marles was also critical of Putin\u2019s decision to mobilise 300,000 reservists, describing the move as \u201ca step in completely the wrong direction.\u201d \u201cRussia needs to stop and Russia needs to leave Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the scenes that we\u2019ve seen from Russia over the last few days, of people seeking to leave the country, of obvious distress for those being called up and being asked to serve in the Russian forces in respect of this says everything about where public opinion is actually at within Russia.\u201d Marles, who has recently met with officials from Nato countries in Europe, also said Australia would provide further and ongoing military assistance to Ukraine. It follows requests from the country\u2019s ambassador for 30 more Bushmaster armoured vehicles, 30 Hawkei protected mobility vehicles and Howitzer missiles. He said he would not yet reveal the details of Australia\u2019s military commitment, but confirmed there would be additional support. \u201cWhat we understand is that Ukraine is going to need support over a long period of time,\u201d Marles said. \u201cThat\u2019s very much the sense when I was in Europe and speaking to Nato countries \u2013 Germany, UK, France \u2013 all of those countries are really steeling themselves for this being an effort which needs to be undertaken over a long period of time, and that the importance of standing with Ukraine and enabling Ukraine to be empowered to resolve this on their own terms is fundamentally important. \u201cRest assured that we\u2019re talking with the Ukrainian ambassador, talking with Ukrainian government, about the way in which Australia can be there and be there over the long term, because we get that this has all the potential to be a protracted conflict.\u201d Marles also rejected suggestions from the federal opposition that the delivery of Bushmaster vehicles to Ukraine had been delayed by red tape, saying the project schedule was \u201con time\u201d. \u201cThe Ukrainians are very appreciative with the speed with which Bushmasters have been delivered to Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not in Ukraine\u2019s interest for us to make public what that delivery schedule is. But the delivery schedule is there. It\u2019s on time and they\u2019re getting those Bushmasters. And they\u2019re having a really big impact.\u201d"

            "content": "Good morning. In a speech to the UN general assembly, Joe Biden has condemned Vladimir Putin\u2019s threat to use nuclear weapons. The new federal water minister has been forced into a tricky situation after a declaration from the New South Wales government set the stage for a water-saving showdown with other states. And Barnaby Joyce and Michael McCormack have said they are unsure if meetings they attended were of Scott Morrison\u2019s secretive cabinet committee or not. Joe Biden and allied leaders have reacted angrily to Vladimir Putin\u2019s threats to use nuclear weapons, with the US pledging to maintain support for Ukraine in the face of Russia\u2019s partial mobilisation. Appearing before the UN general assembly on Wednesday, Biden sought to unite the international community in the face of what he called \u201creckless\u201d threats and \u201can extremely significant violation\u201d of the UN charter. The US president was speaking hours after Putin announced Russia\u2019s first mobilisation since the second world war and warned that his country had \u201clots of weapons to reply\u201d to what he claimed were western threats on its territory. NSW will seek an exemption from its obligations to deliver the final stage of the Murray-Darling Basin plan, a move that could leave the environment short-changed millions of litres of water. NSW will not meet a June 2024 deadline to deliver the last 25% of water savings of the plan, to be achieved through water-saving projects. The declaration sets the stage for a showdown with the other basin states and poses a test for the new federal water minister, Tanya Plibersek. She must decide whether to give NSW the concessions it is seeking at the expense of the environment, or use the tough penalties that are built into the plan. Former deputy prime ministers Barnaby Joyce and Michael McCormack did not always know if the \u201cdeep dive\u201d policy meetings they attended were actually meetings of Scott Morrison\u2019s secretive cabinet subcommittee. McCormack said he was \u201cdefinitely\u201d a member of the cabinet office policy committee, but he was \u201cnot sure\u201d if meetings attended by external stakeholders were cabinet office policy committee meetings. Joyce said there was \u201cnothing distinctly different\u201d about the meetings he attended compared with the processes of former Liberal prime ministers, but he knew them only as \u201cdeep dives\u201d, not as policy committee meetings.

            "date": "2022-09-21T18:17:09Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden and allied leaders have reacted angrily to Vladimir Putin\u2019s threats to use nuclear weapons and pledged to maintain support for Ukraine in the face of Russia\u2019s partial mobilisation and planned annexation of more Ukrainian regions. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, also shrugged off Putin\u2019s moves to escalate the war, saying his country\u2019s forces would continue their counter-offensive, not giving Russia breathing space to mobilise and dig in on Ukrainian soil. \u201cWe can return the Ukrainian flag to our entire territory. We can do it with the force of arms, but we need time,\u201d Zelenskiy said in a pre-recorded broadcast to the UN general assembly, which Russia had tried to stop but was overwhelmingly voted down by member states. \u201cRussia wants to spend the winter on the occupied territory of Ukraine \u2026 It wants to prepare fortifications on occupied land and carry out military mobilisation at home. We cannot agree to a delayed war because it will be even hotter than the war now.\u201d Both Biden and Zelenskiy sought to deepen Russia\u2019s isolation, on a day when North Korea said it would not supply ammunition to Russian forces. In his speech to the general assembly on Wednesday, Biden sought to unite the international community in the face of what he called \u201creckless\u201d threats and \u201can extremely significant violation\u201d of the UN charter. The US president was speaking hours after Putin announced Russia\u2019s first mobilisation since the second world war and warned that Moscow had \u201clots of weapons to reply\u201d to what he claimed were western threats on its territory. A senior US administration official said the US would not lessen its commitment to helping Ukraine defend itself. The official said Putin\u2019s latest actions were an \u201cact of weakness\u201d that showed his \u201cdesperation\u201d. \u201cThis is another episode in what has been a series of episodes over the course of this war where Putin is trying to rattle his sabre trying to scare us off,\u201d the senior official said. \u201cHe has not succeeded before \u2013 he won\u2019t succeed now, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re blind to the dynamics that could relate to escalation and that we weren\u2019t thinking carefully through in close consultation with our allies and with Ukrainians how we would deal with that.\u201d Biden portrayed the Russian leader and his \u201cimperial ambitions\u201d as a threat to the founding values of the UN, seeking to consolidate Ukraine\u2019s global support and coax some developing countries away from their neutral stance, as Putin raised the stakes. \u201cThis war is about extinguishing Ukraine\u2019s right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and Ukraine\u2019s right to exist as a people. Wherever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe, that should make your blood run cold,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBecause if nations can pursue their imperial ambitions without consequences, then we put at risk everything this very institution stands for.\u201d In his speech, Zelenskiy reminded world leaders of the mass graves being exhumed in the recently liberated town of Izium as the general assembly gathered, saying that among the bodies was a man strangled with a rope, and another who had been castrated before the murder. The Ukrainian president said that was not the first of such atrocities. He told the global assembly: \u201cAsk, please, the representatives of Russia why the Russian military are so obsessed with castration. What was done to them so that they want to do this to others?\u201d As Zelenskiy was speaking, a rare bit of good news emerged from the conflict: a prisoner swap in which Russia released 215 Ukrainian soldiers \u2013 many of whom had fought a last stand in the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol in May \u2013 in exchange for 55 Russians and Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician and oligarch who had taken sides with the Russian invaders. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, thanked the Ukrainian government for including two US citizens among 10 foreign fighters it asked to be freed as part of the swap, and also thanked Saudi Arabia and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, for facilitating the deal. The UK prime minister, Liz Truss, dismissed Putin\u2019s threats, telling the UN assembly late on Wednesdy: \u201cWe have seen Putin trying to justify his catastrophic failures. \u201cHe is doubling down by sending even more reservists to a terrible fate. He is desperately trying to claim the mantle of democracy for a regime without human rights or freedoms. And he is making yet more bogus claims and sabre-rattling threats. This will not work.\u201d Earlier on Wednesday, Putin had delivered a highly anticipated televised address to declare a \u201cpartial mobilisation\u201d, which he claimed was a direct response to the dangers posed by the west, which he said wanted \u201cto destroy our country\u201d and was trying to \u201cturn Ukraine\u2019s people into cannon fodder\u201d. \u201cMilitary service will apply only to citizens who are currently in the reserve, especially those who have served in the armed forces, have certain military professions and relevant experience,\u201d he said. Shortly after Putin\u2019s announcement, the country\u2019s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said 300,000 Russians would be called up as part of the mobilisation that will apply to \u201cthose with previous military experience\u201d. The announcement triggered an exodus of Russian men scrambling to avoid the draft. Air tickets rose in price and were soon sold out. Russian opposition groups called for nationwide anti-war street protests and by Wednesday evening, more than 1,300 people had been arrested at the demonstrations, according to the independent protest monitoring group OVD-Info. \u201cPutin\u2019s announcement of a partial mobilisation is an act of desperation,\u201d the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Twitter. \u201cRussia cannot win this criminal war. Putin has underestimated the situation from the outset \u2013 including the will to resist of Ukraine and the resolve shown by its friends.\u201d Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said there had been no perceived change in the deployment Russian nuclear forces. \u201cThe most important thing is to prevent that from happening, and that\u2019s the reason why we have been so clear in our communications with Russia about the unprecedented consequences, about the fact that the nuclear war cannot be won by Russia,\u201d Stoltenberg told Reuters. Putin\u2019s announcement came a day after Russian-controlled regions in eastern and southern Ukraine announced plans to hold \u201creferendums\u201d this weekend on becoming part of Russia. In his speech, Putin gave support to those ballots in the parts of Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia runder Russian control. He also delivered barely veiled nuclear threats against Nato, saying: \u201cI want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction, and for separate components and more modern than those of Nato countries and when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal.\u201d Putin added: \u201cIt\u2019s not a bluff.\u201d The Russian leader and his senior officials have made a string of similar nuclear threats since launching the invasion in February, in an effort to deter Nato countries from intervening. But in his UN speech on Wednesday, Biden sought to make clear the US and its allies would not be deterred from supporting Ukraine\u2019s fight to defend its territory. \u201cRussia has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations charter, none more important than the clear prohibition against countries taking the territory of their neighbour by force,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe Kremlin is organising a sham referendum to try to annex parts of Ukraine, an extremely significant violation of the UN charter. This world should see these outrageous acts for what they are. \u201cAgain, just today, President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the non-proliferation regime,\u201d he said, adding that such \u201cirresponsible nuclear threats\u201d directly contradicted Russia\u2019s international responsibilities and its agreement with a joint statement by nuclear weapons powers at the beginning of this year that \u201ca nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought\u201d. Seeking support from the developing world in what he framed as a contest between democracy and dictatorship, Biden offered US support for reform of the UN security council to make it more inclusive as well asbillion of dollars for global food security and efforts to curb disease. US officials have conceded that their focus on Ukraine has led some developing countries from the global south to feel that their concerns were being ignored in a great power showdown. In his speech on Wednesday, Biden sought to address those fears, pledging $2.9bn for food security this year, and $6bn for the global fund to fight Aids tuberculosis and malaria. He also threw US support behind a longstanding demand for a more inclusive and representative security council with more permanent and non-permanent members, including permanent seats for countries from Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean."

            "date": "2022-09-30T13:01:53Z",
            "content": "Thousands of people living lawfully in the UK are encountering delays in the visa renewal process, which then cause them problems with hostile environment policies, according to research published this week by a migrant rights charity. People seeking to extend or formalise their immigration status are given the little-understood status of \u201c3C leave\u201d while they wait for the Home Office to process their application. During this period, their right to work, rent property and access healthcare is in theory protected, but because they have no documentary evidence proving their status, many face difficulties with landlords and employers. Research by the Refugee and Migrant Forum of Essex and London (Ramfel), which offers support with immigration casework, said more than 30% of its clients had experienced difficulties while they were on 3C leave. Employers and landlords are often unfamiliar with the concept, and because they are anxious to avoid being fined for employing or renting to an illegal immigrant, they often view lack of documentation as synonymous with unlawful status, the charity states. Many placed on 3C leave are in the process of trying naturalise as British, under the 10-year route, which requires applicants to make four 30-month further leave-to-remain applications to stay in the UK during the qualifying period at a cost of about \u00a32,600 each time. Home Office processing delays mean that many find themselves in immigration limbo for extended periods. A package of hostile environment policies introduced from 2012 increased the penalties faced by employers and landlords who fail to conduct immigration status checks, and made it hard for anyone without documentary proof of their valid immigration status to access healthcare, benefits, driving licences, bank accounts or mobile phone contracts. This caused problems for people from the Windrush generation, who were unable to prove they were in the UK legally, but a new group people are now facing similar difficulties because of the poor understanding of 3C status. Shantel Williams, 29, who has lived in the UK since arriving here legally from Jamaica as a nine-year-old with her mother, is trying to obtain British citizenship through the 10-year-route. She applied for work at a bookmakers earlier this summer, while she was on 3C leave while waiting for a Home Office decision on her latest leave-to-remain application, but she was unable to persuade her prospective employers that she was here legally. When she explained that they could go online to do an employee check on the government website, they were unfamiliar with the system and refused to do one. \u201cThe system feels very harsh and brutal. The slowness of the Home Office decision-making process makes things very hard. It has had an enormous impact on my life, in terms of being stable and feeling like I belong here,\u201d she said. \u201cThe average waiting time for a decision is currently 11 months, meaning applicants spend almost a year on 3C leave with no physical visa document. This has been compounded further by government delays in processing employment verification checks, which are meant to act as a safeguard for those on 3C leave,\u201d the Ramfel report states. Between January 2020 and May 2022, Ramfel helped 329 people make further leave-to-remain applications, and in at least 109 instances (31%) clients faced some kind of detriment while on 3C leave; 21 people were either wrongly suspended from work or prevented from taking up employment. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cOur guidance clearly stipulates that employers should provide individuals with every opportunity to demonstrate their right to work and must not discriminate against those with an outstanding application. We are clear that those who discriminate are breaking the law. We have set out a long-term vision to ultimately move away from providing physical documents that evidence immigration status to help make it easier for people to accurately reflect their immigration status.\u201d Nick Beales, of Ramfel, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s hostile environment was shown by the Windrush scandal to trap and victimise British nationals simply because they did not hold physical visa documents. For those on the 10-year route to settlement, lawfully resident in the UK but spending significant periods on 3C leave without physical proof of their immigration status, it should come as no surprise that they are frequently suffering discrimination with employment and when attempting to access even basic services.\u201d Colin Yeo, an immigration lawyer, said the lack of documentation was causing problems: \u201cIf you\u2019ve made a valid application it is invisibly extended by law, but no employer, landlord, college or hospital will be able to see that on the passport and the fines they face will make them reluctant to trust you.\u201d"

            "title": "Food as medicine: could prescribing fruit and vegetables become part of healthcare?",
            "date": "2022-09-18T17:30:19Z",
            "content": "Emma\u2019s type 2 diabetes diagnosis turned her life upside down. \u201cIt is like having a baby that never grows up,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is nagging at you as soon as you wake up.\u201d Every single morsel of food has to be carefully chosen in case it sends her blood sugar levels spiking, which could cause her to pass out or worse. The ideal diet for someone with Emma\u2019s condition would include lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, wholegrains, nuts and seeds, lean meat and fish, and reduced-fat dairy. That diet has been shown to slow down or even reverse the progression of type 2 diabetes and help prevent it happening in the first place. But that has been a diet she has struggled to access. What if such a diet could be prescribed in the same way as medication, as a prescriptive intervention, subsidised by government, readily available and with plenty of support and information, to help prevent or treat disease? The idea of \u201cfood as medicine\u201d is gaining traction around the world as scientists and doctors look for ways to use food in a targeted fashion to improve health. Healthy food is not just important for diabetes, says Prof Jason Wu, a University of New South Wales nutrition epidemiologist and head of the nutrition science program at the George Institute for Global Health in Sydney. He says many of the \u201ctop killers\u201d in western societies, from diabetes to cardiovascular disease and some cancers, are linked to lifestyle \u201cand diet is really one of the major causes\u201d. Decades of campaigns on healthy eating have failed to make much of a dent in Australia\u2019s worsening rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Wu and many others say the problem is systemic barriers \u2013 such as cost, availability, accessibility and education \u2013 that no amount of public health messaging advocating for healthy diets can overcome. Advocates believe better targeted, supported and funded prescriptive approaches are needed and that\u2019s where the idea of food as medicine comes in. Wu and colleagues recently conducted a study involving 50 people with type 2 diabetes who were finding it hard to afford enough food. The group were \u201cprescribed\u201d a free box of fresh fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, lean meats and dairy \u2013 delivered to their home every week. They also had regular access to a dietician and were given recipes and advice on how to prepare healthy food using the ingredients. Emma was one of the study participants. \u201cI would open up these boxes and it was things that I hadn\u2019t eaten in a long time or things that I just didn\u2019t think were an option,\u201d she says. Instead of a burger for breakfast, she started eating fruit; instead of chips, she had nuts and seeds. The study lasted only three months, but in that time the \u201cproduce prescriptions\u201d made a big improvement to diet quality and food security for those involved. And there were other unexpected benefits: overall, the participants showed improvements in their cholesterol levels and lost weight, and also ate less unhealthy food. The affordability problem Wu wants to see food as medicine become an intrinsic part of healthcare, in prevention and treatment of disease. It is not to suggest one can eat themselves out of terminal illness but food can have a powerful effect on health and some disease. \u201cThe reason why we use food as medicine is because healthcare needs to shift,\u201d he says. \u201cWithin healthcare itself, healthy food and honestly just healthy physical activity does not get anywhere near enough attention it should get.\u201d He\u2019s pushing for food prescriptions to become subsidised and accessible in the same way as a pharmaceutical prescription. \u201cWe spend billions and billions of dollars every year paying for medications or paying for surgeries that are essentially downstream consequences of unhealthy diets,\u201d Wu says. He says some of those healthcare dollars should be diverted to pay for, or subsidise, evidence-based healthy foods for patients with these kinds of lifestyle-related diseases and particularly those who are already experiencing food insecurity. As well as prevention \u2013 such as switching from processed carbohydrates to wholegrains to avoid pre-diabetes developing into the full-blown disease \u2013 some studies suggest food prescriptions be used for people already affected by a disease. For example, a recent study from the University of Newcastle found a daily handful of almonds helped relieve constipation in people with kidney disease undergoing the blood-filtering process haemodialysis. Clare Collins, a nutrition and dietetics professor at the University of Newcastle, says she would like to see nutrition managed care plans \u2013 similar to the mental health treatment plans currently subsidised by Medicare \u2013 that give people access to dieticians and nutritionists who can help overcome at least some of the barriers to healthy eating. At the moment, a Medicare-subsidised chronic disease management plan \u2013 for management of diseases such as type 2 diabetes \u2013 includes the option of a single appointment with a dietitian as one of a large variety of allied health professionals available for limited number of subsidised appointments. \u201cIf you really want to help someone, totally change the trajectory,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be getting one of five visits and a prescription; it needs that whole support structure.\u201d While Collins isn\u2019t opposed to the idea of food prescriptions, she says it doesn\u2019t go far enough in addressing the systemic barriers that make it difficult for people to eat a healthy diet. Barriers can be as fundamental as kitchens. In developing their No Money No Time healthy eating website, Collins and her colleagues discovered many people didn\u2019t even have the ability to properly prepare healthy food. Some only have one shelf in a refrigerator, others have a benchtop kitchen only and some might only have a kettle, microwave or sandwich press. \u201cImagine someone comes along with that kind of situation and the doctor says, \u2018you go away and eat more vegetables and fruit\u2019,\u201d she says. Another barrier to implementing a food-as-medicine approach is the accessibility and affordability of healthy food itself. Dr Kelly Lambert, a dietician specialising in kidney disease at the University of Wollongong, says accessibility is a vexed issue. \u201cWe don\u2019t even need to be thinking about remote communities; it could just be downtown Dubbo for example, where I know that is a real issue,\u201d she says. Affordability of fresh produce was challenging even before the recent cost of living crisis. Lambert highlights such initiatives as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the US, which provides subsidised access to healthy food \u2013 in the form of a card that can be used to buy food at particular retailers and supermarkets \u2013 for low-income households and individuals, two-thirds of whom are families with children. Philanthropic organisations such as the Rockefeller Foundation are putting money into addressing this too. The foundation has recently committed US$105m over three years to \u201cincrease access to healthy and sustainable foods for 40 million underserved people around the globe\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re a little bit further ahead than us in terms of using this food-as-medicine concept and providing healthy meals and groceries to particularly disadvantaged communities,\u201d Lambert says. She would like to see these approaches aimed at Australians with health conditions such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, and those who are overweight or obese, \u201cbecause those three big diseases drive the majority of chronic illness in Australia\u201d. The simplest approach would be to subsidise access to fresh vegetables. \u201c[Vegetables] have such a powerful effect from a health perspective, yet there is such a common perception that they\u2019re unaffordable \u2013 and these days they potentially are in some communities,\u201d Lambert says. Since the UNSW study ended, Emma has been missing it \u2013 especially when something as simple as a lettuce became unaffordable. \u201cI really miss those basic things \u2013 I miss broccoli, cauliflower, all of that,\u201d she says. She has reverted to some of her old \u201cstodgy\u201d foods, because they are cheaper. Those weekly deliveries helped her manage her diabetes and improved her insomnia. \u201cIt sounds so cliched, but obviously it was night and day,\u201d Emma says. \u201cI took it as a gift.\u201d"

            "content": "\u201cDoctor, please, he doesn\u2019t want to leave the hospital alive.\u201d Once it might have been a line in a skit, today it\u2019s no joke. The elderly patient is in hospital for the sixth time this year. The cause, his wife synthesises, is \u201ca tired brain\u201d, punctured by strokes and subdued by dementia. Absorbing her dejection, we move on to other patients admitted from residential care. One complained of difficulty swallowing and was bundled into an ambulance. The saintly patience of a nurse coaxes food and drink into her, her sore throat explained by a dry mouth. Another had temporary chest discomfort and the briefest of histories reveals it to be muscular pain eased by simple analgesia. A third has fluid retention, relieved by an additional diuretic. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Careful minutes spent at each bedside quickly demonstrates a few things: one, nearly all their problems could have been addressed in the community and two, they hate being here. A call to their family explodes another myth: far from pressuring the nursing home to send the patient to hospital, most advocated against it. Now, many of these patients are stuck. Multiple teams do their own thing. The flood of interventions, once unleashed, is impossible to tame. The next several patients live alone or with an ageing spouse, or with a \u201cchild\u201d nearing retirement. Their medical problems are minor, but they are teetering on the edge. They can\u2019t climb stairs, are unsafe to drive, can\u2019t remember their medications and need help with meals. An alarming number of them are supporting a child with marital breakdown or mental illness. These patients don\u2019t mind being in hospital where they feel safe, but their deepest wish is summed up by the man who says: \u201cThe best way you can help me is speed up my aged care package.\u201d He has waited six months. He could be waiting for another six. \u201cWhat are we doing for these patients?\u201d asks a flummoxed medical student, probably thinking that the stories of doctors performing daily acts of heroism might just be fictional. As if to compound his dismay, the phlebotomist asks if an unconscious dying patient really needs a blood test and a patient repeatedly wails, \u201cSomeone tell me why I am here.\u201d An annoyed nurse pulls me aside and begs me to stop the \u201ccrazy\u201d tests that hurt patients. I tell her I would if I knew who was writing the orders but there is a different doctor each day. A nurse sits in a corner with her head in her hands, a forlorn image that sums up the state of disillusioned providers. Spend a few hours on the medical ward of any hospital and you feel the pulse of the entire healthcare system. Beds are filled with the frail and elderly suffering conditions that are manageable but not curable. These patients spend a long time in hospital, which would be OK if they benefited, but many don\u2019t. Instead, hospitalisation swaps one problem for another and leaves them deconditioned, isolated, and confused. Over-investigation does harm. Insomnia causes falls. The care feels impersonal. The marvel of living longer is coupled with the inevitability of decline. Most of us can expect to live our final years on a merry-go-round of interventions with diminishing benefit. At the same time, children die in emergency, women give birth on the road, and ambulance delays imperil lives. It would be easy to misrepresent this as an argument for turning away from our elderly to free up hospital beds but that is beneath a decent society. Instead, we must meet our elderly patients where they are. Many patients transferred from a facility to hospital could stay put if the facility had two things \u2013 competence and confidence. Competence in the form of skilled professionals including doctors, nurses, and allied health staff. Where illness happens round the clock, access to help can\u2019t be limited to a few hours. Confidence in the knowledge that while it is easy to summon an ambulance, this may not be the best idea. What these patients need is a knowledgable doctor to take stock of the big picture and make a shared decision. For some, it will be admission to hospital, but for others it will be time-limited treatment or compassionate end-of-life care. Alas, this kind of doctor is disappearing because we like to hail GPs as the backbone of the system while breaking their back through flawed policies. In place of the doctor who could provide care in the community at a fraction of the cost, I dispense costly and fragmented care in hospital where value for money is a sorry footnote. This care is reactive and detached from reality. The lack of communication is dangerous. To add insult to injury, the public purse is bleeding but complaints are rising. This kind of healthcare makes no pragmatic, financial or moral sense. The tired answer to healthcare woes is that no one has \u201ca magic wand\u201d. But what if the magic wand were reimagining healthcare as one ecosystem that faithfully serves the individual from birth to death? Such a system would acknowledge that our needs evolve with age. It would prioritise prevention and early intervention for conditions, physical and psychological, that become costlier upon progression. It would recognise that surgery should be performed in hospital, but wounds can be dressed at home. That funding Meals on Wheels is better than reversing malnutrition. That home-based exercises are cheaper than fixing a fractured hip. Through improved education, it would restrain spending on futile care in the hospital at the end of life and redirect funds to community services. It would send skilled nurses to community hubs so that hospitals were reserved for those who most needed it. And by replacing lip service with targeted investment, it would restore primary care to its rightful place so that no one dismissed one of the most important doctors a patient could have as \u201cjust a GP\u201d."

            "date": "2022-09-11T13:21:43Z",
            "content": "Millions of patients are being forced to pay for private healthcare amid record NHS waiting lists and are having to cut spending, raid savings or get into debt to fund it, new research reveals. One in 10 (10%) adults in the UK have turned to the private sector or independent healthcare in just the last 12 months, according to a survey commissioned by charity Engage Britain. Of those, almost two-thirds (63%) did so because they faced long delays or could not access treatment on the NHS. The latest NHS England figures show the number of people in England waiting for routine hospital treatments has jumped to a record 6.8 million. Of those who have gone private, almost half (46%) were forced to reduce their spending in other areas, plunder savings they had been keeping for another purpose, or get into financial debt to pay for it. Miriam Levin, health and care programme director at Engage Britain, said: \u201cWhile the NHS still unites many of us with a feeling of pride, it\u2019s clear more and more people feel forced to turn to private treatment. \u201cAs people suffer through months of pain and discomfort after postponed appointments, or waste time and energy chasing up referrals, millions are feeling desperate enough to use savings or get into debt to help us get well again.\u201d Faced with the prospect of waiting many months on the NHS, Leanne Langford, 59, who damaged her knee while learning to dance, sold her motorbike and took out a loan to pay for a knee replacement operation performed in the private sector. \u201cI know what the NHS is going through,\u201d she said. \u201cWaiting for eight weeks might become 12 weeks or more. Living on my own I didn\u2019t have anyone to help me and relying on friends just didn\u2019t feel right.\u201d The surgery cost the mother of two from Kent about \u00a39,000. \u201cIt did frighten me how much it was. I\u2019ve not been in debt, I\u2019ve been very fortunate. So I was concerned by that. \u201cThere\u2019s always a perception if you haven\u2019t needed the NHS \u2013 more than the odd prescription \u2013 that it would be there in your hour of need. But of course that wasn\u2019t the case for me then, and it\u2019s certainly not the case now. \u201cThe NHS is amazing and it\u2019s doing far more than it was set up to do. But the current crisis has shown us there need to be some changes in its delivery and our expectations of it.\u201d The survey, commissioned by Engage Britain and conducted by Yonder, polled 2,075 UK adults. Of those who went private in the last year, 46% selected at least one of the following when asked about the financial impact: \u201cI had to go into debt\u201d, \u201cI had to cut back on my spending\u201d or \u201cI had to use savings that I was keeping for another purpose\u201d. Louise Ansari, national director at Healthwatch England, said the research was \u201cvery concerning\u201d. \u201cPeople on the lowest incomes are the most likely to wait the longest for NHS treatment and will have a more negative experience of waiting,\u201d she said. \u201cIn turn, this leads to a worse impact on their physical health, mental health and their ability to work and care for loved ones. \u201cTackling the NHS backlog is a huge challenge but decision-makers must find a way to do so without exacerbating health inequalities, the extent of which has been laid bare by the pandemic.\u201d Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the whole healthcare system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said: \u201cWhilst health leaders have been working at full pelt to drive down patient waiting times, they know only too well the challenge of clearing the treatment backlog is far from over. \u201cThe NHS is understaffed with over 130,000 vacancies at the last count, and a continued lack of investment is being compounded by decades of austerity. The founding principle of the health is that it is exists for everyone and does not discriminate based on whether people can pay. \u201cThe new government would do well to remember that and need to do more to ensure that timely and safe care and treatment are not only available to those that can afford it.\u201d When asked \u201cwhich of the following best describes the reason why you had private healthcare?\u201d, 45% responded, \u201cbecause of the waiting time for NHS treatment\u201d, and 18% chose \u201cbecause the treatment you needed was not available on the NHS\u201d, with 63% choosing one of the two options. Of those who had experienced NHS healthcare in the last 12 months, more than one in four (28%) reported having had an appointment cancelled or postponed. Almost one in five (18%) said they had not been notified about \u201csomething important\u201d relating to their treatment, while 12% reported not being kept \u201cproperly updated\u201d while waiting. One in 10 (11%) said there had been a mistake in correspondence from the NHS relating to their treatment. An NHS England spokesperson said record numbers of people were being treated by the NHS with waits of more than two years \u201cvirtually eliminated\u201d and those waiting more than 18 months down by more than 20,000 since January. \u201cThe message to patients is clear and has not changed \u2013 it is vital that people do not put off seeking care when they need it.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working to ease pressure on the NHS by busting the Covid backlogs, and recently announced the opening of 50 surgical hubs on top of the 91 that are already open, which will ensure millions of people get the surgery they need.\u201d"

            "content": "Watching videos about how to cook, eat less and choose healthier foods can help obese children lose weight, reduce their risk of diabetes and become happier, a study has found. The doctor behind the findings believes they can help in treating childhood obesity because they show that online healthcare can be just as effective as face-to-face appointments. A team of researchers led by Dr Felix Reschke, of the children\u2019s hospital in Hanover, Germany, studied 108 children who followed the video-based weight loss programme while the country was in its second Covid-19 lockdown in late 2020. The trial resulted in many participants eating much more fruit and vegetables and far fewer sugary treat foods such as sweets, snacks and soft drinks. In addition, they reduced the number of meals they ate each day, though they still averaged 4.1 meals, as a result of \u201cvideo-based structured education\u201d. Overall, two-thirds lost weight and generally displayed better health. The yearlong programme consisted of the young people watching educational videos about good food choices, the amount they should be eating at mealtimes and the benefits of being physically active. Participants ranged from eight to 17 years old and their average age was 12. All were already enrolled in the KiCK outpatient healthy living programme for under-18s who were overweight or obese. It was remodelled owing to Covid to become online-only. It also included educational seminars and workshops, as well as online cooking sessions and discussions about difficult subjects such as \u201cemotional eating\u201d and the health consequences of obesity, which can include diabetes and a higher risk of heart, breathing and joint problems. Participants displayed \u201csignificant improvements\u201d in five key measures of their health. They had a lower body-mass index, reduced risk of developing diabetes, less cholesterol in their bloodstream, better results in a six-minute test of their walking speed, and improved mental welfare. \u201cSuccessful treatment of childhood obesity is challenging work, but we have demonstrated that adolescents with pre-existing obesity may be helped through video-based training,\u201d Reschke said. \u201cParticipants showed improvements in their dietary choices, appetite control and portion sizes, which was reflected in better measures of their metabolic health and quality of life.\u201d The results proved that virtual care could help patients as much as in-person consultations, he added. \u201cOur results are very hopeful that this approach may be a useful and cost-effective model for treating obesity in children. It eliminates the need for regular face-to-face contact, which may be of particular use for those who have difficulty attending appointments. Although we must take care not to unnecessarily increase the amount of screen time used by children. It may be a fine line, but our data suggest this approach is worthwhile.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-09-30T10:33:10Z",
            "content": "A weaker than expected recovery from the coronavirus pandemic has left the UK as the only G7 country with a smaller economy than in early 2020, according to official figures likely to further undermine the government\u2019s tax-cutting measures. Before the prime minister and chancellor\u2019s meeting with the head of the government\u2019s independent forecaster on Friday morning, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released figures showing that rather than the economy being 0.6% larger than in February 2020, a combination of a deeper recession during the pandemic and a weak recovery had left it 0.2% smaller. A better than expected performance in the second quarter of this year, overturning a previous estimate of a 0.1% fall to a 0.2% increase and reversing an assessment that the UK was in recession by June, was not enough to boost GDP growth sufficiently to recover from the first lockdowns in 2020 that brought large parts of the economy to a standstill. Analysts said Richard Hughes, the head of the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, would be forced by the new figures to take a tough stance on assessing the impact of further borrowing on the public finances. All the other major economies in the G7, including France and Italy, recovered strongly enough to be larger than they were in February 2020. \u201cDespite the better news on the performance of the economy in the second quarter, the overall picture is that the economy is in worse shape than we previously thought,\u201d Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s before the full drag from the surge in inflation and leap in borrowing costs have been felt.\u201d The Bank of England said earlier this month that it understood the UK economy was already in recession after it forecast a fall in GDP of 0.1% in the third quarter, leading to two consecutive quarters of negative growth, but the ONS estimate of growth in the second quarter shows that while the economy is depressed, it is unlikely to enter a recession until the end of the year. Separate data showed house prices failed to rise month on month for the first time since July 2021, a latest sign of the slowdown in the market caused by the cost of living squeeze and rising interest rates. Kwasi Kwarteng published an economic plan on Friday last week that he said would spur growth by cutting taxes. However, investors responded to the mini-budget by selling the pound and offloading British government bonds, increasing the interest bill paid by the Treasury. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the figures suggested that the damage inflicted by Covid-19 and Brexit on to the economy\u2019s ability to grow was even larger than previously thought. \u201cThese revisions will compel the OBR to revise down further its estimates for future potential GDP,\u201d he said. The recent turmoil in British financial markets has also highlighted the UK\u2019s large current account deficit. The amount by which the value of imports exceeds that of exports has worsened since the financial crisis of 2008 and the Brexit vote despite steep falls in the value of the pound that make exports cheaper. ONS data showed the current account gap in the April-June period shrank to \u00a333.8bn, or 5.5% from a \u00a343.9bn deficit in the first quarter, which was revised down from an earlier estimate. However, the January-March deficit remained the biggest on record, the ONS said, revealing the difficulties UK exporters are having finding markets for their products and services."

            "date": "2022-09-05T06:00:09Z",
            "content": "It was the second day of school for Greenville elementary school, and students were scattered across the playground, soaking in the late August sun. On the swings, some kicked their way closer to the cloudless sky; others scampered around on the multicolored jungle gym. There were shrieks and snacks and one skinned elbow, and the air was fragrant with the freshly laid woodchips that cushioned the students\u2019 rapid descent from the slide. It\u2019s the kind of scene Kristy Warren has witnessed countless times. She first came here as a student herself, then returned about 20 years later as a school principal. Since then, in the course of her seven years as the Plumas county assistant superintendent for curriculum and instruction, she\u2019s made regular visits to the stretch of road where this small northern California town\u2019s elementary school and junior-senior high school stand side-by-side. But this day was different. After more than two years of school closures and crises \u2013 first the pandemic, then the devastating Dixie fire \u2013 the campus was alive with activity. This year marked the first time since 2019 that Greenville\u2019s students would return to these classrooms on schedule as well as in person. Standing on the newly poured blacktop with a few teachers, Warren agreed that it looked like a regular school day \u2013 if you ignored the backdrop of fire-blackened trees. Working as a school administrator in a rural county with fewer than 20,000 people comes with its own unique challenges, and the disasters Warren\u2019s district has weathered in recent years have only expanded her role. Warren juggles responsibilities that would probably be shared in a larger or wealthier district, including overseeing the curriculum \u2013 from early learning through adult education \u2013 for all eight of Plumas county\u2019s schools, and dealing with everything from human resources and hiring to technology and budgeting. After Covid-19 shuttered the schools in March 2020, Warren oversaw getting the district\u2019s 125 teachers set up online, first with Zoom and then using a new system she selected. When students finally began to resume in-person learning, she fielded questions and complaints about the mask mandates and helped set up a testing system that screened hundreds of students a day. She was eager to get kids back in the classroom, and she spent the summer of 2021 optimistically preparing for what was supposed to be a more normal fall, now that vaccines were readily available. But on the evening of 4 August, less than three weeks before the first day of school, the Dixie fire, the second largest wildfire in California\u2019s history, swept through Greenville. The nearly 964,000-acre blaze devastated the town and destroyed the majority of its buildings, including Warren\u2019s childhood home. Residents were evacuated, and many found little remaining when they returned. The flames licked the corner of the high school gym, destroyed the elementary school\u2019s wooden welcome sign, and melted the playground equipment \u2013 but the main buildings survived. \u201cThere\u2019s not one person here who wasn\u2019t affected in some way, shape or form,\u201d Warren said. \u201cSome lost their homes, some didn\u2019t, but the whole community definitely was impacted, because chances are they knew a friend or family member who did.\u201d The district postponed the start of school for two weeks, giving an additional four weeks to Greenville students, who were offered independent study or the option to attend another school within the Plumas county district. Since much of the area did not have dependable wifi, Greenville elementary schoolteacher Maria Johnson said she printed out learning packets and delivered them to students so they could stay on track with their education. Still, many of the residents remained displaced, and fewer than half the town\u2019s students from the previous year registered with Greenville schools after the fire. Meanwhile, Warren and the other district staff navigated the bureaucracy of the disaster recovery system, reaching out to state and federal officials for assistance. Though Greenville\u2019s school buildings had survived the fire physically, they were unsafe for students: there was no electricity, debris was all around, and hazardous chemicals had been found in the ground and water. But because the buildings were intact, the schools were ineligible for most recovery funding, and regulations made it difficult to cope by shifting around resources. Warren offered one example of red tape she encountered, recalling how they had to appeal directly to the governor\u2019s office just to use a multipurpose hall from another campus as a cafeteria. At the same time, Plumas county was still dealing with Covid-19. In October, there was an outbreak that sent home teachers and about a third of the students, Warren estimated. Another wave followed around the holidays, and this time so many staff got sick that Warren had to step in as a substitute teacher. \u201cYou just add on all the recovery and the trauma and Covid, and everyone\u2019s just tired,\u201d Warren told me in February, during another outbreak. \u201cEveryone\u2019s job is different; no one\u2019s doing what they were hired to do three years ago.\u201d After recess on the August day I visited, Warren snapped a selfie in the refurbished gym and watched the newly made wooden welcome sign be placed in the front of the elementary school. It had been just over a year since the Dixie fire, and the Greenville schools were surrounded by properties in the early stages of construction. Warren told me how much it meant to see students and staff back on this campus again, especially since it almost didn\u2019t happen. The school\u2019s wifi, which is currently supplied by a large temporary tower behind the buildings, was unreliable; there was no air conditioning, and temperatures that first week were expected to soar into the 90s. Ultimately, Warren said, the administrators and staff still agreed it was worth moving forward (and getting fans). Being back in the classroom would give the teachers a chance to better address the trauma students had experienced; already, some teachers told Warren they\u2019d noticed how some students flinched whenever the bells rang, and there was a lot of anxiety around the idea of fire drills. Warren said she believed it was for the community to see the school reopen too: The busy campus stood as a sign of progress and hope. Warren ended the day back at her desk in the nearby town of Quincy. She fielded phone calls from colleagues and state officials while checking on how many students had actually returned, compared with how many they\u2019d expected. In Greenville, the numbers were still dozens shy of their 2020 tallies, but up from last year by nearly 50 students. Overall, the first days back had been a success, but there were still challenges to tackle. One teacher was out with Covid-19, and there was the larger issue of the district\u2019s teacher shortage \u2013 they were looking to fill about a dozen spots, and the lack of affordable housing since the fire made finding replacements even harder. The hot weather also served as a reminder of teacher requests, like the social studies department\u2019s plea for more physical textbooks since technology could not always be relied on during warmer months. Here in northern California, the growing wildfire risk has made public safety power shutoffs a regular feature of recent autumns. in many of the district\u2019s schools, bright yellow air purifiers line the halls in case of smoky days. Warren has added yet another responsibility to her roster in recent months: she has begun sharing her district\u2019s experience of disaster recovery with other school administrators. Climate change is making extreme weather events increasingly severe and common, and a Government Accountability Office study found more than half of the nation\u2019s public school districts are located in counties that were officially declared disaster areas between 2017 and 2019. Warren\u2019s hard-earned knowledge will prove increasingly useful to other fire-threatened rural communities in the west. \u201cNow we have our story,\u201d Warren said, \u201cand we\u2019re able to help others\u201d.

At present the Queen lies in the ballroom of Balmoral Castle in an oak coffin covered with the Royal Standard for Scotland and with a wreath of flowers laid on top. It is a \u201cscene of quiet dignity\u201d, allowing her Balmoral estate staff to pay their last respects, a palace spokesperson said. It is the start of a journey of processions, guards of honour, church services and vigils as the nation begins its long goodbye to the Queen and her coffin is moved over the coming days to Westminster Hall for a four-day lying in state before her funeral. During this time, the King will be carrying out \u201call the necessary state duties\u201d. But \u201chis main focus will be leading the royal family, the nation, the realms and the Commonwealth in mourning Her Majesty the Queen,\u201d his spokesperson said. On Monday, he and the Queen Consort will travel to Westminster Hall where, as is traditional, both Houses of Parliament will meet to express their condolences at the death of the Queen, and the King will make his reply. On Sunday, the coffin will travel to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, a journey of six hours by road, via Aberdeen. Six of her Balmoral gamekeepers will carry the coffin from the Balmoral ballroom to the hearse. It will remain in the throne room at Holyroodhouse until Monday afternoon, before a procession to St Giles\u2019 Cathedral on Edinburgh\u2019s Royal Mile, with the King, Queen Consort and other members of the royal family walking behind. At 3pm there will be a service, attended by the King and family members, during which the crown of Scotland will be placed on the coffin. The Queen will then lie at rest at St Giles\u2019 Cathedral for 24 hours, enabling the people of Scotland to pay their last respects, with vigils mounted by the military. That evening, the King and members of the royal family will mount their own vigil. The following evening the Queen\u2019s coffin will be flown to London, accompanied by the Princess Royal, and arriving at Buckingham Palace at 8pm, the palace said. It will be received by a guard of honour, with the King, Queen Consort and other family members watching, before being carried to the Bow Room, where a rota of chaplains will keep watch. In the early afternoon on Wednesday, the coffin \u2013 adorned with the Imperial State Crown, along with a wreath of flowers \u2013 will be taken by procession to the Palace of Westminster for the lying in state, where it will remain for four days until the morning of the funeral. The King, members of the royal family and senior staff of the Queen and King\u2019s households will walk in silence behind the coffin as it follows a route along Queen\u2019s Gardens, the Mall, Horse Guards Parade and Horse Guards Arch, Whitehall, Parliament Street, Parliament Square and New Palace Yard. Throughout the procession, guns will be fired at Hyde Park by the King\u2019s Troop Royal Horse Artillery and Big Ben will toll. The coffin will be carried in procession from the gun carriage to the catafalque positioned in the centre of Westminster Hall by a bearer party. During the lying in state, a continuous vigil will be mounted around the catafalque from the Household Division, the King\u2019s Body Guards of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms, the King\u2019s Bodyguard for Scotland, the Royal Company of Archers and the King\u2019s Bodyguard the Yeomen of the Guard. The Earl Marshal, the Duke of Norfolk, who has overall responsibility for the funeral, which the Queen herself would have approved, said he and others involved \u201cwill carry out our duty over the coming days with the heaviest of hearts\u201d. \u201cBut also, with the firmest of resolve to ensure a fitting farewell to one of the defining figures of our times; a monarch whom we were truly privileged to have had as the head of state of our country and the realms, and head of the wider Commonwealth,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile His Majesty the King was speaking about his family, I think it applies to us all when he said in his broadcast yesterday that \u2018we owe her the most heartfelt debt\u2019. I think we can, in some way, repay that debt by carrying out her last wishes in delivering Her Majesty the Queen\u2019s funeral.\u201d On his visit to Scotland, the King will have an audience with the first minister, followed by an audience with the presiding officer of the Scottish parliament. The King and the Queen Consort will then attend the Scottish parliament to receive a motion of condolence. On Tuesday 13 September they will travel by air to Belfast and later visit Wales on Friday 16 September. The government confirmed the day of the funeral would work in the same way as other bank holidays, and that there would be no statutory entitlement to time off, with employers able to include it as part of a worker\u2019s leave entitlement. The Department for Business said the announcement did not interfere with existing contractual arrangements between employers and workers, but that they would \u201cexpect employers to respond sensitively to requests from workers who wish to take the day of the funeral off work\u201d. They said that schools would be expected to close."

Today\u2019s puzzle imagines a hypothetical new variant, and asks the solver to think about how it would spread. It was set by Professor Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, one of the UK\u2019s leading epidemiologists. A quick recap for those who have forgotten their Covid maths: R is the reproduction number, meaning the average number of infections caused by any infected person. The riddle of R Suppose a hypothetical new COVID variant emerges, and everyone is initially susceptible to infection (but not necessarily severe disease). During the early stages of this new wave, each infected person exposes the variant to two other people (i.e. R=2). Every person exposed to the virus will get infected unless they have already had it, in which case they are immune. As more people get infected, immunity builds, which gradually reduces R until the epidemic peaks and declines. By the end of the variant wave, 75% of the population have been infected with this variant. On average, how many times was each person in the population exposed to infection during this wave? What is surprising about this result? You might want to take a guess before you try to work it out. A quarter of the population dodge the variant, which is quite a large proportion, even though it seems like quite a fast spreading virus. (England\u2019s reproduction number never reached 2 in 2020 or 2021.) To do the calculation, here\u2019s a handy equation that might be helpful. R = R0 x S R0 (R naught) is the basic reproduction number, meaning the reproduction number when everyone is susceptible. S is a number between 0 and 1 representing the proportion of the population susceptible. I\u2019ll be back at 5pm UK with the answer and a discussion. PLEASE NO SPOILERS. Thanks to Adam Kucharski. He is the author of the fantastic Rules of Contagion: Why Things Spread \u2013 and Why They Stop I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I\u2019m always on the look-out for great puzzles.

These are the same people that have kept the country connected and returned Royal Mail Group to record profit.\u201d Royal Mail workers staged strike action over three days in August and September.

We operate in a competitive market, and our customers have choices. \u201cFurther strikes and resistance to transformation by CWU will only make our financial position worse, and threatens the long-term job security of our postmen and women. \u201cThe CWU has a responsibility to recognise the reality of the situation Royal Mail faces as a business and engage urgently on the changes required. \u201cWe apologise to our customers for the inconvenience the CWU\u2019s continued strike action will cause.

The WHO also estimated that 19.8m deaths were averted in 2021 due to Covid-19 vaccines being administered and that 12bn doses had been given around the world. However, it cautioned that coronavirus still posed an \u201cacute global emergency\u201d and highlighted that during the first eight months of 2022 more than 1 million people died from Covid-19. The director general of the international health body, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told a press conference: \u201cLast week, the number of weekly reported deaths from Covid-19 was the lowest since March 2020. \u201cWe have never been in a better position to end the pandemic \u2013 we are not there yet, but the end is in sight. \u201cA marathon runner does not stop when the finish line comes into view, she runs harder, with all the energy she has left. So must we. \u201cWe can see the finish line, we\u2019re in a winning position. But now is the worst time to stop running. Now is the time to run harder and make sure we cross the line and reap the rewards of all our hard work.\u201d Tedros added: \u201cIf we don\u2019t take this opportunity now, we run the risk of more variants, more deaths, more disruption and more uncertainty. So let\u2019s seize this opportunity.\u201d The WHO has released six policy briefs that outline key actions that all governments must take. The documents include guidance on testing, vaccination, best practice when managing the disease, maintaining infection control measures in health facilities, preventing the spread of misinformation, and community engagement. One of the papers says: \u201cWith access to and appropriate use of existing life-saving tools, Covid-19 can become a manageable disease with significantly reduced morbidity and mortality.\u201d UK officials have confirmed that no plans are being made for people to be able to buy Covid-19 jabs privately. The flu jab is offered annually to people in at-risk groups, with those who are not in these groups able to buy the vaccine privately, should they wish to do so. But the Department of Health and Social Care told the GP magazine Pulse there were no plans to mimic this programme with a Covid vaccine, with supplies only available through the NHS. Covid-19 infections in the UK have dropped to their lowest level for nearly 11 months. A total of 944,700 people in private households are estimated to have had coronavirus in the week to 28 August, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It is the lowest UK-wide total since the week to 2 October 2021, when the number was 942,600. Infections hit 3.8m in early July this year during the spread of the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, but have been on a broadly downward path in recent weeks. In the week ending 2 September, 8,868 deaths were registered in England and Wales, and 314 mentioned \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d, accounting for 3.5% of deaths, according to the ONS data. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 September 2022. An earlier version referred to Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as \u201cGhebreyesus\u201d on second mention. This has been corrected to Tedros, as per Eritrean naming conventions."

            "date": "2022-09-30T11:24:40Z",
            "content": "It is thrilling to witness someone making something difficult look easy. When Clairo released her second album Sling in July 2021, the fear was that its hushed, ornate songs, inspired by the Carpenters and Todd Rundgren, might not have been able to exist outside the introspective conditions of the pandemic. Performing live, it takes roughly 30 seconds for Clairo, real name Claire Cottrill, to put these doubts to bed. Sitting at a piano, her face is barely visible from even a few rows back due to a conflagration of phones and outstretched arms. She slides into Sling\u2019s first song, Bambi, lit in soft-focus pinks and blues, and the crowd responds by roaring along to each twist and turn, their boisterousness clearly suggesting the show is something of a release valve. On stage, Cottrill can go where she pleases, because the news from the floor is that they are with her. Her talented band, which has swelled to include multi-instrumentalists who flit between flutes, clarinets and saxophones, expands and blurs the edges of each song, leading to fabulous moments such as Zinnias\u2019s taut hooks being strung out into a War on Drugs-style jam. There is a notable frisson of excitement when Cottrill\u2019s support technician produces an electric guitar from the wings, foreshadowing a change in focus to material from her indie-rock-leaning debut, Immunity. She uncovers new-found muscularity in Alewife and Bags, the latter of which is prefaced by a somewhat redundant request for everyone to \u201csing as loud as you can\u201d. The noise when the first chorus hits is the kind that loosens fillings, and similar reactions await Flaming Hot Cheetos and Pretty Girl, missives from her time as a YouTube bedroom-pop star. Cottrill closes with a fizzing Sofia, pirouetting from one side of the stage to the other as though she wants to meet the eyes of every person in the front row. A year ago, hers was a hand reaching out to these kids from a yawning void. Now, there are thousands reaching back. Clairo is touring the UK until 4 October."

            "date": "2022-09-24T19:33:49Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden\u2019s recent declaration that the Covid-19 pandemic was over was premature, according to several infectious disease experts, but there was not a consensus among them about whether the remarks will cause a significant change in Americans\u2019 attitude towards the virus and lead to worse public health outcomes. That\u2019s partly because Biden was simply catching up to most of the US population, who see how much lower the case and death counts are than earlier in the pandemic, and as such, have stopped wearing masks in public and now gather regularly indoors, the experts said. Still, an average of more than 400 people die every day due to Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University data. As such, members of the public, including the US president, should continue to treat the virus as a significant threat, the experts say. \u201cHe is reflecting the fact that we\u2019re all acting as if it\u2019s something of the past, but many of us, especially us older folks, know friends who are getting Covid, some of whom are suffering from it and getting really bad cases,\u201d said David Rosner, who studies public health and social history at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly better than it was a year ago and two years ago, but it\u2019s not over.\u201d But Biden offered that assessment during a CBS 60 Minutes episode that aired last Sunday. \u201cThe pandemic is over,\u201d the president said during an interview at the Detroit auto show. \u201cWe still have a problem with Covid. We\u2019re still doing a lot of work on it \u2026 but the pandemic is over. If you notice, no one\u2019s wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape. And so I think it\u2019s changing.\u201d The president was likely responding to the fact that people are no longer wearing masks and are \u201cliving a normal life\u201d, said Dr Ezekiel Emanuel, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania who served in Biden\u2019s Covid-19 advisory team. The upcoming midterm elections may have also played a role in the president\u2019s comments, said Dr Celine Gounder, an infectious disease epidemiologist and editor-at-large at Kaiser Health News. The president was \u201csignaling that the country is not suffering the way it was economically and socially from Covid the way it was\u201d, said Gounder. \u201cTo say that we are coping with the pandemic better than we were, but that there\u2019s still room for improvement would have been one thing. But essentially, this is declaring \u2018mission accomplished\u2019 when you still have thousands of people dying each week.\u201d The current rate would amount to about 150,000 deaths per year, which is equivalent to three bad flu seasons, said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. (Over the last decade, the highest number of deaths during a flu season was about 50,000, according to the CDC.) \u201cThis ended pandemic is still three times as bad as something we would ordinarily consider pretty bad, and I think that\u2019s important, especially because we expect cases to tick up in the fall and the winter,\u201d Hanage said. Rather than declare the pandemic over, Biden should have convened stakeholders to discuss possible solutions and \u201cwith far better discussion, act\u201d, Hanage said. But since Biden made the comments in prime time, it will now be more difficult for his administration to encourage people to get a vaccine booster shot and to get Congress to approve his $22.5bn funding request for Covid-19 vaccines, treatment and testing, Gounder said. \u201cHow is Congress going to take such a funding request seriously? Why would they step up and allocate funding for a pandemic that\u2019s over?\u201d Gounder said. People at greater risk of the virus, such as the elderly and immunocompromised, also need public health officials to say \u201cit\u2019s not illegitimate to be careful,\u201d said Rosner. And Biden\u2019s comments could undermine that. \u201cWhat I worry about is people often feeling pressure to act in ways that they feel uncomfortable with,\u201d said Rosner. Biden\u2019s comments give \u201canother level of kind of social legitimacy to the idea of going into crowds, and it just makes some people feel awkward not not doing that\u201d. That doesn\u2019t mean Biden\u2019s comments will have significant public health consequences. The US population has \u201calready adopted a lot of the behavior changes\u201d such as not wearing masks and dining indoors \u201cthat would come with thinking it\u2019s not really important\u201d, said Emanuel, who still doesn\u2019t dine indoors, largely because he remains very worried about developing long Covid. And not all experts criticized Biden\u2019s comments. \u201cPerhaps the most significant rationale in favor of the transition from pandemic to endemic,\u201d meaning a disease that is contained with predictable rates and spread, \u201cis the growing consensus that Covid-19 will never be eradicated\u201d, Dr Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy at George Washington University, wrote in a Washington Post article with the headline \u201cBiden is right. The pandemic is over.\u201d Despite his disagreement with Biden\u2019s assessment, Hanage thinks the comments could be helpful because they sparked a societal conversation about a \u201clonger-term pandemic management strategy\u201d, which should have started ages ago, he said. Even though the infectious disease experts called for continued vigilance regarding the virus, which is perhaps out of sync with much of the American population, they say there will be a time when they support a declaration that the pandemic is over. \u201cAn appropriate risk threshold should reflect peak weekly deaths, hospitalizations and community prevalence of viral respiratory illnesses during high-severity years,\u201d essentially a bad flu season, Gounder and Emanuel argued in a Journal of the American Medical Association report. Accumulating immunity both from infection and vaccination \u201cwill combine to protect the majority of us from the worst consequences of [Covid] and to limit the size of the surges which we see in future\u201d, Hanage said. \u201cThe trend has been solidly in that direction. The thing is, we are not at a point yet where it\u2019s not still causing an historically large amount of severe illness.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-09-17T13:00:02Z",
            "content": "Record numbers of people started businesses during the pandemic. Now there are record numbers winding up companies, hit by the stress of being the boss and compounded by the looming recession. In 2020-21, 810,316 companies were set up, the highest number on record, and another 753,168 the following year, according to figures from Companies House. But 581,824 companies were dissolved in 2021-22, another record and an annual rise of nearly a third, although some of those companies would have closed down earlier without support during the lockdowns. This year is looking even worse for many small-business owners struggling with the cost of living crisis. A survey of 1,000 small-business owners by Opinium on behalf of Sage, the accounting software firm, found that 38% were on the brink of burnout, with 17% blaming rising energy prices, rocketing inflation and supply chain delays. More than half said they were considering giving up altogether, and 54% said their mental health was affected by worries about their ability to hire and retain staff. Sam Kennett started her digital marketing business, the Social Hand Grenade, at the beginning of the pandemic, after being made redundant. \u201cBecause of the connections I\u2019d made, I had a few clients I could take on board quite quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cThen lockdown really hit and no one was sure when we were going to come out of it. So lots of people cut back on their budgets, as companies do, and I lost most of my clients. I had to build it all back from scratch as we came out of lockdown.\u201d Things began to look up, and Kennett even managed to find time to set up Chat Up Fines, a campaign against online harassment, with her colleague Richard Pryor. \u201cNow, everyone\u2019s worried about this massive recession and they\u2019re all starting to cut back on their budgets again,\u201d Kennett said. Only two clients remain, and she has started applying for jobs to make ends meet. \u201cI get up at 4.30 every morning and start work at about 5am. Half the time I don\u2019t finish until 7 or 8pm, when my eyes are going squiffy and I can\u2019t read any more.\u201d Aoife Fitzmaurice, Sage\u2019s vice-president of workplace futures, said that small businesses had demonstrated incredible resilience throughout the pandemic. \u201cBut the ongoing effects of this, alongside rampant inflation and a recruitment crisis, are taking a toll on business owners,\u201d she added. Louise Doherty was forced to close her tech startup, Yoller, a social networking site, in June. She had raised \u00a31m in investment and launched the site in 140 countries, but the stress of working 19-hour days trying to keep things together left her in tears. \u201cI was obsessed with work, everything else in my life was put to one side,\u201d she said. \u201cI would often start at 6am, work flat out then crawl into bed at 1am and a few hours later start it all again. \u201cThe moment I knew I was experiencing burnout was when I forced myself to take a holiday \u2013 when I came back and saw the mountain of work waiting for me, I burst into tears.\u201d Soaring inflation and the recruitment crisis would force others to quit, Doherty said. \u201cOverwork is incentivised in all kinds of jobs, and in my startup journey I have seen how the mental health of founders is consistently ignored and overlooked,\u201d she said. \u201cThe scale of the trail of damage breaks my heart. For small-business owners often working alone, the danger is that there is often no one there to say, \u2018You are too stressed.\u2019\u201d"

            "content": "A second \u201cbivalent\u201d coronavirus vaccine has been approved by the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for individuals aged 12 and over. The regulator confirmed on Saturday that Pfizer/BioNTech\u2019s vaccine had met its standards of safety, quality and effectiveness and had been approved for the UK autumn booster programme. The vaccine, which targets the original variant of coronavirus and the Omicron variant that emerged at the end of 2021, follows the approval of a similar booster from Moderna in August. The decision to approve the vaccine was based on data from a clinical trial, which showed that a booster dose with the bivalent Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine triggers a strong immune response against Omicron and the original strain. Throughout the trial, safety monitoring of side-effects observed showed they were the same as those seen for the original Pfizer/BioNTech booster dose and were typically mild and self-resolving, with no new serious safety concerns identified. Dr June Raine, the MHRA chief executive, said: \u201cI am pleased to announce that we now have a second approved vaccine for the UK autumn booster programme. The clinical trial of the Pfizer/BioNTech bivalent vaccine showed a strong immune response against the Omicron BA.1 variant as well as the original strain. \u201cBivalent vaccines are helping us to meet the challenge of an ever-evolving virus, to help protect people against Covid-19 variants.\u201d Pfizer\u2019s UK country president, Susan Rienow, said: \u201cWe are delighted with today\u2019s approval by the MHRA of Pfizer/BioNTech\u2019s Omicron BA.1-adapted bivalent Covid-19 vaccine. \u201cWe have been following the science since the beginning of the pandemic and are pleased to be able to provide the National Health Service with another tool in the armoury. \u201cWe have been manufacturing the new vaccine at risk (ahead of approval being granted), and doses will be shipped immediately for use in the autumn booster programme to help protect people in the UK this winter season.\u201d Prof Wei Shen Lim, the chair of Covid-19 immunisation on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said: \u201cIt is very encouraging that more vaccines continue to become available and we now have another option to add to the vaccines already advised for the autumn booster campaign.\u201d Adding that winter was typically the time of greatest threat from respiratory infections, Lim encouraged everyone who was eligible to have their booster vaccine this autumn when it was offered, adding: \u201cThis is our best defence against becoming severely ill from Covid-19.\u201d The health secretary, Steve Barclay, said: \u201cOur vaccination programme has already saved countless lives, but it is absolutely vital we are not complacent as winter approaches. \u201cI have therefore accepted the advice of the independent JCVI to add a Pfizer bivalent vaccine to our autumn Covid booster rollout. \u201cIf eligible, please come forward for a booster jab as soon as you are contacted by the NHS.\u201d"

            "content": "People most at risk of contracting monkeypox will be offered second doses of the vaccine, the UK Health Security Agency has said. Sexual health clinics will continue to prioritise offering first doses to those at highest risk. The UKHSA said some clinics will offer eligible people a second dose, which should provide longer-term protection. Modelling published on Friday suggests vaccinating 25% of the groups most at risk could significantly reduce the risk of transmission. It comes as cases of the infection continue to fall. In early September there were fewer than 15 cases a day on average. Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, deputy director of public health programmes at the UKHSA, said: \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging that we\u2019re continuing to see fewer cases of monkeypox reported in the UK and we are grateful to everyone who has followed advice about potential symptoms, isolated as part of this outbreak or come forward for a vaccination to help limit transmission. \u201cPrioritising vaccine stock where possible for second doses for those at highest risk will help us maximise protection and interrupt transmission. When you are called forward for vaccination, please take up the offer.\u201d Symptoms of the infection include a high temperature, a headache, muscle aches and swollen glands. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation endorsed the UKHSA\u2019s proposal to offer second doses to those at highest risk. There are no current plans to widen the offer of vaccination beyond the existing priority cohorts, but the decision will be kept under review. Those that are eligible for vaccination will be contacted by the NHS. Second doses will be offered from around two or three months after the first dose. As of 20 September, more than 45,000 people have received a dose of the vaccine, including over 40,000 gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men who are at highest risk of exposure. As of 16 September, there were 3,585 confirmed and highly probable cases of monkeypox in the UK."

            "content": "The coronavirus vaccine could soon become an annual shot like the flu vaccination, protecting most people from serious illness throughout the year, White House Covid advisers have announced. At a press briefing on Tuesday, Ashish Jha, the Covid response coordinator, said the transition to a single annual shot was an \u201cimportant milestone\u201d in the pandemic \u2013 which has killed more than a million Americans, leaving at least 250,000 children without a parent or primary caregiver. Moving to annual vaccination depends on the mutation of a virus that has so far delivered numerous curveballs. \u201cIn the absence of a dramatically different variant, we likely are moving towards a path with a vaccination cadence similar to that of the annual influenza vaccine, with annual updated Covid-19 shots matched to the currently circulating strains for most of the population,\u201d said Anthony Fauci, Joe Biden\u2019s chief medical adviser who will step down in December. Even if the virus behaves as experts hope, annual shots are unlikely to provide enough protection for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. Some criticised the transition as a \u201ccapitulation\u201d, arguing that next-generation improved vaccines must first be developed \u2013 given that protection from current shots wanes after four to six months. Tuesday\u2019s announcement came as the administration began rolling out the first updated Covid boosters, which are designed to protect against the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants as well as the original strain of the virus. The administration plans to \u201cramp up\u201d education and outreach over the next few weeks, in the hope people will get the new booster together with flu shots in October, said Xavier Becerra, the health and human services secretary. Only two thirds of the US population is fully vaccinated, including 92% of over 65s who are most vulnerable to serious illness and death from Covid. The updated booster is free to everyone over the age of 12, but this could change soon as Congress has yet to approve new funds to pay for vaccines, tests and personal protective equipment (PPE). Jha said: \u201cCongress is aware that if we don\u2019t continue to fund response, we can easily go backwards \u2026 Should there be another surge, we will not have that [PPE] stockpile.\u201d More than 400 Americans continue to die from Covid every single day."

            "date": "2022-09-07T22:30:17Z",
            "content": "The co-inventor of a vaccine that could eradicate malaria has said he hopes it could be approved by as early as next year after the latest trial results were successful. Professor Adrian Hill, co-creator of the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine, said it was \u201cthe best [malaria] vaccine yet\u201d. He has previously said he believes R21 could help to reduce deaths from the disease by 70% by 2030 and eradicate it by 2040. But speaking as the success of the R21 vaccine tests were revealed, Hill, director of Oxford University\u2019s Jenner Institute, said it would be tragic if Britain cut funding just as scientists were poised to make \u201ca real impact\u201d against malaria. He has implored the new British prime minister Liz Truss not to squander cutting-edge UK innovation by \u201cturning off the taps\u201d on global health funding. Results from testing in Burkina Faso showed that R21 \u2013 already shown to be 77% effective after the initial doses \u2013 maintains its high efficacy after a single booster jab. Researchers hope that the vaccine could be approved by the World Health Organization next year, assuming a larger ongoing trial throws up no unexpected problems. But Hill also cautioned that getting the vaccine into the arms of tens of millions of African children who most need it would be a challenge without funding. The body that provides more than half of all financing for the world\u2019s malaria programmes, the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, has warned that unless it receives significantly more money from leading donor countries such as the UK at its pledging conference this month, it will not be able to get the fight against those diseases back on track after the Covid pandemic. The UK has not yet said what it will pledge in New York, but the fund is thought to have asked for about \u00a31.8bn. As foreign secretary, Truss outlined a strategy for overseas aid marked by an overall spending reduction and a retreat from the funding of multilateral organisations like the Global Fund. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important that the Global Fund is properly refunded. What they do is absolutely amazing,\u201d said Hill. \u201cI hope the new prime minister will be very keen to recognise the importance of doing what the UK [the fund\u2019s third-biggest donor] has done so well in the past.\u201d Another British-made malaria vaccine with more modest efficacy levels, GSK\u2019s RTS,S, approved by the WHO last year, is poised to be more widely deployed from next year. \u201cThe two leading vaccines in the world for malaria are [from] a UK-headquartered company and a UK university,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThe UK is good at this stuff \u2026 It would be tragic if suddenly, as new tools become available, and we can have a real impact \u2013 and that\u2019s not hard to see now by getting these [vaccines] out there \u2013 if we were to just we turn off the taps on funding. And there is a risk of that.\u201d Gareth Jenkins, director of advocacy at Malaria No More UK, echoed Hill\u2019s appeal, saying that \u201cfor new British inventions to achieve their potential, British leadership must continue\u201d, starting at the Global Fund conference, to be hosted by the US president, Joe Biden. \u201cThis will be the new PM\u2019s first foreign policy test \u2013 for the sake of millions of children\u2019s lives, global health security and British relations with its closest ally, it\u2019s a test she cannot fail,\u201d he added. Scientists have been trying to find a good vaccine against malaria for about a century, with the first clinical trial taking place in the 1940s. The disease kills hundreds of thousands of people every year, mostly children under five in sub-Saharan Africa. R21, the first malaria vaccine to meet a WHO efficacy target of 75%, is licensed to the Serum Institute of India. It is ready to manufacture at least 200m doses annually from next year if the jab is given the green light after results from the wider trial, expected later this year. Prof Halidou Tinto, regional director of the health sciences research institute (IRSS) in Nanoro, and the Burkina Faso trial principal investigator, said that while production was not expected to be an issue, the big challenge for poor African countries was how to fund the vaccine\u2019s rollout. \u201cThis may be \u2026 the issue that could delay the deployment,\u201d he said. The trial in Burkina Faso involved more than 400 children aged between five and 17 months getting three doses of the vaccine in 2019, followed by a single booster shot 12 months later, largely before the peak of the malaria season. The results, published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, show that in those children given a booster shot with a higher dose of an immunity-boosting adjuvant the vaccine proved 80% effective. That figure fell to 70% in those who were given a booster with a lower dose of the adjuvant. No serious side-effects were noted, researchers said. A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: \u201cAs the third largest donor to the Global Fund the UK has invested \u00a34.1bn to date to fight Aids, tuberculosis, and malaria around the world. We will continue to support its vitally important work.\u201d"

NHS Digital data published on Thursday showed vaccine coverage fell in 13 out of the 14 routine programmes for children up to five years old in England in 2021-22, compared with the year before. \u201cToday\u2019s publication of the childhood vaccination statistics in England is extremely worrying,\u201d said Dr Doug Brown, the chief executive of the British Society for Immunology. \u201cImmediate action to reverse this alarming multi-year downward trend and protect our communities from preventable diseases is urgently needed.\u201d Health officials said disruption caused by the pandemic was likely to have led to a drop in vaccination rates. UKHSA said it was important that child vaccine coverage increased as soon as possible to the 95% level recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to prevent the spread of serious and deadly diseases. The NHS Digital report found 89.2% of children at 24 months had completed their first dose of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, a drop from 90.3% in 2020-21. In 2021-22, 85.7% of children had received their second dose of MMR vaccine by their fifth birthday, falling from 86.6% in the previous year. Helen Bedford, a professor of child public health at UCL\u2019s Institute of Child Health, said the country was now facing \u201cthe concerning double whammy of many children being unprotected and the inevitability of disease rates increasing\u201d. \u201cIn this situation, as night follows day, significant outbreaks of disease are likely. Measles disease is a particular concern as it is so highly infectious that any small decline in vaccine uptake results in outbreaks. \u201cFortunately, it is never too late to be vaccinated. Vaccination works, is highly effective and has an excellent safety record. No child needs to face the potentially serious consequences of a vaccine preventable disease.\u201d Figures also showed that coverage for the six-in-one/five-in-one vaccine \u2013 which protects against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b and hepatitis B \u2013 decreased among children aged 12 months, 24 months and five years. Reportedly, 91.8% of children had completed their primary course of three doses of the six-in-one at 12 months in 2021-22, down from 92% in 2020-21. Dr Vanessa Saliba, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA, said: \u201cMeasles is highly contagious and can be dangerous, and it is extremely worrying that we are seeing levels of uptake of the MMR vaccine falling among young children. It is also vitally important that children get their polio vaccinations to help prevent the risk of paralysis. \u201cI would urge parents to check that all children are up to date with their vaccines, and if not to get them booked in as soon as possible to make sure they have maximum protection against what can be terrible diseases.\u201d Health officials sounded the alarm earlier this year over the rising number of polio samples found in sewage in London. It sparked a drive to vaccinate almost a million children aged one to nine across the capital against the disease, which can cause paralysis in rare cases and can be life-threatening. The UKHSA said that to date no clinical cases of polio have been identified, but health services have been urged to remain vigilant to any cases of paralysis in children."

            "content": "Popping into a room on your lunch break to have a good scream may seem like a helpful way to let off steam, but experts say there is little evidence the approach offers long-term benefits for mental health. Primal scream therapy (PST) was created by psychologist Arthur Janov in the late 1960s. It is based on the idea that repressed childhood traumas are at the root of neurosis, and that screaming can help to release and resolve the pain. With a bestselling book and high-profile patients, including John Lennon and Yoko Ono, the approach became popular in the 1970s. However modern experts say the therapy has little evidence to support its use. Prof Sascha Fr\u00fchholz of the department of psychology at the University of Zurich \u2013 whose research includes the cognitive and neural mechanisms of voice production and emotional processing \u2013 is one of them. \u201cIn my opinion, there is no scientific evidence that primal scream therapy has any positive effects in the treatment of mental and psychological disorders. Given that modern psychotherapy is an evidence-based treatment approach, no serious psychotherapy school uses any elements of primal scream therapy today,\u201d he said. \u201cPST also rests on the, partly wrong, assumption that traumatic early life events are stored as mental and bodily complexes \u2013 like a prison \u2013 that can only be resolved by \u2018busting out\u2019 during screaming,\u201d Fr\u00fchholz added. \u201cThere is no scientific evidence for this.\u201d Fr\u00fchholz also noted that primal scream therapy predominatly uses screams of anger \u2013 which could be counterproductive. \u201cWe know that such consistent expressions of anger as a therapeutic method have no or even negative effects on the therapeutic outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cOur own research shows that positive screams \u2013 joy and pleasure \u2013 are much more relevant for humans, and they induce social bonding as a positive effect.\u201d Dr Rebecca Semmens-Wheeler, senior lecturer in psychology at Birmingham City University, said she is also doubtful about the long-term benefits of screaming for mental health, although she said little research has been done. \u201cThe current state of things is that we don\u2019t really know \u2013 but based on what we do know, is not that likely to be helpful,\u201d she said. Among her concerns were that screaming, or hearing others scream, could activate the body\u2019s \u201cfight or flight\u201d mechanism, boosting levels of adrenaline and cortisol. \u201c[That] is kind of the opposite with what you\u2019re doing with things like meditation or yoga, which is usually activating the parasympathetic nervous system that helps you to slow down, take stock, let the prefrontal cortex get some glucose again \u2026 and helps us to make better decisions,\u201d she said. Semmens-Wheeler added that if screaming becomes a habit it could also get in the way of taking other action that could be more helpful when it comes to tackling emotions. But, she noted, context is important, and it is possible screaming might help if it is undertaken in groups and allows people to bond. \u201cI\u2019m quite sceptical about potential benefits, especially in the long term. [But] if you want to do it for a laugh, why not?\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll feel good for a few minutes. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s got any potential as a lasting and ongoing treatment. I think it\u2019s more of a novelty.\u201d"

            "content": "Like Dr Sanah Ahsan (I\u2019m a psychologist \u2013 and I believe we\u2019ve been told devastating lies about mental health, 6 September), I too work as a clinical psychologist and I see every day the impact of inequality, social injustice and abuse of power on individuals\u2019 mental health (and by association, the mental health of their children, partners, colleagues and acquaintances). For too long, the dominant narrative locates problems in individuals, medicalises them and leaves people feeling helpless, ill and stigmatised. It is as though they are defective, and not positive and resilient enough. This lie affects people from all walks of life, but most severely those who are already disfranchised through poverty and inequality. A huge privilege of my job is hearing people\u2019s rich life stories. Depression, anxiety and psychosis all make sense when you take time to understand the context in which they arose. There is nothing pathological about the anxiety and mistrust felt by a young mother who is about to be made homeless. Or depression and shame in a gay man who has endured discrimination for decades. As the British psychiatrist RD Laing reportedly once said: \u201cInsanity [is] a perfectly rational adjustment to an insane world.\u201d Let\u2019s stop talking about the mental health crisis and start talking about the corrupt and cruel politics in the UK right now. Let\u2019s stop despairing, and see hope in the huge numbers of people in distress. Let\u2019s get angry with the status quo and seek to change it. Abbie Pearce Bristol \u2022 Dr Sanah Ahsan\u2019s article is an excellent example of how discourse is used to locate problems in individuals rather than systems. One example is described by Lisa Marin Wexler in work with the I\u00f1upiat community in Alaska. Her aim is to reduce the incidence of young male suicide in the community. Her successful \u201ctreatment\u201d is not more therapy, but community-based learning circles to challenge the presentation of the suicide statistics as examples of community dysfunction that had led to despondency and self-blame. Wexler changed the conversation by fostering community action, resilience and resistance, and reconceptualising colonisation as something that continues in many forms today, so that the I\u00f1upiat can withstand and resist oppressive structures. In this way, local community practices aimed at decolonisation and prevention have become an effective youth suicide prevention strategy. The lesson is that the more we can help people understand oppression, the more they connect and seek to act together to oppose it, and the more likely they will improve their resilience. Anna Wright Woking, Surrey \u2022 I\u2019ve recently qualified as a counsellor and have been volunteering at a charity. I also work full-time in an office for a large bank. Dr Sanah Ahsan\u2019s article has resonated for a number of reasons. First, many clients attend therapy with issues that require a change in circumstances to really fix them. No amount of therapy can make up for not being watered, to use Dr Ahsan\u2019s analogy. Second, in the bank the emphasis is always on resilience, rather than looking at why employees feel they are not able to cope. Employees are told to go to the employee assistance programme when they are struggling with their mental health, but the working environment is not considered or reviewed. This suggests that while mental health is talked about more, stigma remains, and the desire for an easy fix is a major barrier to improvement. Name and address supplied \u2022 I work with people who self-harm and often want to die. I strongly identify with Dr Sanah Ahsan\u2019s article around how we label individuals as ill or flawed rather than seeing an adaptation to extreme environmental pressures. Everyone I work with has experienced traumatic neglect, abandonment and abuse from those who should have protected them. We tell the survivors of a lifetime of adversity that their personalities are disordered. We provide help that doesn\u2019t match National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, then blame them further when they fail to benefit. In his book Cracked: Why Psychiatry Is Doing More Harm Than Good, James Davies writes of how institutions adapt to serve the ideology of the time rather than the citizens of the country. As the gap between rich and poor widens, as the suicide rate for children grows, it is more convenient to blame an underclass that cannot cope rather than a society that is killing us. Name and address supplied \u2022 In my 30-year experience with adults and children suffering mental health problems, I\u2019ve seen psychiatrists\u2019 diagnostic manuals mushroom in size and complexity. They keep adding more labels for people\u2019s conditions alongside research identifying chemical imbalances in the brain. The problem is one of cause and effect. Are chemical imbalances an effect of mental illness or a cause? New research is contesting the chemical origin of mental illness. Dr Sanah Ahsan highlights the link between poverty and mental illness, underlining research revealing the disproportionate numbers in the poorest households who suffer. As the cost of living crisis gets worse, unemployment rises, and cuts to mental health services go deeper, there will soon be a mental health epidemic hitting the most vulnerable the hardest. The last thing we need is a government ideologically set against state intervention to help them.

            "content": "People seeking cosmetic injections such as botox or filler treatments should undergo compulsory mental health screening in order to stop vulnerable patients worsening pre-existing psychological conditions and increasing their risk of self harm, experts say. Calls for clinicians to be trained to conduct psychological assessments come amid demands for greater regulation of the cosmetic injectables industry after Guardian Australia reported serious side-effects following an a common procedure to dissolve facial filler. Dr Toni Pikoos, a clinical psychologist who specialises in body image and related disorders, said injectables were often ignored when regulators considered the psychological risks of cosmetic treatments but their relatively low cost \u201ccan make them an even more dangerous space than surgery\u201d. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cThey\u2019re seen as being these quick and easy low-risk treatments\u2026 [but] the research tells us that body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and other mental health issues are much higher prevalence in people seeking non-surgical cosmetic procedures,\u201d Pikoos said. BDD is a mental illness characterised by constant worrying about a perceived or slight defect in one\u2019s looks. While only up to 3% of the general population are thought to experience BDD, that number jumps to 15-20% of people seeking cosmetic treatments including fillers and anti-wrinkle injections, Pikoos said. According to Pikoos, when people with BDD seek out treatments most often they do not experience any psychological benefit and, in many cases, it makes them feel worse. \u201cIt makes them more and more fixated on their appearance; it creates more distress,\u201d she said. There is no required psychological training for many of the people allowed under current regulations to administer injectables, including nurse practitioners, nor is there any mandate to screen patients before they are treated, unlike cosmetic surgery. Surgeons, who have basic psychological training as part of their medical degrees, are required to discuss and assess the reasons a patient gives for wanting cosmetic surgery and should refer them to a psychologist if they have concerns. There is also a cooling off period of a number of days between the patient giving informed consent and the surgical procedure. Last year a UK parliamentary inquiry recommended the government develop mandatory psychological pre-screening tests to cover a range of conditions before any non-surgical cosmetic treatment. Dr Gemma Sharp, a body image research lead at Monash University and clinical psychologist, said mental health screening would improve satisfaction levels and improve patient outcomes. \u201c[Psychologists] are able to predict who will likely most benefit and be satisfied from it and who might be trying to treat an underlying mental health condition through injectables, which we know won\u2019t work,\u201d she said. She said the issue was particularly bad for people with BDD who could feel worse after treatments, harm themselves or take legal action against the practitioner who treated them. Sharp explained that when people were disappointed with the outcome, which a psychologist or someone with training could have predicted, the patient may end up coming back again and again for further treatments \u201cin the hope that it will fix their psychological concerns\u201d. \u201cI get referrals because I\u2019m known in this space, but I know that I\u2019m seeing the tip of the iceberg here,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cAny cosmetic procedure [should be] in the hands of health professionals who are trained, and also I believe that there should be a mental health professional, like a psychologist attached to every practice.\u201d Injectable treatments were excluded from the scathing recently released independent review into cosmetic surgery in Australia, commissioned by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) late last year. Pikoos said this was a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d and was concerned people would see that as a stamp of approval from the regulator on a highly unregulated industry. \u201cMental health screening needs to be mandatory for all procedures. I\u2019ve seen lots of clients who have had really bad experiences with anti-wrinkle injections and fillers, who were really vulnerable at the time that they went to go to go to a clinic. They\u2019re so vulnerable to just getting anything that\u2019s recommended to them,\u201d Pikoos said. A spokesperson for Ahpra and the National Boards said it was up to practitioners to consider the appropriateness of any treatment they are recommending to a patient. \u201cPsychological screening requirements may be considered as we review, consult on and update the guidelines,\u201d the spokesperson said. Cosmetic injections require a valid prescription from an authorised prescriber such as a doctor, dentist or nurse practitioner."

            "content": "Police are investigating allegations that vulnerable patients were bullied, humiliated and verbally abused by staff at one of the UK\u2019s biggest NHS mental health hospitals. Staff were apparently filmed mocking, slapping and pinching patients at the Edenfield centre near Manchester during an undercover investigation by BBC Panorama. The programme Undercover Hospital: Patients at Risk, due to air on Wednesday night, reported that vulnerable adults were inappropriately restrained and held in small seclusion units, designed for short-term isolation, for weeks or months with only brief breaks. Dr Cleo Van Velsen, a consultant psychiatrist, said the undercover filming showed a \u201ctoxic culture\u201d among staff of \u201ccorruption, perversion, aggression, hostility, lack of boundaries\u201d. Greater Manchester police (GMP) said it had launched an investigation and was reviewing the Panorama footage to identify any offenders. It was reported that the allegations involve 40 patients and 25 staff, more than a dozen of whom have been suspended. Greater Manchester mental health NHS foundation trust, which runs the Edenfield centre, said it was taking the allegations \u201cvery seriously\u201d and had taken \u201cimmediate actions to protect patient safety\u201d. Michaela Kerr, the head of GMP\u2019s public protection department, said: \u201cIt goes without saying that these allegations are concerning. Since they were brought to our attention, we have been working with partner agencies to ensure the safeguarding of vulnerable individuals. \u201cWe\u2019ve also obtained the information required to open criminal investigations, and inquiries are ongoing to ensure all offences are recorded and those involved identified.\u201d Staff were filmed using demeaning language when talking to patients about their bodies. This was often passed off as a joke, but patients said they felt bullied and dehumanised. A 22-year-old patient, who had in the past stopped eating and drinking because she believed she was overweight, said staff had called her \u201cfat\u201d before claiming they had been joking. Footage shows a nurse apparently refusing to check on her after she had tried to kill herself, while staff members laughed and joked: \u201c[She\u2019s] only crying\u201d, and \u201cif she slit her throat you\u2019d know it\u201d because \u201cshe\u2019d tell everybody about it\u201d. A female support worker was filmed humiliating another patient for having to be supervised by her while going to the toilet. On another occasion the patient sat on the lap of the same support worker, who said: \u201cIf you fart I will actually kill you.\u201d The support worker then pulled aside the patient\u2019s clothing and repeatedly slapped her bare skin. A senior nurse, who was among those watching, laughed and jeered as the patient was slapped. Dr Van Velsen, a consultant psychiatrist, said the members of staff acted \u201clike a gang, not a group of healthcare professionals\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s against any policy I\u2019ve ever seen about restraint in doing this,\u201d she said. The trust said: \u201cWe are working closely with local and national partners including NHS England, the Care Quality Commission and Greater Manchester police to ensure the safety of these services. We will cooperate fully with all investigations. \u201cWe owe it to our patients, their families and carers, the public and our staff that these allegations are fully investigated to ensure we provide the best care, every day, for all the communities we serve.\u201d"

            "content": "Virginia Richards has always been proactive about her mental health. But the pandemic \u2013 and years of juggling paid work and responsibilities at home \u2013 have taken their toll. In 2021 she suffered a relapse of her anxiety, depression and complex post-traumatic stress disorder, which she had developed years earlier after being glassed in the face at work. She was on a waiting list for six months before getting in to see a psychiatrist. Richards, a 37-year-old mother of two daughters, is now seven months pregnant with her third child. \u201cI\u2019ve had to go back on medication for depression and anxiety while I am pregnant,\u201d she says. The Melbourne woman previously worked in the hospitality industry until 2018. For seven years she worked night shifts, even with a newborn and toddler at home. \u201cI would be with them during the day because we couldn\u2019t send them to childcare, because it was too expensive. And then I would work at night, so I would average about four hours\u2019 sleep,\u201d she recalls. She and her now ex-husband were \u201cships in the night\u201d. \u201cMy entire childhood, I was raised to believe that I was an equal. At about 30, it hit me: there is nothing equal about what I\u2019m experiencing.\u201d Now, although she has remarried a \u201cwonderful husband\u201d, sharing the domestic burden is a work in progress. \u201cI go to work every day. I don\u2019t want to go to the supermarket at five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, come home and cook dinner for two hours after I\u2019ve already gotten up at seven o\u2019clock with the kids to get them ready for school,\u201d Richards says. \u201cI do all the finances. I make all the decisions. I do all the planning. \u201cI always go to work. I always finish my job. I always meet my goals. But I\u2019ve never found it as hard as I have with this relapse.\u201d For months she reached out for help with her mental health but she was knocked back, leaving her frustrated and desperate. \u201cI\u2019d never experienced that prior to the pandemic.\u201d Unpaid labour still falls to women Psychological distress and mental illness among women has reached dire levels in Australia, with problems only worsened by the pandemic. One in four Australian women reported an anxiety, depression or substance abuse disorder in 2020-21, compared with 18% of males. Increasingly, research suggests that the double burden of paid work and unpaid domestic labour may be raising the risk of poorer mental health in women. Experts and policymakers say that redressing the issue requires sweeping and long overdue structural and organisational changes to improve gender equity. The most recent Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey, released in December, noted that in the year prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, women did 21 hours more unpaid work than men each week, and experienced higher levels of psychological distress. A paper published in the Lancet Public Health journal this month, which reviewed 19 studies involving more than 70,000 participants in 35 countries, found that for employed adults unpaid labour was negatively associated with women\u2019s mental health. \u201cWomen carry a disproportionate allocation of unpaid work and a large proportion of that is unpaid care,\u201d says Dr Tania King, a social epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne and a co-author of the review. King says the types of unpaid labour done by men and women also appear to be different, with more men doing \u201cless time-pressured activities, such as gardening\u201d. \u201cWomen are more likely to carry out more time-pressured tasks like meal preparation, feeding children.\u201d There are two theories underlying the link between inequality in unpaid labour and higher rates of mental ill health in women. One is role strain, the idea that \u201ccombining paid work and a high unpaid workload increases role conflict and role overload,\u201d King says. \u201cThis can trigger some stress-related pathways.\u201d The other is the time scarcity theory, in which a sense of time pressure and particularly a lack of free time negatively affects wellbeing. \u201cOver the past 50 years there\u2019s been an increase in the proportion of women entering the paid labour force,\u201d King says. Although women are taking on more paid hours of work, the vast proportion of unpaid labour in the household is still falling to them. Covid and the \u2018missing middle\u2019 The relentless stressors of the Covid-19 pandemic and the rise in care responsibilities was particularly taxing on parents. \u201cThe transition to remote and hybrid learning meant mothers, not fathers, reduced their workloads to meet these newfound demands,\u201d the University of Melbourne\u2019s Prof Leah Ruppanner has noted. In households with children, fathers increased their housework at the start of the pandemic and maintained this for at least several months, Ruppaner\u2019s research found. But because women also upped their contributions, gender gaps in housework persisted. Barbara Pocock, a Greens senator for South Australia and the chair of the Senate select committee on work and care, describes the gendered norms in Australian society as \u201cextraordinarily tenacious\u201d. Prior to her election in May, Pocock was an academic who researched work, employment and inequality. \u201cYoung men and young women often start out quite optimistic about how they will share [domestic work],\u201d she says. \u201cBut the data tells us that \u2026 just getting married results in quite a significant increase in unpaid labour for women. The arrival of children drives that up yet again.\u201d Pocock says when the pandemic hit there was a \u201cbig kick up\u201d in unpaid domestic labour, but the ratio of contributions of women and men stayed the same. \u201cIt exactly reproduced the ratio that\u2019s been there for decades around domestic work.\u201d Prof Jayashri Kulkarni, the director of the Monash Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre, says the events of Covid-19 \u201creally underline the need for women\u2019s mental health to be recognised as a separate and under-resourced area\u201d. She co-authored research that found the pandemic affected women\u2019s mental health more profoundly than men. \u201cWomen are more prone to stressors in their environment,\u201d Kulkarni says. \u201cThey\u2019re more likely to be the victims of violence, they have the stress of inequities with wages, have more poverty. There are more stressors in terms of caring for not just self, but for the next generation and the older generation as well.\u201d Richards\u2019 experience is an example of what Kulkarni terms \u201cthe missing middle\u201d \u2013 a growing group of predominantly women who need treatment but are not considered severe enough to be admitted to public mental health hospital beds. \u201cAt the same time, they\u2019re too sick to be able to cope.\u201d The mental health system is inadequately serving the needs of this group, Kulkarni says. \u201cThere is an across-the-board shortage of space on psychologists\u2019 and psychiatrists\u2019 waiting lists.\u201d Structural changes needed In addition to improved mental health services, experts say structural changes are required to improve gender equality at work and at home. King says men are participating in unpaid labour such as childcare and housework to \u201ca much greater extent than previous generations, but it\u2019s still not the same as women\u201d. \u201cWe really need to have accessible, quality childcare that is affordable. Ideally, it\u2019s free,\u201d King says, citing other initiatives such as parental leave with a non-transferable component for fathers, and improved working flexibility for men. Pocock agrees: \u201cThe fact that so many Australian men work long hours \u2026 contributes to their low rates of participation in unpaid domestic work.\u201d The Senate select committee she chairs is holding an inquiry into the impact of work and care responsibilities on wellbeing, with submissions closing on 22 September. Pocock expects the inquiry will hear about issues such as childcare, the Coalition\u2019s scrapping of the \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d portion of paid parental leave, and the effects of balancing a job with different kinds of care and domestic labour. After her first two pregnancies, Richards felt pressured to return to work when both of her daughters were three months old. \u201cMy ex-husband didn\u2019t take a day off when I went into labour \u2013 he came and watched the birth and then went back to work.\u201d When the next baby arrives, Richards\u2019 partner is planning to take seven weeks of parental leave. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different scenario,\u201d she says. \u2022 In Australia, support is available at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636, Lifeline on 13 11 14, and at MensLine on 1300 789 978.

            "content": "The weather was hot but the economy was lukewarm. As temperatures in the UK rose above 40 degrees centigrade for the first time, growth in July remained tepid. To be sure, the economy expanded, but some boost to activity was expected after the hit to growth in June caused by the double bank holiday to celebrate the late Queen\u2019s platinum jubilee. Given that gross domestic product \u2013 the official gauge of how big the economy is \u2013 contracted by 0.6% in June, the 0.2% bounceback in July was unimpressive, particularly given the boost provided by the Euro 2022 football tournament and the Commonwealth Games. Over the three months to July, a better guide to the trend than one month\u2019s figures taken in isolation, the economy moved sideways, showing zero growth. The reason the post-lockdown recovery has petered out is simple: consumers are seeing their spending power reduced by rising inflation. According to the Office for National Statistics, while the economy as a whole is just over 1% bigger than it was pre-Covid 19 in early 2020, the output of consumer-facing services is 4.3% lower. There was also some anecdotal evidence of people using less energy in July \u2013 in part due to the heatwave but also because higher prices affected demand for electricity and gas. The economy shrank in the second quarter of 2022 and the weak start to the third quarter in July means a technical recession \u2013 defined as two consecutive three-month periods of falling output \u2013 is a distinct possibility. Activity in September will be affected by the extra bank holiday on the day of the Queen\u2019s funeral next week. Last week\u2019s decision by the government to cap energy bills at an average of \u00a32,500 has reduced the risk of economic meltdown over the winter, but the outlook remains poor. Manufacturing and construction contracted in July, and surveys suggest business confidence is low. Capping energy bills means inflation will peak at a lower level than previously feared, but prices are still going to be rising faster than wages for some time to come. The Treasury and the Bank of England will be relieved if by next spring the economy is no smaller than it is now."

            "date": "2022-09-27T17:23:44Z",
            "content": "A publicly owned energy company, insulation for every British home, carbon-free power by the end of the decade \u2013 the Labour conference showed Keir Starmer putting a low-carbon future firmly at the centre of his economic plans. Crucially, however, these announcements were not just green in intent \u2013 they are mainly aimed at tackling the soaring cost of living, and at \u201clevelling up\u201d the UK\u2019s regions. With the world in the grip of a gas crisis while renewable energy has tumbled in price, the real costs of fossil fuel addiction are increasingly clear, and a low-carbon energy system looks the economic choice. The Labour leader\u2019s proposals would create a new Great British Energy company to kickstart investment in renewable power generation by providing funds for new projects and helping to remove some of the existing barriers to wind and solar deployment. It would not involve nationalising any existing energy company, however, as some in the party have called for. Labour\u2019s plans also include: A \u00a360bn plan to insulate 19 million UK homes over the next decade, permanently saving about \u00a31,000 per household on energy bills, set out by Ed Miliband. A low-carbon electricity sector by 2030. Boosting fledgling \u201cgreen\u201d hydrogen technology, through the national wealth fund set out by the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves. Electric vehicle development, also through the national wealth fund. Adopting green steel technology, to reduce carbon emissions and end reliance on fossil fuels. Moves to decarbonise the UK\u2019s heavy industry. Plaudits came from both unions and business. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, called the new energy company \u201ca big, bold move that will cut bills and secure our energy future. This new national energy champion can provide high-quality jobs to every corner of the UK. And it\u2019s about time the public shared in the profits of British energy.\u201d Brian McBride, president of the CBI employers\u2019 organisation, called for more detail on the plans for energy market reform, but welcomed the move: \u201cWhere Great British Energy could add value is by channelling catalytic public investment to spur innovation, and accelerating the delivery of renewable projects.\u201d Some of the proposals are still promises rather than fully fledged plans, pointed out Polly Billington, chief executive of the UK100 group of local government leaders. \u201cThe cheapest energy is the energy we don\u2019t use, but this has been overlooked time and again,\u201d she said. \u201cTo avoid another winter like this one, where millions are expected to fall into fuel poverty, we need an energy efficiency revolution. If the Labour party is to deliver on its energy promises, it\u2019s time to end the wait and insulate.\u201d Labour\u2019s targets closely match the advice given by energy economists: go for energy efficiency as a top priority; ramp up renewable energy generation; windfall taxes on energy companies; offer people alternatives to petrol-guzzling cars; and invest in up-and-coming technologies such as hydrogen and green industry. Insulation is the most urgent. One in every three pounds that the average household in the UK spends on heating is wasted, as Britons live in the draughtiest, leakiest housing stock in western Europe. Insulation rates fell sharply in the early years of the coalition government, and never recovered. A single attempt under Boris Johnson to revive home insulation, the green homes grant, was botched in administration and swiftly abandoned, and for the last 18 months \u2013 including the biggest energy crisis for decades \u2013 there has been no nationwide insulation scheme for average households. Ending fossil fuels also means ending fossil fuel jobs, and those workers need a \u201cjust transition\u201d to green jobs, added Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK. \u201cTo be truly effective, and deliver on Labour\u2019s commitment to a fair climate transition, a publicly owned energy agency would need to give fossil fuel workers smooth routes into the clean energy sector,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now we already know that more renewable jobs must go to local workers, with fair contracts and safe working conditions, and there must be proper training and reskilling for workers moving across from the oil and gas industry.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-09-27T13:30:11Z",
            "content": "Kwasi Kwarteng has insisted in a meeting with Britain\u2019s top City bosses on Tuesday that the government\u2019s economic strategy \u201cwill work\u201d, despite a market meltdown that sent sterling to record lows a day earlier. The chancellor issued the assurances during a planned meeting with asset managers, pension funds and insurers from big firms, including Aviva, Legal and General, Royal London, BlackRock, Fidelity and JP Morgan. While the meeting was meant to drum up excitement for further deregulation, Kwarteng also took the opportunity to try to calm top investors after government bonds yields surged and the pound plunged in reaction to the his tax-cutting mini-budget unveiled on Friday. \u201cWe are confident in our long-term strategy to drive economic growth through tax cuts and supply-side reform,\u201d Kwarteng told bosses, according to a Treasury readout of the meeting. \u201cI\u2019m confident that with our growth plan and the upcoming medium-term fiscal plan \u2013 with close cooperation with the Bank [of England] \u2013 our approach will work.\u201d The meeting comes days after the chancellor unveiled sweeping tax cuts in a City-friendly mini-budget, that involved scrapping the EU banker bonus cap and the top 45% rate of income tax, and cutting stamp duty to prop up the housing market. He also trailed \u201can ambitious package of regulatory reforms\u201d to be unveiled this autumn. However, the announcement sent the pound and government bonds plunging, as the scale of the tax cuts, which overwhelmingly benefit the better-off, shocked markets and prompted worries about how they would be paid for. The chancellor assured City bosses and investors on Tuesday that the Treasury was \u201cworking closely together\u201d with the Bank of England \u2013 which has been under pressure from the government to control inflation linked to surging energy costs related to the war in Ukraine. Kwarteng, who said last week he would hold bi-weekly meetings with Bailey, was meeting with the governor \u201cevery day now\u201d. Both the chancellor and the financial secretary, Andrew Griffiths, are said to have reiterated support for the independence of financial regulators. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep these institutions as they are but make them more effective and more nimble,\u201d Kwarteng said. However, that government is still planning to give itself intervention powers through the financial services and markets bill, which would allow it to \u201camend or revoke\u201d regulations where there are matters of significant public interest\u201d Unusually, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s fiscal watchdog, was not asked to provide forecasts for how the package would affect government borrowing and economic growth in coming years. Kwarteng has requested that the OBR sets out a full forecast alongside the medium-term fiscal plan, on 23 November. Kwarteng told City bosses that the government was \u201ccommitted to fiscal discipline and would not reopen the spending review. \u201cWe have a medium term fiscal plan coming on 23 November, alongside an OBR forecast. That will be a credible plan to get debt to GDP falling,\u201d he said. But markets remain in turmoil. Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said: \u201cWhen it comes to the last 24 hours, UK assets have remained at the eye of the storm as the negative reaction to the government\u2019s mini-budget on Friday continued. The country\u2019s government bonds were completely routed for a second day.\u201d Markets are braced for more volatility. The pound hit an all-time low of about $1.035 on Monday morning and is now trading at about $1.08, down 7% this month but up on the day on Tuesday. UK government borrowing costs are on course for their biggest monthly rise on record, going back to the 1950s, as international faith in Britain is battered by Kwarteng\u2019s borrowing binge to fund tax cuts. The yield on the 10-year benchmark gilt, or government bond, has jumped to 4.1%, from 3.1% before the mini-budget. Yields (the return on a bond) move up when prices go down. Mortgage rates have also increased and nearly 300 mortgage deals have been pulled, with economists predicting interest rates could rise to 6% by next summer. Banking and insurance stocks have also taken a hammering."

            "date": "2022-09-23T11:30:44Z",
            "content": "A struggling economy. An unpopular Conservative government. A dramatic change of course. Britain has been here before. Just like Reginald Maudling in the early 1960s and Tony Barber in the early 1970s, Kwasi Kwarteng has gone for broke, with a massive package of tax cuts designed to put Britain on a higher growth path. The chancellor will be crossing his fingers that his experiment has a happier ending than those of his predecessors, neither of which ended well. It is one huge gamble on supply-side reforms boosting enterprise, tax cuts paying for themselves, and the financial markets remaining onside. The initial reaction from the City was far from reassuring. As was only too predictable, sterling took a thumping on the currency markets. City currency traders might well be among the big beneficiaries of Kwarteng\u2019s tax cuts but that didn\u2019t stop them selling the pound down through the $1.10 level against the US dollar. Parity against the US currency is not that far away. No question, this was a big package, a full-scale budget in all but name. Kwarteng delivered on all the tax pledges made by Liz Truss during her leadership bid \u2013 and more. The 45% rate of income tax for the highest earners has been scrapped; a reduction in the basic rate from 20% to 19% pencilled in by the former chancellor Rishi Sunak for 2024 has been brought forward by a year. Put together with the removal of the increase in national insurance contributions and the decision not to go ahead with next April\u2019s increase in corporation tax and you get a \u00a345bn giveaway, not quite as big as Barber\u2019s in 1972 but hefty by historical standards. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out, this was a deeply regressive mini-budget, with the biggest percentage gains going to the top 1% of earners. The much more modest help for those on the lowest incomes will be wiped out by the higher cost of imported fuel and food caused by a weaker pound. Kwarteng\u2019s insistence that the government was committed to fiscal responsibility was greeted with derision from Labour MPs, particularly given the lack of independent scrutiny of the chancellor\u2019s arithmetic from the Office for Budget Responsibility. Such an exercise might have questioned the newfound belief in the Treasury that new investment zones, slashing red tape, tougher welfare rules and an end to the bankers\u2019 bonus cap will raise the trend rate of growth to 2.5%. In effect, the mini-budget was a triumph for free-market thinktanks, such as the Institute for Economic Affairs and the Adam Smith Institute, which are true believers in the idea that low-tax, light-touch regulation, small-state economies are not just good for the rich but good for everyone. That conviction is going to be tested to the limits in the months ahead. Britain has inflation at close to 10% and to the extent it boosts demand, the mini-budget will add to inflationary pressure. It will do nothing to discourage the Bank of England from continuing to raise interest rates and if borrowing costs go as high as the markets are predicting the sugar rush will be short-lived. What\u2019s more, the main beneficiaries of the package will be the better off; the politics of the package depend heavily on less well-off voters being convinced of the theory of trickle-down economics. They might take some persuading. But the biggest immediate threat to the chancellor comes from a crashing pound and soaring bond yields. No chancellor can avoid the scrutiny of the financial markets, which is why Kwarteng\u2019s gamble has only two feasible outcomes: complete success or abject failure. History suggests it won\u2019t be the former."

            "date": "2022-09-12T07:00:06Z",
            "content": "The rise of China has been the biggest story in the global economy in recent decades. But amid concern about its stumbling property market and global fears about inflation, the emergence of its neighbour, India, as a potential new economic superpower may be going under the radar. You won\u2019t find mention of it in Liz Truss\u2019s blueprint for a \u201cmodern brilliant Britain\u201d, but the UK has just been overtaken by India as the world\u2019s fifth biggest economy. The nation of 1.4 billion people is on track to move into third place behind the US and China by 2030, according to economists. And while the world became familiar with Chinese business titans such as Alibaba founder Jack Ma, the staggering wealth accumulated in recent years by Indian billionaires Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani has been less well publicised. Adani, in particular, has come to represent India\u2019s growing economic strength thanks to the rapid expansion of his Adani Group conglomerate, which covers everything from ports to airports, and solar power to television. Having entered the global Top 10 when he became Asia\u2019s richest person in February, he is now ranked third with a fortune of $143bn (\u00a3123bn) and is closing fast on second-placed Amazon boss Jeff Bezos. India was for many years seen as the poor relation to China, held back by a sclerotic, sprawling state sector and labyrinthine bureaucracy. It still has enormous problems of poverty and poor infrastructure, but it is beginning to emerge as a rival to its large neighbour with the kind of economic growth figures that were once the pride of Beijing. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 13.8% in the second quarter of this year as pandemic controls were lifted and manufacturing and services boomed. Although double-digit growth is unlikely to be repeated in subsequent quarters, India is still on track to expand by 7% this year as it benefits from economic liberalisation in the private sector, a rapidly growing working population, and the realignment of global supply chains away from China. \u201cIndia has overtaken the UK to become the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy,\u201d says Shilan Shah, senior India economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, citing recent updated figures from the International Monetary Fund. \u201cLooking ahead, India looks set to continue its march up the global rankings. In all, we think India will overtake Germany and Japan to become the third-largest economy in the world within the next decade.\u201d A key part of India\u2019s continued rise will be its ability to grow its manufacturing sector and challenge China as the world\u2019s No 1 exporter. India has already benefited from a large, well-educated, often English-speaking middle-class, helping the country to develop world-class IT and pharmaceutical sectors. It also has strong consumer demand, which accounts for about 55% of the economy compared with less than 40% in China. Now the trick will be to benefit from its youthful working population to position itself as a manufacturing power to rival China, where an ageing labour force and rising pay levels are reducing its competitive edge. With a geopolitical wedge opening up between China and the west, India also has the opportunity to grow in reshaped international supply chains. Nguyen Trinh, emerging markets economist at Natixis bank in Hong Kong, says the outlook is promising for India if it can keep investing. \u201cIndian demand is expected to be strong due to its demographics,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich is rather favourable with rising working-age population that will push for demand for essentials such as food and energy as well as infrastructure investment. The normalisation of activities post-Covid as well as an increase in government spending, particularly in infrastructure investment, is helping growth. Consumption rose in double digits and investment is accelerating.\u201d As with many aspects of India\u2019s economic rise, Adani\u2019s story is instructive. Now 60, the billionaire dropped out of Gujarat University, moved to Mumbai, and began trading diamonds before expanding into ports, construction and \u2013 latterly, but very profitably \u2013 renewable energy. These widespread industrial interests have dovetailed perfectly with the country\u2019s thirst for growth and seen his Adani Group holdings on the Indian stock market rocket in value. His main listed company, Adani Enterprises, has grown 50-fold in value in the past five years, while Adani Green Energy, which looks after its push into solar power, has doubled in value in the past year. The group is ploughing $70bn into green energy projects by 2030 with the aim of becoming the world\u2019s largest renewable-energy producer \u2013 ironic given the controversy over its plans to expand coal mining in Australia. Another important symmetry comes from Adani\u2019s origins in the western state of Gujarat, which is also the power base of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. Modi\u2019s market reforms, which have included cutting corporation tax from 35% to 25% and opening up India to more foreign investment, have freed up entrepreneurs such as Adani and the man he overtook as the country\u2019s richest person, Mukesh Ambani, head of Reliance Industries, and another Gujarati. Adani is close to Modi who has been known to use the tycoon\u2019s private jet for campaign trips. Nowhere is the local and global ambition of Adani more clearly illustrated than in Mundra, the Arabian Sea port which he wants to become the world\u2019s largest by the end of the decade. With Modi\u2019s government rolling out a 100tn rupees ($1.35tn, \u00a31.1tn) infrastructure programme \u2013 it aims to build 25,000km of new roads in the current financial year alone \u2013 Adani is well placed to profit at every stage as the necessary raw materials are shipped in, turned into goods and services, and then sent back out around the world through Mundra."

The shares were issued at \u20ac82.50 on the Frankfurt stock exchange on Thursday, before rising in value to \u20ac86.30 by late morning. The German carmaker Volkswagen listed 12.5% of Porsche\u2019s shares to raise the billions of euros needed to invest in electric cars \u2013 as well as hoping the sports car company would be able to match its Italian rival Ferrari, which has been able to attract a valuation more typical of luxury fashion brands. The deal raised \u20ac19.5bn, about half of which will go to Volkswagen. Volkswagen intends to pay a dividend using part of the proceeds. Volkswagen and Porsche have been intertwined since their foundations, when Ferdinand Porsche founded a car company in the 1930s, before designing the original \u201cpeople\u2019s car\u201d. While the companies will be listed separately, they will retain the same chief executive, Oliver Blume, suggesting there will be little departure in management style or strategic approach to the electric transition. The spinout will, however, allow the Porsche-Pi\u00ebch family, Volkswagen\u2019s largest shareholder, to regain control of Porsche a decade after they ceded control of it to Volkswagen. Dom Tribe, a partner and automotive sector specialist at the management consultancy Vendigital, said: \u201cThis IPO [initial public offering] will make it possible for the Pi\u00ebch family to regain a controlling stake in Porsche \u2013 a move that probably wouldn\u2019t be feasible any other way. \u201cImportantly, it will also deliver a large injection of funds to accelerate VW\u2019s ambitious plan to overtake Tesla as the world\u2019s leading EV [electric vehicle] manufacturer by 2024, which could cost the company in excess of \u00a350bn.\u201d Blume said he was very positive about the opening price, Reuters reported. He also rejected criticism of his roles as chief executive of both companies. \u201cWe made this decision very consciously \u2013 there is no time horizon in which it will be re-evaluated,\u201d Blume said, speaking next to an electric Porsche Taycan parked outside B\u00f6rse Frankfurt."

            "date": "2022-09-13T19:14:44Z",
            "content": "The roads leading to Balakliia, a former frontline town in Kharkiv province recently recaptured by Ukraine, were littered with the detritus of war; carcasses of Russian tanks, crates of abandoned ammunition and destroyed vehicles were scattered along the sides. Three of the bridges into the town had been blown up. One had been replaced with a pontoon bridge, but that too was out of action after a truck turned on its side while crossing. Several houses on the outskirts were destroyed, as well as factories and farms Russian and Ukrainian forceshad used as bases. Locals said they heard explosions every day from late February onwards and spent most of the last seven months at home and in their basements. Around the beginning of last week, they said, they heard an increase in shelling and shortly after, the Russian forces just fled, some even on foot. Those on Balakliia\u2019s streets on Tuesday, just a small part of the 6,000 square km Volodomyr Zelenskiy says Ukraine has recaptured during its counteroffensive, were mostly older middle-aged or elderly, wheeling bicycles. They said younger people who had children had mainly left for Europe. What the people of Balakliia experienced appears to have differed to the residents of towns in Kyiv region and other northern parts of Ukraine that came under Russian occupation at the beginning of the invasion, suffering well-documented atrocities in commuter towns such as Bucha. Luba, a 63-year-old grandmother who had Russian tanks at the end of her garden on the edge of town said the Russian soldiers did not respect her and the people on her street, but they had not mistreated them. She said that the soldiers were mostly in their early 20s and not dedicated to the Kremlin\u2019s cause. \u201cThey didn\u2019t bully us,\u201d said Luba. \u201cI asked them what are doing here, your state is making money and you\u2019ve just brought us grief \u2026 and they would say: \u2018Yes, yes, we agree.\u2019\u201d Luba had two pieces of shrapnel still stuck in her ankle and lower back \u2013 the result of two shells landing while she was in her garden. Residents told the Guardian that they had little interaction with the Russian forces, who mostlybased themselves on edges of the town. They recounted the terror of shelling, getting by without basic utilities and looting by Russian forces \u2013 but not scenes of torture and execution. Almost no one appeared to have heard about the atrocities committed by Russian forces against civilians in other regions, or the events in Mariupol, where at least 20,000 people are estimated to have died, amid a near information vacuum \u2013 with patchy phone signal, no mobile internet or wifi and TV for most of the period. Some said they had heard second-hand stories that the Russian-occupying authorities had detained volunteers delivering food, former soldiers, or police officers \u2013 or anyone they perceived as a political or military threat. One man, Roman, said his friend\u2019s father hid in his house for the duration of the occupation. Late on Tuesday, Serhiy Bolvinov, head of the Kharkiv region national police investigation department, said that Ukrainian law enforcement officials had discovered a \u201ctorture chamber\u201d where dozens of people were held in the basement of the town\u2019s police station. Writing on Facebook, Bolvinov said that at least 40 people were detained for weeks in the makeshift prison where they were also tortured. He said that several locals were shot dead by Russian troops at a checkpoint on the last day of the occupation. One 69-year-old man, Ivan Borsch, a former policeman told the Guardian he was detained after the occupying forces stole money from his house while they were searching for people collaborating with Ukraine. \u201cDuring a search [of my house] they stole $45. I insisted they give the money back and they were annoyed. So, they put a bag over my head and threw me in a prison cell. It was the very same cell I used to throw people in when I was a policeman. I never imagined that one day I would be thrown in there,\u201d said Borsch. Balakliia sits at the western edge of the recaptured territory and is around 30 kilometres from the new frontlines. But it is clear Russia\u2019s plans have been scuppered for now. One resident, Liudmyla Voloshyna, said the Russians had told her she would need to soon re-register her property and would be given a Russian passport. \u201cThey said the Kharkiv People\u2019s Republic is going to be here,\u201d she added. The issue of collaboration with the now-departed occupying authorities was however playing on the minds of some locals \u2013 a potentially difficult issue for Ukraine as it regains control over areas many had believed it had lost. Oleksandr Horvoy, a 62-year-old, who had continued working with the town\u2019s heating company said he believed he had an important job to do but now feared he might be labelled a collaborator. \u201cPeople had to have heating, right? And I had to earn money for my family,\u201d said Horvoy. When asked how people felt about the occupying authorities and Ukrainian forces recapture of the town, Horvoy said: \u201cListen, no one at this point is going to tell you want they think \u2026 but I think everyone is glad that there\u2019s no more shelling.\u201d Serhiy Smak, 44-year-old, said that there were many collaborators in the town. \u201cSome remain but the majority have left and went to Russia,\u201d said Smak. Many who remained in the town had supported the occupation, according to Luba. \u201cI\u2019m a Ukrainian, I\u2019m a patriot but I can\u2019t say the same for everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cI would say the majority wanted this to happen.\u201d Oleksandr Richardovych, a local doctor who was injured on 8 September when two shells landed either side of him and was recovering in a hospital that was still waiting for the electricity supply to be reconnected, said that the situation with collaboration was not black and white as society \u201ccan only be grey\u201d. \u201cEveryone dealt with it in their own way,\u201d he said.

The company has said it intends to use 49% of the proceeds to pay a one-off special dividend to shareholders, with the remainder to help fund the costly shift towards electric vehicles and battery technology. The listing will comprise 911m shares, a nod to the historic car brand\u2019s most famous model, divided into 455.5m preferred shares and 455.5m ordinary shares. Up to 113.8m of the preferred shares, carrying no voting rights, will be placed with investors in what will be Germany\u2019s second largest initial public offering to date. If Porsche hits its upper-end valuation it will become Europe\u2019s third largest stock market float on record, according to Refinitiv data. The sovereign wealth funds of Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Norway as well as the mutual fund company T Rowe Price will subscribe up to \u20ac3.68bn worth of preferred shares. \u201cWe are now in the home stretch with the IPO plans for Porsche and welcome the commitment of our cornerstone investors,\u201d the Volkswagen chief financial officer and chief operating officer, Arno Antlitz, said. As part of the partial float, the Porsche-Pi\u00ebch families, who are VW\u2019s anchor shareholders, will buy a further 12.5% of Porsche, at a premium of 7.5% on the price of the shares offered to the general public. The families\u2019 shareholding, which will rise to 25% plus one ordinary share, will carry voting rights. Porsche SE, the Porsche-Pi\u00ebch investment vehicle, said it would finance the acquisition of its Porsche shares with debt capital of up to \u20ac7.9bn. The proceeds of the sale of shares to the Porsche-Pi\u00ebch families, who lost direct control of the company when VW bought Porsche in a reverse takeover in 2012, will bring in up to \u20ac10bn. Total proceeds from the sale will be \u20ac18.1bn to \u20ac19.5bn."

            "content": "Mortgage rates in the UK will rise further in coming days, and the next 10 days in financial markets will be crucial in determining how high they will go, according to the head of Principality building society. Experts are predicting that a typical two-year fix, which has cost borrowers \u00a3850 a month, could go up to almost \u00a31,500 a month, after Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s mini-budget on Friday shocked markets and sent the pound plunging, as well as triggering a government bond sell-off. Sterling hit a record low of about $1.035 on Monday morning and has recovered slightly to $1.08, but is still down 7% this month. Julie-Ann Haines, the chief executive of the building society, which has 500,000 members, said: \u201cThis \u00a36,000-a-year difference [in mortgage costs] is really dependent on whether the markets over the next two weeks continue to think that the Bank of England base rate will get to 6%.\u201d The pound\u2019s slide, which makes crude oil, priced in dollars, and imported goods more expensive, threatens to push UK inflation, already at 9.9%, even higher and is expected to force the Bank of England to raise interest rates to 5% or 6% by next summer. It lifted its base rate by a half a percentage point to 2.25% the day before the mini-budget. Haines told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWhat we do know is over 2022 we\u2019ve seen very significant increases. Even so far, what we\u2019ve seen passed on in mortgage rates is resulting in about an extra \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000 a year for an average \u00a3250,000 mortgage. What the markets do in the next 10 days is really quite important in determining how big the impact is.\u201d UK government bonds, known as gilts, are on track for their worst month on record, going back to the 1950s. The sell-off has pushed the cost of borrowing for 10 years up to 4.1%, from 3.1% before the mini-budget. The slump in gilt prices has forced several mortgage providers, including Virgin Money and Skipton building society, to pull deals. Haines said Principality had a \u201ca slightly smaller range than normal\u201d and, as a small lender, was affected by others pulling mortgage deals, but that the mutual was working hard to help customers. She stressed that building societies and other lenders needed to be able to make a margin to survive as businesses. \u201cWe no doubt see [mortgage] rates increase over the next 10 days,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we can start to get a grip on what\u2019s happening in the markets through building confidence from the Bank of England and the government then you are hoping that mortgage lenders will come back into the market.\u201d"

            "content": "Morrisons has revealed its profits dived 50% this summer as it battled \u201cunprecedented inflationary pressures\u201d at its in-house food processing arm. The supermarket, which lost its spot as the UK\u2019s fourth largest grocer this month when it was overtaken by Aldi, said underlying profits had dived to \u00a3177m in the 13 weeks to 31 July from \u00a3356m in the same period a year earlier. Sales for the period rose by 4.5% to almost \u00a34.8bn but were down by just over 3% once new store openings were excluded. The company, which was bought by the US private equity firm Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice in a deal worth about \u00a37bn last year, blamed \u201ctemporary and transitional factors\u201d as well as inflation for the poor trading, which it said would not continue into the autumn. Those factors include a switch in the timing of booking income from payments from suppliers related to promotions, which contributed to the fall in profits, and the removal of discounts for NHS workers and changes to the loyalty scheme, both of which meant lower sales. Morrisons, which has asked senior staff to invest thousands of pounds of their own money in the business in recent months, added that the business had \u201cexperienced unprecedented inflationary pressures in our own food manufacturing operations. As a food maker, we feel the effects of inflation earlier than other retailers but conversely are able to recover more quickly when inflation falls.\u201d Retailers are struggling with soaring food prices as the war in Ukraine combines with the Covid crisis and the effects of the climate emergency to drive up the cost of energy and food production. UK retailers and producers have also been affected by higher import costs due to Brexit and the drought conditions that have hit production of some fresh produce, although the hot weather was good for many soft fruits. Consumers faced 5.7% shop price inflation in this month, up from 5.1% in August and the highest monthly rate since the British Retail Consortium-NielsenIQ index began in 2005. However, these price rises do not fully reflect the increase in costs for retailers and their suppliers, who are absorbing some inflation amid heavy competition for increasingly cautious shoppers. Shoppers have been drifting away from traditional supermarkets \u2013 led by Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda \u2013 to the discounters Aldi and Lidl during the cost of living crisis. However, these retailers are also under pressure from rising costs. Aldi, which has gained 1.5 million customers in the past three months, said on Monday annual profits had slumped 86% last year. It blamed the need for higher wages and the cost of doing business during the pandemic as well as price cuts."

            "content": "Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell warned last month that there would be \u201cpain\u201d ahead as the US central bank struggles to contain a surge in inflation unseen in 40 years. Powell will offer some indication of how much pain he expects on Wednesday. The Fed is expected to announce another sharp rise in interest rates on Wednesday afternoon after the conclusion of its latest meeting. It will also update its economic forecasts for the US economy. Economists are predicting the Fed will raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, the third such rise in a row, and signal plans to raise rates again in the coming months. The hike comes as central banks around the world are increasing rates to tackle a soaring cost of living crisis. The Bank of England is expected to announce its largest rate rise in 25 years this week and the European Central Bank raised interest rates across the eurozone by a record margin earlier this month as inflation reached double figures in some of its 19 member countries. Last year the Fed dismissed inflation as a \u201ctransitory\u201d issue triggered by the pandemic and supply chain issues, but consumer prices have remained stubbornly high and have remained so despite a change in the Fed\u2019s view and its aggressive rate rises. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced last week that prices were 8.3% higher last month compared with August last year. The Fed\u2019s target rate for inflation is 2% annually. That news has led some to speculate that the Fed could increase rates by a full percentage point, a drastic move for an institution that usually moves rates cautiously up and down by a quarter percentage point. The sharp rise in interest rates are aimed at slowing the economy and bringing down prices. Higher rates have fed through to the housing market, where rates for a 30-year mortgage have now passed the 6% mark for the first time in 14 years. But rate rises take time to filter through to the wider economy and so far they have done little to tamp down inflation, nor has it impacted the jobs market. Last month the US added 315,00 new jobs and the unemployment rate, at 3.7%, remains close to a 50-year low. Until recently Powell had suggested a \u201csoft landing\u201d was possible for the economy, in which rising rates would bring down prices without causing a severe financial downturn. But at the annual meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, last month Powell acknowledged that economic distress was a price the Fed was willing to pay to control inflation. \u201cWhile higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.\u201d Ellen Zentner, chief US economist at Morgan Stanley, said the Fed had yet to see the \u201cpain\u201d it believes is necessary to tame inflation. \u201cThus far, higher rates have inflicted little widespread pain on the real economy, so the Fed has room to continue hiking into restrictive territory. Consider that so far, a housing correction is under way, if you squint really hard you can see net job gains slowing, and we\u2019ve seen some deceleration in consumer spending, but this isn\u2019t enough to produce the sustained below-potential growth that the chair is looking for,\u201d Zentner wrote in a note to investors. \u201cBottom line is that the Fed needs more evidence that its actions are taking a bite out of the real economy.\u201d"

            "content": "Prices in the US remained stubbornly high in August even as the overall pace of inflation slowed for the second consecutive month. The news sent US stock markets into a tailspin, with the Dow Jones index losing nearly 1,300 points. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 monthly cost of living survey, found prices were 8.3% higher last month compared with August last year. The figure was down from an annual rate of 8.5% recorded in July and 9.1% in June, the highest rate in four decades. But despite the declining headline rate, the details of the report showed prices rising across a wide range of goods and services and triggered a sharp selloff on Wall Street, the worst since June 2020. The Dow closed nearly 4% lower, at 31104.97, the S&amp;P fell 4.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped over 5% as investors sold companies across the board from airlines and construction to retail and technology. Falling gas prices were the major contributor to the overall drop in August\u2019s CPI. Gas prices have fallen for 13 weeks in a row. Nationally, a gallon of gas currently costs an average of $3.71, according to AAA, down from a high of over $5 in June. Used car prices \u2013 once a major driver of inflation \u2013 also fell, as did airfares. But the prices of other goods and services are still rising. Prices overall rose slightly over the month, 0.1% higher than July. And after stripping out energy and food costs prices rose 6.3% over the last 12 months, up from 6.1% in July. The increases were broad-based with prices for shelter, food and medical care rising fastest. The food index increased 11.4% over the last year, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending May 1979. While the headline rate of inflation has slowed, it still leaves inflation at a rate unseen in four decades and adds to the headwinds facing the Biden administration as midterm elections approach. The news comes as the Federal Reserve weighs another sharp increase in interest rates as it struggles to bring price rises under control. Investors sold off stocks, bonds, oil and gold as the news broke and the likelihood of another big rate hike increased. Many parts of the US economy remain strong, most notably the jobs market and household spending. The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, last month warned that the central bank would use its tools \u201cforcefully\u201d to bring prices down and said there would be pain ahead, a signal that he expects the Fed\u2019s policy to slow job gains and spending. The Fed is raising rates at a pace unseen since the 1980s. It raised its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points in July, the second such rise in two months, and is expected to announce a similarly sharp rise in rates when it meets again next week. Last week Powell made clear that taming inflation remained the Fed\u2019s top priority. \u201cHistory cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy,\u201d Powell said during a discussion at the Cato Institute, a libertarian thinktank. \u201cI can assure you that my colleagues and I are strongly committed to this project and we will keep at it until the job is done.\u201d"

The consumer prices index \u2013 the government\u2019s preferred measure of inflation \u2013 dipped from 10.1% in July to 9.9% last month, with cheaper motoring costs more than offsetting the impact of dearer food. Despite the better-than-expected figure, the Bank of England is still expected to raise interest rates by 0.5 points when its monetary policy committee meets next week. Inflation remains more than three times higher than the 3.2% recorded in August 2021 and almost five times higher than the official 2% target. Core inflation \u2013 which strips out fuel, food, alcohol and tobacco and is closely monitored by the MPC \u2013 rose from 6.2% to 6.3% last month. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed petrol prices dropping by more than 14p a litre in August as a fall in global oil prices was finally reflected in cheaper motoring costs. The annual inflation rate for motor fuels eased from 43.7% to 32.1% between July and August. Food price inflation rose for a 13th successive month, hitting a fresh 14-year high of 13.1% in August, with marked increases in the cost of milk, cheese and eggs. The ONS said the cost of food and non-alcoholic beverages had risen throughout 2022, and the 1.5% increase between July and August 2022 was the largest between the two months since 1995. Clothing and footwear prices rose by 1.1% between July and August as summer sales ended, compared with a 0.2% rise last year, pushing up the annual inflation rate from 6.6% to 7.6% Further increases in the annual inflation rate are expected in the coming months as households are hit by rising domestic energy bills but the capping of the average annual bill at \u00a32,500 will mean the peak is now expected to be lower, at about 11%. Separate ONS figures for producer prices \u2013 which are a guide to inflationary pressure in the pipeline \u2013 showed some signs of easing. Fuel and raw material costs rose by 20.5% in the year to August, down from 22.6% in the year to July, while the cost of goods leaving factory gates was up by 16.1% in the year to August compared with 17.1% in the year to July. The general secretary of the union Unite, Sharon Graham, said: \u201cRocketing inflation may have been eased last month but that won\u2019t last. Current levels continue to threaten the living standards of millions of workers.\u201d Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cWith the oil price now just above $90 a barrel, fuel prices will fall further in the coming months. And after the 25% month-on-month rise in utility prices on 1 October (as the Ofgem price cap increases to \u00a32,500), which will add 0.7 percentage points to CPI inflation and drive it to a peak of about 11%, the government price freeze means that utility price inflation will slump from 69.7% now to zero by October next year.\u201d"

            "content": "Aldi has overtaken Morrisons to become the UK\u2019s fourth largest supermarket for the first time, as grocery inflation hit a new record of 12.4% last month. Higher supermarket prices in August, adding \u00a3571 to the average annual grocery bill, encouraged more shoppers to closely manage their budgets, with the discount grocers benefiting, according to the market research company Kantar. Official figures published on Wednesday are expected to show the headline rate of annual consumer price inflation rose to 10.2% in August from 10.1% in July, which was a 40-year high and sharply higher than the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. Aldi\u2019s sales rose by 18.7% year on year over the 12 weeks to 4 September, according to Kantar, which gave it a 9.3% market share and entry into the top four biggest supermarkets alongside Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda. Lidl increased sales by 20.9% and its market share increased to 7.1%. \u201cAt the start of the 2010s, Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons together accounted for over three-quarters of the sector but that traditional big four is no more,\u201d said Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. \u201cThe discounters have seen dramatic sales increases in recent months, bringing more and more customers through their doors. For the fourth month in a row Lidl was the fastest-growing grocer and recorded its strongest sales performance since October 2014.\u201d Commenting on its demotion from the top four, a spokesperson for Morrisons said: \u201cMarket share is partly a function of new store openings and, although Morrisons has not put on any significant new space for a while, some competitors are still opening many new stores. But customers don\u2019t really care about market share statistics \u2013 they care about value, quality, provenance and service and that is where our focus is going to remain.\u201d Kantar said the typical annual grocery bill rose to \u00a35,181 from \u00a34,610. Milk, butter and dog food were among the items affected by the biggest increases, going up in price by 31%, 25% and 29% respectively in the four weeks to 4 September compared with a year earlier. Sales of the cheapest value own-label products were up by a third compared with a year ago, as customers attempted to cope with surging living costs. Overall spending on all retailer own-label lines was \u00a3393m higher during the four-week period, pushing own-label\u2019s share of the market to 51.1%. \u201cIt seems there\u2019s no end in sight to grocery inflation as the rate at which food and drink prices are increasing continues to accelerate, McKevitt said. \u201cIn what is a fiercely competitive sector, supermarkets are reacting to make sure they\u2019re seen to acknowledge the challenges consumers are facing and offer best value, in particular by expanding their own-label ranges. Their efforts seem to be well received by consumers with sales of the very cheapest value own-label products up by 33% this period versus a year ago and nearly one in four baskets containing one of these lines.\u201d Analysis by the Resolution Foundation thinktank found that Liz Truss\u2019s plans for an energy price freeze and sweeping tax cuts would give Britain\u2019s richest households twice as much financial support with living costs as the poorest households. Meanwhile, Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda achieved their best sales performance since April 2021. Amid the price rises, parents prepared for the end of the summer holidays as the majority of schools reopened in early September. In the week before that, to 4 September, parents stocked up for packed lunches. Sales of sliced bread were up by 12% in comparison with the previous three weeks, while cheese snacks grew by 18% and children\u2019s yoghurts by 57%."

            "content": "Building firms suffered a squeeze on activity for a second month in a row during August as new orders slowed to their lowest level since the summer of 2020 in the latest sign that a UK recession is looming. With inflation at a 40-year high, construction businesses reported that their customers were putting new work on hold, forcing them to stop buying materials and hiring staff. S&amp;P Global\u2019s construction sector index showed depressed activity last month, after an even steeper fall in July. The Cips UK construction purchasing managers\u2019 index was 49.2 in August, after a reading of 48.9 in the previous month. A figure below 50 indicates the sector has contracted. Andrew Harker, the economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said the sector \u201clooks set to be in for a challenging period\u201d. Civil engineering was the hardest hit over the two months combined, while commercial building also experienced a reduction in activity. Only housebuilding enjoyed a lift in August, but that was too modest to push the rest of the industry into growth. Harker said despite the August increase in activity, housebuilding was in a period of stagnation and the only silver lining was that employment remained strong. Gareth Belsham, a director of the national property consultancy Naismiths, said the construction sector was a \u201ccanary in the coalmine\u201d for the rest of the economy. \u201cAs the recessionary vice begins to close on the UK economy as a whole, the construction industry\u2019s brakes are being squeezed harder and faster than most,\u201d he said. Andrew Wishart, the senior property economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said a drop in demand by the leisure and hospitality industry for new work as the cost of living crisis spilled over to the demand for gyms and hotels was especially significant. He said the survey was consistent with construction output falling from 4.1% in the year to June to zero by the end of the year. Max Jones, a director in Lloyds Bank\u2019s infrastructure and construction team, was more upbeat, saying that some firms were flourishing during the recent period of uncertainty. \u201cDespite output remaining in contraction, many larger contractors are feeling more confident than they were earlier in the year,\u201d he added. \u201cRecent financial results from tier one firms showed healthy balance sheets and strong pipelines of new work. Others priced in jobs at a high point and are buying materials now as prices cool. As was the case during the pandemic, sensible balance sheet management has and will continue to be crucial.\u201d"

After all, while toilet paper was the second most sought-after supermarket item during the height of the pandemic, pasta was the first. Consumers were strictly rationed to just one or two packets of rolls to ensure that no one went without. But having boomed during the pandemic, the luxury brand Hakle from D\u00fcsseldorf \u2013 known for \u201cbringing comfort since 1928\u201d with its three-ply rolls \u2013 has bombed as a result of the energy crisis. It is the first large German consumer goods producer to collapse because of soaring energy and raw material costs, and there is much to suggest that it will be followed by many more. Last week the Munich-based Ifo Institute for Economic Research slashed its prognosis for German growth, declaring \u201cwe are heading into a winter recession\u201d. It forecast Europe\u2019s largest economy would shrink by 0.3% in 2023, after growing by just 1.6% this year. Inflation is forecast to hit 8.1% this year and 9.3% in 2023. \u201cThe cuts to gas supplies from Russia this summer and the drastic price increases they triggered are wreaking havoc on economic recovery following the coronavirus,\u201d said Timo Wollmersh\u00e4user, Ifo\u2019s head of forecasts, adding that he did not expect a \u201creturn to normal\u201d until 2024, when 1.8% growth and 2.4% inflation could be expected. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is travelling to the Gulf this weekend asto secure supplies of liquified natural gas (LNG) from the United Arab Emirates, as Russia chokes off its supply of gas. The economy minister, Robert Habeck, said: \u201cThe gas supply is gradually broadening and the government is permanently in talks with many countries, also with nations on the Arabian peninsula.\u201d Paper production is highly energy intensive. Hakle used 60,000 megawatt hours of gas and 40,000 MWh of electricity every year. The rises in energy costs came so hard and fast, the company said, it was unable to pass them on in time to consumers, who in turn have been switching to cheaper two-ply loo roll. Company bosses, trade union leaders, shopkeepers and employees across the country are openly expressing their fears of a crisis in Europe\u2019s largest economy that is in danger of spiralling out of control. They call into question the apparent optimism of people like Olaf Scholz, the chancellor, who has adopted \u201cyou\u2019ll never walk alone\u201d as his crisis management slogan. Economics minister Robert Habeck has admitted \u201cthe financial pressure is enormous\u201d, offering the faint hope that \u201cif we manage to get through this winter, we have a good chance that by next summer and winter things will be considerably more relaxed\u201d. In Hanover, northern Germany, baker Eckehard Vatter, who has 35 branches and employs 430 people, went to the press recently after his gas bill rose by 1,200% to \u20ac75,000 (\u00a365,800) a month. \u201cAre they crazy? We will have to turn off the ovens,\u201d he said, taking to the streets with about 1,000 other bakers on Wednesday, who held up placards accusing politicians of \u201csteering us into the biggest crisis of all time\u201d and calling for urgent state support. Yasmin Fahimi, the head of the Federation of German Trade Unions (DGB), said she fears the consequences of so many challenges coming at once. \u201cSome companies are on the edge. This risks a domino effect which could lead to the deindustrialisation of Germany, which would be a catastrophe,\u201d she told Spiegel. She called on the government to safeguard those companies that are under particular threat, due to their high energy usage, \u201cto ensure that they are able to keep a minimum level of their production capacity going, so that when things get better, they can ramp them up again. Those who shut up shop now, will never come back. We need to be clear about that.\u201d Many companies have done just that: reduced production to an absolute minimum or \u2013 in the case of the ArcelorMittal steelworks at the ports of Hamburg and Bremen \u2013 are planning to shut down \u201cuntil further notice\u201d. The scenario is being repeated across Germany, hitting most of all the energy intensive industries \u2013 steel, building materials, glass, paper, chemicals \u2013 that form the backbone of the German economy. The \u201cdeindustrialisation\u201d which Fahimi fears is what could happen if they close down for good. Meanwhile, cheaper energy and production costs elsewhere \u2013 gas is 10 times cheaper in the US \u2013 are driving some businesses to relocate their manufacturing. But in the case of the hundreds of thousands of Mittelstand companies, which are small to medium sized, often family-run concerns and loyal to a specific location which have been Germany\u2019s main growth engine since the second world war \u2013 this is barely an option. According to the Federation of German Industries (BDI), 90% of companies cite the level of energy and raw material costs as either a \u201cstrong\u201d or an \u201cexistential challenge\u201d. In the case of ammonia \u2013 vital to the agricultural industry for the production of fertiliser \u2013 producers such as BASF have reduced their production to a minimum and been forced to buy the chemical from cheaper markets elsewhere in the world. Volker Jung, the head of the bankrupt Hakle toilet paper firm, has called for a state supported energy price cap \u201cotherwise,\u201d he said, \u201cwe can ask the question whether Germany will ever be able to afford to make paper again.\u201d Wolfgang Gro\u00dfe Entrup, the head of the German Chemical Association (VCI), has warned of the risk of Germany developing new dependencies at a time when it should be looking to do the opposite. Another recent survey has shown consumer confidence to be at its lowest since the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949. Faced with higher energy bills, households are rethinking spending, from holidays to household purchases and meals out. Businesses are doing the same, avoiding new investments and instead holding crisis meetings about how low they can reduce heating in factories and offices. Increasing numbers of companies are switching their workers into \u201cKurzarbeit\u201d \u2013 short-time working mode \u2013 which was first introduced in the 1920s in response to the economic crisis of the Weimar Republic, and later utilised to considerable effect during the global financial crisis. This willingness to cling on to workers is seen as crucial if Germany stands a chance of emerging from the current crisis. But increasingly the question is being asked: how long will it be able to afford to do so?"

            "title": "Liz Truss\u2019s energy price freeze could soften UK recession, say economists",
            "date": "2022-09-06T16:44:51Z",
            "content": "Liz Truss\u2019s expected energy price freeze could stop inflation in Britain from rising further and reduce the severity of the recession that is forecast to hit the country this winter, economists have said. As details of the new prime minister\u2019s plan to tackle soaring household bills emerged on Tuesday, some of the UK\u2019s largest pub groups, food chains and retailers were among the biggest risers on the London stock market as investors bet that support for struggling families would bolster household spending across the economy. The price cap, expected to be announced on Thursday after Truss assembles her cabinet, would freeze an average energy bill at about \u00a32,500 a year and come with a price tag for the exchequer of up to \u00a390bn. Economists said imposing a blanket cap on bills could prevent headline consumer price inflation from rising much further, after the latest figures from July showed the rate had risen above 10% for the first time since the early 1980s. \u201cCancelling all or most of the planned October and January prices rises \u2026 could be a gamechanger in our view,\u201d said Elizabeth Martins, UK economist at HSBC. \u201cIt would mean that, on a mechanical basis, inflation might already have peaked.\u201d The research consultancy Capital Economics called the package an \u201ceffective but expensive sticking plaster\u201d, estimating that inflation could now peak close to 11% in October. It said the UK economy would still probably enter recession, but the contraction in GDP would be more like 0.5%, instead of its current forecasts for a 1% downturn. The Bank of England forecast last month that without intervention, inflation would peak above 13% and there would be a lengthy recession, while some economists warned that inflation could hit 22% next year if high energy costs were sustained. On a day of relief in financial markets as Truss appeared to back down from a campaign promise not to offer \u201chandouts\u201d to struggling families, the pound rose against the US dollar, while the FTSE closed 13 points up, at 7,300. The sportswear company JD Sports closed 3% higher on the FTSE 100, while the clothing and homeware retailer Next climbed 2.5%, as investors hoped that Truss\u2019s economic measures would leave consumers with a little more spending money in their pockets amid the cost of living crisis. Pub groups and food retailers \u2013 including Mitchells &amp; Butlers, Marks &amp; Spencer, Greggs and Domino\u2019s Pizza \u2013 pushed the more UK-focused FTSE 250 higher, in anticipation of a government spending package that would lessen the squeeze on households and help businesses to pay their own bills. In addition to capping consumer bills, businesses could receive an aid package from the government to help with soaring energy bills \u2013 according to Bloomberg \u2013 which are making it impossible for some factories, pubs, restaurants and shops to remain open. Shares in Mitchells &amp; Butlers \u2013 one of the UK\u2019s largest pub groups and owner of chains including All Bar One, O\u2019Neill\u2019s and Toby Carvery \u2013 closed more than 7% higher, while the pub group JD Wetherspoon rose by 4.5%. The bakery chain Greggs and the fast food chain Domino\u2019s Pizza ended the day more than 6% higher, while shares in Marks &amp; Spencer were up nearly 5%. However, some analysts cautioned that the recovery in retailers\u2019 share prices might only be temporary. \u201cWe might be at the stage where investors take the view that shares in retailers have been oversold,\u201d said Russ Mould, the investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell. \u201cHow long it will last is another matter, as the general cost of living crisis is still punishing for households, whether energy bills go up further or not.\u201d The share moves came as research from the building society Nationwide found that the average household is \u00a3249 a month worse off compared with this time last year. The lender found that 83% of 2,000 surveyed said they were worried about the squeeze on their finances, with 71% saying they felt they had cut back their outgoings as much as possible."

            "date": "2022-09-26T17:55:14Z",
            "content": "The world\u2019s leading economies are sliding into recession as the global energy and inflation crises sparked by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine cut growth by more than previously forecast, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). A dependency on expensive gas for heavy industry and home heating will plunge Germany, Italy and the UK into a long period of recession after global growth was projected by the OECD to slow to 2.2% in 2023 from a forecast in June of 2.8%. With the global economy needing to grow by about 4% to keep pace with rising populations, the OECD said incomes per head would be lower in many countries. OECD\u2019s interim chief economist, \u00c1lvaro Pereira, said the world was paying a steep price for the Ukraine war and Russia\u2019s decision to restrict access to gas supplies more tightly than was forecast in June. He said governments would need to encourage households and businesses to reduce their consumption of gas and oil to help weather a difficult winter. Pereira also supported the determination of central banks to reduce inflation by raising interest rates. \u201cWe need to reduce demand, there is no doubt about that. And monetary and fiscal authorities need to work hand in hand to achieve it,\u201d he said. China\u2019s growth rate is expected to drop this year to 3.2% \u2013 its lowest since the 1970s \u2013 causing a large decrease in trade with neighbours South Korea, Vietnam and Japan, dragging down their capacity to grow. A recovery in China next year to 4.7% will be weaker than expected, the OECD said, as Beijing wrestles with a property market and banking sector weighed down by huge debts. However, the Paris-based policy forum was most alarmed by the outlook across Europe, which is most directly exposed to the fallout from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. The OECD forecast that UK GDP growth would be flat in 2023. However, this projection does not take into account the measures announced in the chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s mini-budget on Friday. The OECD forecast a drop in growth in the eurozone from 3.1% this year to only 0.3% in 2023, meaning that many countries in the 19-member currency bloc will spend at least part of the year in recession. A recession is defined as two straight quarters of contraction. France could escape a recession if it grows by 0.8% next year as predicted by the OECD, but will suffer along with other European countries after the downgrade in GDP growth since June of 1.3 percentage points. Russia will shrink by at least 5.5% this year and 4.5% in 2023. Berlin\u2019s dependence on Russian gas before the invasion means the German economy will shrink by 0.7% next year, down from a June estimate of 1.7% growth. The OECD warned that further disruptions to energy supplies would hit growth and boost inflation, especially in Europe, where they could knock activity back another 1.25 percentage points and increase inflation by 1.5 percentage points, pushing many countries into recession for the full year of 2023. Global output next year is projected to be $2.8tn (\u00a32.6tn) lower than the OECD forecast before Russia attacked Ukraine \u2013 a loss of global income equivalent to the UK economy. \u201cThe global economy has lost momentum in the wake of Russia\u2019s unprovoked, unjustifiable and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine. GDP growth has stalled in many economies and economic indicators point to an extended slowdown,\u201d the organisation\u2019s secretary-general, Mathias Cormann, said. A review of the outlook for the US found that while it is likely to grow slowly this year and be in recession for part of 2023, it was less dependent than other countries on energy from Russia or other sources, allowing for a strong recovery in 2024. The OECD forecast that the world\u2019s biggest economy would slow from 1.5% growth this year to only 0.5% next year, down from June forecasts for 2.5% in 2022 and 1.2% in 2023. World Bank officials have called on central banks to refrain from competitive rate hikes that will push the global economy into recession and harm the economies of developing countries the most. Nevertheless, the OECD said further rate hikes were needed to fight inflation, forecasting that most major central banks\u2019 policy rates would reach at least 4% next year."

            "title": "Unprecedented events creating \u2018extremely severe\u2019 risk of global recession \u2013 economist Adam Tooze",
            "date": "2022-09-23T02:00:22Z",
            "content": "Adam Tooze has a cult following among economists and historians alike. The famed English economic historian, once hailed by New York Magazine as \u201cimpeccably credentialed, improbably charming\u201d, is in Australia after speaking at Sydney\u2019s Festival of Dangerous Ideas. The decision by the US Federal Reserve to raise its key interest rate by another 75 basis points this week, and its plans for further increases, have raised the spectre of a global economic slowdown. Overnight, the Bank of England lifted its key rate by 0.5%, matching Indonesia and the Philippines, while the Swiss National Bank and South Africa opted for a 0.75 percentage point rise. Tooze, a history professor at New York\u2019s Columbia University and a frequent contributor to the Guardian, has detailed the gathering economic headwinds and has analysed for Guardian Australia the key areas of the current financial turmoil. \u2018Extremely severe\u2019 recession risk The chances of a global recession were now \u201cextremely severe\u201d, as central banks in many parts of the world raise interest rates to curb inflation. \u201cIt\u2019s the single most dramatic simultaneous tightening of monetary policy ever,\u201d Tooze said. The winding back of Covid support packages by governments as the pandemic tide recedes also meant fiscal brakes were being tapped. \u201cUS fiscal policy right now is massively contractionary,\u201d Tooze said. \u201cIt\u2019s a 4.5% of GDP negative drag.\u201d Textbook moment of \u2018failed technocracy\u2019 Tooze predicted the current policies of central banks and governments would be marked in future textbooks as a \u201cclassic moment of failed technocracy\u201d. The US Fed Reserve lifted its cash rate target range by 75bp to 3% to 3.25% on Wednesday, US time. It also indicated it expected increases of as much as another 125bp this year even as Fed chairman Jerome Powell warned of a possible recession. Tooze said other central banks will be under pressure to follow. Australia\u2019s Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, said last week the bank would probably lift its cash rate 25bp or 50bp on 4 October, making it a record six increases in as many months. The lives of 100s of millions of people and their employment prospects would be scarred by a recession, Tooze said: \u201cThis will mark those people\u2019s lives for the rest of their lives.\u201d Australian fallout Private economists forecast Australian property price falls of as much as 20%, the steepest decline since the 1980s as rates rise. Tooze said Australia and Canada had two of the \u201cmost overheated\u201d property markets in the world, and he predicted \u201chuge effects\u201d from higher borrowing costs. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning One source of support for the market might also be less forthcoming in the future. The surge in both Chinese students and property buying in Australia, US and elsewhere, had partly been a \u201ccapital flight story\u201d, he says. Buying a flat to provide accommodation while studying was one way to get money out of China. Signs have lately been mounting of a renewed effort by Chinese to move money abroad ahead of a major Chinese Communist party meeting in Beijing next month that will formally extend the leadership of President Xi Jinping. To counter that capital flight, authorities are making it harder for people \u201cbeyond certain networks\u201d to access passports, Tooze said. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite difficult now for the Chinese to discreetly exit.\u201d China worries The RBA deputy governor, Michele Bullock, on Wednesday described the global economy as being \u201con a bit of a knife-edge\u201d. One reason was the fragile state of China\u2019s economy. Its Covid-zero policy disrupted supply chains and a plunging property market had \u201cstill not worked itself out\u201d, she said. Demand for Australian iron ore, in particular, hinged on the success of government efforts to support real estate. \u201cThe Chinese property bubble is not just any property bubble \u2013 it\u2019s the largest single phase of accumulation of wealth in economic history,\u201d Tooze said, noting the number of private property owners had jumped from near zero to 300 million in a few decades. \u201cThey poured more concrete in three years [in the early 2010s] than the United States in all of the 20th century,\u201d he said. The Chinese government may yet stabilise the market. \u201cThe amazing thing is that big money in the west is taking a huge gamble on the capacity of an authoritarian regime unfettered by the rule of law to pull off the largest single exercise in macro-prudential, macro-financial stabilisation the world has ever seen,\u201d Tooze said. Assuming they can do that, BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue \u2013 and a large part of the Australian economy \u2013 \u201care all fine\u201d. One cause for optimism Tooze said the \u201cextraordinary progress\u201d in cutting the cost of solar and wind energy was a \u201creal case for optimism\u201d, at least as far as action to limit global heating was concerned. \u201cThe disappointment is we could be even further down those cost curves\u201d if the US and Europe and elsewhere had matched China\u2019s investment. Improving battery technology would be \u201cfundamental\u201d to advancing decarbonisation efforts because of the intermittency of renewables. He cited data from the International Energy Agency on total public funded energy research \u2013 totalling $US23bn ($A35bn) in 2021 \u2013 as proof we can do more. \u201cIf we were serious about the energy transition,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019d think we would be collectively spending more than what Americans spend [each year] just on treats and food for their dogs and cats\u201d."

The letter from the congressional representatives Gerry Connolly, Sylvia Garcia, Ted Lieu and dozens of other Democrats followed the emergence of a report in which a 27-year-old Venezuelan said he was paid $200 by a mystery figure known as \u201cPerla\u201d to find people outside the San Antonio migrant center to board a flight. The migrant, who was called Emmanuel, told the San Antonio Report that he gave Perla contact information for 10 other migrants. \u201cAs the federal government retains jurisdiction over cases that involve interstate travel, we request the Department of Justice investigate whether any federal funds were used to operate a fraudulent scheme and request the Department of Justice make a determination as to whether officials in Texas and Florida violated federal law,\u201d the letter said. At least one criminal investigation has already been opened into the situation by a Texas sheriff, and Connolly and others said the justice department should do the same. Multiple media reports have depicted how the asylum seekers had been misled once they arrived in Texas and were incorrectly told they were being flown to Boston. \u201cIt is alleged that immigration officials knowingly falsified mailing addresses for the migrants by selecting arbitrary homeless shelters across the United States, with the expectation that migrants would be required to contact the wrong agency,\u201d the letter said. Details have not yet emerged about the planning and execution of the plan, which was spearheaded by the office of the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis. DeSantis has defended his administration\u2019s actions and denied that migrants were misled. The Democrats pointed out that the migrants who were used in what was called a political \u201cstunt\u201d were fleeing communism, authoritarianism and violence, having walked thousands of miles for what they called a \u201cdignified life\u201d.

            "date": "2022-09-28T18:09:37Z",
            "content": "Dalian Atkinson\u2019s family have criticised police for taking the life of their loved one and condemned the justice system for taking six years to complete criminal trials of officers involved. The former Premier League footballer died in August 2016 after a clash with two officers in Telford, Shropshire, during which he was shot with a stun gun for 33 seconds and kicked in the head. The trial of PC Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith, who was accused of beating Atkinson with a baton, ended on Wednesday with her acquittal, meaning legal restrictions covering the case no longer apply. After the conclusion of the criminal cases, Atkinson\u2019s family told the Guardian of their pain, exacerbated by the time it had taken: \u201cWhilst we are disappointed in today\u2019s verdict, it brings an end to legal processes which have lasted over six years. Not a day has gone by since Dalian\u2019s death in August 2016 when we haven\u2019t thought that if it hadn\u2019t been for the actions of the police, he might still be with us now. \u201cSix years is far too long for any grieving family to have to wait to achieve closure\u2026 Delay in getting accountability for bereaved families under our criminal justice system is unacceptable: the IOPC [Independent Office for Police Conduct] and the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] must do better.\u201d Last June PC Benjamin Monk was convicted of Atkinson\u2019s manslaughter, and is now serving an eight-year sentence. The case attracted comparisons to George Floyd\u2019s killing by police in the US, with excessive violence resulting in death. The family pointed out that while Floyd\u2019s death came after Atkinson\u2019s, the officer involved was tried and convicted within a year. Monk had been previously found by a police disciplinary hearing in 2011 to have committed gross misconduct but was allowed to remain an officer and given a stun gun. Atkinson was kicked with such force that his blood was found in the laces of Monk\u2019s police-issued boots, and imprints from them were found on the forehead of the former Aston Villa striker. One witness said that when Atkinson was kicked while on the ground his head had snapped back. He was pronounced dead within 70 minutes. On 15 August 2016, police were called to a disturbance with Atkinson acting in an erratic and out of character fashion having gone to Meadow Close, Telford, where his father lived. The IOPC said Bettley-Smith has a case to answer for gross misconduct for her use of force, a discipline charge that could see her sacked. West Mercia police now have to decide whether they agree. During the trial at Birmingham crown court, jurors were told Bettley-Smith, 32, struck Atkinson, 48, with her baton three times as he lay on the ground. Bettley-Smith told the court she used her baton lawfully as a last resort as she tried to control Atkinson, who she said was \u201cactively resisting and trying to get up\u201d. Monk used a stun gun on Atkinson and kicked him in the head as he lay on the ground, while shouting \u201cfucking hit him!\u201d to Bettley-Smith. The court heard how Atkinson, who played for Aston Villa, Ipswich and Sheffield Wednesday during his professional career, was suffering from a number of serious health issues at the time of his death, including end-stage kidney failure. Paul Jarvis, the prosecutor, said that when Monk and Bettley-Smith arrived on the scene, Atkinson smashed a window at the house and walked towards the officers, saying repeatedly he was \u201cthe Messiah\u201d. The defence argued Atkinson still posed a risk to the officers as he was trying to get up and Bettley-Smith\u2019s actions were \u201creasonable\u201d. Amid continuing debate about police and race, Victor Olisa, a former Metropolitan police chief superintendent and head of diversity for Britain\u2019s biggest force, said: \u201cPolicing cultures in the UK and US are pretty similar: the behaviour patterns and thinking process is the same. \u2018I am facing danger, from a black male who is aggressive and they may kill me.\u2019 \u201cIf you compare the both of them, they are both horrific ways for a human being to die. George Floyd with a knee on the neck, Dalian Atkinson tasered and kicked by a police officer. The level of violence is just unimaginable.\u201c Deborah Coles from Inquest, said: \u201cWe have seen in this trial a use of racial stereotypes equating black people with dangerousness and criminality. \u201cLanguage used by police when challenged to defend their actions reproduces the very myths and racial stereotypes that legitimised slavery with reference to \u2018super-human strength\u2019, and \u2018unpredictability\u2019 to legitimise violent and deadly policing.\u201d Monk has now been sacked and West Mercia police said it had implemented changes in the use of Tasers as a result of the incident. The force has paid damages to Atkinson\u2019s family. Assistant chief constable Rachel Jones said: \u201cDalian\u2019s family and friends have suffered a devastating loss; this has been an extremely long and difficult journey and they have shown great dignity throughout.\u201d The National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council said: \u201cFollowing independent research into the causes of racial disparities in the police use of Taser, we will publish the findings of this academic work early next year.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-09-09T00:08:16Z",
            "content": "The US justice department has demanded that a federal judge restore its access to documents seized from Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort that carried classification markings, saying that if not, it would appeal to a higher court. The demands came in a three-page notice of appeal filed by the justice department on Thursday in the case involving Trump\u2019s request for a so-called special master, and paves the way for the government to submit a detailed appeals brief to the US court of appeals for the 11th circuit. But the justice department indicated in a motion for a stay that it would not appeal the decision, if the order for a special master to review classified materials that stopped the investigation into Trump\u2019s unauthorised retention of government secrets was reversed. The filings amounted to a forceful response against the decision by the judge \u2013 a Trump appointee \u2013 to give unusually deferential treatment to Trump on account of his status as a former president. The justice department focused on the classified documents in its motion to stay the order barring it from reviewing the seized materials, arguing that Trump did not have \u201cpossessory interest\u201d for the records \u2013 the key legal standard at issue \u2013 and were themselves the subject of the investigation. Even if Trump attempted to make an executive privilege argument to set aside the classified documents from the evidence cache, the government argued, he could not say that he had a \u201cpossessory interest\u201d for classified documents that belonged to the state. The justice department also said in its motion to stay that although Cannon had ostensibly allowed the ODNI risk assessment to continue, by enjoining the government from examining the seized materials until the appointment of a special master, it caused that assessment to stop. As part of the risk assessment, the filing suggested, the ODNI was reviewing the seized classified documents with the intelligence community, which includes the FBI. But with the FBI also being part of the justice department, the intelligence community was unsure how to continue its review. The FBI seized from Mar-a-Lago around 11,000 documents and 48 empty folders with classified markings. The risk assessment into the empty folders, for instance, was to be completed by the FBI \u2013 but Cannon\u2019s order threw that review into limbo, the justice department said. Additionally, barring the FBI from using the classified documents \u201ccould impede efforts to identify the existence of any additional classified records that are not being properly stored\u201d, prosecutors wrote \u2013 the first suggestion that more classified material might be unaccounted for. The justice department also reiterated that they had already sorted through the seized materials using its own so-called \u201cfilter team\u201d to separate around 520 pages of documents potentially covered by attorney-client privilege. Trump\u2019s legal team argued last week in federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida, the \u201cfilter teams\u201d were inadequate \u2013 with which Cannon agreed \u2013 and that a special master is needed because the FBI seized some materials protected by executive or attorney-client privilege. The precise nature of the justice department\u2019s appeal was not certain on Thursday \u2013 the government filed only the notice of appeal. A spokesman for the justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But senior officials at the justice department mulled for days about how to respond to Cannon\u2019s ruling, according to sources familiar with the matter, and considered several options ranging from not appealing at all, appealing the decision in part, to seeking the reversal of the entire order. The ruling in essence presented the justice department with a dilemma: not appeal the ruling and accept a delay to the investigation, or appeal with the knowledge that a loss would create new precedent for a potentially dangerous interpretation of post-presidential power. While the justice department believed that the appellate court precedent concerning fourth amendment motions, like the one submitted by Trump, cut against the former president, the 11th circuit in Atlanta is majority conservative with six of the judges appointed by Trump."

            "content": "Thousands of young people have staged a coordinated \u201cglobal climate strike\u201d across Asia, Africa and Europe in a call for reparations for those worst affected by climate breakdown. From New Zealand and Japan to Germany and the Democratic Republic of Congo, activists walked out of schools, universities and jobs to demand rich countries pay for the damage global heating is inflicting on the poor. In the latest day of action by the Fridays For Future movement, strikes \u201cfor climate reparations and justice\u201d were planned in about 450 locations worldwide. The protests take place six weeks before the Cop27 climate summit, where developing countries plan to push for compensation for climate-related destruction to homes, infrastructure and livelihoods. Recent months have seen deadly floods engulfing large parts of Pakistan, wildfires ravaging north Africa, Europe and North America, and record-breaking heatwaves in Britain and India. \u201cWe\u2019re striking all over the world because the governments in charge are still doing too little for climate justice,\u201d said Darya Sotoodeh, a spokesperson for the group\u2019s chapter in Germany. \u201cOne day, it could be my house that gets flooded,\u201d said 15-year-old Park Chae-yun, one of about 200 protesting in Seoul, South Korea. \u201cI\u2019m living with a sense of crisis, so I think it is more important to deliver my concerns to the government to take preventive measures rather than going to school.\u201d The biggest strike took place in Berlin, with police in the German capital estimating 20,000 took part in a rally calling on their government to set up a \u20ac100bn fund for tackling the climate crisis. About 400 young activists gathered in the Democratic Republic of Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, chanting \u201cAct for Africa, protect our planet\u201d. They marched on the shoulder of a busy thoroughfare carrying cardboard signs saying \u201cClimate Justice\u201d and \u201cClimate SOS\u201d. In Rome, 5,000 young people turned out for a march that ended near the Colosseum. One carried a placard saying: \u201cThe climate is changing. Why aren\u2019t we?\u201d Denmark is the only rich country that has so far stepped up with funding for the problem of \u201closs and damage\u201d due to climate-related disasters, announcing at the UN assembly this week it would provide DKK 100m (\u00a312m) to address it. A statement on the Fridays For Future website said: \u201cColonisers and capitalists are at the core of every system of oppression that has caused the climate crisis, and decolonisation, using the tool of climate reparations, is the best kind of climate action.\u201d The Fridays For Future youth movement began in 2018, inspired by Greta Thunberg\u2019s solitary protests outside the Swedish parliament. It reached a high point in November 2019, when 4 million people took part in 4,500 actions worldwide on one Friday."

            "content": "The leader of criminal barristers on strike in England and Wales has urged Liz Truss\u2019s lord chancellor to hold urgent talks to resolve the dispute over legal aid fees. The Criminal Bar Association (CBA) has been angered by the refusal of Dominic Raab, who announced he was leaving the justice secretary post on Tuesday, to meet them since industrial action began in April. Its chair, Kirsty Brimelow, said it should be the immediate priority of his successor. Barristers began their first indefinite all-out strike on Monday over demands for an immediate 25% increase in legal aid fees, after a fall in their real earnings of 28% since 2006. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has offered 15% but it will apply only to new cases and, given a backlog of about 60,000 cases, Brimelow said it could be up to four years before CBA members see its fruits. Addressing striking barristers in front of the supreme court in central London on Tuesday, Brimelow, who took over as CBA chair on Thursday, said the dispute could be settled in a couple of days if the government showed goodwill. She said striking barristers shared the MoJ\u2019s vision of a world-class criminal justice system, but added: \u201cThat vision cannot be realised without immediate investment into the people who actually are keeping the criminal justice going and not only keeping it going but delivering the high standards that we need in order to function as a civilised society and to function as a liberal democracy. \u201cSo we urge the new secretary of state and lord chancellor to meet us tomorrow and to open negotiations to resolve the crisis, which has not been of barristers\u2019 making.\u201d Later on Tuesday, appearing before MPs on the justice committee to discuss the strike, Brimelow was asked by the chair, Bob Neill, what engagement there had been with Raab. She answered: \u201cThere\u2019s been none,\u201d adding: \u201cThere\u2019s been no operative meetings in order to discuss, to drill down, to find points of commonality to reach some agreement. There\u2019s been nothing and we\u2019ve been pushing for those meetings because none of the barristers actually want to not be in court. They\u2019re all suffering as well, I should say, because they\u2019re self employed \u2026 many are making very significant sacrifices.\u201d At the gathering opposite parliament, one of several taking part outside courts around the country, barristers spoke passionately about how stress, low pay and uncertain hours were driving advocates out of criminal practice. They warned that without change, women, people of colour and working-class barristers in particular would forgo the profession. Anisha Kiri, whose parents fled war-torn Sri Lanka and who was called to the bar in 2020, said: \u201cI ask myself all the time: \u2018Why am I working so hard for so little? When can I pay my family back? When will I be able to buy a house?\u2019 I\u2019m so tired. Every case where I calculate how little I get paid for the amount of work I put in pushes me closer to quitting \u2013 I cannot go on.\u201d At the committee meeting, Alejandra Llorente Tascon, co-chair at the CBA young bar subcommittee, said she was paid \u00a312,000 in her first year, declaring \u00a34,000 to \u00a35,000 on her tax return after expenses. \u201cThe fees are now so low that most \u2026 junior barristers are struggling to pay the student debt, are struggling to move out of their family homes, are struggling to pay travel and their general expenses to practise at the criminal bar,\u201d she said. Llorente Tascon said one of the biggest problems was that preparation work \u2013 outside courts \u2013 was unpaid, in a job in which there was no work-life balance. She said she had heard of one barristers\u2019 chambers where out of six pupils (student barristers) five \u201cdid not complete their pupilage because they could not afford to stay at the criminal bar\u201d, adding: \u201cThe one pupil that stayed, stayed for three months and then realised that they couldn\u2019t afford it so they left.\u201d The MoJ has called the strike \u201cirresponsible\u201d and said it would harm victims. It claims the 15% fee increase will add about \u00a37,000 to a typical barrister\u2019s annual earnings."

            "content": "It is to be welcomed that Gordon Brown\u2019s constitutional review has identified the House of Lords and the balance of power between the centre, nations, regions and localities as ripe for reform (Labour may abolish House of Lords if it wins next election, leaked report reveals, 22 September), but it is concerning that his proposals are proving contentious in the Labour party. Many other issues remain to be addressed, not least a flawed electoral system producing grossly disproportionate results, where the need for change is supported by the membership and unions, but not by the leadership. One way to resolve these matters would be for Labour to set up a UK constitutional convention, using a consultative process to agree proposals on constitutional and electoral reform. Building cross-party and public consensus in advance would model good governance and enable an incoming Labour government to start the process of constitutional change, ensuring that a more proportional voting system is introduced prior to the next general election. Dr Anthony Isaacs London \u2022 Jessica Elgot\u2019s excellent article on the Labour conference (Starmer has eye on the election prize as Labour heads to conference, 23 September) left me, and all our supporters, bursting with eagerness to put our Labour values into practice in the next government. Any suggestion that the unity and passion of Labour members and trade unionists in support of proportional representation (PR) is somehow a defeat for the leadership is a complete misunderstanding. PR is a unifying policy across the Labour movement, and its popularity at the conference this year shows that members have more in common than anything that could divide us. Sandy Martin Chair, Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform \u2022 John Harris is correct to point out the anomalies of the first-past-the-post system (Truss is on an economic rampage with no mandate. So why is Starmer resisting electoral reform?, 25 September), but a move to PR would not necessarily provide a more democratic solution or lessen the likelihood of being subjected to Tory policies. There is no perfect electoral system. Under PR, there would be hung parliaments and coalition governments, preceded by horse-trading between the coalition partners, where compromises are made behind closed doors. Harris points out that in the 2019 general election, the Tories received one seat for every 38,000 votes, while for Labour it was one seat for every 51,000. But this \u201cwinner\u2019s bonus\u201d, a feature of first past the post, has benefited Labour when it has been the leading party, such as in 1997, when Labour received one seat for every 32,000 votes compared with the Tories\u2019 one for every 58,000. First past the post also has the advantage of preventing extreme parties from gaining power. In 2015, Ukip only received one MP in return for nearly 13% of the popular vote, and there was never any serious possibility of the BNP winning seats. Glyn Evans Ellesmere Port, Cheshire \u2022 The simplest solution, easier than PR for voters to understand, would be to require all members of parliament to have a simple majority of votes cast. In any constituency where this is not achieved, there would be a runoff election a week later, with only the two frontrunners on the ballot paper. This proposal is easily understood and irrefutably sound. Michael Radcliffe Parwich, Derbyshire \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

            "content": "Bravo for the Labour party and a new cadre of trade union leaders who this week showed unequivocal support for overhauling our archaic voting system. Labour conference delegates overwhelmingly backed a motion calling on the party to embrace proportional representation. How could it be otherwise when a fanatical cult of free-marketeers has seized power and crashed the economy? Progressives almost always outvote the right, according to the Electoral Reform Society. But the right nearly always wins under the current first-past-the-post system because the centre and centre-left vote has been fatally split ever since the rising Labour party failed to kill off the remnant of the old Liberals. At the last local elections, in 85% of seats just one rightist \u2013 a single Tory \u2013 confronted an anti-Tory vote split between two or three Labour, Lib Dem and Green candidates. Readers of these pages know the well-rehearsed reasons why the Guardian backs electoral reform. The political scientist Sir John Curtice says the system is now more biased towards the Conservatives than at any time since the 1950s, when Labour on its own outpolled them but lost. At the next election, the Tories only need a five-point lead to win, while Labour needs to be 12 points ahead because the latter\u2019s voters are clumped in the same seats, while Tory supporters are spread more widely. According to political academic Prof Robert Ford: \u201cCitizens living in countries with more proportional electoral systems are more politically engaged and turn out more in elections\u201d, delivering \u201chealthier democracies with happier voters\u201d. And it\u2019s easy to see why: voters here are confined to holding their noses and choosing between one of two big, uncomfortable coalitions: far left and social democrats in Labour, or pro-EU traditional Conservatives and far-right Brexit free-marketeers in the Tories. There is no hope for new parties and no way for voters to express a particular opinion, causing a dangerous disillusion with politics that threatens democracy itself. Roy Jenkins\u2019 compromise solution, commissioned by Tony Blair \u2013 combining constituency links with a proportional top-up \u2013 sits gathering dust on the shelf. So what\u2019s preventing Keir Starmer and his team from embracing what his party so demonstrably wants and what the majority of the public, for the first time, supports? Two things: one understandable, the other disgraceful. Starmer himself and most of those around him are instinctive reformers, for all the above good reasons. But they take fright easily, only newly arrived at believing they could actually win the next election. Might the chameleon Tories reform and revive in the next two years? Might those eternal zombies spring from their political grave? To do that, the Tories need to make the next election about anything except the economy, pay, the cost of living, sky-high mortgages and derelict public services. They will, no doubt, scramble for any culture war issue they can drum up, preferably a return to Brexitry. They will grub up any phoney distraction \u2013 and a Labour manifesto pledge to reform the voting system might just fit the bill. The Mail has been testing its teeth on this already: \u201cTory election planners fear Labour will back bid to axe \u2018first-past-the-post\u2019 system next month \u2013 risking a \u2018coalition of chaos\u2019 that could lock Conservatives out of power for a generation.\u201d This week they stirred up MP Maria Caulfield, whose Lewes seat will probably return to the Lib Dems, to warn: \u201cFor all his bluster, Keir Starmer is keeping the door open to a grubby backroom deal with the Liberal Democrats because he can\u2019t rely on running on his own record. And we know the price of Lib Dem support will be to renege on the referendum result and Brexit.\u201d Never mind that it\u2019s nonsense: the Conservatives might manage to make the Brexit threat fly, pretending that it is the price the Liberal Democrats would demand. It is true that proportional representation would prevent the Tories in their current demented form ever again winning alone. Imagine how they might blow this up into an entirely mendacious \u201cLabour gerrymandering threat to democracy\u201d. Look no further than the scandalous lies the no side told during the alternative vote referendum in 2011, preposterously claiming its cost would take money from babies\u2019 incubators, as they cut their teeth on how to lie in the Brexit referendum. Does Labour really want to commit to an electoral reform referendum consuming its first few months? The complex pro argument will be hard to make against the hailstorm of the Tory press defending their indefensible electoral advantage. Fear that backing proportional representation could lose Labour the election is a genuine enough reason for concern. The disgraceful reason why a minority in the party, comprising tribal dinosaurs, reject it, however, is that it means Labour, too, would never win alone again, losing seats to the Greens and any new socialist party that may emerge. Since Labour rarely wins anyway, that\u2019s a very bad reason. What matters is that progressives can coalesce to keep out the kind of right that has brought us to this crisis. A progressive coalition of well-defined parties commanding influence in government according to their strength would secure a progressive future. Letting extreme Tories win mostly is a rotten price for preserving the old Labour party. If Labour needs Lib Dem support to get its budget and legislation through, Ed Davey has to show he is no Nick Clegg by refusing absolutely without proportional representation, with or without a referendum. Clegg threw everything away, allowing a weak alternative vote system instead of proportional representation on the ballot paper, and failing to force David Cameron to back it. This time the Lib Dems will be wiser if they hold swing votes. They have learned bitter lessons. But if Labour wins outright, never mind what they timidly said before the election, they must do it. Remember what happened in 2010 with George Osborne\u2019s first austerity budget: he swept away almost everything good Labour did in its 13 years because, aided by the folly of Lib Dems infatuated with red boxes, he could impose extreme policies. A proportional representation-elected Commons wouldn\u2019t be able to command a majority for such extremism. Why yet again toil to bring in decent policies, only for the political pendulum to swing back and knock them all away again? This is a risk worth taking. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"

            "date": "2022-09-25T12:49:38Z",
            "content": "The new Metropolitan police commissioner is at loggerheads with the National Black Police Association after refusing to meet its president and suggesting he will ban officers from \u201ctaking the knee\u201d. A request by the group\u2019s head, Andy George, for an urgent meeting with Sir Mark Rowley, who returned to lead Scotland Yard a fortnight ago, was said to have been rejected in an email on Wednesday morning. George, who had regularly met Rowley\u2019s predecessor, Cressida Dick, described the decision as \u201cbaffling\u201d at a time when levels of confidence in Scotland Yard among black and ethnic minority officers and the wider community are at rock-bottom. George had wished to raise issues including the shooting of Chris Kaba, an unarmed 24-year-old black man in Streatham Hill, south London, on 5 September. The snub follows Rowley\u2019s suggestion in his first media interviews that he would prevent Met officers from taking the knee as it equated to aligning with a protest group, a stance George described as \u201cvery disappointing\u201d. The comments were echoed in an open letter to police chiefs in England and Wales from the home secretary, Suella Braverman, who ordered an end to \u201csymbolic gestures\u201d. George, a serving inspector in the Police Service of Northern Ireland who is mixed race, said he was concerned Rowley had appeared to describe the gesture in support of equality as \u201cpolitical\u201d. George said: \u201cI am not ever going to force anybody to take the knee, but if someone feels compelled to do so I think it is wrong for policing to restrict their support for a really important cause. It is not about making a political statement. How can equality of opportunity or any equality matter be seen as a political gesture? \u201cEquality is what we should all be pushing for as a police service. It is certainly the reason I joined: to stick up for people who cannot defend themselves. And again it leads to how that plays out in black communities in London at a time when the crisis in confidence is at its peak in those communities? I find it is really disappointing.\u201d Rowley, 57, a former head of counter-terrorism who left the Met in 2018 to work for consultants Deloitte and Quest Global, a business intelligence firm founded by former Met commissioner Lord John Stevens, has rejoined Scotland Yard at a moment of crisis. The Met was placed in special measures in June and on Thursday, His Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services published a damning report highlighting how victims of crime were being failed. Rowley is meeting with the president of the Metropolitan Black Police Association, a police sergeant who sits on the board of the NBPA, but George said it was difficult for internal organisations to challenge the leadership of Scotland Yard adequately for fear of repercussions down the line. He said: \u201cIn the last couple of days, I asked for an urgent meeting with the commissioner and the deputy commissioner and it was turned down. It was turned down even though I had regular meetings in the diary with the last commissioner [Cressida Dick]. I met her, I would say, five times in the last two years as president. I ultimately find it baffling. \u201cI said it is disappointing, obviously, and different to the previous arrangements where I met the commissioner on a quarterly odd basis, and I got back that that was not the recollection that they had around the previous arrangements. Well, I have got the meeting invites.\u201d A spokesman for the Met said George had been invited to join the next meeting between Rowley and a representative of the Met National Black Police Association. George said the Met had been repeatedly let down by its leadership, further claiming: The Met was \u201cgaslighting\u201dblack and ethnic minority communities and the police officers who served them on the issue of stop and search. \u201cReport after report we have: \u2018We are going to get things right and move on but our officers do a great job.\u2019 But that does not lead to improvement,\u201d said George. \u201cIt kind of almost gaslights the communities that are coming out with the problems. It gaslights the frontline officers as well, if I am to be honest. They are saying: \u2018You are telling me I need to do more stop and search and I am going to do that to prevent serious violence and knife crime issues and then I am the one facing an Independent Office for Police Conduct investigation for doing exactly what you have told me.\u2019\u201d In recent years, there had been four-fold surge \u2013 from 15 to more than 60 \u2013 in the number of officers being supported by the Met Black Police Association over grievances or during disciplinary processes. George said: \u201cWe are supporting officers with grievances that just aren\u2019t being dealt with. Even when there are two or three people complaining about the same person, that discrimination is still being justified. They are still protecting the reputation of the Met over learning and improving.\u201d The career structures within the Met appeared to \u201coperate like an organised crime gang\u201d. George said: \u201cYou will not get promoted unless you take the party line. We have bosses and leaders that end up developing and sponsoring people that they like and [are] loyal to them, and they will pull them through.\u201d In response to George\u2019s comments, Rowley said he hoped to be judged by his actions on racism in Scotland Yard. He said: \u201cRacism will not be tolerated at the Met. We will be ruthless in hunting for and removing racists and others guilty of prejudice from the organisation. It is my belief the Met should be judged on actions, where words and gestures often fail. \u201cI have a clear plan for change at the Met but I am under no illusion that I will achieve this on my own. \u201cI have been heartened by the way communities and the workforce have reached out to support my new direction. I\u2019m grateful for the many conversations in my first 10 days as commissioner, influencing my plan for reform, including with representatives from the Met\u2019s Black Police Association. \u201cI will keep these conversations going.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-09-25T17:30:40Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s social contract, framed in times of abundance and optimism, promises significant government services and financial support for citizens. But an ageing population means fewer taxpayers and greater demands on the public purse. Over the next decade, Australia\u2019s old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of people aged 65 and over to the working-age population) will change from about four workers to three workers for every retiree. Lower tax receipts and higher spending on pensions, health and aged care may cost around $40bn every year (about 8% of the budget). Given concerns about debt levels and budget repair, government revenues must better align with outlays if Australians want continuation of expected benefits, cost-of-living relief and expenditure on ameliorating the rising costs of more frequent climate change induced weather events. Australia\u2019s overall taxation level at 28% of GDP is below the OECD average of 34% and at least 10%% less than that of Germany, France and Scandinavia. Addressing the tax take and how it is raised is a pressing issue. Australia\u2019s tax base is narrow, dependent on personal income taxes which at 42% of all federal tax revenues is also below the OECD average of 49%, after adjustment for social security payments which many countries levy to fund unemployment support, age and disability pensions. Given Australia\u2019s reasonably progressive tax scale and a highest marginal tax rate of 47% (including the Medicare levy), scope for increases is limited if the country wishes to attract and retain skilled talent. Corporate taxes (about 17% v the OECD average of 10%) are difficult to increase because of Australia\u2019s industrial structure and high overseas ownership of businesses (about 79%) with earnings accruing overseas. A side-effect of globalisation and Australia\u2019s open economy is that personal and corporate income tax increases need to stay globally competitive in what is increasingly a race to the bottom. This may make increased consumption and wealth taxes unavoidable. Australia\u2019s GST, at about 12% of total tax revenue, is below the OECD average of 20%. Increases in the rate and coverage are one alternative. As at March 2022, total Australian household wealth reached $14.9tn ($574,807 a person). Since March 2020, it has risen 35%, due to increases in residential property values (up 40%) and superannuation balances (up 22%). Since the abolition of death duties in 1979, this wealth accrues largely tax free except for concessional capital gains imposts. Where to raise more taxes? Options include revising the capital gains tax regime and introducing inheritance taxes \u2013 Australia is one of few countries that does not tax bequests. Ultimately, primary residences and superannuation balances will need to be taxed or applied against post-work aged care and healthcare expenses. Wealthier Australians cannot continue to use their homes and superannuation as a tax-advantaged savings vehicle with the capital preserved at death for beneficiaries. Irregularities and anomalies need to be reduced. Government support must be targeted to ensure intended recipients benefit. Australia\u2019s childcare subsidies, for example, are available to families with income up to $356,756. Frequently distortionary, regressive and expensive concessions for investment in equipment that would be bought anyway, dividends, capital gains, superannuation and property must be reconsidered. Simplification of Australia\u2019s complex tax code of tens of thousands of pages is essential. It enables legal structuring of affairs to minimise tax liabilities. A simpler principle rather than detailed rule-based system and allowing retrospective penalties, where the legislative policy or intent is ignored, would reduce tax planning opportunities. But significant tax changes in Australia are difficult. Will Labor make the move? The GST, ultimately introduced by stealth, took decades. The ALP attributes its loss at the 2019 election to modest proposed alterations to taxation of dividends and negative gearing, since abandoned. Unwilling to attempt serious tax reform, governments rely instead on bracket creep \u2013 increased tax revenue from rising nominal incomes due to inflation which put taxpayers into higher tax categories. This has pushed up the average personal income tax rate from 24% in 2016-17 to about 27% now. Inflation indexing thresholds would force governments to be transparent about tax revenues. Understandably, it faces bipartisan opposition. Complexity facilitates pork barrel politics with governments tweaking concessions and provisions to placate different constituencies. A large tax advice industry of questionable productive value resists simplification as an existential threat. Voters are likely to reject proposals that adversely affect them financially. Without radical tax reform, Australia faces an insoluble public finance problem \u2013 demand for spending which cannot be met by taxes. The only other course of action is to wind back the country\u2019s cherished welfare net.

They also recommended anti-corruption measures to limit the amount of cash leaking out of the economy, helping the government to cope with the costs of a long war. After Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February, Kyiv implemented a series of emergency economic measures to cope with the disruption and extra military costs. While foreign governments have financed and supplied military hardware and training to support the war effort, Kyiv has funded most of its domestic policies by printing the local currency, the hryvnia, and deferring payments on $20bn of foreign debt. Nine economists working for an academic network of economists, the Centre for Economic Policy Research, which includes the former International Monetary Fund (IMF) economic advisers Simon Johnson, Barry Eichengreen, Maurice Obstfeld and Kenneth Rogoff, said the emergency measures had run their course and Ukraine needed to adopt a more strategic approach. The rating agency Moody\u2019s has forecast that Ukraine\u2019s budget deficit will hit 22% of GDP this year \u2013 $50bn \u2013 forcing the government to print money to fill the gap. A recent devaluation of the hryvnia has failed to ease pressure from international investors who have seen that \u201cmoral support for Ukraine is only partly translating into a strong financial lifeline\u201d. An increase in the central bank base rate to 25% has similarly failed to instil confidence in the management of the economy. The economists said the government should stop relying on the central bank to print money and begin taxing wealthy Ukrainians and sell war bonds to ordinary citizens. Ukraine has a flat personal income tax rate of 18%. A military levy introduced in 2015 adds a further 1.5 percentage points. \u201cIf the government cannot make these taxes progressive, it can introduce a progressive \u2018war surcharge\u2019. For example, the surcharge would apply only to income or capital above a certain threshold that may be easier to accept politically and could be rolled back after the war,\u201d the report says. The G7 and EU have announced official financing commitments to Ukraine worth $29.6bn. However, the country\u2019s allies and international financial institutions are understood to have only disbursed $12.7bn. The economists\u2019 report coincides with analysis by the World Bank, the EU and Kyiv that shows the impact of the war on the fabric of Ukraine and how the invasion has harmed its infrastructure, education system, health sector and pushed up poverty levels. As of 1 June, direct damage had reached more than $97bn, they said, with housing, transport, commerce and industry being the most affected sectors. Disruption to the economy is expected to cost another $252bn this year, cutting Ukraine\u2019s GDP by 15.1% and increasing the proportion of people in poverty from 2% to 21%. \u201cIn the next 18\u201336 months, about $105bn will be needed [from internal sources of finance and external donors] to address the most urgent needs,\u201d the report said. The economists\u2019 report suggests widening the tax base and increasing taxation rates to survive the period of conflict, pointing out that wartime governments have always done so. Moving away from a fixed currency would also alleviate pressure on the central bank to repeat July\u2019s 25% devaluation. A high-value currency encourages firms to rely on imports, which increases an already large balance of trade deficit. However, a free-floating currency could be highly volatile against the backdrop of see-sawing news about the conduct of the war. More controversially, the authors argue that market forces should become a larger feature of Ukraine\u2019s highly regulated economy. They said the government\u2019s achilles heel was persistent corruption and a hidden, untaxed business sector that would be difficult to reform using existing institutions, adding: \u201cTo this end, the aim should be to pursue extensive radical deregulation of economic activity, avoid price controls, and facilitate a productive reallocation of resources.\u201d Kyiv has recently begun selling its surplus electricity to the EU to generate foreign exchange after a loosening of constraints on generators. It has also put in place reforms of the labour market that allowed firms to \u201cfire workers relatively easily and unilaterally suspend elements of labour contracts\u201d. Equally, workers who want to move jobs no longer need to give their employers advanced notice."

            "date": "2022-09-08T06:59:36Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s first climate change legislation in a decade has passed federal parliament with support from the government, the Greens and key crossbench senators. Labor\u2019s climate bill \u2013 which includes the national targets of cutting emissions by at least 43% by 2030 (compared with 2005) and reaching net zero by 2050 \u2013 cleared the Senate 37 votes to 30 after the government accepted some minor amendments proposed by the ACT independent David Pocock. In addition to the Greens, it was backed by Pocock and the two senators from the Jacqui Lambie Network. It was opposed by the Coalition, One Nation and United Australia\u2019s Ralph Babet. The amended bill returned to the House of Representatives for the formality of a final vote at 4pm on Thursday. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, told the parliament \u201ctoday is a good day for our parliament and our country, and we\u2019re going to need many more of them\u201d. He said the passage of the legislation would send a message to the world that Australia was driving down emissions and was \u201cserious about reaping the economic opportunities from affordable renewable energy\u201d. \u201cLegislating these targets gives certainty to investors and participants in the energy market and will help stabilise our energy system,\u201d he said. The Liberal MP Bridget Archer again crossed the floor to support Labor\u2019s legislation, having argued her northern Tasmanian community expected her to vote in support of action on climate change. It passed the lower house 86 votes to 50. Bowen said other elements of the bill \u2013 including a requirement that the minister give an annual climate statement to parliament and strengthened public advisory powers for the Climate Change Authority \u2013 would improve transparency and accountability. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Senate vote followed an at times fractured debate in which Pocock was forced to withdraw an unparliamentary remark after describing contributions from some senators who questioned the science of climate change as \u201cbullshit\u201d. The passage of the bill was broadly welcomed by business groups and the environment movement, though climate activists urged the government to do more. It comes more than eight years after the Abbott government repealed a climate bill that included an economy-wide carbon price scheme. The 2022 legislation is comparatively modest and does not include measures to cut emissions in the private sector. Those will follow in the months ahead when the government attempts to change the safeguard mechanism, which covers emissions from big industry. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the passage of the bill was a \u201csmall step\u201d in tackling the climate crisis, but immediately flagged the party would pressure the government on the safeguard, which was introduced by the Coalition under Tony Abbott ostensibly to prevent increases in industrial emissions. In practice, companies have been allowed to increase pollution without penalty and industrial emissions have continued to rise since it began in 2016. The government has released a consultation paper on changes to the safeguard mechanism that it intends to introduce next July. It would involve 215 major polluting facilities covered by the scheme being set new emissions baselines, or limits, that would be gradually reduced over time. Companies will either have to cut emissions onsite or buy carbon credits to stay within their baseline. Bandt framed the debate over the safeguard as being primarily about coal and gas developments, saying 50% of the pollution covered by the scheme came from fossil fuel industries. He said Labor\u2019s choices over the safeguard design \u2013 including whether it hoped to win support from the Greens or Coalition to pass legislative changes needed \u2013 would \u201cset the course of climate policy for the next decade and determine whether pollution rises or falls\u201d. He said the policy was a \u201crent seeker\u2019s paradise\u201d and \u201cthe wrong way to go\u201d to cut emissions from industry, but that the Greens were ready to work with Labor to improve as long as the changes ensured that pollution actually went down. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown very clearly we\u2019ve been prepared to work constructively with the government to get action on climate,\u201d Bandt said. \u201cNow the rubber hits the road as the government starts to tell us exactly how they\u2019re going to cut pollution from these big coal and gas plants.\u201d The opposition\u2019s climate change, Ted O\u2019Brien, said the legislation would \u201cwrap a new layer of red tape around the Australian economy\u201d. \u201cLabor\u2019s legislation is a direct attack on Australian jobs and the prosperity of our regional communities,\u201d he said. The Australian Industry Group, a national employer association, disagreed. \u201cThe passage of the climate change bills through the senate provides a useful basis for business, government and the community from which to work towards Australia\u2019s ever more challenging emissions goals,\u201d the group\u2019s chief executive, Innes Willox, said. The Australian Conservation Foundation\u2019s Gavan McFadzean said it was good that parliamentarians had worked together to support climate action. \u201cIt is heartening to see Australia\u2019s legislators finally taking the climate crisis seriously,\u201d he said. He urged the government to move quickly to turn the safeguard mechanism \u201cfrom a broken tool into an effective scheme to cut emissions from the nation\u2019s major polluters\u201d."

            "content": "Flood maps used by the federal government are outdated, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or Fema, said on Sunday, considering a series of devastating floods caused by excessive rainfall induced by climate change. Deanne Criswell told CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cThe part that\u2019s really difficult right now is the fact that our flood maps don\u2019t take into account excessive rain that comes in. And we are seeing these record rainfalls that are happening.\u201d Criswell was questioned about the situation in Jackson, Mississippi, where city water facilities failed in the aftermath of heavy flooding on the Pearl River, leaving residents without drinkable or usable water. On Sunday, thunderstorms and heavy rain pounded parts of north-west Georgia, sparking flash floods. Local news reports showed roads under water and homeowners struggling. The Georgia governor, Brian Kemp, declared a state of emergency in Chattooga and Floyd counties, directing all state resources to help with \u201cpreparation, response and recovery activities\u201d. The National Weather Service (NWS) reported rainfall of up to an inch an hour. Up to 12in was estimated to have fallen, according to Kemp\u2019s executive order. \u201cThis is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation,\u201d the NWS said. \u201cDo not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order.\u201d Such excessive rainfall and flooding will bring back into focus difficulties in predicting and responding to the climate crisis. Criswell said Fema would work with local jurisdictions \u201cto help them better identify what their needs are and help them create better predictive models, because we have to start thinking about what the threats are going to be in the future as a result of climate change, so they can put the mitigation measures in place\u201d. Last month, rainfall in Missouri, Kentucky and Illinois broke century-old records, causing devastation to communities, buildings and infrastructure. \u201cFema\u2019s maps right now are really focused on riverine flooding and coastal flooding and we work with local jurisdictions to update the maps,\u201d Criswell said. A 2020 study of flood risks by the non-profit First Street Foundation that analyzed every property in the 48 contiguous US states found federal maps underestimated by 67% the number of homes and businesses in significant danger. In Georgia on Sunday, the NWS declared a \u201cflash flood emergency\u201d for Summerville, Lyerly and James H Floyd State Park in Chattooga county. Floyd county, just to the south, was also under a flash flood warning. The NWS advised people to avoid non-emergency travel. The city of Summerville advised residents who use the city\u2019s water services to boil water prior to drinking, cooking or preparing baby food, due to flash flooding at the Raccoon Creek filter plant."

            "date": "2022-09-13T17:30:43Z",
            "content": "The Albanese government has appointed three women with environmental backgrounds to the board of the Climate Change Authority in a bid to counter concerns the advisory body was taken over by business leaders under the Coalition. The authority was given expanded responsibilities under climate change legislation that passed parliament last week, including advising the government on future emissions reduction targets and an annual statement to parliament by the climate change minister. The advice must be made public, and the minister must explain why if he rejects it. Climate activists have questioned whether the authority\u2019s existing board is qualified to offer scientific advice after the Coalition appointed several business leaders to fill board vacancies. The chair is Grant King, a former head of Origin Energy and president of the Business Council of Australia. The former Greens leader Christine Milne has called for King to be replaced by a climate scientist. Under changes to be announced by the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, on Thursday, there is no change to the existing six board members, but he has made three appointments to fill vacancies. The new members are the biologist Prof Lesley Hughes, a distinguished academic who has held government advisory roles and is a member of the Climate Council, Dr Virginia Marshall, a legal researcher who has worked on Indigenous water rights, and Sam Mostyn, a businesswoman and sustainability adviser who was chair of the climate advocacy group 1 Million Women. Bowen said they would bolster the authority\u2019s role in \u201cproviding independent advice to government on the reduction of the nation\u2019s emissions and climate change policy\u201d. \u201cWith this expanded membership, the authority is better placed to oversee emissions reduction efforts and provide government with expert advice,\u201d he said. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the appointments were \u201ca welcome change from the coal and gas advocates appointed in the past\u201d. \u201cI hope this is the beginning of the Climate Change Authority returning to a focus on the science of how we power past coal and gas and fight the climate crisis,\u201d he said. The authority was created in 2012 as part of a suite of climate policies agreed by the Gillard government, the Greens and independent MPs. The Coalition under Tony Abbott tried to abolish it, but failed. Instead, it cut its funding, slashed its staffing and sidelined its advice. Milne, who was the Greens\u2019 climate spokesperson when the authority was introduced, said the new appointments were important, and praised Hughes\u2019 inclusion in particular. But she said she believed the makeup of the board meant the new appointees would have an \u201cuphill battle\u201d in getting their colleagues to take climate science seriously and not prioritise the future of the gas industry."

            "content": "Rightwing voters in Australia are less likely to consider climate change a major threat compared to rightwing voters in most other comparable nations, according to a major international survey. The latest Pew Research Centre survey, however, showed that overall more Australians are worried about climate change than ever before. Australia was the only non-European nation in the survey to rate climate change as the greatest threat from the five threats listed, with 71% of respondents rating it their number one concern. But there were stark differences between the views of those who identified as rightwing and leftwing on the issue of climate change in Australia, compared with most other surveyed countries, bar the US. Some 91% of Australian respondents who self-identified as being on the left side of politics said climate change was a major threat, while just 47% of those on the right thought the same way. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In the UK, by contrast, 84% of leftwing respondents said climate change was a major threat, while 68% of rightwing respondents agreed. In France, 86% of leftwing respondents said it was a major threat, as did 75% of rightwing respondents. The political divide on the topic in Australia was the second highest, with only the US ranking higher, where 85% of leftwing respondents said climate change was a major threat, but just 22% of rightwing respondents agreed. Less than 50% of rightwing respondents in Canada and Israel also said climate change was a major threat, though the gap between left and right was less pronounced than Australia. The gap between Australian men and women on the topic was also vast, with 64% of male respondents finding climate change to be a major threat compared to 78% of female respondents \u2013 one of the highest divides of the 19 nations. Continuing that trend, age was also a major difference in thinking in Australia, with 85% of people aged between 18 and 29 ranking climate change as a major threat compared to 63% of those 50 and older. But compared to the 2013 survey, when just 52% of Australians ranked climate change as a major threat to the country, more Australians were awake to the danger, with seven out of 10 respondents believing it to be a serious concern. That rise in concern tracks with last year\u2019s Climate of the Nation result, which also found Australians were increasingly anxious about the changing climate. Respondents were asked to rank their concerns over five global threats, with the spread of false information online, cyber-attacks from other countries, the condition of the global economy and the spread of infectious diseases rounding out the list. Australians were less worried about the impact of the other four threats on the list, including the spread of infectious diseases, with Australians only moderately (2%) more worried than in 2020 when 59% of people rated it a major threat. Australia is already feeling the impact of a changing climate, with more frequent and more severe natural disasters. A new study published in the journal Communications Earth &amp; Environment suggested even if the world was to meet the Paris agreement and limit global warming to 2C, exposure to dangerous heat will \u201clikely increase by 50-100% across much of the tropics\u201d. That includes northern Australia. Dangerous heat was classified as being above 39C. The Albanese government has refused to rule out approving new fossil fuel mining projects and recently opened up another 47,000 sq km of Australian waters to oil and gas exploration. The Pew Research survey included 2,034 Australians who were polled (mostly online) between 15 and 28 March. The survey carries a 2.8% margin of error."

            "title": "Carbon capture is not a solution to net zero emissions plans, report says",
            "date": "2022-09-01T05:00:45Z",
            "content": "Carbon capture and storage schemes, a key plank of many governments\u2019 net zero plans, \u201cis not a climate solution\u201d, the author of a major new report on the technology has said. Researchers for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) found underperforming carbon capture projects considerably outnumbered successful ones by large margins. Of the 13 projects examined for the study \u2013 accounting for about 55% of the world\u2019s current operational capacity \u2013 seven underperformed, two failed and one was mothballed, the report found. \u201cMany international bodies and national government are relying on carbon capture in the fossil fuel sector to get to net zero, and it simply won\u2019t work,\u201d Bruce Robertson, the author of the IEEFA report, said. Despite being a technology still in development, carbon capture and storage has been put forward as a key element in the UK\u2019s plans to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Proposals put forward by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) suggest that up to 30m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions will need to be captured and sequestered every year in the UK alone by the mid-2030s, if targets are to be met. Internationally, to align with goals to reach net zero by 2050, annual CCS capacity will need to reach 1.6bn tonnes of CO2 every year by 2030, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has said. IEEFA\u2019s report said that although carbon capture and storage is a 50-year-old technology, its results have been varied. Most CCS projects have since reused captured gas by pumping it into dwindling oil fields to help squeeze out the last drops, it pointed out. This \u201cenhanced oil recovery\u201d (EOS) accounts for about 73% of the CO2 captured globally each year, in recent years, according to the report. Roughly 28m tonnes out of the 39m tonnes captured globally, according to its estimates, is reinjected and sequestered in oil fields to push more oil out of the ground. \u201cEOR itself leads to CO2 emissions both directly and indirectly,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe direct impact is the emissions from the fuel used to compress and pump CO2 deep into the ground. The indirect impact is the emissions from burning the hydrocarbons that could now have come out without EOR.\u201d A further challenge is finding suitable storage sites for carbon sequestration, where the gas will not merely be used to push out more oil. According to the report, trapped CO2 will need monitoring for centuries to ensure it does not leak into the atmosphere \u2013 raising the risk of liability being handed over to the public, years after private interests have extracted their profits from the enterprise. The risk is that CCS technology will be used to extend the life of fossil fuel infrastructure long past the cut off point for maintaining atmospheric carbon at less than catastrophic levels, the report suggested. \u201cAlthough [there is] some indication it might have a role to play in hard-to-abate sectors such as cement, fertilisers and steel, overall results indicate a financial, technical and emissions-reduction framework that continues to overstate and underperform,\u201d Robertson said. However, he added: \u201cAs a solution to tackling catastrophic rising emissions in its current framework, CCS is not a climate solution.\u201d A Beis official disputed the report\u2019s claims, pointing to Norway\u2019s Sleipner and Sn\u00f8hvit sites as examples of successful carbon storage. The UK had potential to store 78bn tonnes of CO2, and doing so was essential to meet net zero emissions targets, the official said. \u201cWe are determined to make the UK a world leader in this field and are exploring the potential of CCS as part of our plans for industrial decarbonisation,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe are supporting this through our \u00a31bn carbon capture infrastructure fund and have committed to establishing two CCS industrial clusters by the mid-2020s and a further two by 2030.\u201d The IEA was also contacted for comment."

            "date": "2022-09-07T12:38:16Z",
            "content": "For all the furore over Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s \u201cSorry you were out\u201d notes, used to shame civil servants who were working at home, he only printed and left three on unoccupied desks. \u201cIt was a PR stunt, pure and simple, and that\u2019s Jacob all over,\u201d says one Whitehall source with knowledge of the episode. The Cabinet Office minister\u2019s move did what it was designed to do: send a signal that Rees-Mogg \u2013 and by extension Boris Johnson \u2013 was on the anti-woke side of the culture war. He has played the role of Johnson\u2019s rightwing outrider for three years, saying the things the prime minister could not get away with, such as dismissing Partygate as \u201cfluff\u201d. And now he is poised to take on the same role for Liz Truss, for whom he hit the media during her campaign by describing her comments suggesting British workers need more graft as \u201csensible\u201d. For his loyalty, he has been rewarded with a plum cabinet job as business secretary and Rees-Mogg once again appears to have picked a winner during a Tory leadership campaign. But for Truss, keeping Rees-Mogg close is a gamble, given his polarising views and propensity to gaffes. He is unashamedly pro-fracking, is in favour of extracting every last drop of oil out of the North Sea and has decried \u201cclimate alarmism\u201d. Already, she has had to appoint another minister to sit in cabinet and look after the climate brief after an outcry from pro-green Tories. The new business secretary, who is strongly pro-deregulation, may also face questions over his continuing financial interests: he retained a substantial stake in the investment firm he co-founded, Somerset Capital Management, while in Johnson\u2019s cabinet. The new prime minister has shown her faith in Rees-Mogg by promoting him, but political sources say Johnson came close to sacking his ally on more than one occasion, most seriously when he suggested Grenfell fire victims should have had the \u201ccommon sense\u201d to escape. Rees-Mogg, who had hosted campaign dinners for Johnson at his \u00a35m Westminster townhouse, always found his way back into favour. \u201cWe all thought Jacob was bonkers and none of us thought he was a good spokesman for the government at that point,\u201d says one former Downing Street aide, recalling the middle of the 2019 election campaign. \u201cHe always just managed to say something bone-headed. He was told by No 10 to apologise or face the sack. And he was put in the freezer by Boris for goodness knows how long. But somehow he bounced back.\u201d His ability to shrug off criticism coupled with his lifelong hunger for the limelight is, they say, Johnson-esque. \u201cEven more than Boris, he\u2019s always been a proto-celebrity,\u201d says another person who has worked closely with him, pointing to his history of TV appearances as a \u201cyoung fogey\u201d on Have I Got News for You and an encounter with Ali G. \u201cHe\u2019s a tart. He\u2019s always everywhere, doing anything to get noticed.\u201d A regular figure in the diary columns before he entered political life, Rees-Mogg even appeared in a piece in the Daily Mail in 2007 talking about how his first child was conceived on the fifth day of his honeymoon in Seychelles and was due on his heroine Lady Thatcher\u2019s birthday. But Rees-Mogg has always seen himself as much more than a caricature. He is not short of confidence \u2013 or ambition. The scope of his ambitions was apparent in an interview he gave to French television as a besuited 12-year-old. Travelling in the back of a Rolls-Royce, Rees-Mogg declared he \u201cloves money\u201d and wanted to be a company executive by 30. And by 70? \u201cI would love to become prime minister,\u201d he pronounced. \u2018We don\u2019t know where he has come from\u2019 Born Jacob William Rees-Mogg in Hammersmith, London, in 1969, he is one of the richest ministers in the cabinet, with Spear\u2019s Wealth Management estimating in 2019 that his net worth is \u201cwell over \u00a3100m\u201d, including the expected inheritance of his wife, Lady Helena de Chair. His own background was wealthy but not blue-blooded, though his father, William Rees-Mogg, moved in privileged circles through his job as editor of the Times. His mother, born Gillian Morris, had been his father\u2019s secretary and now lives close to Gournay Court, a Grade II* listed Somerset mansion belonging to the Rees-Moggs and their six children. Rees-Mogg famously claims not to change nappies, instead relying on the services of his own former nanny, Veronica Crook, who looked after his own children and has worked for the family for more than five decades. One contemporary at Westminster Under School, Julien Garran, said the signs of ambition were always there. \u201cHe was pretty pushy even back then. I think he\u2019d been given some shares and I remember one time there was an article about him written up that he\u2019d harangued the CEO for not doing his job properly. At this point he was aged 11,\u201d he said. Describing him as \u201cunusual\u201d, Garran said: \u201cThat was probably the clearest example of his kind of character, and the fact that he was an unusually and surprisingly fast bowler. We were just kids but I think that part of his character probably came out at that point.\u201d None of his siblings appeared to show a similar love of Victorian traditionalism, although his sister, Annunziata Rees-Mogg, also had political leanings, running unsuccessfully as a Tory candidate and later becoming a Brexit party MEP. According to the biography of Rees-Mogg by the Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, his father once remarked to his school teacher: \u201cWe don\u2019t know where he has come from.\u201d After prep school, Rees-Mogg went to Eton, five school years below Boris Johnson and two below David Cameron. From there he went to Trinity College, Oxford, where one of his best friends was former Tory MP Louise Mensch, with whom he remains in touch. Those who know him from the time recall a nerdy but self-publicising young man, who was addicted to Cadbury\u2019s Creme Eggs and Eurosceptic student politics. Rees-Mogg did not, Mensch says, propose to her, and their relationship was always platonic, contrary to previous rumour, but she did base the \u201calt-romantic hero\u201d in her novel Venus Envy on him. \u201cHe is a sort of almost romance for our heroine and then she basically falls in love with somebody else and so does he,\u201d she says, adding: \u201cWe were just very, very, very close.\u201d Mensch says that one of Rees-Mogg\u2019s best qualities was being \u201cjust completely uninterested in pandering to what anybody else thought\u201d and that his love of tradition and the establishment is far from an act. \u201cThe anecdotes that come up about Jacob, that he likes to listen to the shipping forecast and stuff like that, that he would stand up whenever anybody played God Save the Queen, people think those things are affected or done for show in politics, though I can assure your readers that they are not. He has been doing those all his entire life, literally forever,\u201d she says. It was at Oxford where Rees-Mogg\u2019s Eurosceptic views developed, alongside Daniel Hannan, who would become a Tory MEP. \u201cIt was like three little Thatcherites toddling along and just having a great time,\u201d Mensch says. Andrew Bridgen, a Conservative MP who joined the same 2010 intake as both Rees-Mogg and Mensch, was on the same side as Rees-Mogg during the Eurosceptic battles for a hard Brexit seen in the Theresa May era. He echoes Mensch\u2019s view that Rees-Mogg is not playing a role. \u201cHe\u2019s the real deal. What you see is what you get,\u201d he says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a private and public persona.\u201d Others who have worked with him are not so sure. \u201cIs it a put-on job or has the mask eaten into the face? It\u2019s not clear,\u201d says the person who worked closely with him for years in politics. Properties, plagiarism \u2026 and potted plants During his time in business, Rees-Mogg worked in Hong Kong and Mayfair for hedge funds before setting up on his own. His ventures were a success, including Somerset Capital Management, which he established with financier Dominic Johnson and still has an interest in, receiving dividends. His property portfolio now ranges from Gournay Court to his Westminster townhouse, and his register of interests lists two flats in Pall Mall owned by his company, Saliston. His company also owns a further two properties, a former schoolhouse near Gournay Court and a bungalow in Midsomer Norton. He does, however, declare a farmhouse in Somerset from which rent is received. Neighbours of a farmhouse property and surrounding fields in Midsomer Norton, in his constituency, believe Rees-Mogg is the beneficiary of a trust that holds the land, although he has declined to answer questions about his ownership. With so much property wealth, Rees-Mogg has clearly made money in his own right, but he was always intent on entering politics, trying unsuccessfully in Central Fife in 1997 and The Wrekin in 2001. When he first came to parliament in 2010, Rees-Mogg was viewed as something of a joke figure, best known for his previous campaigning as a 27-year-old hedge fund manager in Scotland with the help of his family nanny and his father\u2019s Mercedes. His rival Labour candidate, former first minister of Scotland Henry McLeish, says he had to step in to stop the young Tory from being beaten up during that first foray into politics in 1997. \u201cI was just kind of his protector in a way because he was totally out of his constitutional, and I suppose class, depth because I\u2019m sure he had never encountered people like my supporters in his life,\u201d says McLeish. \u201cI have no idea how such a person could have gained the kind of stature he\u2019s got in terms of a cabinet position in the government.\u201d Cameron\u2019s modernising Conservative party did not put him on the A-list. But once in parliament, Rees-Mogg was seen by those at the top as almost a harmless idiot, making a number of early missteps, including attending a dinner of the Traditional Britain Group, who he later had to distance himself from when its rightwing supporters later backed \u201crepatriation\u201d of black people to Africa. There were also a number of long-forgotten scandals in his 2010 election campaign, in which he was caught plagiarising a Trevor Kavanagh column from the Sun and trying to pass off one of his own staff members as a voter on his election leaflet. He later drew criticism for suggesting that quotas for state-school and non-Oxbridge MP candidates could lead to the election of \u201cpotted plants\u201d to parliament and more recently suggested a rise in food bank usage was \u201crather uplifting\u201d in showing the charitable nature of the British people. There are also varying accounts about whether Rees-Mogg is as unflappable as he usually appears in public. His encounters with protesters show he is a rare MP who will happily talk even to those calling him scum, while in interviews the minister seldom appears ruffled by a line of questioning. But former Labour MP Peter Bradley says he saw another side to Rees-Mogg\u2019s usually composed character when he unsuccessfully stood for parliament in the Wrekin in Shropshire in 2001. At one hustings, says Bradley, a candidate from \u201cUkip or whatever kind of Brexit party\u201d caused Rees-Mogg to stop projecting \u201cthis calm superiority\u201d, instead going \u201ccompletely bonkers\u201d. He added: \u201cHe was being outflanked on the right by this anti-EU fantasist and he was really angry that he couldn\u2019t get to the right of this guy.\u201d He added: \u201cHe thought this was his shtick. As I say, it was performance art and this was his crescendo, his climax, and he wasn\u2019t at all pleased about it. He just lost his composure, which of course made the rest of the programme infinitely easier for me.\u201d This accords with the account of two people who worked with Rees-Mogg in the days of parliament\u2019s Brexit battles, who recall him seriously struggling over the decision not to join the \u201cSpartan\u201d holdouts but to back Theresa May\u2019s deal on the third attempt. They said they detected a sense of disappointment in himself that he was not as purely Eurosceptic as his self-image, but that he had been subject to pressures from friends, particularly those in business, begging him not to usher in a general election and the possibility of a Corbyn-led government. He did not throw his hat into the ring this time, but could Rees-Mogg ever stand to be leader himself? Colleagues say his devout Catholic views, as well as his rightwing ones, would be a problem \u2013 including being anti-abortion even in cases of rape or incest, his description of morning-after pills as \u201cabortifacients\u201d and his observation that he \u201ctook the whip\u201d from Rome in relation to his vote against gay marriage. But then many thought this and his extensive business interests would have been a barrier to him becoming a minister. Asked in the past whether he would like one day to be Conservative leader, Rees-Mogg has said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t put any money on it\u201d. However, he was said by those close to him to have been mulling the idea of a run. And, after all, Boris Johnson once claimed he was more likely to be reincarnated as an olive than to become prime minister of the United Kingdom. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 September 2022 because an earlier version described Somerset Capital Management as a hedge fund. To clarify: it is an investment firm."

            "title": "NSW becomes first state to treat carbon dioxide as pollutant to ensure industries cut emissions",
            "date": "2022-09-08T00:23:59Z",
            "content": "New South Wales will be the first state in Australia to start treating carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as pollutants, which will eventually require polluters to develop plans to cut emissions. The NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) on Thursday launched an eight-week consultation period for its draft climate change policy and related action plan. It marks the first step to require that polluters are on a trajectory towards net zero emissions by 2050. \u201cThe big issue here is that an Australian government is moving to comprehensively cover [carbon dioxide] and equivalent emissions as a pollutant,\u201d the new EPA chief executive, Tony Chappel, said. \u201c[The plan would] give regulatory teeth to its net zero commitment to ensure that the whole economy moves on that path efficiently and effectively.\u201d The EPA\u2019s approach was modelled in part on the US EPA\u2019s regulation of greenhouse gases, with fines and criminal sentences among the penalties. It was designed to complement the Albanese government\u2019s safeguard mechanism that will set a cap on carbon pollution on 215 large industrial facilities responsible for about 28% of national emissions. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning NSW\u2019s approach was triggered by a case brought before the state\u2019s land and environment court last year by the Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action. They argued the EPA had a duty under the Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991 to develop objectives, guidelines and policies to ensure environmental protection from climate change, and won. The state\u2019s environment minister at the time, Matt Kean, ordered the EPA not to appeal the mandamus order that an agency perform mandatory duties correctly. The EPA\u2019s approach could also prove a template for other states. Chappel said the state\u2019s 50% emissions reduction goal by 2030 was an important step on the route to mid-century carbon neutrality. \u201cHappily that\u2019s the NSW target but this is really a science-based approach,\u201d he said. A carrot in the policy will be the \u201chuge opportunities\u201d offered by the transition from fossil fuels, such as new forms of farming or lower cost energy. The state could \u201chave a new wave of prosperity and another sort of \u2026 mining boom in that we\u2019re mining the sun and the wind, and producing hydrogen, ammonia and green steel, and regenerating the landscape to produce agriculture sustainably\u201d, Chappel said. The impacts of global heating, whether in the form of worsening bushfires, floods or other extreme weather, meant \u201cbusiness and the community are already paying a very high price for our emissions intensity\u201d, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s also a real financial cost businesses are already paying in terms of access to insurance, access to capital markets, and access to export opportunities, as our trading partners transition very quickly to requiring low-carbon products.\u201d The EPA has planned eight weeks of consultation. The findings are due to be considered before a policy is formalised before Christmas. The agency would then begin detailed engagement with each sector of the economy on how each would cut emissions and demonstrate they are preparing for future climate impacts. \u201cIt\u2019s just too early to say what the suite of tools will be because we do want to quite genuinely engage with each industry sector, and understand how they are already acting to reduce their emissions and where the opportunities are,\u201d Chappel said. The approach was \u201cvery much informed\u201d by the lived experiences of disaster-hit regions. Chappel recently visited Lismore in the state\u2019s north to examine repairs for the region\u2019s sewage works. A barrier to protect against one-in-100-year floods was exceeded by several metres, wiping out all the pumping stations, treatment ponds and all the site\u2019s electronics. Landfills in the area also suffered \u201chuge damage,\u201d Chappel said. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s about limiting the environmental impact when these disasters happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best remediation is prevention. \u201cWe just anticipate a continuing worsening of these threats, obviously, as the climate continues to warm.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-09-18T17:30:21Z",
            "content": "The climate firm Labor used to model its policies before the federal election has advised the government to abandon a proposal that could hand free carbon credits to big industrial polluters \u2013 warning it could lead to Australia missing its emissions reduction targets. RepuTex \u2013 a consultancy that the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has described as Australia\u2019s top energy economists \u2013 issued the warning in a report on the safeguard mechanism, a policy that was introduced by the Coalition in 2016 to prevent increases in industrial pollution. In practice, the safeguard mechanism has not been a success as companies have been allowed to increase pollution without penalty and industrial emissions continued to rise. But Labor has promised to keep and reform it. It released an options paper last month for public consultation. RepuTex warned against an option that would give free carbon credits to the owners of industrial sites that emitted at a level below a newly determined \u201cindustry average\u201d. It said giving credits to individual companies on this basis, even if they had not cut their own pollution, could subsidise and lock in fossil fuel production and undermine the integrity of the safeguard. Under Australia\u2019s carbon credit scheme, each credit is meant to represent one tonne of carbon dioxide that has been reduced or avoided by, for example, growing native plants. Companies can buy credits, also known as offsets, as an alternative to cutting their own pollution. Under one proposal put forward by the government, a new type of credit \u2013 known as a safeguard mechanism credit \u2013 would be given to companies that emitted less than an industry-average baseline, or limit. These companies could sell these credits to companies that emitted above the industry baseline to cancel out their higher pollution. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning RepuTex said this was problematic because the new credits would not reflect a real cut in pollution and would therefore not be a genuine offset. Instead, they would just be a financial subsidy to \u201cslightly cleaner\u201d industrial facilities. Hugh Grossman, managing director of RepuTex, said people involved in the scheme would have little confidence that cuts were real if a carbon credit did not actually represent a one-tonne reduction in emissions. \u201cThe environmental integrity of the scheme \u2013 and Australia\u2019s 2030 target \u2013 could collapse,\u201d he said. The safeguard mechanism covers 215 major polluting facilities, including coalmines, gas production sites, aluminium smelters, steel plants, manufacturing sites and airlines. Labor has said it would require facilities to gradually reduce emissions from July next year to help meet the national targets of a 43% cut by 2030 (compared with 2005) and net zero by 2050. The RepuTex report said the proposal to give away free credits could lead to half the country\u2019s big fossil fuel sites initially getting a financial windfall instead of being required to make cuts. It said this could apply to the country\u2019s liquified natural gas (LNG) export production facilities, which have been responsible for most of the increase in industrial pollution over the past decade. Grossman said going down this path could create a subsidy for big polluters that emitted only slightly less than average, lock in fossil fuel production and delay investment in low-emissions technologies. \u201cJust because you are below average does not mean you are clean,\u201d he said. RepuTex said its modelling found a better strategy \u2013 also proposed in the options paper \u2013 would be to give every polluting site a site-specific trajectory to reach net zero. Grossman said it would ensure all facilities contributed to the 2030 target and that cuts were \u201creal and additional\u201d. RepuTex\u2019s warning follows concern over the integrity of Australia\u2019s existing carbon credit scheme. One of the scheme\u2019s architects, Prof Andrew Macintosh of Australian National University, has described it as \u201clargely a sham\u201d and a fraud on taxpayers and the environment. Labor has commissioned Prof Ian Chubb, a former chief scientist, to head a review of the scheme. It plans to allow these carbon credits to also be used under the safeguard mechanism once the review is complete. The consultation paper suggests international carbon credits could not be used initially. A spokesperson for Bowen said an extensive consultation process on the design of the safeguard mechanism was still under way. \u201cWe know industry and stakeholders will have a wide range of views on these reforms, which is why the Albanese government is going through this genuine consultation process. The government will consider these views on their merit before making any decisions on the final design,\u201d they said. Grossman said policy design on emissions reduction was \u201cat a major crossroads\u201d. \u201cIf market integrity is not prioritised, Australia\u2019s ability to meet its 2030 target and realise the economic benefits of the low-carbon transition, such as new investment and job creation, could be significantly undermined,\u201d he said. Submissions on the safeguard mechanism consultation paper close on Tuesday."

            "date": "2022-09-20T05:00:03Z",
            "content": "MPs have warned consumers may end up paying higher bills if the government rushes into providing further state support for power station owner Drax. As part of Liz Truss\u2019s \u00a3150bn energy bills freeze, renewable and nuclear power generators are being asked to supply electricity below current market rates. Officials have begun to \u201cnegotiate\u201d with generators on older wind, solar and nuclear contracts, which have benefited from windfall gains as the price of gas has soared, to persuade them to switch to newer, less lucrative deals, which lock in lower prices in return for guaranteed long-term income. It is understood Drax, which owns the vast power station complex in North Yorkshire and is Britain\u2019s single biggest source of carbon emissions, could also negotiate over units 2 and 3 at its plant, which receive renewable obligation certificate (ROC) payments for burning biomass wood pellets, making them eligible for the scheme. Generators are not obliged to negotiate with the government as the scheme is voluntary. Drax has not yet confirmed whether it plans to rework its contract. It said it is \u201cworking in partnership with the government to find ways in which we can support the country during the energy crisis this winter\u201d. However, there are growing fears that the government is in a weak negotiating position as generators will need to be convinced to forgo high prices that are unlikely to abate for some time, meaning officials could rush into deals that later prove a poor deal for taxpayers if the spike in wholesale gas prices quickly subsides. The thinktank Ember calculates that, from 2012 until 2027, when Drax\u2019s ROC subsidies end, it will have collected more than \u00a311bn in government payouts. It is understood the new contracts could stretch to between 10 and 15 years, opening up the possibility that Drax could land a further decade of state support. The company has drawn criticism from scientists and campaigners who have argued that burning wood to produce electricity is far from green and can even increase the CO2 emissions driving the climate crisis. Nuclear power station owners Centrica and EDF are keen to enter the initiative and have already begun talks with ministers. The initiative was formally unveiled hours before parliament was suspended due to Queen\u2019s mourning period. Charlotte Nichols, the Labour MP and member of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said: \u201cIt is vital that the terms of these renegotiated contracts receive proper parliamentary scrutiny, as it risks locking in higher prices over the longer term and continuing excessive subsidies for technologies we are moving away from as we head towards our net zero targets. \u201cSuch long-term financial decisions cannot simply be made unilaterally as a kneejerk response to our current energy crisis, and must be properly debated, with alternatives considered, before any decisions are made that cannot later be unpicked. Particular scrutiny needs to be given to any deal with Drax given the existing levels of government support.\u201d The Conservative MP Pauline Latham said: \u201cThe government is right to be looking at ways to bring down energy bills. But they should avoid locking bill payers into expensive new 15-year contracts to subsidise sources of energy with dubious environmental credentials. Instead, we should focus on building new renewables which are nine times cheaper than gas.\u201d The Friends of the Earth head of policy, Mike Childs, said: \u201cDuring a cost of living crisis and with wind and solar power so cheap, it\u2019s astonishing that the government is considering spending more public money on Drax. \u201cIf the company is to receive more subsidies, the government must at the very least ensure full transparency and proper parliamentary scrutiny.\u201d Truss and the chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, have opposed windfall taxes, however the EU\u2019s decision to impose an emergency levy may increase pressure on Truss to follow suit. The Times reported that some power generators believe a windfall tax would be better than being pushed to sign cut-price contracts. Drax said in July that profit before tax had jumped to \u00a3200m in the first half of the year, up from \u00a352m in the same period a year earlier, aided by high electricity prices. It upgraded annual profit forecasts, and has signed a deal with National Grid to keep its coal-fired operations open through the winter. In the past 12 months, its stock has risen 63% to 709p, valuing the company at \u00a32.84bn, after peaking at 831p in April. Kwarteng said last month, when he was business and energy secretary, that the importing of wood to burn in Drax power station \u201cis not sustainable\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t make any sense\u201d. A Drax spokesperson said: \u201cDrax is working in partnership with the government to find ways in which we can support the country during the energy crisis this winter. \u201cWe also plan to invest \u00a33bn by 2030 in critical renewable energy infrastructure projects, including bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and pumped hydro storage, which will support energy security as well as jobs.\u201d"

The California-based company confirmed it was responding to a \u201ccybersecurity incident\u201d, after the New York Times reported that a hack had accessed the company\u2019s network and forced it to take several internal communications and engineering systems offline. The hacker claimed to be 18 years old, according to the report. Uber confirmed that there are no issues with the company\u2019s service, which operates in more than 10,000 cities around the world. A hacker compromised the employee workplace messaging app Slack and used it to send a message to Uber employees announcing that it had suffered a data breach. Sam Curry, a senior engineer at non-fungible token creator Yuga Labs, said he was contacted by the Uber hacker on the HackerOne platform and had been shown \u201cvery convincing\u201d screenshots of full administrative access to Uber\u2019s cloud services. \u201cFrom my understanding, the attacker had keys to the kingdom after obtaining an internal file with credentials to nearly everything,\u201d Curry told the Guardian. He added: \u201cBased on the screenshots and my understanding of the hack, they likely had access to read/modify the cloud services which run Uber and store user information.\u201d The company has been hacked before. Its former chief security officer, Joseph Sullivan, is on trial on allegations he arranged to pay hackers $100,000 as part of an attempt to cover up a 2016 attack in which the personal information of about 57 million customers and drivers was stolen. Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University, said: \u201cAs the hacker does appear to have such high-level access it\u2019s also going to be difficult for Uber to know they have managed to remove the hacker from the network. It could mean a major rebuild of their systems, which will cause serious disruption.\u201d It appeared the hacker was able to gain access to other internal company systems, posting an explicit photo on an internal information page for employees, according to the New York Times. \u201cWe are in touch with law enforcement and will post additional updates here as they become available,\u201d Uber said in the tweet confirming the attack. The Slack system was taken offline on Thursday afternoon by Uber after employees received the message from the hacker. \u201cI announce I am a hacker and Uber has suffered a data breach,\u201d the message read, going on to list several internal databases that were claimed to be compromised, the report added. The New York Times reported that the person who claimed responsibility for the hack said they gained access through social engineering, a term for tricking an employee into granting access. The hacker sent a text message to an Uber worker claiming to be a company tech employee and persuaded the worker to hand over a password that gave them access to the network. The hacker, who had provided a Telegram account address, said they broke in because the company had weak security, according to the report. Staff at the company were instructed to not use Slack. Other internal systems, too, were reportedly inaccessible."

Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, says she will be looking at new cybersecurity laws to prevent similar breaches. The Optus attack has affected up to 10 million customers including 2.8 million people who had their licence or passport number leaked. O\u2019Neil told parliament on Monday that in other jurisdictions a data breach of this size would \u201cresult in fines amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars\u201d. \u201cI really hope this reform task is something we can work on collaboratively across the parliament,\u201d she said. On ABC\u2019s 7.30, O\u2019Neil added that the current level of penalties \u2013 a maximum of just over $2m \u2013 was \u201ctotally inappropriate\u201d. The minister flagged that the government would look at the cybersecurity requirements currently placed on large telecommunications providers to see if they were fit for purpose. She also suggested the government was looking at ways to ensure the passport and licence details of the 2.8 million affected customers could be flagged to provide additional protection against identity theft. O\u2019Neil told ABC Melbourne the data breach was caused by a \u201cvery significant error on Optus\u2019 part\u201d as the cyberhack \u201cwas not particularly technologically challenging\u201d. \u201cOne of the great disappointments for me as cybersecurity minister is that \u2026 a telecommunications company left open a vulnerability of this size. \u201cThe Albanese government is incredibly angry \u2026 and we have to do whatever we can to support those Australians to protect themselves.\u201d O\u2019Neil said \u201cat this stage\u201d the government does not have the capacity to fine Optus, but it would consider legislating such powers in the wake of the incident.

The minister said these were \u201cnot demonstrated\u201d by the data breach. The shadow home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, said the opposition was prepared to consider a new regime that imposed hefty fines into the hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cI am happy to look at it and see whether or not this is something that is too late to have an impact on Optus which I suspect it is, and also whether or not it is going to have a deterrent effect and what is the impact of that?\u201d Andrews told the ABC. Consumer group Digital Rights Watch said the breach highlighted the danger of collecting and storing large amounts of personal information and called for changes to the Privacy Act. \u201cWe need privacy laws that will ensure the companies only collect and store the minimum amount of personal information, and that there are harsh penalties when they collect more than they need, given the risk it creates for the individuals involved,\u201d the group said in a statement."

Two samples each of 100 user records were also posted, as well as a demand for $1m in cryptocurrency. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Jeremy Kirk, the executive editor of the Information Security Media Group (ISMG), who has been in contact with the user, was able to verify some of the information in the sample data and said it appeared to genuinely originate from Optus. The user claimed to have extracted the data from an unauthenticated application programming interface (API) \u2013 software that allows two different systems to talk to each other \u2013 meaning that login details were not required to access it. \u201cIf you were an Optus subscriber, and you logged in and you said, \u2018Show me my account info\u2019, that\u2019s an API grabbing your account information and bringing it back to you,\u201d Kirk said. \u201cYou\u2019re authenticated because you\u2019ve logged in \u2026 you don\u2019t have any broader access to anything else.\u201d Kirk said that the data breach appeared to have occurred because \u201cOptus exposed this quite powerful API that was connected to their entire customer database, apparently. And it was just on the internet.\u201d The user told Kirk in a message: \u201cNo authenticate needed. That is bad access control. All open to internet for any one to use.\u201d The user\u2019s claims were independently corroborated by a second source, Kirk said. A spokesperson for the Australian federal police said yesterday that the agency was aware of claims the data had been put up for sale. Optus chief executive, Kelly Bayer Rosmarin said on Friday that the company was not sure exactly how many customers had their details compromised, but said 9.8 million was the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d. The cyber-attack has potentially affected customers dating back to 2017, as Optus is required to keep identity verification records for six years. In the past, the telco has proposed changes to privacy laws that would enable customers to request their data be destroyed. Optus call centre staff have told Guardian Australia that the telco has been swamped with complaints through its online complaints form. Staff say they have not been informed when or if a dedicated hotline will be set up, but have been directed to call each complainant to \u201cresolve the issue\u201d, explaining to customers what people can do to manage their risk individually. Optus was contacted for comment."

            "title": "Darktrace shares slump after takeover talks collapse",
            "date": "2022-09-08T09:21:50Z",
            "content": "Shares in Darktrace, a British artificial intelligence and cybersecurity company, slumped by nearly 35% after the US private equity firm Thoma Bravo walked away from a potential takeover of the business, whose founder, Mike Lynch, is fighting extradition to the US on fraud charges. Despite full-year results that showed an increase in sales, helping the Cambridge-based company turn a profit after last year\u2019s heavy losses, investors sold off Darktrace stock in droves on Thursday, as the chances of a money-spinning takeover evaporated. Under City takeover rules, Thoma Bravo cannot return with an offer within six months, except for if certain conditions are met, such as a rival bidder entering the fray, or an agreement being reached directly with the Darktrace board. As Darktrace\u2019s stock tumbled on Thursday, closing down 34.5% at 337.1p, ShadowFall, a hedge fund that has taken big bets on its shares falling, said the end of Thoma Bravo\u2019s interest vindicated its belief that the company was overvalued. But in a statement accompanying Darktrace\u2019s annual results, its second as a public company after last year\u2019s stock market float, the chief executive shrugged off the dissolution of talks that could have triggered \u00a3200m in payouts for senior managers. \u201cBeing listed on the London Stock Exchange is exactly where we want to be right now,\u201d said Poppy Gustafsson, a former protege of Lynch, who still owns more than 12% of the company, together with his wife. Lynch\u2019s legal travails have cast a shadow over Darktrace, despite his involvement with the running of the business ending earlier this year. The billionaire, who has been described as Britain\u2019s answer to the Microsoft founder Bill Gates, is expected to learn within weeks whether he has won the right to appeal against extradition to the US, where he is facing charges over the $11bn (\u00a39.5bn) sale of his tech business Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard in 2011. His former lieutenant, the one-time Autonomy chief financial officer Sushovan Hussain, has been jailed over the same deal. When it floated on the stock market last year, Darktrace admitted there was a risk it could face potential money-laundering charges, should the proceeds of the Autonomy sale be found to have helped fund its growth. In the UK this year, the high court ruled that Lynch had duped HP into paying far too much for Autonomy, resulting in the US buyer taking a $9bn writedown on the value of its acquisition. The case focused on accounting trickery allegedly used by Autonomy staff to paint a false picture of how well its software was selling, including bringing forward revenues that should not yet have been booked. In Thursday\u2019s full-year result, Darktrace was at pains to be upfront about the timing of revenue accounting, revealing that $3.8m of revenue should have been booked in 2021, rather than reported in its 2022 first-half results. Despite the disclosure, the company reported a strong operating performance, as sales soared by nearly 46% to $415m, turning last year\u2019s $144m pre-tax loss into a $5m profit. \u201cSince listing on the public markets, we\u2019ve turbo-charged our growth by adding ground-breaking products to our platform, including our new Prevent [cyberdefence software] offerings,\u201d it said. \u201cWe have a proven business model, which is generating cash. Today\u2019s results are yet another example of our strong performance.\u201d Darktrace has been dogged by criticism from ShadowFall, a company that specialises in short-selling (betting against) companies it thinks are overvalued and currently holds a short position against the cybersecurity firm. \u201cSince our first short in September 2021, Darktrace has been a significant contributor to the ShadowFall Fund,\u201d said ShadowFall\u2019s managing partner, Matthew Earl. \u201cFor some time, we have struggled to satisfy ourselves of its investment quality. We see this morning\u2019s announcement [ending its takeover interest] as supportive of our view, and continue to believe that there are numerous issues with Darktrace, including accounting, governance, and cultural concerns.\u201d Darktrace has divided opinion since last year\u2019s float, soaring in value within six months as its conservatively priced float price of 250p shot up to 945p. It has since suffered huge falls after criticism from City analysts and ShadowFall, followed by a sharp rise in its stock market value, from \u00a32.6bn to \u00a33.6bn, on Thoma Bravo\u2019s bid interest. By mid-morning on Thursday, its market capitalisation was back down to just over \u00a32.5bn. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 September 2022. An earlier version described Mike Lynch as having \u201cday-to-day\u201d involvement in Darktrace until earlier this year. To clarify: his involvement had been latterly as a member of the company\u2019s science and technology committee."

            "date": "2022-09-07T05:00:40Z",
            "content": "It is an award-winning pioneer in the fast-growing cybersecurity industry, boasting veterans of the spy community and the British political establishment on its payroll. It is also the subject of admiring glances from a deep-pocketed US private equity house pondering a takeover that could lead to payouts worth \u00a3200m for its management team. But there are clouds hanging over Darktrace, in the shape of analysts\u2019 criticism of its business model and concerns about its workplace culture, not to mention an escalating legal battle over a multibillion pound fraud. Within weeks, a high court judge will decide whether Darktrace\u2019s founder, the British billionaire entrepreneur Mike Lynch, can prolong his fight against extradition to the US. There, the man sometimes dubbed Britain\u2019s answer to Microsoft founder Bill Gates would face charges of fraud relating to the $11bn (\u00a38.5bn) sale of Autonomy, the tech business he founded, to Hewlett-Packard. It has not gone well for the 57-year-old tech genius so far. Lynch\u2019s erstwhile lieutenant, Autonomy\u2019s finance director Sushovan Hussain, has already been jailed for five years over charges relating to the same events. In January, the high court ruled, in a civil fraud case brought by HP, that Lynch duped HP into buying his company. Almost simultaneously, the then home secretary Priti Patel determined that Lynch could be extradited. The charges, which he denies, carry a maximum custodial sentence of 25 years. Lynch\u2019s only hope of avoiding extradition is to be granted the right to appeal, with a decision expected this month. Failure would set the extradition wheels in motion. The uncertainty casts a shadow not just over Lynch but over Darktrace, despite its insistence that it is unaffected by Lynch\u2019s legal travails. Darktrace does at least have a good-sized chunk of the transatlantic political and espionage community in its corner. Its advisory board includes former MI5 director Baron Evans of Weardale, 35-year CIA veteran Alex Wade and former British home secretary Amber Rudd. Former Tory minister Lord Willetts is on the board, while another ex-CIA man, Marcus Fowler, runs US subsidiary Darktrace Federal. Last year, as Darktrace geared up for a stock market float, Rudd came out to bat for the company\u2019s effort to distance itself from Lynch, lamenting that a largely female leadership team was being starved of the spotlight because \u201cthe only name that seems to get mentioned is the founder\u201d. Documents filed before the float went some way to explaining that. Among the risks attached to the initial public offering, Darktrace admitted, was the prospect of liabilities arising from the Autonomy sale. These included potential money-laundering charges, should the proceeds of that deal be found to have funded \u00a36.6m in start-up loans that Lynch\u2019s investment vehicle, Invoke Capital, extended to Darktrace as it grew. But the links to Lynch don\u2019t end there. According to one person familiar with the company\u2019s early days, Lynch was far more than a source of funding. \u201cHe gets reported as being an early investor who gave them some office space,\u201d they said. \u201cIt was his idea, he was the creator, brought the first people in, named it, named the immune system [the AI cyber-defence system that has become Darktrace\u2019s flagship product].\u201d Up until earlier this year, when coverage of Lynch\u2019s trial reached fever pitch, he remained a member of the company\u2019s science and technology advisory council. Together with his wife, Angela Bacares, he still owns more than 12% of the company. This week, the company is preparing to announce its first set of financial results as a public company. But the longer-term backdrop is ongoing buyout interest that could soon take it private again, from US private equity group Thoma Bravo. Judging by the exuberant stock market reaction since bid interest emerged, a deal could be done at close to \u00a33.6bn, a figure Lynch claims would be higher were it not for the \u201cvindictive\u201d pursuit of him by the US authorities. Even at that price, Lynch and Bacares\u2019 share of the proceeds would be above \u00a3430m. The remaining management team, including chief executive Poppy Gustafsson, could share payouts of up to \u00a3200m, according to stock market filings issued last month. But one of Darktrace\u2019s most persistent critics, the hedge fund ShadowFall, contends that this very group of people should be giving investors cause for pause. \u201cThe prevailing view seems to be that the current management of Darktrace had relatively little to do with Autonomy,\u201d said Matthew Earl, managing partner of ShadowFall, which specialises in taking short positions at companies it thinks are overvalued, betting on their share prices falling. \u201cThat couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\u201d According to ShadowFall\u2019s research, about 41 former Autonomy employees ended up at Darktrace, of which more than 25 remain, including Gustafsson and chief strategy officer Nicole Eagan. During Lynch\u2019s civil fraud trial, lawyers for HP described Eagan as part of a trusted \u201ccabal\u201d around Lynch, as he came up with the very accounting strategies that prompted the US company\u2019s legal claim. Earl has also raised concerns about the proportion of Darktrace\u2019s budget that goes on research and development, an essential area of spend in a fast-developing area like cybersecurity. The company spends considerably less on this than competitors, he says. Rival Vectra has even openly mocked Darktrace\u2019s approach on its website, in a now deleted post. Another question mark, says Earl, is the churn rate, the speed at which companies that have paid for Darktrace\u2019s much-vaunted AI-driven protection are choosing not to renew their contracts. Darktrace typically runs on three-year contracts, says Earl. That means, he says, that a reported churn rate of 6-8% could be much higher, because the bulk of its customers have only signed up in the last two years and remain locked in to their contracts. This, ShadowFall argues, masks the rate of exit among those that are entitled to defect to a rival. \u201cWe think it\u2019s between 20% and 30%, which is much higher than competitors,\u201d said Early. If churn rates are that high, ShadowFall\u2019s analysis suggests it could be due to a hyper-aggressive sales culture. Earl claims to have identified an unusual number of complaints on job review website Glassdoor about toxic workplace behaviour in pursuit of new business. One former employee in the sales department, who spent more than a year at the company, says there is some truth in that. \u201cEverything we did was monitored through software on our computers,\u201d they said. \u201cSometimes they\u2019d ask why you had taken a five-minute break or asking why there hasn\u2019t there been enough activity on your laptop, monitoring the number of emails you were sending.\u201d The employee put this down to a highly aggressive sales culture as the company geared up for its stock market float and looked to burnish its credentials as a market leader. \u201cIt was stressful and sometimes toxic,\u201d they said. \u201cOn the other hand it was very lucrative.\u201d Darktrace did not return a request for comment."

            "date": "2022-09-02T14:03:32Z",
            "content": "The US added another 315,000 jobs in August as the jobs market remained strong amid signs of a worsening economy. The US jobs market lost 22m jobs in early 2020 at the start of the pandemic but roared back after the Covid lockdowns ended. It has remained strong despite four-decade-high rates of inflation and slowing economic growth. In July, the US unexpectedly added 526,000 new jobs, restoring employment to pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.7% in August from 3.5% in July but is still close to a 50-year low. The report also showed more people came off the sidelines in August and started looking for work. The remarkable strength of the jobs market has the Federal Reserve worried that as employers compete for workers, wage inflation will keep driving prices higher. Average hourly earnings have increased by 5.2% in the last 12 months \u2013 faster than the 3% annual growth pre-pandemic but less than the 8.5% annual rate of inflation recorded in July. The central bank has sharply increased interest rates in the hope of cooling the economy and bringing down prices. Last week the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, made clear the Fed intends to keep raising rates sharply as the central bank struggles to tamp down inflation. His speech triggered a meltdown on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones index losing 1,000 points. The latest jobs report is the last to be released before the Fed meets again in September. Nancy Vanden Houten, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said there was \u201cmuch to like in August\u2019s job report\u201d but added that it was unlikely to change Fed policy. \u201cThe modest slowdown in employment growth in August may be welcome by the Fed, but it won\u2019t prevent further sizable rate hikes in the months ahead,\u201d she wrote in a note to investors. Earlier this week the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, told reporters that the White House was \u201cexpecting job numbers to cool off a bit\u201d as the economy transitions from the \u201chistoric economic growth that we saw last year to a more stable and steady growth\u201d. There are mixed signals about the health of the job market. Large employers including Ford and Walmart have announced plans for widespread layoffs, and 50% of businesses surveyed by PriceWaterhouseCoopers last month said they were reducing their headcount or planning to. At the same time, the government reported this week there were 11.2m open job positions in July \u2013 two openings for every unemployed person. New claims for jobless benefits \u2013 seen as a proxy for layoffs \u2013 fell last week to a two-month low. The government\u2019s latest job report follows the monthly survey of private employers from ADP, the US\u2019s largest payroll supplier. Private employers added only 132,000 jobs in August \u2013 less than half the number ADP calculates were added in July. \u201cOur data suggests a shift toward a more conservative pace of hiring, possibly as companies try to decipher the economy\u2019s conflicting signals,\u201d said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. \u201cWe could be at an inflection point, from supercharged job gains to something more normal.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-09-11T17:29:06Z",
            "content": "The fragile state of Britain\u2019s economy will be underlined this week by official figures showing a renewed slump in consumer spending amid soaring living costs, before a possible slowdown in activity during the national period of mourning after the death of Queen Elizabeth II. City economists are forecasting a further rise in inflation to 10.2% in August when official figures are published on Wednesday, as the rising price of a weekly shop and sky-high energy bills add to the financial pressure on struggling households. This would mark a modest uptick from the July reading of 10.1%, which was the first time the consumer prices index had risen above 10% since the early 1980s. The figures come after the Bank of England delayed a decision over a further rise in interest rates from the current level of 1.75% this week, in a mark of respect for the Queen. With businesses, financial institutions and unions cancelling or pushing back major events amid the national period of mourning, the central bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee will wait until 22 September to act. Over the weekend it was confirmed that the Queen\u2019s funeral on Monday 19 September will be a bank holiday. While providing an opportunity for the public to pay their respects, the event could bring mixed blessings for businesses. Rail industry leaders said travel to and from London would be \u201cextremely busy\u201d, urging mourners going to the capital to plan their journeys in advance. Extra bank holidays can provide a boost to retail sales and hospitality spending. However, additional bank holidays have also led to a fall in monthly output for the economy as a whole, with businesses and factories closing their doors early. Official figures have shown a drop in monthly gross domestic product (GDP) for previous one-off bank holidays, including the Queen\u2019s golden and diamond jubilees in 2002 and 2012 respectively. Simon French, chief economist at the City broker Panmure Gordon, said one-off bank holidays in 2002, 2012 and earlier this year had lowered economic output by at least \u00a32bn. \u201cThere are few parallels for this moment and that makes forecasting particularly difficult,\u201d he told the Sunday Times. \u201cWe may not simply be talking about an extra bank holiday. There could be a prolonged period of national mourning.\u201d Government guidance published last week encourages companies to consider cancelling or postponing events during the period of mourning, especially on the day of the state funeral. However, there was no obligation to suspend business, with the decision at each firm\u2019s discretion. None the less, on Friday, some retailers temporarily shut their doors, and many events including conferences and sports fixtures due to be held this week have been postponed. Taken together, this suspension of normal business and cultural life could weigh on an already gloomy economic picture. Households have begun reining in their spending in response to soaring prices for basic essentials, with the City braced for figures confirming a drop in August retail sales in Great Britain when the Office for National Statistics publishes its latest monthly data later this week. Economists polled by Reuters expect a fall of 0.4% on the month, reflecting the downturn in wider economic activity as Britain drifts towards a lengthy recession. Last week the government set out plans to freeze energy bills at an average of \u00a32,500 a year for two years, as part of a package of support for homes and businesses that marks one of the biggest government interventions since the financial crisis. In her first major act as prime minister, Liz Truss said its energy price guarantee would \u201cgive people certainty on energy bills, curb inflation and boost growth\u201d. Economists believe the measures could prevent inflation from rising much further than current levels while helping to lessen the impact of recession. However, the Bank is still expected to keep raising interest rates amid the risk of high inflation becoming entrenched, and as the pound comes under pressure on global financial markets on the back of speculation over the cost of Truss\u2019s tax and spending plans. Figures released on Monday are expected to show that economic activity recovered in July after June\u2019s fall, when the platinum jubilee long holiday weekend weighed on growth. After June\u2019s 0.6% drop in UK GDP, City economists predict a monthly rise of 0.4% in July, while warning that this will represent a temporary respite amid wider pressure on businesses and households. \u201cJuly GDP should be disappointing,\u201d said Klaus Baader, an economist at the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \u201cRetail sales are likely to show renewed weakness. Inflation probably only edged up in August, but recently all the surprises have been to the upside, so we should be prepared for another.\u201d \u2022 This story was amended on 12 July 2022 to correct the June fall in GDP, which was 0.6% rather than the 0.1% originally stated"

            "date": "2022-09-30T12:46:55Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s been a week since the chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, delivered his \u201cfiscal event\u201d, heralding \u201ca new approach for a new era\u201d that left the Daily Mail cooing: \u201cAt last! A true Tory budget.\u201d The impact of which has been devastating, with even the generally Tory-supporting Economist saying the government\u2019s reckless incompetence may have already damaged it \u201cbeyond repair\u201d. Here we look at the key figures that defined one of the worst probation periods in history. \u00a365bn The Bank of England triggered an emergency \u00a365bn bond-buying programme on Wednesday to stem the crisis triggered by Liz Truss and Kwarteng\u2019s growth plan, which put entire pension funds at risk of insolvency. 4.3% The yields on 10-year gilts \u2013 UK government bonds \u2013 surged after Kwarteng\u2019s Friday announcement, rising from 3.5% to 4.3% before falling back to about 4.05% on Friday after the Bank of England\u2019s intervention. Yields are effectively the cost of borrowing to an issuer, in this case the UK government. Rising bond yields suggest a lack of willingness among investors to own the debt, as buyers demand a lower price to buy them. 10.6% The British Retail Consortium revealed food price inflation surged again to 10.6%, compared with an already staggering 9.3% last month. 232 The FTSE 100 has fallen by about 232 points since last Friday as jittery investors took flight. 33 Labour holds a 33-point lead over the Conservatives, according to a poll from YouGov. It is thought to be the largest poll lead held by a political party since the late 1990s. Labour is widely considered to have enjoyed a successful party conference, where it announced plans to form a publicly owned green energy company called Great British Energy. 1.03 The pound fell to a record low of 1.03 against the US dollar on Monday after Kwarteng doubled down on his \u00a345bn package of tax cuts by pledging to go further. The pound-dollar was about 1.12 on the day of the mini-budget, hit its low on Monday, and has returned to close to 1.12 on Friday. 1,621 As of Thursday, spooked lenders had withdrawn 1,621 mortgage products from the market, according to Moneyfacts, amid uncertainty over the future trajectory of base rates and the lack of faith in the government\u2019s plan. Eight The prime minister, Liz Truss, experienced a bruising round of eight BBC local radio interviews on Thursday morning. From Bristol to Stoke, and Lancashire to Kent, Truss was up against the ropes for much of the excruciating hour of exchanges, in which she frequently drifted off into uncomfortable silences, resorted to challenging \u201cthe premise of the question\u201d and in many cases providing answers to questions that had not been asked."

            "date": "2022-09-25T18:21:09Z",
            "content": "One of the curiosities of the sudden re-emergence of stark ideological dividing lines in the Liz Truss era has been the fact that her central policy aim \u2013 trying to grow the economy \u2013 is not something that Labour would disagree with. Similarly, for all the reactions of outrage and, at times, genuine surprise at Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s unofficial budget on Friday, the government\u2019s focus on cutting taxes does not, in the most basic terms, differ that much from Labour\u2019s previous criticism of tax increases under Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. The political dividing lines are shifting at speed, and for all Labour\u2019s largely unspoken delight at facing a government seemingly intent on channelling fiscal giveaways towards the better-off, the party is also wary lest it digs itself into the wrong trench. Hence the focus on the economy at this week\u2019s Labour conference in Liverpool, and the ways in which Keir Starmer and his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, can present an alternative vision to voters. An early sign came in Starmer\u2019s interview with the BBC on Sunday morning, in which he committed to reversing the abolition of the top 45p rate of income tax but not the 1p cut to the basic rate. Half an hour earlier, Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, had argued that both should go, saying there were better ways of targeting help to poorer people than a basic-rate tax cut benefiting everyone. Economically, Burnham is most probably correct, but politically, Starmer\u2019s position has some logic. Going into an election, a Conservative attack of \u201cyou want to increase taxes on the rich\u201d is hardly as resonant as one saying \u201cyou want to increase taxes on everyone\u201d. The second half of this equation, to be spelled out by Reeves on Monday in perhaps the most important speech of the conference, is to set out an alternative vision for growing the economy. And this is where the dividing lines perhaps become more simple. Reeves is to stress the importance of strong public services, not least the NHS and education. Echoing Truss\u2019s repeated leadership campaign claims about her supposedly failing comprehensive school, Reeves told the Guardian in an interview before her speech that her school used prefab huts for sixth-form buildings. Most voters would probably agree that public services have deteriorated since 2010, when David Cameron\u2019s coalition government set out on its course of brutal austerity spending cuts, which were mainly outsourced to local authorities. Johnson declared the era of austerity over, promising a new era of levelling up, however modestly this was funded. Truss and her chancellor have just delivered \u00a345bn of tax cuts, which are intended to be permanent. Despite Downing Street\u2019s stated insouciance over soaring public debt, Kwarteng has committed to cutting it as a share of GDP before too long, and something has to give. It is thus not a surprise that some are predicting a new round of spending cuts. Labour believe that most voters would happily pay more in taxes, especially if largely confined to corporations and richer individuals, in return for better public services. Most polling seems to support this idea, so as a winter looms in which the NHS could face its worst crisis for years, and with train services crumbling and the country in the grip of an energy crisis, raising the spectre of renewed austerity could be even more effective."

            "content": "Liz Truss plans to radically reshape the UK economy with even more tax cuts and fewer regulations, her chancellor has said, declining to set a limit on how much public debt could be incurred in the process. \u201cThere\u2019s more to come,\u201d Kwasi Kwarteng told BBC One\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, two days after his unofficial budget delivered \u00a345bn of tax cuts, mainly for the rich. \u201cWe\u2019ve only been here 19 days. I want to see, over the next year, people retain more of their income,\u201d he said. Kwarteng dismissed the negative reaction of the money markets to his mini-budget and the amount of borrowing it will involve, and said he was confident the Bank of England would be able to keep a grip on inflation. He also denied his tax cuts predominantly favoured those on higher incomes. \u201cThey favour people right across the income scale,\u201d he said. Challenged over how a government with no new mandate could embark on such a radically different course, the chancellor said he was certain the public supported his ideas. Asked about fiscal plans that will add about \u00a3400bn to public borrowing over the coming years, Kwarteng said he was committed to debt as a proportion of GDP falling over time, but gave no details as to how or when. \u201cObviously, you can\u2019t borrow for ever, and that\u2019s why on Friday I was very specific, very careful, to say that we\u2019re going to have a medium-term fiscal plan,\u201d he said, arguing that the government had to respond to the economic shocks of Covid and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cWe had two multigenerational unprecedented events,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that a government shouldn\u2019t respond in a fiscally expansive way, in a way that we can support the economy, support our people through these two unprecedented shocks.\u201cAll I would say on borrowing is we\u2019ve managed to respond to two of what they call exogenous shocks that were not in our control and were of unprecedented scale, and that was absolutely the right thing to do.\u201d Asked if there was a limit to the new borrowing, Kwarteng replied: \u201cWhat I\u2019m not going to do is to say that if there is an exogenous, extreme event I can\u2019t possibly say we won\u2019t borrow to deal with that.\u201d The chancellor agreed with Kuenssberg when asked if Truss\u2019s government hoped to implement what previous Conservative governments, including Boris Johnson\u2019s, had deemed unthinkable in terms of tax cuts and deregulation. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely our focus,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way we are going to pay for our public services in the future, the only way we\u2019re going to have the kind of economy we want, is by growing this economy. And that is what I, the prime minister and the government is 100% focused on.\u201d Some Conservative MPs have voiced disquiet over the new approach, a view echoed on Sunday by the former chancellor Ken Clarke, who told the BBC that tax cuts for the rich was \u201cthe kind of thing that\u2019s usually tried in Latin American countries without success\u201d. Kwarteng did not rule out loosening some immigration rules to provide more overseas workers, or possible changes such as ending EU rules on maximum working hours, but said these were a matter for cabinet colleagues. Asked how he felt able to pursue policies so different to the 2019 Conservative manifesto when only Tory party MPs and members had selected Truss, Kwarteng said only that it was \u201cvery clear to me that people don\u2019t want to see the tax burden going up indefinitely\u201d. Challenged again on whether he had public consent for such radical changes, he said: \u201cWe have a responsibility in government to protect everybody and to make Britain the best it can be, and I think economic growth is absolutely essential to that.\u201d Kwarteng declined to discuss the slide in the value of sterling after his statement on Friday, with the pound tumbling to a 37-year low, below $1.09. \u201cAs chancellor of the exchequer, I don\u2019t comment on market movements,\u201d he said. According to the Sunday Telegraph, some Conservative MPs could revolt if sterling reaches parity with the dollar, seeing this as a signal for action. Some could vote against the finance bill bringing in the tax cuts, or even send letters of no confidence in the prime minister, the paper predicted."

            "content": "Politicians on TikTok will no longer be able to use the app tipping tools, nor access advertising features on the social network, as the company tightens its policies around political issues in the run-up to the US midterm elections in six weeks\u2019 time. Political advertising is already banned on the platform, alongside \u201charmful misinformation\u201d, but as TikTok has grown over the past two years, new features such as gifting, tipping and ecommerce have been embraced by some politicians on the site. Now, new rules will again limit political players\u2019 ability to use the app for anything other than organic activity, to \u201chelp ensure TikTok remains a fun, positive and joyful experience\u201d, the company said. \u201cTikTok has long prohibited political advertising, including both paid ads on the platform and creators being paid directly to make branded content,\u201d it added. \u201cWe currently do that by prohibiting political content in an ad, and we\u2019re also now applying restrictions at an account level. \u201cThis means accounts belonging to politicians and political parties will automatically have their access to advertising features turned off, which will help us more consistently enforce our existing policy.\u201d Political accounts will be blocked from other monetisation features, and will also be removed from eligibility for the company\u2019s \u201ccreator fund\u201d, which distributes cash to some of the most successful video producers on the site. They will also be banned from using the platform for campaign fundraising, \u201csuch as a video from a politician asking for donations, or a political party directing people to a donation page on their website,\u201d the service has said. \u201cTikTok is first and foremost an entertainment platform, and we\u2019re proud to be a place that brings people together over creative and entertaining content. By prohibiting campaign fundraising and limiting access to our monetisation features, we\u2019re aiming to strike a balance between enabling people to discuss the issues that are relevant to their lives while also protecting the creative, entertaining platform that our community wants.\u201d The rules are in contrast to those of Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram, both of which have long allowed political advertising and encouraged politicians to use their services for campaigning purposes. In August, Meta announced its own set of policy updates for the US midterm elections, and promised to devote \u201chundreds of people across more than 40 teams\u201d to ensuring the safety and security of the elections. Meta will ban all new political, electoral and social issue adverts on both its platforms for the final weeks of the campaign, its head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said, and will remove adverts that encourage people not to vote, or call into question the legitimacy of the election. But the company won\u2019t remove \u201corganic\u201d content that does the same. After years of being effectively unregulated, more and more countries are bringing online political advertising under the aegis of electoral authorities. On Monday, Google said it would begin a program that ensured that political emails never get sent to spam folders, after Republican congressional leaders accused it of partisan censorship and introduced legislation to try to ban the practice. \u201cWe expect to begin the pilot with a small number of campaigns from both parties and will test whether these changes improve the user experience, and provide more certainty for senders during this election period,\u201d the company said in a statement."

            "title": "Carolee Schneemann: Body Politics; Marcus Coates: The Directors \u2013 review",
            "date": "2022-09-11T12:00:31Z",
            "content": "I cannot imagine a more controversial show than Carolee Schneemann: Body Politics at the Barbican. Reactions to this lifetime survey of the pioneering American feminist ran all the way from fascination to affront, disaffection, awestruck reverence and slavering lust the day I was there. If you are thinking of visiting, take someone with you. Argument was always what she wanted. Schneemann (1939-2019) started out as a painter in what she called the \u201cArt Stud Club\u201d of New York, but expanded the medium, you might say, to include her own body. All of her fiercely radical art \u2013 films, performances, installations, happenings \u2013 starts out as a response to macho American conservatism. Up to and Including Her Limits is a direct hit at abstract expressionism, performed nine times in the early 70s. Suspended naked from the museum ceiling in a tree surgeon\u2019s harness, Schneemann swings between walls and floor with a crayon, wildly making her mark. She is both the image and the image-maker all at once; one in the eye for the men. In Fuses, she and her then partner, James Tenney, filmed themselves having sex over a span of three years (1964-67). The footage was shot from a low vantage point, so it is never voyeuristic, and what strikes is the sheer and abundantly equal pleasure the couple take in each other\u2019s bodies. To a contemporary eye, the exposure of certain frames to acid and fire is a pointless period intervention, and I could wish for less of the lithe Schneemann playing to the camera on a beach like a nymph from some dirty old uncle\u2019s magazine. But that is the whole point. It is her body and she can do what she wants with it. The 1975 performance Interior Scroll involved the naked Schneemann addressing audiences in East Hampton, New York. \u201cIf you are a woman \u2026 they will almost never believe you really did it \u2026 they will patronise you, humour you, try to sleep with you.\u201d Specific criticisms of her work were then read aloud from a scroll of paper slowly pulled from within her (the scroll is in this show, along with numerous photographs). The artist retaliates straight from the vulva. This must have been staggering to behold, particularly at the Telluride film festival in Colorado under a programme titled, to her disgust, The Erotic Woman. It seems clear from the many documents in this show that Schneemann was intent on thwarting the very response she seemed to court. Her most famous work is probably Meat Joy, first performed at the Festival of Free Expression in Paris in 1964. Four men and four women, dressed in feather and fur-trimmed underwear, tangle and writhe on the stage. Their instructions (Schneemann is very precise) were also to roll about on the floor, rubbing themselves with raw chickens and dead fish; all one flesh, as it were. Badly lit, poorly filmed, the recording you see at the Barbican is nonetheless an orgy of jubilant excitement. Schneemann, always her own greatest champion, telegrammed Tenney: \u201cBeautiful frenzy wild meat joy triumph our love covers Paris.\u201d Paris was less impressed than she hoped. Schneemann later describes it as a moral little city, unlike London, which \u201chealed\u201d her like a hospital. Her vivid writings are among the many posters, flyers, photos and other ephemera documenting these long-ago events. You will be almost as familiar with Schneemann\u2019s life as her body by the end, friendships and romances as freely displayed as her genitals. Everything in this show is a sign of the times: then and also now. I cannot imagine any artist today displaying their menstrual blood like stigmata behind glass as a consciousness-raising exercise. But nor can I imagine any artist now repeating an event such as Meat Joy for the casual treatment of animals. Our taboos are ever-renewing. It is possible to feel deep ambivalence about Schneemann\u2019s three-dimensional works: the Rauschenbergian assemblages, the Joseph Cornell boxes fitted out with shards of glass. A mop swings up and down, thumping a telly. The paintings are bashed out for a while, a wearier festival of expression. A bowl lined with fur slowly revolves, M\u00e9ret Oppenheim with added tin cans. To me, Schneemann is always at her blazing best when most political, especially in the defiant poignancy of an installation devoted to the treatment of the breast cancer she endured. Oranges stuck with syringes, oranges flattened into juiced jellies on straw heaps on the floor. This is sculpture as piercing epigram. Feminists have criticised Schneemann\u2019s body-positive art as old-fashioned exploitation. Would she have appeared constantly naked if she hadn\u2019t been so flawlessly beautiful? Is this self-portraiture or exhibitionism? It is her body, to be sure, but it is your mind to make up. Nakedness is her medium, and at times her metier; what she does with it is the essential question. What shocks at the Barbican is never the joyous, proud or satirical nudity. It is, for me, the intercutting of footage of her open vulva with newsreel of atrocities in Vietnam and images of her injured pet cat. (Also seen in 140 photographs of nameless interactions with the artist; who is doing what to whom I do not know.) I found her isolated and enlarged figures falling from the twin towers in Terminal Velocity fundamentally offensive, and so is this work too; a kind of visual relativism \u2013 it\u2019s all on the box, all of the time, look-don\u2019t-look \u2013 that feels in the end morally repugnant. The British artist Marcus Coates has made five films with people recovering from psychosis in which he appears as a protagonist acting out their directions. Each is screened in a different venue in Pimlico, south London. In a vintage shop, Coates is required by the voiceover to walk through a park taunted by thoughts of his wife\u2019s boss luring her away with his bigger car, house, member etc. In a curry house, he has to make his way along a street knowing that everyone is watching him. On the fifth floor of a tower block he has to learn that everything is fake. This teenage bedroom in which he \u2013 and you \u2013 are sitting is not real. Cue Coates shaking the walls and discovering that it is all a stage set, a cliche that might have been avoided. The sincerity of Coates\u2019s project, presented by Artangel, is not in doubt. He has taken such pains to discover what psychosis is like, gone to such lengths to allow his directors, as he calls them, to express the daily sufferings he then enacts. Voices in the head, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions of threat and surveillance: it is almost as if he has chosen the most familiar experiences. Nothing on screen takes you much closer than art, literature and cinema already has. Partly that is to do with the distance between the sufferers\u2019 raw words and the artist\u2019s sophisticated performance. There are comic moments, but the strongest work here, set in a residents\u2019 hall, feels more like a meeting of minds. Coates is imprisoned in a chair on a stage. Bar fires are held close to his face, plates of offal below his nose, wet sponges squeezed on the crotch of his trousers. The audience (sitting where you sit) whisper, laugh and develop horrifying grins. He can never get away. His mind hates him. Eventually the wet trousers becomes a self-induced reality. Star ratings (out of five) Carolee Schneemann: Body Politics \u2605\u2605\u2605 Marcus Coates: The Directors \u2605\u2605\u2605 Carolee Schneemann: Body Politics is at the Barbican Art Gallery, London, until 8 January Marcus Coates: The Directors is at Churchill Gardens, London SW1, until 30 October"

            "date": "2022-09-21T12:00:28Z",
            "content": "Of all the speeches Charles III will give as king, none will be as incendiary as one he gave as prince. Speaking at a 1984 gala dinner celebrating the Indian architect Charles Corea, the then Prince of Wales launched, to the horror of his hosts, into a devastating evisceration of contemporary architecture. He labelled a new tower, still on the drawing board, designed by the architect Mies van der Rohe as \u201cyet another giant glass stump\u201d and likened a proposed extension to the National Gallery by ABK Architects to \u201ca monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend\u201d. Both projects were aborted. ABK never fully recovered. British architecture changed for decades. What can we learn about our new King from his meddling with architecture during his long stint as heir apparent? A decade after the carbuncle speech, Prince Charles launched his own architecture magazine titled Perspectives on Architecture. Surprisingly diverse, the journal included pieces on anarchist groups squatting development sites intermingled with odes to Islamic geometry. \u201cWe had articles on deconstructivism and feminist Marxist architectural historians \u2013 all in a magazine run by the Prince of Wales,\u201d recalls the broadcaster and former assistant editor of Perspectives, Tom Dyckhoff. \u201cThere was an air of it being a kind of court with courtiers. It ran according to regal logic, not commercial logic.\u201d Perspectives ultimately folded, but was not without compelling moments. It was an early publisher of George Monbiot, for example, and became, according to Dychoff, the kind of magazine that \u201cpeople who liked brutalism would read in a brown paper bag\u201d. As the staff were let go, the future King presented them with signed photos of himself in plastic frames. Redundancy papers followed, delivered to Dyckhoff\u2019s rented Whitechapel flat by a royal footman. It was in Perspectives that the prince unveiled his Phoenix Trust. Frustrated with the number of grand industrial and institutional facilities falling into ruin, he hoped to buy and repair historic buildings, then sell them to new owners like a flipper renovating doer-uppers on a giant scale. \u201cI am not prepared to sit back and see this great legacy needlessly squandered,\u201d the prince declared. \u201cWith a little imagination, many historic buildings can become real assets to their local communities.\u201d But imagination was not enough. An early project was Anchor Mill, a vast 1886 weaving factory in Paisley, Renfrewshire, that had lain deteriorating for decades until the prince stepped in. A coalition of funders renovated the building, but it was then sold off as \u201cluxury flats\u201d by the property developer Persimmon. Though the structure was saved, the \u00a311m pound restoration packed rooms into the deep floor plan. Many of the resulting flats are small and single aspect with the only bedroom windows facing into communal corridors, forcing residents to keep their blinds down permanently Elsewhere though, the prince was creating architecture of his own. Poundbury in Dorset and later Nansledan in Cornwell were neighbourhoods built on duchy land intended to mix walkable streets free from the dominance of motor vehicles, with characterful buildings made from local materials using traditional construction techniques. Instead both are now full of cars, built to far lower standards that the Prince had hoped. \u201cThe local materials\u2019 were of no interest to the volume housebuilders who have constructed most of it\u201d observes Owen Hatherley, who has been visiting Poundbury throughout its construction. \u201cFinishes and build quality are poor because of the contracting systems, which remove power from the architect.\u201d In setting out to realise an exemplar of how new development can be done well, the prince has instead shown that even the British monarchy is no match for the UK\u2019s profit-driven procurement system. Though not without merit, Poundbury, Paisley and Perspectives all ultimately failed to conquer the complex commercial and political challenges they faced. Their royal patron\u2019s attempts to create human-centred townscapes have led to car-dominated suburbs. His efforts to uplift grand historic buildings have carved them into dreary flats. Our King is someone who sees the right problems but, ensconced in the very establishment that prevents meaningful solutions, he can only meddle around the edges of effecting real change. Before the carbuncle quip, the prince had spent much of that infamous architect-bashing 1984 speech calling for higher standards in wheelchair access and noting the potential of housing cooperatives to empower inner city residents. Yet it was never unwilling architects preventing British housing cooperatives from flourishing as they do in Europe, but rather the UK\u2019s conservative banking sector and byzantine land ownership laws. Likewise, it is not a lack of \u201ca little imagination\u201d that allows Britain\u2019s grand industrial buildings to fall apart but the total absence of political support for our manufacturing sector, which has been hollowed out for decades. King Charles is someone who wants to improve a society that he is not part of and will never truly experience or understand. He sees snapshots in visits and ribbon-cuttings but can never know the complexities of existing within an ordinary community and relying upon its infrastructure. He\u2019ll never chat to a neighbour while hanging washing out to dry or sprint for the last night bus in the rain; he\u2019ll never struggle to find an affordable nursery or worry about energy bills; he\u2019ll never play, pray or party in the street. His view of society, as of architecture, is restricted to what can be seen from the tinted window of a chauffeured car. \u201cMy concern is the future,\u201d the prince insisted in the Architectural Review in 2014. \u201cWe have to work out now how we will create resilient, truly sustainable and human-scale urban environments that are land-efficient, use low-carbon materials and do not depend so completely upon the car.\u201d These are undoubtedly the right questions but such huge challenges require systemic, far-reaching political solutions \u2013 not more well-intentioned meddling. Phineas Harper is chief executive of Open City, a charity dedicated to making architecture and cities more open, accessible and equitable"

            "title": "With Liz Truss\u2019s wild energy gamble, big politics is back | Gaby Hinsliff",
            "date": "2022-09-09T13:00:34Z",
            "content": "Liz Truss had barely finished speaking when the ripples began spreading around the chamber. Notes were ferried along frontbenches; brows furrowed, faces paled and Keir Starmer quietly slipped out. It swiftly emerged that family members were being summoned to the bedside of the 96-year-old Queen, so visibly fragile just a few days ago as she anointed her third female prime minister. What a sombre, black-edged week for a new prime minister to make her debut, and not just because of darkening skies over Balmoral. The energy plan Liz Truss was unveiling when the news broke of the monarch\u2019s failing health essentially involves writing a blank cheque for multiple billions for the next two years, to cover the costs of something she cannot easily predict or control. It is an extraordinary gamble with particularly serious consequences for the poor, for the public finances and for the planet. If it blows up in all our faces, it\u2019s hard to see her government recovering. But if she can somehow pull it off, then nobody will care that the abiding image of her first speech as prime minister was of a binbag shrouding a rain-sodden lectern, or that she once made a duff speech about pork markets. People often complain that politics seems petty and superficial, fiddling round the edges. Well, be careful what you wish for. The era of big ideological divides, big politics and equally big risks is back, under a prime minister now boldly staking all her roulette chips on taking Britain into the red. The pandemic forced Boris Johnson into some equally momentous decisions, but his differences with Labour over lockdown were mostly over timing. Now, two diametrically opposed economic theories of the world are duking it out in real time: Truss\u2019s conviction that tax cuts are the key to growth, and that the resulting wealth will somehow trickle down to everyone rather than accumulating, as it so often does, in the pockets of the rich, versus Keir Starmer\u2019s argument for redistributing wealth via windfall taxes. What\u2019s more unexpected is that somehow Labour has overnight become the party of soberly balancing the books, or finding ways to pay for the things you want to do, while Truss seems content to cross her fingers and borrow her way out of trouble. The idea of piling anywhere up to \u00a3150bn on the never-never would surely have Margaret Thatcher turning in her grave. The jury is still out on what it will do to her successor, with Truss\u2019s statement on Thursday notably kicking some difficult questions a few weeks down the road. Household bills will be frozen for two years, at about \u00a32,500 for the average home, while businesses and public sector organisations like hospitals and schools get an equivalent deal for six months (after that, only vulnerable people will be supported). But Truss wouldn\u2019t be drawn on costings, or exactly where that money will be found: we must await a budget later this month for all that. There will be more licences to drill for oil and gas, and the ban on fracking will be lifted, despite fierce local resistance in areas rich in shale gas. But further decisions on climate policy seem to have been parked under a review, led by the thankfully pro-green former science minister Chris Skidmore, of how to hit net zero without sacrificing economic growth. Truss offered nothing much for those who have been struggling ever since bills went up last April, never mind this winter, and there was little mention of the urgent need for insulating homes to cut bills \u2013 although that may also have to wait for the budget. And the question of whether there will be blackouts this winter, if Russia continues to starve Europe of gas supplies, still hovers. As a libertarian who hates the idea of the state telling people what to do in their own homes, Truss has ruled out rationing fuel and won\u2019t be ordering anyone to turn down their thermostats. But her government has put itself on the hook for whatever we spend this winter, it has a huge new incentive to keep fuel usage low, and talk of a campaign encouraging Britons to cut their energy usage is to be welcomed. There is a golden opportunity here for Truss to treat decarbonisation like the national war effort it should always have been: repackaging the idea for people who would normally balk at anything too green-sounding as a patriotic way of defying Vladimir Putin and protecting their children and grandchildren from the long-term bill for this crisis. Can it be beyond a Conservative government to rustle up a bit of blitz spirit around the idea of pegging out the washing instead of tumble-drying it, getting your cavity walls filled or not running too many appliances at times of peak pressure on the National Grid? When Ukrainians are dying in their thousands in the name of a free Europe, being asked to put the dishwasher on a bit later at night or turn off your hot tub doesn\u2019t seem an outrageous sacrifice. Many people who haven\u2019t previously bothered much about their bills have been shocked into using energy more mindfully in recent months, and it wouldn\u2019t take much to encourage some benign new habits, which could stick once this crisis is over. The long-term consequences of all that borrowing, however, may prove a harder sell. Truss is already facing rumblings of protest from free market thinktanks such as the Institute of Economic Affairs. Polling for the campaign group 38 Degrees suggests most Tory voters would rather the bill freeze were funded via a windfall tax than borrowing. For now, most people will just be relieved not to face \u00a36,000 bills next spring. But if all this splashing of cash triggers a sharp rise in interest rates, the mood could darken very quickly. The tottering pile of cards that is the British property market is built on cheap borrowing, and interest rates that were so low, for so long, that a whole generation of homeowners have virtually forgotten they can go up. Some who stretched themselves to the limit to buy in recent years would surely snap. Renters would feel the pain, too, if buy-to-let landlords tried to pass the cost of their own rising mortgages on to tenants in the form of even higher rents. The stakes are high, the risks real, and the outcome not wholly in British hands. This has been a consequential week in the life of a nation, one whose unfolding dramas are likely to stick in the memory for some time. We may yet have to endure more of those before the winter is out. Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"

            "date": "2022-09-15T18:41:29Z",
            "content": "A series of audio recordings in which members of an extremist far-right group talked openly about killing the vice-president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, have been presented in court by Argentina\u2019s intelligence agency. The recordings were made just four days before she survived an assassination attempt. A handgun pointed only inches away from her face failed to go off as she arrived at her apartment building on the evening of 1 September surrounded by supporters. The assailant, 35-year-old Fernando Sabag Montiel, was quickly subdued and is now under arrest. His girlfriend, Brenda Uliarte, is accused of instigating Sabag Montiel. \u201cI am going to send Cristina to be killed,\u201d Uliarte wrote to her 21-year-old friend Agustina D\u00edaz a few days before the attack, according to messages found on her phone. Argentina\u2019s intelligence officials believe there may be a link between the conspirators and Federal Revolution, a far-right extremist group that openly discussed conducting a similar attack on 28 August. Argentina\u2019s intelligence chief, Agust\u00edn Rossi, said the attempted assassination was carried out exactly as the audio recordings, posted to Twitter on 28 August, described. \u201cA person infiltrated among the group of sympathisers who took advantage of the opportunity [\u2026] to carry out the criminal deed,\u201d he told the press after the audio clips were presented to investigating judge Mar\u00eda Eugenia Capuchetti. \u201cThere are right-wing extremist groups, the black sun tattooed on Sabag Montiel is a symbol used by many of these organizations,\u201d Rossi added. Sabag Montiel, Uliarte and D\u00edaz, all now under arrest, have been identified in news camera footage outside the vice-president\u2019s home, apparently scouting the area for at least nine days before the attack. Uliarte and D\u00edaz have both been interrogated by the investigating court, with Uliarte likely being charged with attempted homicide. Confronted with the messages found on her mobile phone, Uliarte refused to answer questions, according to press reports. \u201cI\u2019m going to go with the gun and shoot Cristina,\u201d Uliarte said in a message to her friend D\u00edaz. \u201cI\u2019ve got the ovaries to do it, the problem is the old woman has security. I\u2019m not bullshitting you. I\u2019m putting together a group to go with torches, bombs, gun, everything. I\u2019m going to be the liberator of Argentina. I\u2019ve been practising shooting, I know how to use a gun.\u201d Her friend D\u00edaz testified for two hours on Wednesday, declaring herself innocent and describing her friend Uliarte as \u201cmanipulative, conniving, delusional and over-imaginative\u201d, claiming she only went along with Uliarte\u2019s threats to humour her friend. News footage, however, appears to show D\u00edaz at the scene a few days previous to the attack and D\u00edaz texted Uliarte to erase all their messages after the attack. A fourth suspect has also been arrested, Gabriel Carrizo, who ran a small cotton-candy business, for whom Uliarte and Sabag Montiel worked, apparently to camouflage their infiltration among the vice-president\u2019s supporters posing as street vendors. The Federal Revolution extremist group was founded this May by 23-year-old Jonathan Morel, a participant in audio recordings presented to court. The group has participated in anti-government protests, including a torch parade in front of the Casa Rosada, the presidential palace, on 18 August in which fake gallows were displayed, implying this was the fate in store for Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. Uliarte participated in this parade, although Morel has presented himself in court denying any link to the attackers."

            "date": "2022-09-08T10:21:09Z",
            "content": "A former president of the Marshall Islands has called for an investigation into an alleged plot by a Chinese couple to establish a mini-state inside its borders and set it up as a lucrative tax-break haven. The pair were charged by US prosecutors with bribery and money-laundering offences over a \u201cmulti-year scheme\u201d that included establishing a non-governmental organisation, allegedly bribing five Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) officials and attempting to bribe a sixth. One of the five was allegedly given cash to bribe others into supporting the carving out of a Hong Kong-style territory. Hilda Heine, who is now an MP, said the identities of the six legislators were not specified in the indictment but that \u201cthere\u2019s some guesstimates of who the officials are\u201d. She added: \u201cThe people deserve to know who accepted bribes and accountability measures taken as appropriate by our laws. I hope the identities will be forthcoming.\u201d Cary Yan, 50, and Gina Zhou, 34, are accused of trying to manipulate RMI legislators into establishing an exclusive economic zone on the Rongelap atoll, with the name \u201cRongelap atoll special administrative region (Rasar)\u201d \u2013 a designation similar to those given by China to Hong Kong and Macau. The accusations were laid out in an indictment unsealed last Friday after the pair were extradited to the US from Thailand, where they were arrested almost two years ago. The US attorney Damian Williams said the pair \u201cblatantly flouted the sovereignty of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and its legislature\u201d. The indictment said: \u201cYan planned to use the Rasar to, among other things, attract investors and customers to businesses that he would operate in the Rasar, in whole or in part through the NGO.\u201d It also indicated that Yan and Zhou were involved in the drafting of the legislation. They have pleaded not guilty to the charges, which carry sentences of up to five years in jail for bribery and 20 years for money laundering. Among the bribery allegations is a claim that Zhou paid an interest-free \u201cloan\u201d of $22,000 (\u00a319,000) to an RMI official who had officially sponsored the Rasar bill and taken other actions in attempting to have it passed. Another official was allegedly given $7,000 through a family member \u201cto induce or influence other RMI legislators to support [the legislation]\u201d. The indictment also said Yan and Zhou paid flight, hotel and entertainment expenses for RMI officials \u2013 at least two of whom had voting power over the bill \u2013 to travel to New York and Hong Kong in April 2018 for the launch of the scheme at the AsiaWorld-Expo. According to the filing, one official promoted the atoll as a \u201cpromising location to do business\u201d, accepted Yan\u2019s investment in their private business venture and appointed Yan as a special adviser to the atoll. Rongelap was the site of extensive US nuclear testing in the 1940s and 50s, causing devastation to the population, whose descendants are reluctant to return. At the height of the scheme, the Rasar was touted as a foreign investment paradise that would offer relaxed immigration laws and low or no tax, to draw in foreign investment, and improve the struggling Pacific nation\u2019s place in the global economy. Instead, it caused chaos in the RMI government. In November 2018, Heine narrowly survived a no-confidence motion, which she said at the time was about her opposition to the scheme. On Thursday, the former president said she did not support the legislation because it was \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and sidelined RMI laws in \u201ccritical areas\u201d. Heine added: \u201cEconomic development is and should be encouraged but not at the expense of money laundering and other similarly ill activities that are usually a part of money laundering, as was obvious in the Rasar legislation. The people of Rongelap deserved better standards of living and economic development.\u201d The Rasar bill was never filed in parliament owing to the constitutional questions raised by opponents. Contained within the indictment was a reference to an email from an unnamed RMI official to Yan and Zhou vowing \u201crevenge\u201d against Heine over her successful opposition to the bill. After she was voted out in January 2020, Yan and Zhou allegedly emailed the official and promised that their family would be \u201cone of the most powerful\u201d in the RMI if a resolution endorsing the bill were passed. It was passed in March that year. There is no indication in the filings that the alleged scheme was connected to the Chinese Communist party (CCP) but the Rasar proposal has nevertheless raised concerns about the growing influence of Beijing across the Pacific. At the time of the no-confidence motion against Heine, she said the proposal was \u201can effort by certain foreign interests to take control of one of our atolls and turn it into a country within our own country\u201d. The Marshall Islands are a former US territory and one of the few nations to recognise Taiwan. Pacific neighbours including Kiribati and Solomon Islands have switched recognition to China in recent years, with Solomon Islands prompting western concerns over a security agreement with the CCP."

            "date": "2022-09-07T05:18:32Z",
            "content": "China\u2019s military is increasingly using drones to put pressure on Taiwan, the island\u2019s president has said, adding to its arsenal of intimidatory strategies including \u201ccognitive warfare\u201d and incursions by war planes and ships. Taiwan\u2019s president Tsai Ing-wen said the threat from China\u2019s government, which claims Taiwan is a province it will one day retake, remains uninterrupted. \u201cIn addition to frequent intrusions by China\u2019s aircraft and ships, China also conducted cognitive warfare, using false information to create disturbance in minds of people, as well as the use of drones,\u201d Tsai said. The speech, delivered to soldiers during live-fire exercises on Tuesday, came a day after the first inclusion of a Chinese military drone\u2019s flightpath in Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry report on daily PLA incursions. Last month the People Liberation Army (PLA) intensified its intimidation of Taiwan by encircling the island with live-fire military drills. It has since made near daily crossing over the median line \u2013 a previously rare act challenging the unofficial maritime border in the Taiwan Strait. On Monday Taiwan\u2019s ministry of defence said nine PLA aircraft had entered Taiwan\u2019s air defence identification zone (ADIZ), including a BZK-007 reconnaissance drone. It was the first time the flightpath of a drone had been revealed by the ministry. In recent months PLA drones to the east of Taiwan have been detected and publicly reported by Japan\u2019s ministry of defence. They were not initially reported by the Taiwan government, prompting some speculation that they had either not been detected, or that the ministry was not releasing the information. Last week Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry said soldiers had shot down a Chinese civilian drone after several days of drones flying over military posts on Kinmen Island. The shooting came shortly after Tsai ordered the military to take \u201cstrong countermeasures\u201d against what she termed Chinese provocations. Anti-drone defences are included in the defence budget for next year. Taiwan is set to increase its defence budget by 12.9%, bringing it to about 2.4% of GDP, as it increases its readiness for a Chinese attack or invasion. Last week the US Biden administration announced a $1.1bn arms sale to Taiwan, including a $655m logistics support package for Taiwan\u2019s surveillance radar programme, which provides air defence warnings. Another $355m was for Harpoon air-to-sea missiles and $85m for Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, the state department said. In response, China\u2019s defence ministry accused Washington of \u201cmaking trouble,\u201d and demanded it withdraw the sale, which is likely to receive required approval from Congress. Taiwan on Tuesday launched military exercises on the Hengchun Peninsula in the far south of the island, simulating ground warfare against an invading enemy aided by Apache attack helicopters. \u201cWe will continue to hold the attitude of being prepared for war,\u201d Lt. Col. Jing Feng-huang told reporters at the site of the drills. \u201cWe will not shy away from war but will not seek it out.\u201d The exercises began with snipers firing at targets, followed by two Apaches blasting away at hillside targets. Troops also fired rounds from M109 howitzers and 105mm armoured vehicle assault guns, as well as Javelin anti-tank weapons that have proven highly effective against Russian armor in the Ukraine conflict, which some have likened to a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan. The exercises will also feature joint drills with Taiwan\u2019s air force on Wednesday."

            "date": "2022-09-06T22:26:42Z",
            "content": "Two days after Chileans emphatically rejected a new constitution, President Gabriel Boric has reshuffled his cabinet as he attempts to ride out a fresh period of uncertainty. On Sunday, 62% of Chileans voted against a progressive new constitution which would have replaced the current document drafted under Gen Augusto Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship in a historic plebiscite. The result was a shattering blow to Boric, 36, and his youthful generation of leftist leaders. As the fallout commences, Chile is gripped by uncertainty and political wrangling as the country\u2019s future comes under the microscope. \u201cThis is one of the most difficult moments I have had to face politically,\u201d the president said on Tuesday as he unveiled changes to his senior team. Six new ministers were appointed, including the presidency\u2019s secretary-general, and ministers for energy, health, science and social development. The changes maintain the female majority in Boric\u2019s cabinet, but tip the balance towards the more moderate democratic socialist bloc \u2013 and away from the young generation of politicians and former students leaders from among whom Boric emerged to become Chile\u2019s youngest ever president in December\u2019s election. Carolina Toh\u00e1, a respected former mayor of Santiago, has replaced the interior minister, Izkia Siches, who became the first woman to hold the post when Boric took power in March. Toh\u00e1 is a prominent figure in the centre-left Party for Democracy, one of the groups which formed the broadly centrist coalition to guide Chile through its delicate transition to democracy in the 1990s and 2000s. \u201cAfter the plebiscite result, it is clear that these young politicians need the help of the older generation to improve their relationship with the opposition,\u201d said Miguel \u00c1ngel L\u00f3pez, an academic at the University of Chile\u2019s faculty of government. \u201cBoric still has the opportunity to implement changes, but they will not be framed in the radical way in which his agenda had originally described them.\u201d The 1980 constitution remains in force while leaders seek consensus on the route. The coordinators of the successful \u201creject\u201d campaign have called for a new constitutional process, but that would require a four-sevenths majority to be reached in both houses of Chile\u2019s congress before a new convention can be elected to draft a new proposal. Boric has reiterated his commitment to continuing efforts at constitutional reform, and invited the leaders of the country\u2019s political parties to a meeting at La Moneda on Tuesday. The proposed constitution, which now has no legal standing, was drawn up over a year of hard-fought negotiations by a gender-equal convention and presented in July. It enshrined gender parity and reproductive rights, promised action on climate change, and recognised Chile\u2019s Indigenous peoples constitutionally for the first time in the country\u2019s history. But these values are not guaranteed to be carried forward. \u201cNone of these elements are guaranteed to be part of a new constitutional process,\u201d said Tania Busch Venthur, a constitutional expert at Andr\u00e9s Bello University in Santiago. \u201cThe only thing we know for sure at the moment is that any changes will have to be made according to the rules set out by the 1980 constitution, and they will depend on the will of politicians.\u201d The campaign against the constitutional proposal was able to coalesce widespread support by casting doubt on its shake-up of the political and judicial systems, and criticised some of the rights it promised Chileans. More than 13 million people turned out to vote on Sunday as part of an exemplary electoral process, reinforcing the widespread dissatisfaction with the proposal drafted by the convention. Yet in October 2020, 78% of Chileans voted in favour of drafting a new constitution. Although that enthusiasm appears to have evaporated, many Chileans remain in favour of a new constitution \u2013 just not the proposal they were offered in Sunday\u2019s plebiscite. It now falls upon Boric to guide Chile through a new chapter in a turbulent period for the country and reach an agreement that can win the support of society at large."

            "date": "2022-09-10T10:12:05Z",
            "content": "President Biden\u2019s speech in Philadelphia last week, on the imminent threat to democracy, marks an important moment in US history. The president was precise and direct about why democracy is under threat, and from whom. Throughout his speech, he made sure to distinguish between what he called \u201cmainstream Republicans\u201d on one side and extremist \u201cMaga Republicans\u201d on the other. But Biden also left no doubt that the extremist forces are not simply fringe phenomena, that today\u2019s Republican party is \u201cdominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the Maga Republicans\u201d. Biden was right to tie the Republican anti-democratic radicalization to the broader assault on the post-1960s civil rights regime. \u201cMaga forces are determined to take this country backwards,\u201d the president declared, \u201cbackwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love\u201d. Both the attempts to subvert the political system and to impose conservative social and cultural ideals on the entire country are indeed part of a broader reactionary counter-mobilization against egalitarian, multiracial, pluralistic democracy. The conservative vision for America is one of maintaining traditional hierarchies, of 1950s-style white Christian patriarchal dominance in all spheres of American life: the political institutions, the public square, the workplace, the family. And conservatives understand that they are pursuing a minoritarian project. In a functioning democratic system, they would have to moderate, accept compromise, accommodate the will of the majority. Instead, they have chosen a different path, favoring authoritarian minority rule over the acceptance of democratic defeat. Biden explicitly marked the current situation as exceptional, as \u201cnot normal\u201d. In many ways, however, the struggle over democracy has been very much the norm in US history, as the question of who should get to actually participate in the democratic process has always been a highly contested issue. And yet, the fact that this struggle now overlaps so clearly with party lines is indeed the result of a rather recent ideological reconfiguration of the two major parties. This process of party realignment or partisan sorting started before the 1960s \u2013 but the major civil rights breakthroughs of that era certainly acted as a crucial catalyst. Until the final third of the 20th century, those who wanted to leave white patriarchal rule intact largely dominated in both parties, or at least were powerful enough to veto any serious racial and social progress; those who wanted to transcend traditional hierarchies could also be found on either side of the aisle, but they weren\u2019t influential enough to upend the bipartisan white elite consensus. The establishment of the civil rights regime in the 1960s sped up a process by which all those opposed to egalitarian, multiracial, pluralistic democracy united in the Republican party. Their voices have dominated the Republican party since the 1970s. While the Democratic party came to lean towards embracing the idea of extending the democratic promise, conservatives were willing to tolerate democracy only as long as it wouldn\u2019t undermine established hierarchies. Their allegiance, however, was never to democratic ideals \u2013 but to the traditional order of white Christian patriarchal dominance. Whatever doubts anyone may still have held about where the parties stood on the question of multiracial pluralism got a clarifying answer during the Obama and Trump presidencies, which fully polarized \u201cthe Left\u201d and \u201cthe Right\u201d around the core issue of democracy. That\u2019s the main reason why the media\u2019s criticism of the speech\u2019s \u201cpartisan\u201d nature misses the mark so severely: yes, it was partisan! Because that is the fundamental reality of American politics right now: The conflict over whether or not the country should actually be a democracy maps on to the conflict between the two parties. Democracy itself has become a partisan issue. The president claimed that the country has reached an inflection point, a moment in which \u201cAmerica must choose to move forward or to move backward.\u201d Within the context of the speech, this notion served to sharpen the contrast between the pro-democratic forces Biden wants to mobilize and the Maga Republicans. But it\u2019s also an apt description that captures the historical significance of the current moment, emphasizing the fact that the status quo is untenable, that there is no stable equilibrium in sight. As the reactionary counter-mobilization is escalating, particularly in Republican-led states, America is being split into a multiracial, pluralistic \u201cblue\u201d part that accepts the country\u2019s changing social, cultural and demographic realities v a white Christian nationalist \u201cred\u201d part that is led by people entirely devoted to rolling back those changes. While Republicans claim to be representing \u201creal America\u201d, their agenda of entrenching a white Christian patriarchal order lacks majority support \u2013 and the gap between what most Americans want and what the Republican party is implementing wherever it gets the chance is rapidly growing. Some form of stability can only be achieved by either overcoming reactionary rule \u2013 or through ever more authoritarian measures and increasingly violent oppression. The fact that a shrinking minority of white conservatives is consistently being enabled to hold on to power against the will of the majority of voters is causing a massive legitimacy crisis. And unless the system is properly democratized, it is only going to get worse. Of course, there has never been a consensus that the \u201csoul of the nation\u201d, as President Biden called it, is defined by egalitarian ideas. At its heart, the country has always been divided between those who envision America as a beacon of democratic equality and those who see it as a land of and for white Christians. \u201cWe honor the will of the people,\u201d Biden proclaimed. But the key conflict has always been over who gets to delineate the boundaries of \u201cthe people\u201d \u2013 and who gets to claim equal rights as a member of the body politic. \u201cFor a long time,\u201d Biden warned, \u201cwe\u2019ve told ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed, but it\u2019s not.\u201d Still, the president insisted on striking a hopeful note at the end: \u201cI have no doubt, none, that this is who we will be and that we\u2019ll come together as a nation that will secure our democracy.\u201d But the future of American democracy is actually very much in doubt. That was the whole reason why this presidential intervention was urgently needed. It really could happen here. And any successful attempt at halting America\u2019s slide into authoritarianism must be built on an unflinching admission of where we are, of democracy\u2019s potential demise \u2013 even here, in the land of the free.
