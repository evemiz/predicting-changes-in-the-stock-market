            "content": "Three of the most prominent rightwing groups that spread election denial lies and advocate for restrictions on voting rights in the US have joined forces in a secret attempt to woo top election officials in Republican-controlled states. Led by the Washington-based conservative thinktank the Heritage Foundation, the groups have created an incubator of policies that would restrict access to the ballot box and amplify false claims that fraud is rampant in American elections. The unstated yet implicit goal is to dampen Democratic turnout and help Republican candidates to victory. Details of the two-day \u201csecretaries of state conference\u201d held in Washington in February were obtained by the watchdog group Documented and shared with the Guardian. Officials from 13 Republican-controlled states, including 10 top election administrators, participated in the event. Attendees discussed controversial \u201celection integrity\u201d ideas of the sort weaponized by Donald Trump. Among the participants were nine secretaries of state and Virginia\u2019s election commissioner, all of whom preside over both statewide and federal elections in their states including next year\u2019s presidential contest. A list of attendees namechecks the chief election officials of Indiana, Florida, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. Documented also obtained the conference agenda which lists a number of Trump associates among the speakers. They include Ken Cuccinelli who, as acting deputy secretary for homeland security, played a key role in setting elections policy for the Trump administration. Cuccinelli now runs the Election Transparency Initiative which is fighting Democratic efforts in Congress to shore up voting rights, and has been active in pushing state-level vote restriction measures. The keynote speech was given by Ken Blackwell, former secretary of state in Ohio. He was an early adopter of Trump\u2019s lie about rigged elections, championing the idea in the 2016 presidential race which Trump won. Blackwell now chairs the Center for Election Integrity at the America First Policy Institute, a rightwing thinktank led by former Trump officials. The center has been touting election-related model legislation. Heritage was careful to organize the conference amid tight secrecy. Among the records obtained by Documented is an email from Hans von Spakovsky, a lawyer at the foundation who leads their election work. Responding to a query about the event from a Texas official, Von Spakovsky said: \u201cThere is no livestream. This is not a public event. It is a private, confidential meeting of the secretaries. I would rather you not send out a press release about it.\u201d *** Von Spakovsky has long been at the forefront of efforts to undermine US elections by claiming falsely that fraud is endemic. He helped spearhead the attack on voting by mail during the pandemic, holding private briefings with Republican state election officials \u2013 a drive that became a core part of Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn his defeat in the 2020 presidential election. Heritage and its political arm, Heritage Action for America, have spent tens of millions of dollars promoting their own model bills that impose strict restrictions on voting. They have targeted the investment on key battleground states such as Arizona, Georgia and Michigan that could hold the balance of power in the 2024 presidential race. Heritage began hosting annual gatherings of Republican secretaries of state at the start of the Trump presidency in 2017. February\u2019s in-person conference was the first to be sponsored by three rightwing powerhouses of election denial and voter suppression \u2013 Heritage, together with the Public Interest Legal Foundation (Pilf), and the Honest Elections Project (HEP). Pilf is a conservative legal group that sues election officials to force them to purge voter rolls, a process that has affected eligible US voters. The group is led by J Christian Adams, a former justice department lawyer who tried to use the Voting Rights Act to claim voting discrimination against white people. Trump\u2019s former lawyer Cleta Mitchell also sits on the Pilf board. HEP is a conservative dark-money group closely tied to the Republican operative Leonard Leo who was instrumental in engineering the current conservative supermajority on the US supreme court. Reporting by ProPublica and the New York Times last year revealed that Leo has received control of a staggering $1.6bn to advance rightwing causes. Concern about the potential of top election officials to subvert democracy intensified during the 2022 midterm elections when a number of individuals committed to Trump\u2019s stolen election lie also ran for office. They formed the \u201cAmerica First Secretary of State Coalition\u201d which became a conduit of far-right conspiracy theories linked to QAnon. Most of those candidates failed in their bid to take over the reins of election administration in their states. But the Heritage conference suggests that the desire to deploy Republican secretaries of state as channels of voter suppression and election misinformation remains very much alive. *** Though chief election officials are tasked with ensuring that ballots are fair and impartial, the Heritage conference was attended only by Republican secretaries of state. The Guardian asked Heritage to explain why its conference was held in secret and with only Republican attendees. The group did not answer those questions. Von Spakovsky said that the event was an \u201ceducational summit intended to provide information on current issues in elections and ensure that our election process protects the right to vote for American citizens by making it easy to vote and hard to cheat\u201d. He disputed the argument that security measures at the ballot box such as voter ID suppressed turnout. \u201cThe claim that secure elections somehow promote greater restrictions is outrageous and has been clearly disproven,\u201d he said. Von Spakovsky also pointed to Heritage\u2019s election fraud database, which he said sampled \u201cproven instances of election fraud from across the country\u201d. The database records 1,422 \u201cproven instances of voter fraud\u201d stretching back to 1982 \u2013 a 41-year period during which billions of votes have been cast in the US. Several of the participants at the conference have election denial and voter suppression track records. They include Florida\u2019s secretary of state, Cord Byrd, who, soon after being appointed by Governor Ron DeSantis last spring, refused to say whether Joe Biden had won the 2020 presidential election. Byrd runs Florida\u2019s \u201celection integrity unit\u201d that was set up by DeSantis last year to investigate election crimes, even though there is scant evidence of substantial voter fraud. More than a dozen citizens accused of illegally voting have been arrested at gunpoint under DeSantis\u2019s crackdown on supposed voter fraud. Another attendee \u2013 Jay Ashcroft, secretary of state of Missouri \u2013 has been a leading proponent of that state\u2019s new restrictive voting law. His office has been named in numerous lawsuits in the last year for imposing extreme constraints on voter registration, including a recent lawsuit accusing Ashcroft of illegally blocking a ballot measure. Tennessee\u2019s secretary of state, Tre Hargett, another listed participant, has been accused by Democratic leaders in Tennessee of purging thousands of voters from the official rolls. Panel discussions laid out in the agenda were held on several of the core talking points of the current Republican party. The opening discussion, moderated by Von Spakovsky, was on \u201cAuditing Expertise\u201d. The main speaker was Paul Bettencourt, a state senator in Texas who has sponsored several bills making it harder to vote including a measure that would deploy armed \u201celection marshals\u201d to oversee polling stations. Before the conference-goers attended a cocktail reception and dinner held at an upscale restaurant in downtown Washington, day one ended with a session entitled: \u201cRealistic Eric Fixes and Reforms\u201d. Eric \u2013 the Electronic Registration Information Center \u2013 is a non-profit group run collectively by 28 states which is used to finesse the accuracy of state voter rolls. In recent months it has become the target of rightwing conspiracy theories fueled by Trump who claimed falsely that it was rigged to benefit Democrats. Ashcroft, the Missouri secretary of state, was one of the speakers in that session. Earlier this month he announced that he was pulling Missouri out of Eric, making it one of the first Republican-controlled states to quit the organization along with Alabama, Florida and West Virginia.

            "title": " Fox and Dominion settle for $787.5m in defamation lawsuit over US election lies",
            "date": "2023-04-18T21:27:41Z",
            "content": "Fox and the voting equipment company Dominion reached a $787.5m settlement in a closely watched defamation lawsuit, ending a dispute over whether the network and its parent company knowingly broadcast false and outlandish allegations that Dominion was involved in a plot to steal the 2020 election. The settlement came before scheduled opening statements and after an unexpected lengthy delay on Tuesday afternoon just after the jury was sworn in. Neither party immediately disclosed the terms of the settlement other than the dollar amount, and attorneys for Dominion declined to answer questions about whether it requires Fox to issue a retraction or a formal apology. \u201cThe parties have resolved their case,\u201d Judge Eric Davis told jurors on Tuesday afternoon before excusing them from the courtroom. In a press conference outside the courthouse, the Dominion attorney Justin Nelson said the more than $787m represented \u201cvindication and accountability\u201d. The settlement amount is less than half of the $1.6bn Dominion demanded in its lawsuit. \u201cTruth matters,\u201d he said. \u201cLies have consequences. The truth does not know red or blue,\u201d he continued. \u201cPeople across the political spectrum can and should disagree on issues, even of the most profound importance. But for our democracy to endure another 250 years and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts.\u201d In a statement, Fox said the settlement reflected its \u201ccontinued commitment to the highest journalistic standards\u201d. \u201cWe are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues,\u201d the statement said. Opening statements were scheduled to start on Tuesday after a lunch break, but the judge and jurors did not return to the room until close to 4pm. During the more than two-hour delay, attorneys huddled and left the courtroom to convene in adjacent meeting rooms. After returning to the courtroom, Davis thanked the jurors for their service, and called the efforts by the lawyers on both sides \u201cthe best lawyering I\u2019ve had, ever\u201d in his career on the bench since 2010. The anticipated six-week jury trial was originally set to begin on Monday, but Davis, the judge overseeing the case, postponed the start of trial by a day as the sides worked to reach a settlement agreement. The trial in Wilmington, Delaware, was set to be a blockbuster media trial. Rupert Murdoch, the 92-year-old chief executive of Fox, was called to testify in the case, along with top Fox talent including Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro and Maria Bartiromo. The lawsuit was seen as one of the most aggressive efforts to hold Fox, or any actor, accountable for spreading the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. It was a lie that led to threats against election officials across the country, and ultimately helped fuel the violent attack on the US Capitol on 6 January. Nine deaths have been linked to the event. Though the case was settled, Dominion had unearthed a stunning trove of internal communications from Fox laying bare how top talent and hosts knew the outlandish claims about Dominion and a stolen election were false. The extensive messages offered a remarkable insight into how some of the most powerful hosts in America did not buy the allegations they were broadcasting to their audience each night. Dominion, a relatively obscure company until the 2020 election, sought $1.6bn in damages in the case. It challenged repeated claims made on Fox\u2019s air after the general election that Dominion switched votes, paid government kickbacks and was founded in Venezuela to rig elections for Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. In the press conference on Tuesday, Dominion\u2019s CEO, John Poulos, called the settlement historic because of Fox\u2019s admission that it was telling lies. \u201cThroughout this process, we have sought accountability,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe the evidence brought to light through this case underscores the consequences of spreading lies. Truthful reporting in the media is essential to our democracy.\u201d Even before trial, Davis had already concluded that Fox\u2019s claims about Dominion were false. \u201cThe evidence developed in this civil proceeding demonstrates that is CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true,\u201d he wrote in a ruling earlier this month. The question that would have been before the jury was whether Fox committed \u201cactual malice\u201d in airing the claims. That required Dominion to show whether key decision makers were aware the claims were false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth. Fox still faces several legal battles related to its decision to broadcast false claims. Smartmatic, another voting equipment company, is suing the company for $2.7bn. Abby Grossberg, a former Fox employee who worked for Bartiromo and Carlson, is also suing the company, alleging she was coerced into giving misleading testimony. The network also faces a separate lawsuit from a shareholder who is seeking damages and argues that executives breached their fiduciary duty to the company by causing false claims about the election to be broadcast. During the press conference, Stephen Shackelford, an attorney who was set to give opening arguments for Dominion on Tuesday, said that the company would continue seeking accountability. \u201cMoney is accountability,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got that today from Fox. But we\u2019re not done yet. We\u2019ve got some other people who have some accountability coming for them.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-04-02T11:00:18Z",
            "content": "More than $37m has already been spent in an election that will this month determine control of Wisconsin\u2019s supreme court, easily making it the most expensive judicial contest in US history. Spending in the race easily shatters the $10m spent in the 2020 Wisconsin supreme court race, the previous record in the state. It also easily surpasses the previous national record, $15m spent on an Illinois supreme court race in 2004. The race has national implications \u2013 it will probably ultimately determine the legality of abortion in the state as well as play a key role in setting voting rules for the 2024 election in one of America\u2019s most competitive states. \u201cIt\u2019s just a truly incredible amount of money,\u201d said Douglas Keith, a lawyer at the Brennan Center for Justice who closely follows state courts. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of what we should expect to see in the future in other state supreme court elections in other states provided that for some reason a particular seat is seen as important.\u201d A once-in-a-generation set of circumstances have come together to make the state supreme court race between liberal Janet Protasiewicz and conservative Daniel Kelly \u2013 typically a little-noticed contest outside Wisconsin\u2019s borders \u2013 the most important election this year. First, the ideological balance of the seven-member court is up for grabs. Second, the outcome of the race will probably directly determine whether abortion is legal in Wisconsin, as the court is expected to weigh in soon on the state\u2019s 1849 abortion ban. Third, the court could strike down Wisconsin\u2019s gerrymandered legislative maps, ending Republicans\u2019 unshakable majority in the state. Lastly, the court is expected to weigh in on a range of disputes over election rules ahead of the 2024 presidential election in Wisconsin, a key battleground state. Protasiewicz and Kelly have taken different approaches to how that money has been raised. Protasiewicz\u2019s campaign has raised $14.5m in total, a vast haul that dwarfs the $2.7m Kelly has raised. But Kelly has benefited from an influx of outside spending from third-party groups, most notably Fair Courts America, a Super Pac backed by the GOP mega-donors Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein, which has spent nearly $4.5m on advertising so far. Women Speak Out Pac, which is connected to the anti-abortion group Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America, has also pledged to spend $2m in support of Kelly and has spent nearly $1.3m on advertising so far. The Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) \u2013 which focuses on state-level elections \u2013 has also spent about $200,000 in support of Kelly through its Judicial Fairness Initiative, according to an analysis by the Center for Political Accountability, a watchdog group. Some of the RSLC\u2019s donors since the supreme court\u2019s decision overturning Roe v Wade have been companies like Google, Comcast and Amazon that have pledged to support their employees if they want an abortion, according to the Center for Political Accountability. \u201cYou have so many major household name companies come out in support of their employees\u2019 access to abortion rights. Offering to cover travel expenses, offering to cover medical expenses, that sort of thing,\u201d said Jeanne Hanna, the Center for Political Accountability\u2019s research director, \u201cbut then continuing to fund these groups that elect openly anti-abortion judges in battleground states where one judicial seat could make the difference of whether people in this state can access abortion care at all. They\u2019re saying one thing and doing another with their political spending.\u201d Kelly has openly touted his support from outside groups, telling supporters earlier this month not to worry because a \u201ccavalry\u201d of outside money was coming to support him. \u201cWhat has been most surprising is that Dan Kelly has basically raised no money as a candidate \u2026 So all of his backing has been from outside groups,\u201d said Barry Burden, the director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand. Legally, they\u2019re not allowed to coordinate. So he\u2019s essentially handed over messaging to groups that he cannot control.\u201d Protasiewicz\u2019s fundraising has been prolific. She has spent more than $10.5m on television advertisements alone, compared with Kelly\u2019s $580,000, according to a Brennan Center tracker. And while she has benefited from considerable spending from liberal outside groups \u2013 A Better Wisconsin Together, the American Civil Liberties Union, and Everytown for Gun Safety among them \u2013 the bulk of the money she\u2019s raised has come from the state Democratic party. The party\u2019s $8.8m contribution to her campaign was made possible by a 2015 Republican rewrite of the state\u2019s campaign finance rules. Those changes removed a cap on the amount of money candidates could receive from state parties. They also allowed individual donors to make unlimited contributions to the political parties. \u201cWhen the Republicans rewrote the laws in 2015 \u2026 they did it with the expectation that it would advantage them. They felt that the sources of money they could rely on, both outside groups and big contributors, would mean they would always have financial advantages in races like this. Just the opposite has happened,\u201d said Jay Heck, the executive director of the Wisconsin chapter of Common Cause, a watchdog group. \u201cThat is the reason why [Wisconsin Democratic party chair] Ben Wikler and the Democrats have been able to be such a powerhouse.\u201d Protasiewicz has said she would recuse herself from cases involving the Wisconsin Democratic party. Kelly has declined to make a similar recusal pledge for cases involving his major donors. \u201cJudges should not be able to hear cases involving major donors or supporters,\u201d said Keith, the Brennan Center expert. \u201cOne of the issues that comes with all this money being as opaque as it is is that the public doesn\u2019t actually know who the judge\u2019s major supporters are often. And if the judges do know, then that\u2019s even more troubling that the judge has information that the public doesn\u2019t about what cases they may have a conflict in.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-04-21T09:00:08Z",
            "content": "Scores of rightwing US extremists were defeated in school-board elections in April, in a victory for the left and what Democrats hope could be effective for running against Republicans in the year ahead. In Illinois, Democrats said more than 70% of school-board candidates it had endorsed won their races, often defeating the kinds of anti-LGBTQ+ culture-warrior candidates who have taken control of school boards across the country. Republican-backed candidates in Wisconsin also fared poorly. Moms for Liberty, a rightwing group linked to wealthy Republican donors which has been behind book-banning campaigns in the US, said only eight of its endorsed candidates won election to school boards, and other conservative groups also reported disappointing performances. The results come as education and free-speech organizations have warned of a new surge in book bans in public schools in America. Over the past two years, conservatives in US states have removed hundreds of books from school classrooms and libraries. The targeted books have largely been texts that address race and LGBTQ+ issues, or are written by people of color or LGBTQ+ authors. \u201cFortunately, the voters saw through the hidden extremists who were running for school board \u2013 across the [Chicago] suburbs especially,\u201d JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, said after the results came in. \u201cReally, the extremists got trounced yesterday.\u201d Pritzker added: \u201cI\u2019m glad that those folks were shown up and, frankly, tossed out.\u201d The Democratic party of Illinois spent $300,000 on races in Illinois, the Chicago Tribune reported, endorsing dozens of candidates. The party said 84 of 117 candidates it had recommended won their races. Teachers\u2019 unions, including the Illinois Education Association, endorsed candidates in school board elections around the state. The IEA backed candidates in about 100 races, and about 90% of those candidates won, said Kathi Griffin, the organization\u2019s president. \u201cI would hope that the tide is turning, to make sure that people who want to have those [school board] positions because they want to do good for our kids, continue [to get elected],\u201d Griffin said. \u201cI think that oftentimes these fringe candidates are funded with dark money. That dark money comes from outside our state.\u201d The results were disappointing for conservative groups, who had pumped money into races. The 1776 Project, a political action committee that received funding from Richard Uihlein, a billionaire GOP donor, said only a third of the 63 candidates it had backed in Illinois and Wisconsin won their races. Politico first reported on the lackluster performances. Union-endorsed candidates won two-thirds of their school-board races in Milwaukee, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported, although Republican-supported candidates performed better in rural areas. Ben Hardin, executive director of the Democratic party of Illinois, said \u201cvalues were on the line in these races\u201d. \u201cWe knew this work wouldn\u2019t be easy, especially given the organized movement from the far right to disguise their true agenda, but we\u2019re grateful that voters saw through the falsehoods and turned out to support credible community advocates,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m proud that Illinoisans once again voted for fairness, equity and inclusion in our state.\u201d With other states holding school board elections later this year \u2013 and a critical presidential election in 2024 \u2013 the successes offered some hope for Democrats. At the local level, at least, Griffin said the results \u201cshowed the value of having relationships within the community\u201d. \u201cWhen you have teachers who are part of the community, who have relationships with parents, with other community members who engage in community activities and support that community, there\u2019s a level of trust that is built and that has happened across our state,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2023-04-12T07:32:45Z",
            "content": "Lachlan Murdoch allowed Fox News hosts to peddle the claim that the US presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump despite knowing it was false, Crikey will argue in a defence of contextual truth in its upcoming defamation trial. The 36-page defence, which has been filed by the Crikey publisher, Private Media, in the federal court ahead of an October trial, substantially relies upon events in the US, where Dominion brought a $1.6bn defamation suit against the media company for spreading election lies. Crikey\u2019s defence alleges Murdoch \u201cclosely monitored how Fox News Network handled reporting on the election\u201d, according to his Dominion deposition, and that he was \u201cgenerally aware of the allegations made by Sidney Powell on the Fox News Network at the time they were being made, which were to the effect that the 2020 US presidential election was fraudulently stolen from Mr Trump\u201d. The US jury trial, set to begin on 17 April, centres on whether Fox News knowingly broadcast false claims about Dominion equipment as Trump and his allies sought to overturn the 2020 election. Justice Michael Wigney granted Crikey additional time to add the contextual truth defence on top of its already pleaded defences of public interest and qualified privilege. The defamation proceedings against the independent Australian news site were launched last year over an article published in June that referred to the Murdoch family as an \u201cunindicted co-conspirator\u201d in the US Capitol attack. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The expanded defence includes the recent admission by Rupert Murdoch that Fox News hosts endorsed Trump\u2019s false claims. \u201cLachlan Murdoch is morally and ethically culpable for the illegal January 6 attack because Fox News, under his control and management, promoted and peddled Trump\u2019s lie of the stolen election despite Lachlan Murdoch knowing it was false,\u201d the Crikey defence says. \u201cLachlan Murdoch\u2019s unethical and reprehensible conduct in allowing Fox News to promote and peddle Trump\u2019s lie of the stolen election, despite Lachlan Murdoch knowing it was false, makes him morally and ethically culpable for the illegal January 6 attack.\u201d Murdoch\u2019s barrister, Sue Chrysanthou SC, indicated in an earlier hearing she would apply to strike out the contextual truth defence, which she described as vague. \u201cThis defence is not rational, it is not arguable, it\u2019s a waste of everyone\u2019s time and it serves no legitimate end in the litigation,\u201d the barrister said. She accused Crikey of including masses of material from the Dominion case in the Australian defamation lawsuit purely as part of its \u201cLachlan Murdoch campaign\u201d, which she alleges is an attempt to raise funds and increase subscriptions on the back of the lawsuit. Murdoch\u2019s attempt to split the trial and have the imputations determined first was dismissed. Murdoch has argued that he has been \u201cgravely injured in his character, his personal reputation and his professional reputation as a business person and company director, and has suffered and will continue to suffer substantial hurt, distress and embarrassment\u201d as a result of the Crikey article. At the hearing earlier this month, Wigney described the litigant and the respondent as having \u201ca scorched earth policy\u201d in their conduct of the matter. \u201cAnd I say this with the greatest respect \u2026 there does seem to be a hint that this case is being driven more by \u2026 ego and hubris and ideology than anything else,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2023-04-13T21:55:34Z",
            "content": "A former Peruvian presidential candidate, Daniel Urresti, has been sentenced to 12 years in jail for his role in the murder of a journalist in 1988 at the height of the country\u2019s brutal civil conflict. A court ruled on Thursday that Urresti, then a military intelligence army officer, took part in the ambush and murder of Hugo Bust\u00edos, who was investigating human rights abuses. As the sentence was read, Urresti listened along with his wife and daughter, whom he hugged before being taken into custody by the police. Lawyers for the politician and former interior minister said they would appeal the verdict. Prosecutors had requested 25 years, but said they were satisfied with the decision. Hugo Bust\u00edos was a reporter for the weekly magazine Caretas in the Andean region of Ayacucho at the centre of the armed conflict in the 1980s and 90s. The journalist reported on human rights abuses committed both by the Shining Path rebels and the armed forces in the region, the worst hit by the political violence which left nearly 70,000 people dead or disappeared, according to Peru\u2019s truth and reconciliation commission. Bust\u00edos was shot at with machine guns by a group of plainclothes soldiers while riding a motorbike, forcing him to lose control and crash. His companion, another journalist who had been riding pillion, managed to escape. As Bust\u00edos lay gravely wounded, prosecutors said, soldiers detonated explosives on his body, killing him. Urresti was accused by two fellow officers from his military base who had been convicted of ordering the journalist\u2019s murder in 2007. They claim Urresti, then a captain in charge of intelligence, took part in the ambush in which Bust\u00edos was killed in November 1988. In 2018, Urresti was cleared of any involvement in the journalist\u2019s murder when he was a front-running candidate to be mayor of Lima, an election which he narrowly lost. But Peru\u2019s supreme court overturned the ruling and ordered a new trial, which following a lengthy hearing led to his conviction for murder in the early hours of Thursday. The judges also ruled that Bust\u00edos\u2019 murder had been premeditated. In a combative political career, Urresti served as Peru\u2019s interior minister between 2014 and 2015, ran twice for the presidency, in 2016 and 2021, as well as the mayoral office of Lima, in 2018 and 2022. He lost the latter by less than a percentage point to the ultra-conservative millionaire Rafael L\u00f3pez Aliaga. Throughout, he courted notoriety for his social media attacks on politicians while brushing off accusations that police used excessive force against protesters. Despite backing for his populist law-and-order platform, the former army general\u2019s political career has been overshadowed by allegations he took part in Bust\u00edos\u2019 brutal murder. Sharmel\u00ed Bust\u00edos, the eldest daughter of the murdered journalist, welcomed the ruling, saying in a tweet that she could finally light a candle for her parents and tell them: \u201cJustice has been done, 34 years later. The road has been hard and painful. Today all that remains is to give thanks.\u201d Peru\u2019s National Association of Journalists said on Twitter that the verdict represented redress for the Bust\u00edos family and an \u201cimportant step towards justice and the defense of press freedom in Peru\u201d."

            "date": "2023-04-02T18:32:21Z",
            "content": "The former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson announced on Sunday that he plans to run for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, saying the US needs \u201cleaders that appeal to the best of America, and not simply appeal to our worst instincts\u201d while also calling for Donald Trump to drop out the race. Meanwhile, on the other side of the political aisle, the centrist Democrat and West Virginia senator Joe Manchin evaded a question during an interview on CNN about a potential run challenging his party\u2019s Oval Office incumbent, Joe Biden, fueling speculation about his own ambitions. \u201cThis is one of the most unpredictable political environments that I have seen in my lifetime,\u201d Hutchinson said on ABC, adding that he traveled the US for six months and listened to repeated demands for new leadership before declaring himself as a candidate. Hutchinson\u2019s announcement follows an eclectic career including stints as a prosecutor, administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration and a member of Congress. He joins the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley as the only members of the Republican mainstream to challenge Trump, Biden\u2019s presidential predecessor, for the party\u2019s 2024 White House nomination. Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, has been Trump\u2019s only serious rival in polling. Hutchinson spoke of his recent visit to Iowa, which has historically been the first state to vote in presidential primaries and holds a crucial spot in White House election cycles. The former governor of Arkansas had hinted at this candidacy for almost a year and said in May that a possible Trump campaign wouldn\u2019t deter him from running. He said he doesn\u2019t \u201calign\u201d with a lot of Trump\u2019s politics and that the country needed to go in a \u201cdifferent direction\u201d. In Sunday\u2019s interview, he said that Trump is better off focusing on his criminal indictment in the Stormy Daniels hush money case, as well as other legal concerns, instead of taking another shot at the presidency. \u201cIf we\u2019re looking at the presidency and the future of our country, then we don\u2019t need that distraction,\u201d said Hutchinson, who added that he would formally kick off his presidential campaign later this month. Meanwhile, on Sunday morning, CNN\u2019s Dana Bash spoke with Manchin and informed him of Hutchinson\u2019s announcement. The host then asked Manchin about his own plans for 2024 after the senator skirted a question about whether he would support re-electing Biden in 2024. \u201cI\u2019m worn out,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cThe people are tired, sick and tired of the fighting and division that we have.\u201d When Bash asked Manchin again about his plans for 2024, Manchin replied evasively, saying: \u201cWe have a movement. There\u2019s a movement. There\u2019s a movement going on that people want to bring the extremes back to the sensible and reasonable, responsible middle.\u201d He then went on to say he would like to be at least \u201ca part of trying to get a dialogue\u201d that would bring people \u201cto the middle\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s about our country,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s worried about their own political future. I\u2019m worried about the country.\u201d A millionaire coal-trading company founder, Manchin at times has undermined the agendas of Biden and other Democrats, occasionally voting against the party\u2019s interest in the Senate, where the party and the independents who caucus with it currently hold just a two-seat advantage. Notably, last year, Manchin torpedoed sweeping climate legislation staunchly opposed by Republicans before later helping ratify a less ambitious bill. The self-help author Marianne Williamson has so far been the only Democrat to announce an intent to challenge Biden for the party\u2019s presidential nomination in 2024. Biden is widely expected to announce another White House run but as of Sunday had not officially done so."

            "title": "DeSantis assembles senior staff for expected 2024 presidential campaign",
            "date": "2023-04-27T10:00:28Z",
            "content": "Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, is quietly assembling a senior staff for an expected 2024 presidential campaign that will be headed by his top political adviser, Generra Peck, and around seven other Republican operatives serving as top advisers, according to two people familiar with the matter. The leadership roster remains subject to change since the campaign \u2013 which could launch as soon as the start of next month \u2013 does not yet technically exist and most salaries are being paid, for the moment, through the state Republican party. But some of the senior staff have started to move in recent weeks to the campaign\u2019s base in Tallahassee, the people said, as DeSantis prepares to announce his presidential ambitions as perhaps the closest challenger to Donald Trump for the 2024 Republican nomination. The leadership roster, described to the Guardian, shows an initial team of advisers drawn from people who have previously worked for the governor, either from his time in Congress or his re-election campaign last year, as well as relative newcomers to his circle. Yet the lack of presidential campaign experience among the senior staff and the wisdom of recruiting a team that appears conventional in nature to take on an unconventional candidate like Trump has emerged as an early concern among some of the governor\u2019s allies. DeSantis has recently taken curveballs from the Trump campaign, which cut a television ad mocking him for using his fingers to eat chocolate pudding, something he has denied, and slammed him as unelectable in a general election after he became the face of a six-week abortion ban in Florida. The campaign manager is expected to be Peck, one of DeSantis\u2019s most trusted advisers, who most recently shepherded his 2022 re-election effort for Florida governor, which saw him defeat the Democratic challenger and former governor Charlie Crist by almost 20 percentage points. Peck is considered a highly adept political operator \u2013 notably including by Trump\u2019s own team \u2013 who associates say earned the trust of DeSantis and his wife, Casey. At the governor\u2019s inauguration, Peck was one of the people he thanked for his success. The political director is expected to be Ryan Tyson, another top DeSantis adviser and one of the best-known Republican pollsters, who has been tasked with turning DeSantis\u2019s legislative record in Florida into campaign policy that could work for a national audience. Tyson has had a rocky start. This week, DeSantis made a special trip to Washington to meet with Republican members of Congress, only for them to mostly turn around and endorse Trump. The only endorsement for DeSantis came from Representative Laurel Lee, who served in his administration. The policy team is expected to be headed by Dustin Carmack, DeSantis\u2019s chief of staff when he was a member of Congress, from 2013 until 2018, before he ran for Florida governor. Carmack was also the chief of staff for the director of national intelligence during the Trump administration. The communications team is expected to be headed by David Abrams, who came over from the Republican State Leadership Committee. Abrams previously worked for the former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and the New Hampshire governor, Chris Sununu \u2013 both potential 2024 candidates. Also a senior adviser for press is Christina Pushaw, responsible for rapid response. Pushaw came under scrutiny last year when the justice department directed her to retroactively register as a foreign agent for her work on behalf of the former president of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili from 2018 until 2020. In a reflection of Casey DeSantis\u2019s influence on her husband\u2019s political career, her top aide, Melissa Peters, is also expected to serve as a senior adviser, with the title of chief financial officer overseeing operations, acting effectively as \u201cthe voice\u201d of the would-be first lady on the campaign. The chief technology officer is expected to be Carl Sceusa, who helped set up the WinRed platform, which generated more than $1bn in digital fundraising for Republican candidates in the 2020 election in only 15 months. He is expected to work with Ethan Eilon, who is heading the digital team. DeSantis had discussed having Heather Barker run the finance operation, but last month, she joined Never Back Down Pac \u2013 the main fundraising vehicle for the DeSantis campaign. Barker\u2019s deputy, Tucker Obenshain, is now expected to lead the advance team. Also regarded as senior staff is Jason Johnson, the former chief strategist for Senator Ted Cruz, though it was unclear whether he will be leading a specific team or whether he will take on a broader top advisory role with the campaign. A spokesperson for DeSantis declined to comment on personnel moves. The senior staff roster effectively outlines a leadership team of around eight people as DeSantis looks to finalize his campaign operation ahead of a 2024 announcement that could come as early as the first two weeks of May or as late as July, one of the people said. That number could still expand, and some DeSantis allies have told associates that they believe other close aides to the governor could yet join the campaign. One name that has frequently been floated as an expected addition to the senior staff, for example, is the veteran national Republican operative Phil Cox. The campaign\u2019s ambition is to reach a headcount of around 80 people by the time DeSantis announces. That would rival the Trump campaign, which has been staffing up since November \u2013 but it is unclear whether DeSantis has a payroll system in place for such an expansion, the person said."

            "date": "2023-04-24T19:41:48Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden is expected to announce his 2024 re-election campaign as early as Tuesday, possibly setting the stage for an extraordinary rematch with Donald Trump. A Tuesday launch would come exactly four years after Biden announced his 2020 presidential bid, in which he warned that the \u201csoul\u201d of the nation was at stake after four tumultuous years under Trump. More than two years into his own presidency, Biden has struggled to heal political and cultural divisions he believes are tearing American society. But he has racked up a list of legacy-defining legislative accomplishments while working to restore US leadership on the world stage. Following Democrats\u2019 better-than-expected performance in the November midterms, Biden has been open about his intention to seek a second term. For months, the question was not if he would run, but when and how he would announce. Just before leaving Ireland earlier this month, Biden declared that the ancestral journey had reinforced a \u201csense of optimism\u201d about what he might accomplish. He told reporters the \u201ccalculus\u201d on a second term had been completed and he planned to run. An announcement, he said, would come \u201crelatively soon\u201d. Asked again on Monday, Biden replied: \u201cI told you I\u2019m planning on running. I\u2019ll let you know real soon.\u201d Partial to symmetry and nostalgia, Biden appears to have signed off on a plan to announce his 2024 campaign with a video outlining his vision, as he did in 2019. The president is scheduled to speak at the North America\u2019s Building Trades Unions\u2019 US Legislative Conference in Washington on Tuesday, an echo of his first campaign event in 2019, when he spoke at a union hall in Pittsburgh. Much has changed. The pandemic that reshaped US life for nearly three years has receded, due in large part to the mass vaccination campaign the Biden administration oversaw. Decades-high inflation is abating, though economic uncertainty lingers. A loss of federal abortion protections and threats to democratic institutions have fueled Democrats in key battleground elections. \u201cPart of the case President Biden will make to the public after he announces his re-election campaign is that he needs more time to do more and build on the things he has done during his first term,\u201d Biden\u2019s former press secretary, Jen Psaki, said on her MSNBC show on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s the message: \u2018Let me finish the job I started.\u2019\u201d Biden\u2019s team is touting the historically productive start to his term, which included a pandemic-relief package that temporarily halved child poverty; a generational investment in infrastructure; rare action to reform gun laws; a wide-ranging effort to combat climate crisis; lower healthcare costs; and efforts to boost US competitiveness and arrest inflation, leading to an unexpectedly successful midterm election season. With Republicans in control of the House and major legislative action unlikely, Biden has focused the second half of his term on selling these policies to the public. Visits to Japan and Australia next month will bring an opportunity to emphasize efforts to rally the world in defense of Ukraine and against the growing influence of China. But Biden will also have to contend with voter disapproval of his handling of the economy and Republican attacks on immigration. Perhaps most urgently, Biden must decide how to engage with House Republicans in a debt limit standoff. The speaker, Kevin McCarthy, has proposed dramatic spending cuts, including to Biden\u2019s landmark climate and healthcare bill, in exchange for lifting the debt ceiling and avoiding default. Accusing Republicans of holding the economy hostage in order to cut social programs, the White House has repeatedly called on Congress to keep negotiations over the debt ceiling separate from debate about fiscal restraint. Biden is dogged by low approval ratings and concerns about his age. Already the oldest president in American history at 80, he would be 86 by the end of a second term. Polling has consistently shown that most Americans, including a majority of Democrats, do not want him to seek re-election. That lack of enthusiasm is especially prevalent among young voters, who were skeptical of Biden in 2020 but ultimately turned out in high numbers to help him beat Trump. He has also tangled with progressives who accuse him of returning to his moderate roots on crime, immigration and climate. Yet the desire to keep Trump or a Trumpian alternative out of the White House remains strong among Democrats and independents. Most Democrats say they will back Biden if he is their nominee. While Biden is not expected to face any major challenge for the nomination, the field of Republican contenders remains unsettled. Trump leads the pack. The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, is expected to jump into the race, offering a combative alternative to Trump, who faces legal challenges stemming from his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, his handling of classified documents, payments to a porn star, a rape allegation and his business affairs. Biden is also confronting a legal inquiry into his handling of classified documents as vice-president and before that as a Delaware senator. Biden ran unsuccessfully for president twice before 2020. To defeat Trump, he mobilized a coalition of young people, women and voters of color while persuading independents soured on his opponent. Biden presented himself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders. But with his mind now made up about a second term, and little agreement over who might succeed him if he did step aside, he appears best placed to be the party\u2019s standard-bearer in 2024. \u201cRunning for the president the first time is aspirational. You can make all sorts of big bold promises,\u201d Psaki said. \u201cRunning for re-election is when you actually get your report card from the American people.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-04-27T06:00:24Z",
            "content": "The most irresponsible thing you can do these days is look away from the worst-case scenario.\u201d So says Rick Wilson. In the week Fox News fired Tucker Carlson, Wilson\u2019s worst-case scenario is this: a successful Carlson campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Wilson is a longtime Republican operative turned co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project and a media company, Resolute Square, for which he hosts the Enemies List podcast. He says: \u201cTucker is one of the very small number of political celebrities in this country who has the name ID, the personal wealth, the stature to actually declare and run for president and in a Republican primary run in the same track Donald Trump did: the transgressive, bad boy candidate, the one who lets you say what you want to say, think what you want to think, act how you want to act, no matter how grotesque it is. \u201cAmong Republicans, he\u2019s a beloved figure. He\u2019s right now in the Republican universe a martyr \u2013 and there ain\u2019t nothing they want more than a martyr.\u201d Carlson\u2019s martyrdom came suddenly on Monday, in the aftermath of the settled Dominion Voter Systems defamation suit over Trump\u2019s election lies and their broadcast by Fox News. The prime-time host, a ratings juggernaut, was gone. On Wednesday night, the New York Times reported that Carlson\u2019s dismissal involved \u201chighly offensive and crude remarks\u201d in messages included in the Dominion suit, if redacted in court filings. Carlson, 53, released a cryptic video in which he said: \u201cWhere can you still find Americans saying true things? There aren\u2019t many places left, but there are some \u2026 see you soon.\u201d Other than that, he has not hinted what\u2019s next. To many, a presidential campaign may seem unthinkable. To Wilson, that is precisely the reason to think it. Before Trump launched in 2016, \u201cpeople used to say, \u2018Trump? There\u2019s no way he\u2019ll run. He\u2019s a clown. He\u2019s a reality TV guy. Nobody ever is gonna take that seriously\u2019 \u2026 right up until he won the nomination. And then they said, \u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry, it can\u2019t be that bad. What could possibly be as bad as you think?\u2019 Well, everything. \u201cAnd so I think we live in a world where the most irresponsible thing you can do is look away from the worst-case scenario. I do believe that if Tucker ran for president, there is an argument to be made that he\u2019s the one person who could beat Trump.\u201d In the words of the New York Times, at Fox Carlson created \u201cwhat may be the most racist show in the history of cable news \u2013 and also \u2026 the most successful\u201d. Pursuing far-right talking points, he channelled the Republican base. Now he has lost that platform. Wilson discounts a move to another network or a startup, like the Daily Caller Carlson co-founded in 2010, after leaving CNN and MSNBC. But to Wilson, Carlson has precious assets for any political campaign: \u201cHe has an understanding of the camera, he has an understanding of the news media, infrastructure and ecosystem. He can present. He can talk.\u201d Which leads Wilson to Ron DeSantis, still Trump\u2019s closest challenger in polling, though he has not declared a run. Carlson \u201cis unlike Ron DeSantis. He can talk to people, you know? He is the guy who can engage people on a human basis. Ron is not that guy.\u201d The Florida governor has fallen as Trump has surged, boosted by his own claimed martyrdom over his criminal indictment and other legal problems. DeSantis has also scored own-goals, from his fight with Disney to his failure to charm his own party, perceived personal failings prompting endorsements for Trump. Wilson thinks DeSantis\u2019s decision to run in a \u201cTucker Carlson primary\u201d, courting the far right, may now rebound. \u201cDeSantis\u2019s people had been bragging for a year. \u2018Oh, we\u2019re winning the Tucker primary. His audience loves us. We\u2019re gonna be on Tucker.\u2019 And it was an interesting dependency. It was an advantage that DeSantis was booked on Fox all the time and on Tucker, and mentioned on Tucker very frequently. But that has now disappeared. Fox is all back in on Trump.\u201d Wilson knows a thing or two about Republican fundraising. If Carlson ran, he says, he would \u201cabsolutely destroy with small donors. He would raise uncounted millions. Mega-donors would not go for it. The racial aspect of Tucker is not exactly hidden. I think that would be a disqualifier for a lot of wealthy donors. But Tucker could offset it. He would be a massive draw in that email fundraising hamster wheel. \u201cRemember, in 2016 the large-donor money for Trump was very late in the game. Before that, they were all with Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz or Chris Christie. \u201cI have very high confidence you\u2019re gonna see another iteration of, you know, \u2018We love you Ron, we\u2019re never leaving you Ron,\u2019 and then they\u2019re gonna call him one day and say, \u2018Hey, Ron, I love you, man. But you\u2019re young. Try again next time.\u2019 And they\u2019ll hang up with Ron and go, \u2018Mr Trump, where do I send my million dollars?\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ve been to that rodeo too many times now.\u201d So if Carlson does enter the arena, and does buck DeSantis into the cheap seats, can he do the same to Trump? \u201cThis iteration of Trump\u2019s campaign is a lot smarter than the last one. I predict they would say, \u2018Let\u2019s bring Tucker in as VP and stop all this chaos, be done with it. You know, there are very few good options [for Trump] if Tucker gets in the race.\u201d Joe Biden and Kamala Harris versus Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson? It seems outlandish. \u201cAgain, I think the worst thing we can do is imagine the worst-case scenario can never happen. Because the worst-case scenario has happened any number of times in the last eight years.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-04-12T19:53:37Z",
            "content": "Liz Harris, an election-denying Republican lawmaker in the Arizona house of representatives, was expelled by her colleagues on Wednesday after she invited to a committee hearing a conspiracy theorist who accused elected officials of unproven corruption and bribery. Republican and Democratic representatives joined together to expel Harris with a 46-13 vote. An expulsion requires a two-thirds vote of the chamber and is rare. The last expulsion from the Arizona legislature was in 2018, though before that, the most recent was in 1991. Harris invited a woman to present at a joint elections hearing hosted by the Arizona house and senate in late February who shared unvetted allegations that various elected officials had illegally received bribes from drug cartels as part of an elaborate money-laundering and property-deed scheme. Among those accused by Jacqueline Breger, a local insurance agent with no elections expertise, included Governor Katie Hobbs and other state lawmakers such as the house speaker, Ben Toma. The expulsion resolution said that Harris \u201cundermined the public\u2019s confidence in this institution and violated the order and decorum necessary to complete the people\u2019s work in the state of Arizona\u201d. Before she joined the legislature, Harris gained notoriety for her involvement in election denialism. After the 2020 election, she led an unsanctioned canvass of voters, which was then debunked by elections experts. When Hobbs, a Democrat, won the governorship in November, Harris said she would not vote for anything unless there was a revote of the 2022 election. The joint elections hearing came after Harris voted against a Republican-led budget plan, and Republican leaders allowed the hearing as a way to get Harris to change her vote on the budget. After the hearing, the Democratic representative Stephanie Stahl Hamilton filed an ethics complaint against Harris. The bipartisan house ethics committee, chaired by a Republican, subsequently investigated the complaint and concluded Harris had committed disorderly behavior in violation of house rules. Her behavior had damaged \u201cthe institutional integrity of the house\u201d. The committee recommended the full house decide how best to discipline Harris. Harris had told the ethics committee she was not aware of what Breger would present to the elections hearing, but the committee received a batch of text messages from an anonymous source that contradicted that claim. The committee found Harris knew of the bribery claims ahead of the hearing and did not comply with internal deadlines to show any presentations to House leaders, which could have flagged the presentation as out of bounds. In one of the text messages, Breger told Harris she was \u201ctrying to think of something that won\u2019t raise a red flag\u201d when naming her presentation, a sign that Harris knew of the extreme allegations the presenter would bring up. Harris\u2019s Republican colleagues were split on the expulsion vote, with some saying she clearly crossed a line and others saying expulsion went too far despite her lack of judgment on the issue. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d Republican David Livingston said of voting to expel Harris. \u201cBecause this institution is more important than us individually.\u201d Alexander Kolodin, who voted against expulsion, said expelling Harris set a bad precedent because it held her accountable for comments made by a member of the public. The expulsion \u201cgives credit to these awful allegations and makes her a martyr for them\u201d, she said. Harris narrowly won her election in 2022 in a swing district in Phoenix\u2019s suburbs. Precinct committeemen in her district\u2019s Republican party will now nominate three people who could replace Harris, with the Maricopa county board of supervisors deciding on the person who will take her spot. With Harris\u2019s seat now empty, Republicans do not have a majority in the House, leaving them one GOP vote shy of what they would need to pass their priorities until her position is filled."

            "date": "2023-04-03T09:41:10Z",
            "content": "Families of children with rare genetic disorders are being made to wait more than a year for genome sequencing results under a flagship NHS programme, the Guardian has learned. Senior doctors said worsening backlogs in the Genomics Medicines Service risked children not accessing treatments or support designed to give them the best outcomes. In other cases, parents wishing to know if their child has an inherited genetic condition in order to plan future pregnancies are being left in limbo for unacceptable time periods, experts said. Many of the cases involve babies or children who have missed developmental milestones and whose doctor suspects an underlying genetic cause. Prof Anneke Lucassen, the director of the Centre for Personalised Medicine at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cClinicians want to offer advanced technologies in the clinic, but the waiting lists have become too long to do this effectively. It\u2019s not unusual for there to be more than a year between sending the sample and delivering the result to the patient.\u201d A senior consultant who wished to remain anonymous said \u201cnon-urgent\u201d patients at her hospital \u2013 one of the UK\u2019s largest \u2013 whose blood was sent for sequencing today would be projected to wait more than three years, based on current turnaround times and a backlog of 700 cases. \u201cThe system is in crisis for routine testing,\u201d she said. The Genomics Medicine Service, launched in 2018 by the then health secretary, Matt Hancock, aimed to bring personalised medicine into the mainstream by identifying genetic causes of rare diseases and cancer to allow more targeted treatments. A goal was set to sequence 500,000 patient genomes over five years to form the basis of a DNA database that, it was hoped, would also become a valuable national asset for biomedical research and drug discovery. The government signed a \u00a3123m contract with the US company Illumina to deliver sequencing. Lucassen said the government\u2019s aim of widening access to genomics technologies was \u201claudable\u201d, but the scale of ambition for the programme \u2013 and the 500,000 genome target \u2013 \u201cseemed somewhat removed from the reality on the ground\u201d. She and other senior scientists say that while Illumina is delivering sequencing effectively, the service is being severely hampered by a lack of investment on the NHS side, citing an onerous, paper-based ordering system and shortages of scientists and clinical geneticists to carry out the detailed interpretation of sequence data and explain findings to patients. Despite the extensive backlog, one clinician said doctors were being \u201cbulldozed\u201d into sending more samples for whole-genome sequencing when in some cases quicker targeted gene tests would be more clinically appropriate. Urgent cases, such as critically ill patients or prenatal tests, are prioritised and results are typically delivered in weeks or days. However, there are long delays for non-urgent whole-genome sequencing, with an average turnaround time of 12 months at the South East Genomics regional hub and 314 days at the East Genomics service. The target time for these tests is 84 days. Many cases involve babies or young children who have not met developmental milestones such as sitting, talking, walking and eating, where clinicians think there could be a genetic cause. Genome sequencing results often do not change the medical treatment, but a diagnosis can fast-track access to speech and language therapy or physiotherapy and be crucial for future reproductive choices. There are also some treatable conditions, including certain rare forms of epilepsy, where early intervention makes a significant difference. \u201cAt the moment, the service is not set up to provide test results to families in a timely and consistent manner to families,\u201d said Louise Fish, the chief executive of the charity Genetic Alliance UK. \u201cYou can\u2019t have cutting-edge science and cut-price services.\u201d Fish said she was aware of a family who recently waited two years for a result. \u201cThat\u2019s an unacceptably long wait if you\u2019ve got a six-month-old and you\u2019re not sure what\u2019s wrong with them,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are massive chunks of these tiny children\u2019s lives.\u201d Some also expressed concern that the Genomics Medicine Service will not have the capacity to process the 300,000 genomes that the government has contracted Illumina to sequence over a five-year period, raising questions about whether the contract represents value for money. A freedom of information request showed that the NHS had sent just under 60,000 sequences to the company by the end of 2022, three years into the five-year contract. An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cThe NHS is the first health system in the world to offer whole-genome sequencing as part of routine clinical care and has sequenced almost 50,000 entire genomes to date, helping transform the lives of thousands of patients and their families by providing a more accurate diagnosis, as well as more effective treatments. \u201cIn October 2022, NHS England launched a rapid whole-genome sequencing service to provide results more quickly, diagnosing thousands of seriously ill children and babies with a likely monogenic [disorder] and providing them with the best treatment possible.\u201d"

            "title": "Why did Sanna Marin lose Finland\u2019s election? ",
            "date": "2023-04-04T09:12:24Z",
            "content": "Sanna Marin was the most popular prime minister in Finland this century. She was praised for her handling of the Covid pandemic and led her country to join Nato with overwhelming support. In Sunday\u2019s election, her centre-left Social Democratic party (SDP) increased its vote share and number of MPs. Nonetheless, she and the SDP have been defeated \u2013 and Finland is moving to the right. The leader of the conservative National Coalition party (NCP), Petteri Orpo, is likely to be the next prime minister. And while it is possible he will ultimately form a coalition with the SDP, he may first seek to form a government with the far-right Finns party, which had its best ever election result. Why did Marin lose? Not because of a leaked video of her dancing exuberantly that prompted a drugs test (she passed): while that story drew outsized international attention, neither it \u2013 nor the spurious subsequent questions about Marin\u2019s character \u2013 have been a decisive feature of the campaign. \u201cIt made her fans more enthusiastic, and her enemies more critical,\u201d says Jon Henley, the Guardian\u2019s Europe correspondent. \u201cAt most, it accentuated the differences.\u201d By some measures, Marin and the SDP did pretty well: for a governing party to increase its vote share is unusual in Finland, and Marin\u2019s personal popularity was a central part of their pitch to voters. The SDP added three seats, but the NCP and the Finns gained 17 in Finland\u2019s 200-seat parliament. Meanwhile, the vote for smaller parties in the left-leaning coalition collapsed. While Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is a huge issue in Finland \u2013 and the reason behind its new membership of Nato \u2013 it was not a point of disagreement in the election. Instead, as Marin tacked to the left to shore up the SDP\u2019s support, the right successfully leaned into concerns about Finland\u2019s growing national debt and persuaded voters that it was time to cut social programmes to balance the books. \u201cAfter the pandemic and the war, the economy has come back to the forefront,\u201d says Henley. Who is Petteri Orpo? \u201cI saw somebody tweet that the world has returned to its natural state of being unable to recognise the Finnish prime minister in a crowd,\u201d Henley says. \u201cHe\u2019s not a very charismatic character.\u201d But while Orpo is unlikely to achieve international political rock star status, he is seen as a moderate and experienced figure and is trusted on the economy. The 53-year-old has led the NCP since 2016, was deputy prime minister between 2017 and 2019, and has held several government ministries, winning praise for his handling of a tenfold increase in asylum seeker arrivals in 2015. He has promised to cut spending on unemployment benefits and other welfare programmes in order to allow tax cuts. \u201cHe has been very clear that he won\u2019t change tack on Russia \u2013 it was the first thing he said in his victory speech,\u201d says Henley. \u201cBut the crucial question about the direction of his government is who he goes into coalition with.\u201d What will happen next? Under Finland\u2019s proportional representation system, the largest party gets the first chance to seek to form a government, a process that could take weeks. Orpo will send out questionnaires to other parties this week to scope out space for an agreement. He is expected to start by seeking the support of the Finns, the far-right party whose popularity was bolstered by worries over inflation and claims excessive non-EU immigration was to blame for the problem. The Finns\u2019 route into government is not straightforward, though. Two possible coalition partners, the Greens and the Centre party, ruled out entering any coalition on Monday, the Helsinki Times reported. Other smaller parties have said they would not join a coalition of which the Finns are a part, while more moderate backbenchers in Orpo\u2019s own party have reservations about making concessions to them. \u201cThe NCP and the Finns agree vaguely over the economy,\u201d says Henley. \u201cBut they have massive ideological differences over Europe, climate change and migration.\u201d It is possible that Orpo will turn to Marin and the SDP \u2013 but that coalition would still require support from two other smaller parties for even a majority of a few seats. \u201cWhichever way Orpo turns, forming a government is going to be tricky,\u201d says Henley. What does this tell us about the direction of travel across Europe? The result \u201creflects something that looks like it\u2019s becoming a general trend\u201d, says Henley. \u201cThe right did well in Sweden last year, and it looks like they will in Spain and Poland this year. It\u2019s about post-pandemic worry and the economy trumping everything else.\u201d At the same time, classic centre-left parties are seeing their vote share hold up above disastrous levels, \u201cbut that has to be put in the context of where they were a decade ago\u201d, says Henley. \u201cThey have about half the support they did.\u201d That\u2019s part of a general tendency for European politics to fragment \u2013 though the impact of this phenomenon is somewhat masked in the UK and US by their first past the post electoral systems. \u201cThere are 10 parties in the Finnish parliament now,\u201d says Henley, and there are 20 in the Netherlands. \u201cThe big parties of centre-left and centre-right which dominated politics after the second world war are no longer in that position. And it seems like their ability to reverse that trend is limited.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 10 April 2023. An earlier version referred to there being 13 political parties in the Netherlands\u2019 parliament. There are currently 20."

            "date": "2023-04-25T10:22:51Z",
            "content": "Good morning. Joe Biden has announced his 2024 re-election campaign. Biden had declared that his ancestral journey to Ireland this month had reinforced a \u201csense of optimism\u201d about what he could accomplish. He told reporters the \u201ccalculus\u201d on a second term had been completed and he planned to run. An announcement, he said, would come \u201crelatively soon\u201d. Now more than two years into his presidency, Biden has struggled to heal the political and cultural divisions he spoke of after announcing his 2020 presidential bid. A Tuesday launch marks exactly four years since that announcement. Polling had consistently shown that most Americans, including a majority of Democrats, did not want Biden to seek re-election. That lack of enthusiasm is especially prevalent among young voters, who were skeptical of Biden in 2020 but ultimately turned out in high numbers to help him beat Trump. But most Democrats said they would back Biden if he was their nominee. Tucker Carlson leaves Fox News Fox News abruptly announced on Monday that far-right host Tucker Carlson and the network \u201cagreed to part ways\u201d. The Los Angeles Times is reporting that the decision to oust Carlson, a prominent face of conservative news, came directly from Rupert Murdoch, the 92-year-old Fox owner, and is connected to a lawsuit filed by Abby Grossberg, a former senior booking producer on Carlson\u2019s show who claims she faced sexism and a hostile work environment. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Carlson found out about his ousting 10 minutes before its announcement. Carlson\u2019s departure comes less than a week after Fox settled a defamation lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5m. Filings from the lawsuit featured scores of vulgar text messages from Carlson. Despite repeatedly pushing lies on his show that election fraud took place during the 2020 presidential race, Carlson had texted a Fox News producer that Donald Trump\u2019s attorney was the one lying and was wrong in claiming Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cYou keep telling our viewers that millions of votes were changed by the software. I hope you will prove that very soon,\u201d Carlson texted Trump\u2019s attorney. \u201cYou\u2019ve convinced them that Trump will win. If you don\u2019t have conclusive evidence of fraud at that scale, it\u2019s a cruel and reckless thing to keep saying.\u201d Carlson\u2019s eponymous show averaged more than 3 million viewers a night, and was generally the most watched cable news program. \u201cCarlson has been uniquely dangerous and damaging \u2013 the leading figure in the right\u2019s larger undertaking of making stuff up and inciting a hate-filled narrative against the educated, cosmopolitan elite,\u201d the author and cultural historian Linda Hirshman told the Guardian\u2019s Margaret Sullivan. Donald Trump\u2019s civil rape trial: jury selection begins Last year, the famed advice columnist E Jean Carroll filed a civil lawsuit against Donald Trump, alleging that the former president pinned her against the wall of a New York department store and sexually assaulted her in late 1995 or early the following year as they shopped together. Today, a federal court in New York will begin selecting a jury to hear evidence in the case. It remains the only case to come to court among more than a dozen allegations of rape, groping and other sexual assaults against Trump, as well as accusations that he walked unannounced into women\u2019s dressing rooms at beauty pageants. Trump is not expected to attend the trial after his lawyers said he would not testify, and Carroll\u2019s lawyers say they do not intend to put him on the stand as a hostile witness. Trump has denied the allegations, saying that Carroll was \u201ctotally lying\u201d and calling her a \u201cnut job\u201d. He also claimed that he would never have assaulted her because she was \u201cnot my type\u201d. Evacuations from Sudan continue after ceasefire Four days after Sudan was plunged into chaotic violence as two rival factions battled for control of its capital city, countries worked to airlift their citizens out of the country as a three-day ceasefire brokered by the US began. The UK government is coordinating an evacuation of British nationals from Sudan, while France is helping fly Irish citizens out of the country, according to the country\u2019s ambassador to Dublin. Follow the Sudan liveblog here. The conflict is between army units loyal to Sudan\u2019s military ruler, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who are fighting the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti. Those on the ground say the warning lights were flashing red long before 15 April, when the shooting started. But western diplomats claim there was no \u201cearly warning\u201d of oncoming violence. \u201cThis is the worst of worst case scenarios,\u201d said Volker Perthes, the UN\u2019s special representative to Sudan. \u201cWe tried even with last ditch diplomacy \u2026 last week and we have failed.\u201d In other news \u2026 The Republican North Dakota governor signed into law yesterday one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the US, banning the procedure throughout pregnancy, with slim exceptions up to six weeks\u2019 gestation. Zooey Zephyr, a transgender lawmaker in Montana, has been prevented by Republican legislative leaders from speaking for a third day over her remarks about banning gender-affirming care for transgender youth. A prosecutor closed out yesterday a historic trial over the 6 January attack on the US Capitol by saying that the leaders of the Proud Boys were for ready for \u201call-out war\u201d and viewed themselves as foot soldiers for Donald Trump as he clung to power after the 2020 election. Stat of the day: Hong Kong\u2019s primary school enrollment is steadily declining along with its birthrate, one of the lowest in the world At least five Hong Kong schools face closure in coming years for not reaching the minimum 16 enrollments in the first grade. Education department data shows that kindergarten enrollment has been dropping since 2015, from about 185,000 down to almost 156,000 in 2021-22. Primary school enrollments also dipped, from 373,000 in 2019-20 to 364,000 in 2020-21, and to about 349,000 the next year. This comes as Hong Kong\u2019s live birthrate has fallen from 35 per 1,000 population in 1961 down to 5.2 per 1,000 population in 2021. Don\u2019t miss this: inside the crisis at Juventus, Italy\u2019s most glamorous football club Financial scandal after financial scandal has rocked Juventus, the Turin-based Italian soccer club with 8 million supporters. The club was accused of falsely inflating the value of players in transfer dealings, of lying to shareholders and, according to the Italian football association, \u201crepeated violations of the principle of truth\u201d. The club has become a symbol of the downfall of Italian football. But is the trouble at Juventus symptomatic of a deeper rot in world football? \u2026 or this: Arizona\u2019s experiment with third parties Arizona voted for Joe Biden in 2020, a moment of triumph for organizers who had worked for years to sway the swing the formerly red state blue. But now two new third parties want to get on the ballot, while other groups want to remake the way votes are cast and counted. Democrats and Republicans alike are worried about what this means for Arizona\u2019s new status as a swing state. But others argue that the system is badly broken enough that it\u2019s time for new solutions. Climate check: climate experts and advocates celebrate supreme court decision On Monday, the supreme court rebuffed an appeal by major oil companies that want to face litigation in federal courts, rather than in state courts, which are seen as more favorable to plaintiffs. Climate experts and advocates hailed the decision as feeling \u201clike a dam breaking\u201d after years of legal delays to the growing wave of climate lawsuits facing big oil companies.

            "date": "2023-04-12T00:42:51Z",
            "content": "Six months out from a general election, New Zealand\u2019s politics sits on a knife-edge, with the Labour and National parties splitting the vote evenly in recent polls. Polling from over the Easter weekend, conducted by Curia, showed Labour and National sitting at 37% each \u2013 up one point for Labour, and up two points for National. Their traditional coalition partners were sitting at 7% for left partners the Greens, and 10% for the libertarian rightwing party Act. That would place the projected seats for a National-Act coalition at 59, marginally ahead of a Greens-Labour coalition of 57 seats. In that scenario, neither could form a government, and the most likely kingmaker would be the M\u0101ori party \u2013 likely to win three seats. On Tuesday, prime minister Chris Hipkins confirmed he had met the M\u0101ori party to discuss the government\u2019s legislative agenda, but said they had not talked about any potential election or coalition arrangements. Other recent polling has also shown that there are likely to be just a few seats between the main parties. Polling by Roy Morgan from the end of March showed Labour on 33% and National on 32%. Under that result, the coalition blocs would sit at 59 seats for the right and 58 seats on the left, with the cross-benches once again deciding the outcome of the election. The M\u0101ori party has so far not confirmed whether it would support a Labour-led coalition \u2013 but it has ruled out working with the Act party. Speaking to the Guardian in 2022, co-leader Rawiri Waititi said of supporting Act, if the country maintained current policies: \u201cIt\u2019s a no. Absolutely. It\u2019s a hard no,\u201d and described it as \u201ca party that is just actively campaigning against the rights of the tangata whenua [Indigenous people]\u201d. Act is campaigning for a referendum on the future application of the treaty of Waitangi, New Zealand\u2019s foundational legal document which guarantees M\u0101ori rights and chieftainship. New Zealand continues to face economic challenges, which could work against the incumbent government. The increasing cost of living is a central election issue, with annual inflation at 7.2%. Roy Morgan\u2019s polling showed high levels of economic pessimism. The majority of those surveyed \u2013 52.5% \u2013 said New Zealand was \u201cheading in the wrong direction\u201d, a rise of five percentage points on the previous survey. It compared with 38.5% who said the country was \u201cheading in the right direction\u201d. Just 10% of New Zealanders said the next year would hold \u201cgood times\u201d economically, while 56% said there would be bad times ahead. New Zealand\u2019s election is due to take place on 14 October."

            "date": "2023-04-16T11:44:18Z",
            "content": "Only six weeks ago, Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour party seemed locked into the mood of optimism and quiet delight that had started to cohere over the previous autumn. Polls continued to show leads over the Tories of about 25 percentage points. Starmer was guardedly looking ahead to two terms in office and \u201ca decade of national renewal\u201d. Rishi Sunak and his allies, by contrast, were synonymous with disruption, impossible living costs and the state of constant internal chaos labelled \u201clong Johnson\u201d. We were still heading, it seemed, for one of those moments when a tired and divided ruling party simply collapses, and change becomes inevitable. Maybe we still are. Whenever the next election arrives, Conservative defeat is still the most likely outcome. But as MPs prepare to return after the Easter recess, the battle between the two big Westminster parties has subtly shifted. Labour\u2019s average poll lead is now in the teens rather than 20s, Starmer and Sunak\u2019s personal ratings are almost even, and gurus of political gambling have been heard advising against any bets on an outright Labour win. The key reasons why are not hard to work out: notwithstanding such grinding problems as the ongoing strikes in the NHS, Sunak is just about managing to look like an efficient, stable, confident kind of leader, while Starmer seems stuck \u2013 ahead, but coasting. There is an obvious response to that \u2013 which Labour people know by heart \u2013 and that is, given the calamity of the 2019 result, everything is going better than anyone could have reasonably expected. But does Starmer seem insurgent? To what extent do his arguments and ideas cut through to voters? How far is he from that point when would-be prime ministers so dominate the political conversation that the move from opposition to government seems almost inevitable? Given the huge trail of Tory wreckage that has mounted up over 13 years and the recent anarchy at the top, these are questions that ought to make Labour people uneasy, at least. Starmer and Labour\u2019s senior shadow ministers still mostly speak in a deadening political argot full of abstract nouns and concepts that have little resonance in people\u2019s everyday lives. A year ago, his pitch to the public was all about \u201csecurity\u201d, \u201cprosperity\u201d and \u201crespect\u201d; now, he and his team want to \u201cbuild a better Britain\u201d that will supposedly push ahead in the \u201cglobal race\u201d. Insurgency requires energy, pace and emotional intelligence, but he seems slow, leaden and strangely cold. His key weakness is much the same as it has always been \u2013 the absence of a story about who he is, the condition of the country he wants to govern, and how Britain needs to change. And in that sense, there are grim historical echoes: Starmerism, if such a thing exists, is as reminiscent of New Labour as its admirers sometimes claim, but less suggestive of 1997\u2019s glories than the murky years \u2013 from 2005 to 2010, roughly \u2013 when that project lost its way, got lost in internal battling, chased votes in the basest ways possible, and headed for defeat. Back then, progressive intentions and big ideas were often lost in loud talk about \u201cyobs\u201d, making foreign nationals carry ID cards, and welfare cheats. Now, Labour promises crackdowns and \u201crespect orders\u201d \u2013 Tony Blair\u2019s old adage about being tough on both crime and the causes of crime seems to have lost its second half \u2013 and says it is keeping a close eye on the cost of benefit fraud. The imperative, it seems, is to echo the supposed views of the so-called hero voters in seats Labour recently lost to the Tories, with any unease from leftwing faint-hearts cited as welcome proof that the leader is, to use his chosen word, \u201cruthless\u201d. Meanwhile, tactics and strategy still seem woefully incoherent. Up until the recent spurt of crass anti-Sunak attack ads \u2013 defended over the weekend by the deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner as \u201cno-nonsense\u201d and \u201cfactual\u201d \u2013 there was a drive to make Starmer\u2019s lack of political experience an asset and portray him as a dutiful public servant uninterested in the usual Westminster games: now, he looks like the opposite. All this matters for two very big reasons. First, as those tightening polls suggest, Labour\u2019s underperformance still leaves room for a Conservative revival and a narrow election win. And there is another set of possibilities, fraught with different risks: Labour taking power with a small Commons majority \u2013 or as a minority administration, whose fragility would be sealed by Starmer\u2019s explicit rejection of coalitions or agreements with other parties. As things stand, without a defining narrative or much of a relationship with the electorate, either scenario would reveal Labour as a precarious political force, at the mercy of both events and its adversaries. No one should underestimate what a Starmer-led government would be up against, even if Labour won outright. The UK economy remains in a perilous state, not least in the context of continued fears about the stability of the global banking system. The effects of Brexit now play out in the kind of visceral scenes \u2013 queues and shortages, chiefly \u2013 that any government should fear. Thanks in part to Labour\u2019s nervous embrace of spending restraint, our public services will still be vulnerable to crises and meltdowns. And then there are the dangers of a reborn Tory party. A couple of weeks ago, I had a long conversation with the academic Tim Bale, who has just published an impressive book, The Conservative Party After Brexit, subtitled \u201cturmoil and transformation\u201d. When we talked about the prospect of Tory defeat and what might follow it, he highlighted the near-disappearance of centrist Conservative voices and the likelihood of a reversion to the kind of hard-right instincts that Sunak has managed to smooth over. The next leadership contest, he said, may well be between Kemi Badenoch and Suella Braverman. The former would mix her populist, Brexity aspects with the kind of free-marketry that so spectacularly imploded when Liz Truss was in charge; the latter would take her party perilously close to the kind of organised nastiness pioneered by such politicians as Nigel Farage and Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. In either scenario, the Tories would be backed by a fierce and formidable machine: the rightwing press, internet provocateurs, and the deeply anti-Labour voices now given a daily platform by TalkTV and GB News. More than ever before, every national mishap would be amplified into a crisis, and Labour failure would present a huge opportunity; even, come an election, the chance to finally see off everything deemed \u201cwoke\u201d and to finish whatever deranged post-Brexit business the Tories had left unfinished. Those are the stakes. And in that sense, drawing attention to Starmer\u2019s shortcomings ought not to be a matter of factional fighting or ideological point-scoring, but something much more universal: a reminder that for all our sakes, he urgently needs to up his game.

            "content": "Only three in 10 Britons think the monarchy is \u201cvery important\u201d, the lowest proportion on record, a poll shows as the king\u2019s coronation approaches. A survey by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) shows public support for the monarchy has fallen to a historic low. A total of 45% of respondents said either it should be abolished, was not at all important or not very important. In 2022, the year of the late queen\u2019s platinum jubilee, 35% of respondents gave one of the same three answers. Overall, answers in 2023 displayed a drop in support for the monarchy to roughly the levels last seen in 2021. The data, based on 6,638 interviews, builds on 40 years of data collected for the annual British Social Attitudes survey. It shows the number of people who say the monarchy is \u201cvery important\u201d has fallen to 29%, from 38% in 2022. This reflects a long-term trend of declining support for the monarchy, with the new research showing the number of those answering \u201cvery important\u201d at the lowest level since data collection began in 1983. But the return to 2021 levels is in keeping with the bump in popularity the Windsors tend to receive during showpiece events such as jubilees, weddings or births, NatCen noted. Guy Goodwin, the chief executive of NatCen, said: \u201cWhilst we are observing a downward trend in support for the monarchy, it is clear from the data that important national events and celebrations, such as jubilees, marriages and births, have a clear and positive effect on society\u2019s views towards the monarchy. \u201cThroughout the 2010s, we saw an increase in support for Britain to continue to have a monarchy, which coincided with the marriage of HRH the Prince of Wales, and the queen\u2019s diamond jubilee celebrations.\u201d A total of 26% of people surveyed said the monarchy was \u201cquite important\u201d, up two percentage points on 2021. But 20% said it was \u201cnot very important\u201d, also up two points since 2021. A quarter of those questioned said the monarchy was \u201cnot at all important/should be abolished\u201d, a proportion that has remained unchanged since 2021. Goodwin said it was an additional concern that just 12% of 18- to 34-year-olds view the monarchy as \u201cvery important\u201d, compared with 42% of those aged 55 and older. He said: \u201cThe challenge going forward will be for the monarchy to deliver its relevance and appeal to a younger generation to maintain this support.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-04-06T12:42:22Z",
            "content": "One of Zimbabwe\u2019s most vocal opposition politicians, Fadzayi Mahere, has narrowly avoided a prison sentence after being convicted of \u201ccommunicating falsehoods\u201d in 2021. The verdict has stoked fears of a brutal state clampdown on freedom of expression before this summer\u2019s general election. Mahere, the firebrand spokesperson for the main opposition party, Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), and one of the country\u2019s leading politicians, faced up to 20 years in prison. She was fined US$500 (\u00a3400). Handing down the judgment on Wednesday, a Harare magistrate said Mahere was a first offender and deserved a lighter sentence. \u201cI am not going to send you to prison because your moral blameworthiness is not too high,\u201d the magistrate said in handing down the sentence. State prosecutors told the court that Mahere posted a video on Twitter of a woman with a baby strapped to her back being beaten by a police officer with a truncheon in 2021. In the post, Mahere claimed the baby had killed in the incident but police later confirmed the child had not died. During cross-examination, prosecutors had pushed for a custodial sentence. \u201cA file for community service will trivialise the case,\u201d the court heard. Inside court, Mahere\u2019s mother sobbed quietly after the magistrate delivered the ruling. Her conviction comes ahead of a crucial presidential election that pits the CCC against the ruling Zanu-PF, which has been in power since independence in 1980. Outside court, a defiant Mahere said citizens had the right to freedom of expression. \u201cAs citizens who are desirous of change, who are hopeful about a new Zimbabwe, that courage to speak in line with what the constitution permits should never be taken away,\u201d she said. \u201cRegardless of what transpired today, I remain bound with what the constitution provides and that is to speak freely,\u201d Mahere told reporters outside Harare magistrates court. Hopewell Chin\u2019ono, a prominent journalist and freedom of expression campaigner, described Mahere\u2019s conviction as \u201ctragic\u201d. A similar charge against Chin\u2019ono was thrown out by the high court last year as it was based on what he called a \u201cnonexistent\u201d law. Chin\u2019ono said on Twitter: \u201cThis is so tragic for the country to have someone convicted with a law that doesn\u2019t exist. I was arrested in January 2021 using the same facts in Fadzayi\u2019s case, and the high court threw out the case unopposed on the basis that the law doesn\u2019t exist. Zimbabwe, oh my Zimbabwe.\u201d Evan Mawarire, a cleric and political activist who has been arrested several times in Zimbabwe, tweeted: \u201cThe arrest, trial and conviction of opposition politician Fadzai [sic] Mahere by the Zimbabwean government has been a total sham and farce. \u201cShe did not commit a crime and this is nothing but persecution for her sterling work in challenging the dictatorship,\u201d he said. Mahere has been the subject of repeated government attacks for speaking out against corruption. In 2020, she was arrested for staging a one-woman demonstration against rising corruption. At that time, other campaigners, including the Booker prize-shortlisted writer Tsitsi Dangarembga, were also arrested. Dangarembga was convicted of \u201cpromoting public violence\u201d last September for joining a peaceful anti-government demonstration. Political commentators accuse the ruling party of using the courts to intimidate the opposition, which is widely viewed as a real threat to President Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s grip on power. In January police raided a CCC meeting at a private home in Budiriro township, 11 miles (18km) from the capital, Harare, and arrested 25 activists for holding a political gathering. Another leading opposition figure, Job Sikhala, has been in prison on charges of inciting violence and obstructing the course of justice for more than 200 days, with his trial constantly being delayed. The CCC leader, Nelson Chamisa, will again face Mnangagwa in the presidential election, which comes amid growing anger over the ailing economy and rising unemployment."

            "date": "2023-04-24T15:18:34Z",
            "content": "A significant majority of Americans do not support laws that would prohibit access to drugs used in medication abortions, and confidence in the US supreme court is at a new low, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released on Monday. A majority of Americans also do not believe federal judges should be able to overturn the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) approval of a prescription drug, the poll found. Sixty-four per cent of Americans oppose a law that would ban access to medication abortion \u2013 the use of prescribed pills to end a pregnancy. There was broad partisan consensus on that \u2013 73% of Democrats opposed such a ban, along with 57% of independents and 55% of Republicans. The finding comes amid a somewhat muted Republican response as an effort to block access to mifepristone moves through the federal courts. A federal judge in Texas blocked access to the pill earlier this month, overturning the FDA\u2019s approval of the drug more than two decades ago. The US supreme court temporarily halted that ruling on Friday, allowing continued access to the medication while an appeal proceeds. The survey of 1,291 adults was conducted from 17 to 19 April \u2013 before the US supreme court\u2019s decision. After the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, Democrats seized on concerns about abortion to win key races last year as well as a state supreme court race in Wisconsin earlier this month. \u201cThis is an issue that Republicans have largely been on the wrong side of,\u201d said US Republican congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina this month. \u201cWe have over the last nine months not shown compassion towards women. And this is one of the issues that I\u2019ve tried to lead on, as someone who is pro-life and just has some common sense. \u201cIf we have our head in the sand, we\u2019re gonna lose,\u201d said Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican US senator who supports a national 15-week abortion ban. The NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist poll also found that 61% of Americans do not support allowing federal judges to overturn the FDA\u2019s approval of a drug. Partisan attitudes were more split on that issue, with 75% of Democrats, 62% of independents, and 45% of Republicans saying the FDA should have the final say. A slim majority of Republicans (51%) said that judges should be able to overturn the FDA\u2019s approval. The survey also found that Americans\u2019 confidence in the US supreme court continued to drop as the high court faces scrutiny over its continued politicization and Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s financial relationships. Only 37% of Americans said they had a great deal or some level of confidence in the court. That was the lowest level of confidence the poll had measured since 2018, when it first began asking about confidence. Then, 59% of Americans said they had a great deal or good amount of confidence in the court."

            "date": "2023-04-18T11:23:39Z",
            "content": "Vladimir Putin has made a rare visit to a military headquarters in Russian-occupied Ukraine in an area where his troops are bracing themselves for an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive in the coming weeks. Video put out by the Kremlin showed the Russian president stepping off a military helicopter and then being driven to a military headquarters in southern Ukraine, where he met a senior officer from Russia\u2019s airborne troops, Col Gen Mikhail Teplinsky, who has reportedly taken up a powerful new role in the invasion. The Kremlin claimed Putin had travelled to the front without either the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, or the chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov, and directly appealed to local commanders for information about the battle in Ukraine\u2019s Kherson region, where Russian troops have retreated and are reinforcing their positions. \u201cI do not want to distract you from your direct duties related to command and control,\u201d Putin said during the visit, according to the Kremlin. \u201cIt is important for me to hear your opinion on how the situation is developing, to listen to you, to exchange information. I would ask you to start your report with the situation [near Kherson and then near Zaporizhzhia],\u201d he said. Moscow claims to have annexed four Ukrainian regions but its forces are locked in a grinding artillery battle in the eastern Donbas with heavy losses on both sides, while they have been forced to pull back in southern Kherson, which Putin visited. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, claimed the video was shot on Monday. But the Russian independent news site Agentstvo noted that Putin referred to the upcoming Orthodox church celebration of Easter, indicating he may have visited the region last week and then waited to publish the footage. The visit follows a lacklustre Russian winter offensive that has failed to take considerable ground in east Ukraine. The Kremlin said Putin attended a military command meeting in the Kherson region. He heard reports from commanders of the airborne forces and the \u201cDnieper\u201d army group and other senior officers on the situation in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, both of which Moscow has proclaimed part of Russia. Russian troops retreated from the city of Kherson in November and have been reinforcing their positions on the opposite bank of the Dnipro River. Putin was flanked by Teplinsky, the commander of Russia\u2019s airborne troops, and Col Gen Oleg Makarevich. British military intelligence have claimed Teplinsky was recently given a \u201cmajor role in Ukraine \u2026 [he] is likely one of the few senior Russian generals widely respected by the rank and file\u201d. The intelligence agency said Teplinsky\u2019s recent turbulent career, which included a demotion following a retreat from the Kherson region last year, \u201csuggests intense tensions between factions within the Russian general staff about Russia\u2019s military approach in Ukraine\u201d. The Russian president also visited national guard headquarters in Ukraine\u2019s Luhansk region in the eastern Donbas, which Moscow also claims to have annexed along with the adjacent Donetsk region. \u201cThe head of state also congratulated the servicemen on the Easter holiday and gave them copies of icons as a gift,\u201d the Kremlin said. Russia\u2019s Orthodox church celebrated Easter on 16 April. Reuters contributed to this report"

            "date": "2023-04-28T02:00:09Z",
            "content": "Securing a lasting ceasefire in Sudan is essential in order to limit the opportunity for malign outside actors to intervene in the fighting on a greater scale, former diplomats and analysts have said. Foreign leaders including the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and Israeli officials have offered to help mediate in Sudan, while the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he had engaged the African Union in an attempt to ensure a long-term ceasefire. Foreign powers in the Gulf, the US and Europe swept into Sudan after the 2019 uprising that overthrew the former dictator Omar al-Bashir, eager to deepen their own financial interests or engage politically with the two men now at war with each other: Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country\u2019s de facto ruler, and the former warlord Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, Burhan\u2019s deputy on the ruling council established in the aftermath of the uprising. \u201cThe longer this goes on, the more likely it is that outside actors will start trying to back one general or another, hyper-charging this fight and turning it into a similar struggle to the situation in Libya or Syria,\u201d said Jeffrey Feltman, a longtime diplomat and former US special envoy for the Horn of Africa. After Bashir\u2019s overthrow, Saudi Arabia was eager to invest in verdant land on the banks of the Blue and White Nile rivers where prized alfalfa crops run for miles, as a way to exploit Sudan\u2019s water resources and preserve what little water remains in the Gulf. The United Arab Emirates fostered a close connection with Hemedti, whose Rapid Support Forces control most of Sudan\u2019s goldmines and are involved in the export of Sudanese gold to Dubai. A consortium of Emirati companies including one connected to its sovereign wealth fund signed a $6bn agreement late last year to build a new industrial zone and port facility north of Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast. \u201cSudan for many years was seen as a key area for food security in different Gulf states, without any regard for the civilian population who live there,\u201d said Kristian Ulrichsen of Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy. \u201cYet it\u2019s seen as ripe for dealmaking at the very top level, so we\u2019ve seen the empowerment and enrichment of state and non-state actors like Hemedti who have grown rich on these connections; in Hemedti\u2019s case goldmining, with much of that gold shipped to the UAE for refining and then onward sales. It\u2019s another critical node in the economic network that enabled him to become so influential.\u201d As tensions simmered between Burhan and Hemedti in the opening months of this year, Sudan\u2019s international partners did little to intervene. A readout from a visit by the Emirati minister of state to Khartoum in February said Burhan stressed a commitment to forming a civilian government, despite the reality on the ground. Burhan also conducted a \u201cworking visit\u201d to the UAE in mid-February where he met with the president, Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. A month later he embarked on a four-day official visit to both the UAE and Saudi Arabia, where he met the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Sudan\u2019s northern neighbour Egypt was also eager to engage with Burhan after he and Hemedti collaborated on a military coup in 2021 intended to stall a planned handover to civilian rule. Burhan received a warm welcome in Cairo from Gen Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, whose security forces have targeted exiled Sudanese activists including with violence and deportations. Egypt\u2019s military and intelligence service evacuated at least 177 soldiers from Sudan with the help of Emirati mediation after the outbreak of fighting, saying the soldiers were there to train the Sudanese armed forces. The UAE publicly called on both parties in Sudan \u201cto exercise restraint, and to de-escalate and work towards ending this crisis through dialogue\u201d. Kristin Smith Diwan of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington said both Saudi Arabia and the UAE were likely to be eager to protect their newfound commercial interests in Sudan by promoting diplomacy. \u201cThe UAE in particular has deeper ties with Hemedti, both in terms of using him for manpower to execute their war in south Yemen, and it\u2019s also known that Gen Hamdan keeps a lot of his wealth and commercial activities in Dubai. For the UAE in particular, this gives them a certain amount of influence and leverage over Hemedti, so the question is whether they\u2019re willing to use that,\u201d she said. Diwan added: \u201cI have some skepticism that the UAE in particular would prefer a full democratic transition [in Sudan], but in terms of the current situation where you have the two military actors openly fighting, that\u2019s in none of their interests.\u201d The UAE\u2019s partners nearby, particularly in Libya, appear eager to intervene in Sudan to protect their interests. Gen Khalifa Haftar in Libya helped train RSF forces in readiness for the battle, while his partners in the Russian private military force the Wagner group reportedly offered weapons to the RSF, according to American officials. The US defence department concluded that the UAE \u201cmay provide some financing\u201d for Wagner\u2019s operations in Libya. Wagner already boasted longstanding ties to the RSF and Hemedti due to its involvement in the gold trade across Sudan, and surrounding nations. Marat Gabidullin, a former Wagner commander and aide to its founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, told the Guardian: \u201cWagner has been present in Sudan country since the end of 2017. They sent about 200 people from the first assault unit there. The unit was mostly engaged in training the Rapid Support Forces and the local police. The soldiers were transferred to Libya and the Central African Republic afterwards.\u201d The former US special envoy for Libya Jonathan M Winer described the risk of Wagner intervening in Sudan as part of Russia\u2019s \u201cplaybook\u201d across Africa that Moscow already demonstrated with its support of Haftar in Libya. \u201cIt\u2019s what they did with Haftar: provide military support to a warlord with a decent chance of taking over the whole country,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re seeking to shape events by any means possible to wind up with a government that\u2019s beholden to them, seeking to extend Russian influence.\u201d Feltman said the opportunities available for malign forces underscored the importance of a swift end to the fighting. \u201cThis is why a humanitarian ceasefire is the No 1 priority, meaning the welfare of the Sudanese people, the second being preventing outside actors from starting to think they need to intervene on behalf of their preferred victor in this fight,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the key thing: if you stop the fighting, you basically eliminate the breeding ground for this outside interference.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-04-21T07:21:11Z",
            "content": "Taiwan\u2019s foreign minister has said he is preparing for the possibility of a conflict with China in 2027. Speaking on LBC\u2019s Tonight with Andrew Marr, Joseph Wu said: \u201cWe are taking the Chinese military threat very seriously \u2026 I think 2027 is the year that we need to be serious about.\u201d US intelligence believes that Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, has ordered the country\u2019s military to be ready by 2027 to annex Taiwan. China regards Taiwan, a democratic and self-governing island, as a renegade province that must be reunited with the mainland. Since he came to power in 2012, Xi has stressed that the Taiwan issue \u201ccannot be passed on from generation to generation\u201d. On Friday, China\u2019s foreign minister, Qin Gang, said both sides of the Taiwan strait belonged to China, and that \u201cthose who play with fire on Taiwan will eventually get themselves burned\u201d. Some US officials believe a conflict may come sooner. In January, Gen Mike Minihan, a former deputy commander for US Indo-Pacific command, said his \u201cgut\u201d told him to expect a conflict in 2025. On Tuesday, Adm John Aquilino, the head of US Indo-Pacific command, told the armed services committee in Congress that \u201ceverybody is guessing\u201d when it comes to predicting timelines for a conflict. Yun Sun, the director of the China programme at the Stimson Center, a US thinktank, said: \u201cMilitary capabilities are the necessary but not sufficient condition for China to launch an attack. Military readiness does not suggest that China will take the move.\u201d Sun noted that Chinese authorities had never publicly set a 2027 target. She said: \u201cI don\u2019t think Xi is planning to invade Taiwan in 2027, unless Taiwan declared independence by that time.\u201d Nonetheless, Wu\u2019s comments on Thursday indicate the extent to which Taiwan is trying to bolster support from the west ahead of a possible invasion. In the interview with Marr, Wu emphasised the risks to the UK posed by a conflict, saying that \u201ceven though the UK is looking at China as an economic opportunity in the long run\u201d, an attack on Taiwan would affect the UK \u201cin a very serious manner\u201d. \u201cTherefore we need to look at a comprehensive way in for the UK, Taiwan and other countries to come together\u201d. In particular, Wu stressed the extent to which the UK \u2013 and the rest of the world \u2013 is dependent on the semiconductors produced in Taiwan, which makes more than 90% of the most advanced computer chips. \u201cIf there\u2019s any disruption to the supply chain or to the shipping lanes, I think it\u2019s going to have a serious impact upon the rest of the world,\u201d Wu said. In an interview with the Guardian on Tuesday, the UK\u2019s foreign minister, James Cleverly, said the UK must not \u201cjust pull the shutters down\u201d on its relationship with China. But lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic are becoming increasingly concerned about the threat China poses to regional and global security. Wu drew an analogy between China and Russia, saying the world had failed to take Russia\u2019s aggressive postures seriously in the past. He said: \u201cWe did not stop Russia from taking over Crimea. And the Russians were emboldened to go ahead and initiate a war against Ukraine. \u201cWe did not stop China from imposing national security law in Hong Kong. And people were asking: is Taiwan going to be next? Now Taiwan is feeling all this pressure.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-04-12T14:14:46Z",
            "content": "Russia has tightened its conscription law before a widely anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive in the coming weeks, including introducing electronic military draft papers. The lower and upper houses of parliament rushed through legislation that will make it significantly harder for Russians to dodge the draft while automatically banning registered conscripts from leaving the country. The changes were pushed through with little public debate, fuelling speculation that Russia plans to announce a second wave of mobilisation, something the Kremlin has repeatedly denied. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the changes were intended to improve the military registration system and \u201chave nothing to do with mobilisation\u201d. \u201cWhen the special military operation began, you and I saw that in some places we had a lot of mess in the military recruitment offices,\u201d Peskov told journalists on Wednesday. \u201cThat is exactly the purpose of this legislative initiative: to clear up this mess and to make it [the system] modern, effective and convenient for citizens.\u201d In September last year, Russia\u2019s first mobilisation since the second world war caused unparalleled chaos and anger across the country. More than 300,000 men were conscripted to fight in Ukraine, while an even larger number are believed to have fled Russia. Under the new legislation, call-up papers will be deemed to be served as soon as they appear on Gosuslugi, a government portal widely used by Russians to pay bills, and will be considered officially received by a prospective draftee after one week, whether or not it has actually been received. Men who fail to show up at the draft office will be banned from travelling abroad, their driving licences will be invalidated and they will be unable to register small businesses. Andrei Kartapolov, the head of the State Duma defence committee, said these penalties could also apply to the thousands of men who were already outside the country. The changes will apply to regular conscriptions of men aged 18 to 27, which occurs every six months, as well as in the event of a larger one-off mobilisation. The Gosuslugi web portal was initially introduced as part of the country\u2019s modernising campaign and is also used for activities such as applying for a new passport or a marriage licence. Alexei Venediktov, the influential former editor-in-chief of the Echo of Moscow radio station, said the latest draft changes amounted to \u201cthe introduction of martial law without the formal introduction of martial law\u201d. Helpdesk, a website that offers advice and assistance to Russian men trying to avoid being sent to fight in Ukraine, wrote on Tuesday: \u201cIf you are in Russia and can be drafted, you are in danger!\u201d The draft changes are widely seen as an effort by Moscow to boost its military\u2019s long-term prospects and replenish its depleted army. Russia\u2019s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, earlier proposed increasing the armed forces from 1.15 million combat personnel to 1.5 million. Western officials estimate that as many as 220,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in the fighting so far, while leaked US intelligence documents suggested that 43,000 Russian soldiers had been killed and as many as 180,000 wounded."

            "date": "2023-04-27T10:00:20Z",
            "content": "Renewed clashes in Khartoum and in south-west Sudan have raised fears that the current three-day ceasefire due to expire on Thursday night will not be extended and fighting will instead intensify A surge in violence would threaten the evacuation of thousands of foreign nationals who remain in Sudan. UK military chiefs said flights would continue as long as conditions were safe, although the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said the UK \u201ccannot guarantee\u201d how many would depart once the ceasefire ends. The violence in Sudan has pitted army units loyal to its military de facto ruler, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, against the Rapid Support Forces, paramilitaries led by a warlord called Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti. The Sudanese army said on Wednesday that Burhan had given initial approval to a plan to extend the truce for another 72 hours and send an army envoy to the South Sudan capital of Juba for talks. There was no immediate response from the RSF to the proposal from the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad), a regional bloc. The Sudanese military said the presidents of South Sudan, Kenya and Djibouti had worked on a proposal that included extending the truce and talks between the two forces. \u201cBurhan thanked the Igad and expressed an initial approval to that,\u201d the army statement said. The move comes amid frantic efforts to stop Sudan, Africa\u2019s third largest country, sliding into greater chaos. Since fighting erupted on 15 April, airstrikes and artillery have killed at least 512 people, wounded nearly 4,200, destroyed hospitals and limited food distribution in the vast nation where a third of the 46 million population was already reliant on humanitarian aid. The true death toll is thought to be much higher. The World Health Organization said only 16% of health facilities were functioning in Khartoum and predicted \u201cmany more deaths\u201d as a result of disease and shortages of food, water and medical services including immunisation. An estimated 50,000 acutely malnourished children have had treatment disrupted because of the conflict, and those hospitals still functioning are facing shortages of medical supplies, power and water, according to a UN update on Wednesday. Though the ceasefire has led to a reduction in violence, there were clashes in Omdurman, a city adjoining Khartoum where the army was fighting RSF reinforcements from other regions of Sudan, on Wednesday. In Khartoum, which together with two bordering cities is one of Africa\u2019s largest urban areas, there was widespread looting. Deadly clashes broke out in Geneina in West Darfur on Tuesday and Wednesday resulting in looting and civilian deaths and raising concerns about an escalation of ethnic tensions. The crisis has sent growing numbers of refugees across Sudan\u2019s borders, with the UN refugee agency estimating 270,000 people could flee into South Sudan and Chad alone. Foreigners evacuated from Khartoum have described bodies littering streets, buildings on fire, residential areas turned into battlefields and young people roaming with large knives. \u201cIt was horrible,\u201d said Thanassis Pagoulatos, the 80-year-old Greek owner of the Acropole hotel in Khartoum, after arriving in Athens to be greeted by relatives. \u201cIt has been more than 10 days without any electricity, without water, and five days nearly without food,\u201d he added, describing shooting and bombing. \u201cReally, the people are suffering, the Sudanese people.\u201d Aid agencies have called for the international focus to now switch from evacuations to the broader humanitarian crisis. \u201cWhile swift evacuations from Sudan have helped thousands, what about the \u2026 Sudanese who remain in the country? A rapid surge of humanitarian aid is the key to helping millions in Sudan,\u201d said David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee. \u201cEuropean leaders are focused on evacuating their citizens, but there is no time to waste in shifting focus on supporting and protecting those who remain.\u201d Civilian groups fear the violence will enable the military to tighten its grip and revive the sway of an ousted autocrat\u2019s loyalists. Hopes for a democratic transition in Sudan were raised when Omar al-Bashir, the 79-year-old former dictator was ousted in 2019 after months of popular protest. Bashir has been in prison, with spells in hospital, on Sudanese charges related to the 1989 coup that brought him to power. He is also wanted by the International Criminal Court to face charges of war crimes related to widespread abuses during counter-insurgency campaigns in Darfur 20 years ago. On Wednesday, the army said Bashir had been transferred from Khartoum\u2019s Kober prison to a military hospital, along with at least five of his former officials, before hostilities started. Analysts said the move was part of a broader hope of many loyal to Burhan that they would be able to reinstate many aspects of Bashir\u2019s repressive regime under a new leader. Over the weekend, thousands of inmates were freed outright from prison, including a former minister in Bashir\u2019s government who, like him, is wanted on war crimes charges by The Hague."

            "date": "2023-04-10T19:55:43Z",
            "content": "The recent leak of more than a hundred secret US defense documents could just be the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d of a trove of material that had started circulating long before it was widely noticed, according to a new report. The disclosure of highly classified material already represents Washington\u2019s worst national security breach in many years, including details about Ukraine\u2019s lack of ammunition, US intelligence collection methods used against Russia, and embarrassing evidence pointing to US spying on close allies such as Ukraine, South Korea and Israel. Analysts suggest the damage to the US could still get much worse. The spokesman for the national security council, John Kirby, said Joe Biden had been informed of the breach late last week and was being kept informed of developments. Kirby also said Washington\u2019s allies were being consulted \u201cat high levels\u201d. One of the documents, dated 23 February of this year and marked secret, outlines in detail how Ukraine\u2019s Soviet-era S-300 air defense systems would be depleted by 2 May at the current usage rate. It is unclear whether Ukraine has since changed the rate it is using S-300 missiles, whether stocks have been replenished, or whether it is now relying more on other anti-aircraft systems. The same document also refers to an intelligence source as \u201cLapis time-series video\u201d, an apparent reference to a little-known and closely guarded satellite system for imaging objects on the ground. On Monday, Ukraine denied a report that it had been forced to amend some military plans ahead of a long-anticipated counter-offensive because of the leak. Presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said Kyiv\u2019s strategic plans remained unchanged but that specific tactics were always subject to change. The authenticity of the documents has not been officially confirmed but the Pentagon issued a statement on Sunday saying it was reviewing the documents which \u201cappear to contain sensitive and highly classified material\u201d. A UK defense source said on Monday that reports \u2013 citing the documents \u2013 claiming that a Russian fighter jet nearly shot down a British surveillance plane off the coast of Crimea in September \u201ccontain inaccuracies and do not reflect what happened in international air space over the Black Sea\u201d. Britain\u2019s defense secretary, Ben Wallace, disclosed the incident to parliament in October and said at the time that the UK did not consider the case a deliberate escalation, but that it had been due to a technical malfunction. He also accused Moscow of acting recklessly. The document refers to the incident as a \u201cnear-shoot down of UK RJ\u201d, a reference to the Rivet Joint moniker common for RC-135 reconnaissance planes. The investigative journalism group Bellingcat traced the leak back through a series of channels used by different internet communities, mostly involving teenagers with interests ranging from military gear, Orthodox Christianity, music and video games, all using Discord, a messaging platform popular with gamers. Racist language was common on the internet forums involved. Several Discord users told Bellingcat that the original source of the leak was a server used only by 20 people, which went by a variety of different names, most frequently Thug Shaker Central. It was set up by followers of a popular YouTuber called Oxide, who posts videos about weapons and other military paraphernalia. The sources said that the first leaks on Thug Shaker Central dated back to last October, and involved far more documents than have so far come to light. The most recent leaked documents are dated as recently as early March. The leaker allegedly was acting as the server\u2019s administrator and set up a channel within Thug Shaker Central called \u201cBear vs Pig\u201d, about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The documents did not spread beyond Thug Shaker Central until late February, when one of the users of the \u201cBear vs Pig\u201d channel, a teenager who went by the name Lucca, started posting 107 of the photographed documents on a more widely used server, WowMao, for fans of a UK-based Filipino YouTuber known for his video memes, often about European and Asian history. The founder of the Thug Shaker Central, which has since been deleted, and two of its former users, told Bellingcat that the files posted on WowMao are only the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d compared to the quantity of documents originally uploaded. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s out there,\u201d Kirby admitted on Monday. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who\u2019s responsible for this, and we don\u2019t know if they have more than they intend to post. So we\u2019re watching this and monitoring it as best we can.\u201d A few days later, a user reposted 10 of the pictures on a Discord server for players of the Minecraft video game. They remained there apparently unnoticed for another month before a user posted three of them on a rightwing forum, 4chan, and a little later in April, five documents appeared on the Telegram messaging app. On Telegram, part of one of the documents about Ukraine was doctored to inflate Ukrainian casualties and diminish Russian casualties. The Pentagon has referred the leak to the justice department for criminal investigation. The documents have a range of classifications, including top secret and Noforn, which stands for \u201cnot releasable to foreign nationals\u201d, suggesting the leaker is American. The documents were printed and folded, possibly to put in a pocket, before being photographed and uploaded. Another document, marked top secret from a CIA intel update from 1 March, says the Mossad intelligence agency was encouraging its officers to take part in protests against the Israeli government\u2019s plans to weaken the independence of the judiciary. The Israeli government denied there had been any Mossad involvement in the demonstrations. One of the challenges for the leak investigation is that the Pentagon circulates such material widely, considering its sensitivity. Thousands of US staff and contractors are frequently able to get access to top secret and Noforn material. The defense department has begun a review of distribution protocols for sensitive materials as part of an overall investigation and damage assessment."

            "content": "In terms of sheer volume of DNA at least, farm animals could be seen as evolution\u2019s biggest winners. There are currently about 80bn of them on this planet being reared for food, and their combined weight is more than twice that of the entire human race. But what a strange success this is: the lives of these animals are too often miserable and short, and the effects on the environment are disastrous. The single best thing each of us can do for the environment is to cut back on our meat consumption \u2013 and by at least 30%. If, like me, you have carnivorous children, you\u2019ll need a few tricks up your sleeve. This week\u2019s recipes have been tested thoroughly on meat-loving kids \u2013 they are cheap, popular and easy to make. Meatless meatballs Last time I made these, I mixed in a few \u201creal\u201d meatballs to see if my children would notice the difference. They did \u2013 but declared the meatless ones better. Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr 30 min Serves 6 4 garlic cloves, peeled 400g tin chopped tomatoes 4 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, peeled Salt and black pepper 400g tin chickpeas, well drained 400g tin kidney beans, well drained 1 tsp paprika 2 tsp cumin 3 level tbsp gram flour 1 egg 1 cup breadcrumbs (I used panko, but any will do) Oil, for frying 1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley or coriander Crush two cloves of the garlic and put them into a small pan with the tomatoes. Level the top with a spoon and gently pour over three tablespoons olive oil so it forms a thin layer over the tomatoes. Warm over a moderate heat until the first bubbles break the surface. Cook on a very gentle heat for an hour to an hour and a half (however long it takes you to make the balls) so that the occasional bubble breaks through the olive oil \u2013 you will need to turn down the heat gradually over the course of the hour. Do not stir. While the sauce is cooking, finely chop the onion and fry with a pinch of salt in a tablespoon of olive oil until softened \u2013 at least 15 minutes. Roughly chop the remaining two garlic cloves and put in a food processor with the chickpeas, beans, paprika, cumin, gram flour, and egg. Blend on pulse mode \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t be too smooth: there should be little lumps of chickpea and kidney beans through it from about the size of pine nuts to peas. Transfer to a bowl and season, going heavy on the pepper. Add the fried onion, and stir. Heat the oven to 140C (120C fan)/275F/gas 1. Roll the mixture into balls and coat with breadcrumbs, then fry in oil for about eight minutes, or until the breadcrumbs are golden. Put the balls into a serving dish, then into the oven for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, blitz the sauce with a blender, pour on top of the balls and sprinkle with the chopped herbs. Bolognese, our way This is a Chefs in Schools staple. It still contains some meat for flavour, but that\u2019s bulked out with masses of vegetables, which is healthier, as well as better for the planet. It is worth making a large batch and freezing some for future meals. Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr 25 min Serves 12 3 tbsp olive oil 2 onions, peeled and sliced 2 leeks, finely sliced 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped 1kg lean lamb mince 1 x 400g tin green lentils, drained 3 carrots, grated 2 courgettes, grated 2 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes 2 tbsp tomato puree 1\u00bd tsp sea salt To serve 100g spaghetti per person 50g grated cheese Chopped green herbs (optional) Heat the oil in a large pan for which you have a lid and gently fry the onion, leek, ginger and garlic until very soft \u2013 around 15 minutes. Scoop the cooked onion mixture out on to a plate and turn up the heat. Add the minced lamb and cook until the meat has browned, then turn down the heat and put the cooked onions back into the pan. In a large jug, tip in the lentils, carrots and courgettes and, using a stick blender, blitz to a smooth paste. Tip this into the meat, along with the tinned tomatoes, tomato puree and salt, then cover and cook over a low heat for one hour. When ready to serve, cook the pasta in boiling salted water for eight to nine minutes, then drain and combine with the sauce. Serve with grated cheese and, if you like, a sprinkle of chopped green herbs.

            "date": "2023-04-29T06:00:29Z",
            "content": "Royalists and republicans alike can enjoy a cut-price coronation quiche as the food writer and campaigner Jack Monroe has revealed her own twist on the official recipe served up by Buckingham Palace chefs. Monroe, the Boot Strap Cook, famous for her low-budget and store cupboard dishes, has dived into the Big Help Out, which is encouraging people to sign up for volunteering opportunities over the coronation weekend, to inspire the next generation of food bank, surplus food and community kitchen volunteers. Together with The Felix Project, FareShare, City Harvest and London Community Kitchen, Monroe will be helping out with a community cooking challenge. But her main contribution is a budget take on the royal chef Mark Flanagan\u2019s official broad bean, spinach and tarragon quiche. Replacing broad beans with frozen peas, fresh spinach with frozen, and double cream with cream cheese, she has cut the cost down to just 41p a portion. \u201cI looked at the royal chef\u2019s recipe and actually there is nothing to criticise here, really. They have chosen a recipe that was not too difficult, used ingredients fairly easy to source; [it] doesn\u2019t take a disproportionate amount of time or require great skill,\u201d said Monroe. \u201cI have never made a quiche before in my life. But I wondered if I could make it more cheaply.\u201d She has served her version to an army of the Big Help Out volunteers \u201cwho loved it\u201d, and even her son, her harshest critic, had given it his approval, she said. Monroe said the Big Help Out would create a great legacy for the coronation. \u201cThe scale of need at the moment for voluntary organisation and the services they offer is staggering,\u201d she said, urging people to \u201cbe part of the social moment feeding people and looking after people who otherwise are slipping through the gaps of the welfare safety net\u201d. She said: \u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of people have until recently realised how precariously close to the edge many of us live. The pandemic brought that home for a lot of people, how perilously close we are to personal disaster, and a real volunteer movement seems to have grown.\u201d Volunteering had saved her in the past, Monroe said. As a young single mum, using food banks, unemployed and on benefits, she had fallen into \u201ca real depression\u201d, unable to give her young son any treats, and constantly applying for and failing to get jobs. \u201cIt was just a Groundhog Day of \u2018no\u2019. It really chipped away at my self-esteem as a human being. And I was suicidal, I was chronically depressed, I felt I didn\u2019t have a place in the world any more.\u201d But through volunteering, she said, \u201cI felt a part of something again, a part of my community, it gave me hours to keep to routine and structure, a reason to get out of bed, jump in the shower and put on clean clothes. Gradually I regrew my self-esteem.\u201d Monroe said her own leanings were towards republicanism, though her family was more royalist. \u201cBut that\u2019s OK because we can get around the table together and have the best discussions. We will no doubt be doing a lot of that over the coming days.\u201d And, obviously, over quiche. The Big Help Out app is available at thebighelpout.org.uk. Jack Monroe\u2019s quiche recipe is also available on her website."

            "title": "UK gardens: get growing now for a budget spring makeover",
            "date": "2023-04-29T06:00:28Z",
            "content": "Fed up with staring through the window at a rusty barbecue set and flowerpots filled with last year\u2019s dead geraniums? With three bank holidays coming up and \u2013 hopefully \u2013 some sunny weather, many of us will be thinking about giving our garden a bit of a refresh. If your outdoor space needs some love and attention after all the cold and wet weather, but you haven\u2019t got the cash for a full-on transformation, there are lots of cheap and easy tips and tricks that can help you welcome in spring and summer. Start with the basics A fairly simple makeover could cost as much as \u00a310,000 for a 100 sq metre area, according to the tradespeople website Checkatrade, and for a complete transformation you may need even deeper pockets. You don\u2019t have to hire a professional designer or landscaper for a revamp, however. You can make small changes on a tight budget that will change your garden\u2019s look and feel. Chris Bonnett, the founder of Gardening Express, says: \u201cSomething as simple as changing the shape and size of your beds can give a fresh look. \u201cYou could, for example, create sharp lines if your home is contemporary or, if you\u2019re after a real change, try curved beds.\u201d Other simple changes that can make a big difference include painting fences and sheds to change your garden\u2019s backdrop, and furnishing your outside space with shelves to display plants and pots, and brightenng up the whole area by investing in solar-powered lamps and fairy lights. Do your own design There are plenty of places to get guidance on redesigning your garden for nothing. The Facebook group Gardens on a budget has provided many people with inspiration, and also check out websites such as Houzz, GardenAdvice.co.uk and GardenersWorld.com. Pinterest and Instagram are good places to search for ideas, too, whether you are looking for a total makeover or simply plant advice. Before you begin any significant work, create a plan of your garden layout. This can be done by simply sketching it on a piece of paper to give a clear overview and help you decide which areas you really want to focus on. Alternatively, there are several free apps you can use to create your own design. For example, iScape enables you to upload an image of your garden and add your design, including flowerbeds, paving and plants. If you are creating a more complicated layout, you can draw up a digital 3D plan using the Home Design 3D Outdoor &amp; Garden app or SketchUp. Use cheaper or fast-growing options If you are keen on a particularly expensive plant or tree, search for cheaper options. Acers can be pricey, for example, but a Cotinus or Amelanchier may provide the same look for significantly less cash. Rather than spending a fortune on individual plants, Bonnett says: \u201cTry buying fast-growing plants. Things such as euphorbias, grasses and bamboos (Phyllostachys) will fill up your outdoor space more quickly. \u201cYounger plants are also much more cost-effective if you\u2019re not planting from seed.\u201d Make your own plant pots Repurposed plant pots can make great statement garden pieces as well as being completely free. You can put plants in anything from mugs to boots, tin cans and buckets, for example. \u201cIf you\u2019re after a quirky look, try substituting teapots for plant pots \u2013 this is a great way to add some character into your garden,\u201d Bonnett says. \u201cYou\u2019ll just want to ensure you create some drainage, and a good way is to fill one quarter of the teapot with pebbles before placing your plants. This layer will allow the water to drain through and prevent the plants from absorbing too much water.\u201d He adds: \u201cAnother nice idea is to reuse jam jars \u2013 give them a good wash once you\u2019re done with them, pop a tea candle inside and use them to create a cosy ambience on a summer evening. You\u2019ll want to get about five or six and dot them around for a really beautiful effect.\u201d Meanwhile, you can turn plastic bottles into self-watering planters in the warmer months. Thomas O\u2019Rourke, the editor of the online publication Horticulture Magazine, says: \u201cI\u2019ll cut the bottom off and make a small hole in the cap using a pin or small drill bit before placing head down in a pot or raised bed. \u201cThis slow delivery of water is really useful, especially if you\u2019re going away or can\u2019t tend to your plants very often.\u201d Also, you could try local warehouses and ask if they have any spare pallets or boards that you could take to turn into multipurpose planters or create stylish shelves, for example. Repurpose and recycle Robert Kirby from the building firm QBuild recommends moving materials that you already have, such as gravel or shingle, to other garden areas. \u201cLow-cost materials such as bark or decorative stones are also an affordable, yet aesthetically pleasing, option to break up areas,\u201d he says. Meanwhile, you could source old items of furniture such as chairs and upcycle them for use as garden furniture. Danielle Bayliss, who upcycles for Rediscovered by Danielle, says: \u201cI tend to look for free pieces on eBay or Facebook, clean them with sugar spray, use a hand sander to rough up the surface, and pick up a wood preserver stain spray to give a nice long-lasting colour finish.\u201d Meanwhile, the team at Tisserand English Gardens say: \u201cWe love the look of using old butler or Belfast sinks, for herbs in particular, or farm-style troughs for planting features. \u201cYou can often find these at reclamation yards or, if you\u2019re lucky enough to live in an older property, you may already have one. \u201cWe love using metal features \u2013 something as simple as an old metal bucket with holes drilled into the bottom can create the perfect potted area.\u201d Next time you make a trip to your local recycling centre, see if there are any dumped, unwanted garden items, or furniture, that you can repurpose. Also look in junk shops and at auctions for old garden furniture and tools. Seeds and cuttings If you cultivate patience, you can save a small fortune by planting flowers from seed. This is much cheaper than buying flowering plants from a garden centre. For packets of cheap seeds try Poundland, Wilko, Amazon or supermarkets such as Lidl. For example, Amazon sells a wide variety of seeds for about 50p a packet. You can also take cuttings or divide existing plants. O\u2019Rourke says: \u201cThis is how the garden centres and nurseries tend to propagate most of their plants for sale, as it\u2019s the most cost-effective method of growing at scale. \u201cIt\u2019s really not as difficult as it sounds, and when you consider that single plants, such as trees and hedging, can cost anywhere between \u00a310 and \u00a3300, you can save a lot of money if you use this approach across your entire garden.\u201d Methods can vary slightly depending on the plant but, in general, you simply take sections of new plant growth using secateurs or scissors, plant with compost and ensure you water regularly. Tom Church, a co-founder of the money-saving community LatestDeals.co.uk, says: \u201cDivide perennials. You can buy those such as daylilies, hostas and peonies that you can divide and plant in your flowerbed. \u201cNext year, when they\u2019ve grown and spread, dig them up and pull them apart again to gain even more plants for free.\u201d Classifieds and swaps Whether you are looking for plants, seeds, garden furniture or anything else, it is worth checking local classified ads and websites such as Freecycle, Freegle or Facebook Marketplace. Some people will even give away an unwanted shed or greenhouse if you are able to dismantle and collect it yourself. If you have a neighbours\u2019 WhatsApp group, ask if anyone would be interested in swapping some of their favourite plants for ones in your garden. Alternatively, they may have unused plant pots or tools they want to swap or dump that you could make use of to transform your outside space."

            "date": "2023-04-17T07:23:03Z",
            "content": "The Minns government says it has uncovered more than $7.1bn in fresh \u201cfinancial pressures\u201d since taking office last month, and will delay the New South Wales budget three months until September while it conducts a \u201cline-by-line\u201d spending review. Additional \u201cdifficult to avoid\u201d costs include whether to extend funding for 1,112 temporary nurse roles that were only budgeted for two years to cover surge capacity estimates, the state treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, said. \u201cA person who walks into a hospital expects there to be a healthcare worker,\u201d Mookhey told a media conference in Sydney on Monday. Out-of-home care cost overruns will also total $700m, while the state\u2019s $70m cybersecurity unit is not funded beyond 2024-25, he said. Mookhey confirmed the government would press ahead with plans to abolish the wage cap \u2013 set at 3% for 2023-24 and 2.5% for subsequent years \u2013 on public services. \u201cThat remains our policy, and that remains our intention,\u201d he said on Monday, adding the extra wages bill would be funded \u201cby productivity gains and budget savings\u201d and that a budget surplus by 2024-25 \u201cremains our goal\u201d. Labor fell two seats short of forming majority government in NSW last month but its 45-seat haul was sufficient to end 12 years of Coalition rule in Australia\u2019s most populous state. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In its pre-election assessment, the independent parliamentary budget office deemed the costs of Labor\u2019s promises would improve the state\u2019s bottom line by about $1.3bn more than the previous government. It highlighted, though, a risk to the budget if Labor did not cover increases in public sector wages with productivity gains. Each percentage point increase in wages above the existing caps would add $2.6bn over three years without those improvements, the office said. Echoing the measured tone of the election campaign, Mookhey declined to label his predecessors as deceptive, or say they had left behind budget \u201cblack holes\u201d. \u201cWe aren\u2019t interested in casting blame,\u201d he said. In place of the June budget, Mookhey instead will provide parliament with an economic update. The finance minister, Courtney Houssos, will also conduct a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d of spending to determine what savings can be made, with a report due by June. \u201cIn this difficult economic environment, every family, every household, every business is taking a fresh look at the money they are spending,\u201d Houssos said. \u201cWe are going to do the same for the government.\u201d A separate strategic infrastructure review of significant capital works will be led by Ken Kanofski and supported by Infrastructure NSW. Preliminary briefings show the capital side of the budget is also facing $2.2bn in financial pressures, Mookhey said. \u201cThis is a conservative estimate and it is a volatile number.\u201d NSW\u2019s interest costs had increased from 0.43% for three-year debt to about 4% in a year, he said. Separately, Mookhey disclosed he had held an \u201cintroductory meeting\u201d 10 days ago with Brookfield, the Canadian investment group seeking to take over Origin Energy, one of Australia\u2019s biggest electricity generators. Origin said in February last year it planned to close the Eraring power station \u2013 Australia\u2019s largest coal-fired power plant with a capacity of 2,880MW \u2013 by August 2025. The coalition government sold Eraring to Origin in 2013. During the election campaign Labor said it wouldn\u2019t rule out buying it back if such a move were necessary to ensure reliability of supply. \u201cThere\u2019s no change in the government\u2019s position here,\u201d Mookhey said. \u201cAll options remain on the table when it comes to the future of the Eraring power stations.\u201d AGL Energy\u2019s Liddell coal-fire power station \u2013 now operating at less than 1,000MW \u2013 is to close by the end of this month."

The exercises are focused on \u201ctesting the ability to seize sea control, air control, and information control\u201d, state media said. A few hours later Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry said it had detected 42 PLA fighter jets and eight warships in Taiwan\u2019s air defence identification zone (ADIZ), with up to 29 of the planes crossing the median line \u2013 the de facto border in the Taiwan Strait. The PLA has sent planes and ships into the ADIZ on a near daily basis in recent years and, since the drills last August, has increased the frequency of median line crossings. A crossing by 29 planes is higher than average, and similar to figures recorded by observers during the drills held in August after then-House speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei. Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry said it would respond calmly, rationally and with a serious attitude, neither escalating conflicts nor causing disputes, after China announced plans for the drills. \u201cIn recent years the [Chinese Communist Party] has continued to send aircraft and ships to harass the region, threatening the regional situation,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cIt has used president Tsai\u2019s visit to the US as an excuse to conduct military exercises, seriously damaging regional peace, stability and security.\u201d The People\u2019s Daily, the official newspaper of China\u2019s ruling Communist party, said in a commentary on Saturday that the government had \u201ca strong ability to thwart any form of Taiwan independence secession\u201d. \u201cAll countermeasures taken by the Chinese government belong to China\u2019s legitimate and legal right to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d it said. On Saturday afternoon state media released a video it said depicted the morning\u2019s drills, including long-range rocket artillery, conventional missiles, and various planes and seacraft. There has been no report or notice of intended missile launches. Tsai, who strongly rejects Beijing\u2019s sovereignty claims, has repeatedly offered talks with China but has been rebuffed as the government views her as a separatist. She says only Taiwan\u2019s people can decide their future. On Saturday she said Taiwan had \u201cfaced continued authoritarian expansionism\u201d in recent years, making cooperation between democratic nations even more vital. \u201cWe will continue to work with the US and other like-minded countries to jointly defend the values of freedom and democracy,\u201d she said. Tsai will meet a visiting US delegation of lawmakers, led by Michael McCaul, chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, later on Saturday. China had threatened unspecified retaliation if the meeting with McCarthy took place, having staged war games around Taiwan including live-fire missile launches in August after Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taipei. However, unlike in August, China has yet to announce whether it will also stage missile drills. Then, China published a map at the same time as its announcement of the drills showing which maritime areas near Taiwan it would be firing into. Taiwan and the US had warned Beijing not to use Tsai\u2019s US visit, made during stopovers on a trip to central American allies, as a pretext for hostile activity. Taiwanese security officials had said they expected a less severe reaction to the McCarthy meeting given it took place in the US, but nonetheless had also said they could not rule out the possibility of China staging more drills. On Friday evening Fujian maritime authorities published a do-not-enter notice for a small sea area near Pingtan, in the Taiwan Strait, where it said live shooting drills would be held from 7am to 8pm. Earlier this week the PLA moved a strike carrier group, led by the Shandong aircraft carrier, through the Bashi channel into waters southeast of Taiwan. Japan\u2019s defence ministry also detected PLA guided-missile destroyers and surveillance vessels sailing between the northeast coast of Taiwan and its own islands in Okinawa. Chinese maritime authorities \u2013 which are under the same ruling body as the PLA but are not controlled by the PLA \u2013 had also announced an inspection patrol operation in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan\u2019s government told Taiwanese vessels, including cargo ships and ferries, to refuse any attempt by the patrols to board, prompting concern about the potential for escalation. China\u2019s announcement came hours after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, left China following meetings with senior leaders, including president Xi Jinping, in which Macron urged Beijing to talk sense to Russia over the war in Ukraine. The European Union chief, Ursula von der Leyen, also in China this week to meet Xi, also said stability in the Taiwan Strait was of paramount importance. Xi responded by saying that expecting China to compromise on Taiwan was \u201cwishful thinking\u201d, according to China\u2019s official reading of the meeting. Reuters contributed to this report"

            "date": "2023-04-03T20:04:24Z",
            "content": "A Chinese spy balloon gathered intelligence as it flew over sensitive military sites in the US, despite efforts by the Joe Biden White House to thwart its espionage mission, new reports suggest. China succeeded in flying the massive balloon over some military bases on multiple occasions and sent the information back to Beijing in real time, NBC News reported on Monday, citing two current senior US officials and one former high-level administrator. The balloon, which was the size of three school buses, was occasionally flown in a figure-eight formation over at least some of those sensitive sites before it was shot down in early February. \u201cThe intelligence China collected was mostly from electronic signals, which can be picked up from weapons systems or include communications from base personnel, rather than images,\u201d NBC\u2019s report cited the officials as saying. White House official John Kirby told reporters on Monday that he could not confirm NBC\u2019s report, but said the US limited the balloon\u2019s \u201cability to be able to collect anything additive\u201d. He added that the US government was able to study and analyze the balloon while it was in US airspace, saying: \u201cWe gained some useful context.\u201d The Pentagon said experts were still analyzing debris collected from the balloon after it was shot down on 4 February. \u201cI could not confirm that there was real-time transmission from the balloon back to (China) at this time,\u201d said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh, adding, \u201cthat\u2019s something we\u2019re analyzing right now.\u201d Beijing officials have vehemently denied that the balloon was a government intelligence-gathering asset, claiming that the US overreacted to what was an unmanned civilian vessel that had accidentally strayed off course. The balloon triggered a major national security incident and a diplomatic row, prompting the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to postpone a long-awaited visit to Beijing. Once the balloon\u2019s existence became public, its flight was closely tracked as it glided from Alaska to Montana, where the US Department of Defence stores some nuclear assets at the Malmstrom air force base. The balloon sped up as China tried to get it out of American airspace as quickly as possible, according to the officials cited by NBC. The officials said that the Biden administration had limited China\u2019s efforts to gather intelligence from sensitive sites by moving potential targets and by blocking the balloon\u2019s ability to pick up and transmit electronic signals. The balloon spent a week flying over North America before a US warplane shot it down over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of South Carolina on 4 February. Biden\u2019s administration played down the balloon\u2019s capabilities at the time. But after it was shot down, the White House confirmed the vessel was carrying equipment capable of intercepting and geolocating communications. \u201cIt\u2019s not a major breach,\u201d Biden said after the balloon was destroyed. \u201cIt\u2019s a violation of international law. It\u2019s our airspace. And once it comes into our space, we can do what we want with it.\u201d The debris is still being analysed by American security experts. China has deployed similar balloons to collect intelligence over 40 countries on five continents, the US government has claimed."

            "date": "2023-04-07T15:00:07Z",
            "content": "Australia needs to be \u201cruthless\u201d about prioritising which technologies it pursues under the second pillar of the Aukus pact to overcome \u201cregulatory barriers\u201d in the US, the shadow minister for cybersecurity and countering foreign interference, James Paterson, has said. The Liberal senator made the comments on the Guardian\u2019s Australian politics podcast, warning that an \u201cabsence of consensus\u201d in the US and a \u201cclear plan\u201d in Australia could see it miss out. On Thursday Paterson returned to Australia from a bipartisan parliamentary delegation to the US with a message about how to facilitate access to artificial intelligence, hypersonic weapons, quantum computing and other advanced technologies. In addition to the $368bn nuclear-powered submarine acquisition, the Aukus agreement contains a second pillar: the push to collaborate with the US and the UK on other advanced military technologies. Richard Spencer, a former US navy secretary, warned last month that the US export controls \u2013 known as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (Itar) \u2013 were \u201cthe biggest speed bump we need to overcome\u201d to make Aukus a success. Paterson said Australia needs \u201ca plan to overcome the regulatory barriers, particularly in the United States, that currently stand in the way to the successful delivery of Aukus\u201d. These included the US \u201cinformation sharing security provisions\u201d, intellectual property protections and \u201cin particular\u201d the Itar controls, he said. \u201cAll of those really are not fit for purpose for Aukus. If they stay in place in the same way they have over the last 30 years, then each individual item of Aukus, particularly under the second pillar of Aukus, will have real barriers to success.\u201d Paterson said there was \u201cmassive momentum\u201d behind the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines which \u201cin some ways will take care of themselves\u201d. But he said the technologies under pillar two will not. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cAs a country, I think we need to be ruthless about prioritising, which among those technologies under pillar two are the urgent priorities that we want to get done straight away and which of them are longer term and will bear fruit over time. \u201cBecause otherwise we\u2019re going to be biting off more than we can chew and we\u2019re going to really struggle to deliver the capability we need.\u201d Paterson said there was \u201cno pushback\u201d in the US to the first principles of cooperation, but there is a \u201clack of consensus\u201d about whether legislative change will be needed or a system of \u201ccase by case exemptions and executive orders from the president and other mechanisms\u201d will be sufficient to give technology to Australia. He said power in the US system was \u201cwidely dispersed\u201d. The minister for defence industry, Pat Conroy, has played down concerns about roadblocks to technology transfer under Aukus, saying the government was \u201cworking through the nitty gritty of that now\u201d. Conroy, who has visited the US, said last month: \u201cI think there\u2019s a real sense of energy \u2026 people [in the US] were very much focused on making sure the technology was transferable. There\u2019s very broad bipartisan support and I\u2019m confident we can get it done.\u201d Paterson has given support to the Albanese government for its decision to ban TikTok on government devices, but said it should \u201clook very closely\u201d at what to do protect other Australians from \u201ca company which is beholden to the Chinese Communist party [which has] unregulated access to \u2026 data\u201d. Paterson noted foreign interference also occurs as \u201cauthoritarian states have proven very adept at weaponising western social media platforms\u201d. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m concerned about, which I will explore through the Senate select committee on foreign interference through social media, is the way in which Twitter, under its new ownership, has kind of turned back a lot of the controls that it had on foreign interference and disinformation.\u201d Twitter had \u201cstopped the practice of identifying state-affiliated entities on the platform\u201d, according to media reports, he said, which \u201cdoes make the risk of foreign interference much higher\u201d. Paterson said he was \u201cquite concerned\u201d about the potential for foreign interference in the voice referendum. He cited China\u2019s foreign interference in the Canadian election, and a Chinese official reportedly saying that it \u201clikes it when western parties fight amongst each other\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Chinese Communist party or the Russian government or anyone else for that matter, has a strong view about the merits of the yes or no case in the upcoming referendum. \u201cBut they will see it as an opportunity potentially to exacerbate and drive existing divisions within our society.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-04-09T06:21:35Z",
            "content": "China sent dozens of warplanes towards Taiwan for a second day of military drills on Sunday, launching simulated attacks in retaliation to the island\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen, meeting the US House speaker during a brief visit to the US. Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry said it was monitoring the movements of China\u2019s missile forces, as the US said it too was on alert. China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) sent 70 warplanes, including fighter jets, reconnaissance craft and refuellers, into Taiwan\u2019s air defence identification zone (ADIZ) on Sunday morning, according to Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry. It did not provide a map or locations, but said 31 planes had crossed the median line \u2013 the de facto border in the Taiwan strait between Taiwan and China. The PLA had announced the immediate start to three days of drills on Saturday morning. By 7pm that evening it had sent 71 warplanes and eight ships into Taiwan\u2019s ADIZ with almost 60 crossing the median line. Taiwan\u2019s ministry said the activity had severely violated Indo-Pacific peace and stability, and had a negative effect on international security and economies. It urged other countries to speak out against China\u2019s actions. Chinese state television reported that multiple units carried out simulated strikes on key targets in Taiwan and the surrounding sea. The Chinese military\u2019s eastern theatre command put out a short animation of the simulated attacks on its WeChat account, showing missiles fired from land, sea and air into Taiwan with two of them exploding in flames as they hit their targets. A Taiwan security source told Reuters that on Saturday the Chinese drills around the Bashi channel, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines, included simulated attacks on aircraft carrier groups as well as anti-submarine drills. Last August, after a visit to Taipei by then US House speaker Nancy Pelosi, China staged war games around Taiwan including firing missiles into waters close to the island, though it has yet to announce similar drills this time. Chinese maritime authorities have issued just one notice of a live fire zone, in a small area of water near Pingtan, in the Taiwan strait. The mandatory notice warns air and seacraft to keep clear of the area, which is just a fraction of the areas designated for live fire during last year\u2019s drills. While in Los Angeles last week, on what was officially billed a transit on her way back from Central America, Tsai met the speaker of the US House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, despite Beijing\u2019s warnings against the meeting. The de facto US embassy in Taiwan said on Sunday that the US was monitoring China\u2019s drills around Taiwan closely and is \u201ccomfortable and confident\u201d it has sufficient resources and capabilities regionally to ensure peace and stability. US channels of communication with China remain open and the US had consistently urged restraint and no change to the status quo, said a spokesperson for the American Institute in Taiwan, which serves as an embassy in the absence of formal diplomatic ties. Washington severed diplomatic relations with Taipei in favour of Beijing in 1979 but is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China, which has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control, says Taiwan is the most important and sensitive issue in its relations with the US, and the topic is a frequent source of tensions. Beijing considers Tsai a separatist and has rebuffed her repeated calls for talks. Tsai says only Taiwan\u2019s people can decide their future. China has over the past three years or so stepped up its military pressure against Taiwan, flying regular missions around Taiwan, though not in its territorial airspace or over the island itself. Chinese state media said the aircraft flown into the ADIZ this weekend were armed with live weapons. Taiwanese air force jets also typically carry live weapons when they scramble to see off Chinese incursions. Late on Saturday, Taiwan\u2019s Ocean Affairs Council, which runs the coast guard, put out footage on its YouTube channel showing one of its ships shadowing a Chinese warship, though it did not give an exact location. \u201cYou are seriously harming regional peace, stability and security. Please immediately turn around and leave. If you continue to proceed we will take expulsion measures,\u201d a coast guard officer says by radio to the Chinese ship. Other footage showed a Taiwanese warship, the Di Hua, accompanying the coast guard ship in what the coast guard officer calls a \u201cstandoff\u201d with the Chinese warship. Still, civilian flights around Taiwan, including to Kinmen and Matsu, two groups of Taiwan-controlled islands right next to the Chinese coast, have continued as normal. In August, civilian air traffic was disrupted after China announced effective no-fly zones in several areas close to Taiwan where it was firing missiles. Meanwhile the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said in an interview published on Sunday that Europe must not be a \u201cfollower\u201d of either the US or China on Taiwan, saying that the bloc risks entanglement in \u201ccrises that aren\u2019t ours\u201d. His comments risk riling Washington and highlight divisions in the European Union over how to approach China, as the US steps up confrontation with its closest rival and Beijing draws closer to Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. \u201cThe worst thing would be to think that we Europeans must be followers and adapt ourselves to the American rhythm and a Chinese overreaction,\u201d Macron told media as he returned on Friday from a three-day state visit to Beijing.

            "date": "2023-04-12T14:14:46Z",
            "content": "Russia has tightened its conscription law before a widely anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive in the coming weeks, including introducing electronic military draft papers. The lower and upper houses of parliament rushed through legislation that will make it significantly harder for Russians to dodge the draft while automatically banning registered conscripts from leaving the country. The changes were pushed through with little public debate, fuelling speculation that Russia plans to announce a second wave of mobilisation, something the Kremlin has repeatedly denied. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the changes were intended to improve the military registration system and \u201chave nothing to do with mobilisation\u201d. \u201cWhen the special military operation began, you and I saw that in some places we had a lot of mess in the military recruitment offices,\u201d Peskov told journalists on Wednesday. \u201cThat is exactly the purpose of this legislative initiative: to clear up this mess and to make it [the system] modern, effective and convenient for citizens.\u201d In September last year, Russia\u2019s first mobilisation since the second world war caused unparalleled chaos and anger across the country. More than 300,000 men were conscripted to fight in Ukraine, while an even larger number are believed to have fled Russia. Under the new legislation, call-up papers will be deemed to be served as soon as they appear on Gosuslugi, a government portal widely used by Russians to pay bills, and will be considered officially received by a prospective draftee after one week, whether or not it has actually been received. Men who fail to show up at the draft office will be banned from travelling abroad, their driving licences will be invalidated and they will be unable to register small businesses. Andrei Kartapolov, the head of the State Duma defence committee, said these penalties could also apply to the thousands of men who were already outside the country. The changes will apply to regular conscriptions of men aged 18 to 27, which occurs every six months, as well as in the event of a larger one-off mobilisation. The Gosuslugi web portal was initially introduced as part of the country\u2019s modernising campaign and is also used for activities such as applying for a new passport or a marriage licence. Alexei Venediktov, the influential former editor-in-chief of the Echo of Moscow radio station, said the latest draft changes amounted to \u201cthe introduction of martial law without the formal introduction of martial law\u201d. Helpdesk, a website that offers advice and assistance to Russian men trying to avoid being sent to fight in Ukraine, wrote on Tuesday: \u201cIf you are in Russia and can be drafted, you are in danger!\u201d The draft changes are widely seen as an effort by Moscow to boost its military\u2019s long-term prospects and replenish its depleted army. Russia\u2019s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, earlier proposed increasing the armed forces from 1.15 million combat personnel to 1.5 million. Western officials estimate that as many as 220,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in the fighting so far, while leaked US intelligence documents suggested that 43,000 Russian soldiers had been killed and as many as 180,000 wounded."

            "date": "2023-04-15T06:00:35Z",
            "content": "Germany\u2019s three remaining nuclear power stations will shut down on Saturday, 12 years after the Fukushima disaster in Japan accelerated the country\u2019s exit from atomic energy. The closures mark the conclusion of a stop-start approach to atomic energy and a victory for the country\u2019s vociferous anti-nuclear movement. The facilities shutting are in Emsland, in the northern state of Lower Saxony, the Isar 2 site in Bavaria, and Neckarwestheim, in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in the south-west. The shutdowns leave a conundrum for energy policymakers attempting to balance growing electricity demand in one of Europe\u2019s industrial superpowers and efforts to decarbonise, against the backdrop of uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine. Germany last year delayed the closure of the three sites \u2013 which provided about 6.5% of the country\u2019s electricity in 2022 \u2013 after Russia reduced European gas supplies, triggering concerns about a shortage of energy over the winter. The country began phasing out nuclear power more than two decades ago amid a long-fought campaign against the technology, but, in 2010 Angela Merkel, then chancellor, announced an extension to the life of the country\u2019s 17 nuclear plants until 2036 at the latest. This policy was swiftly reversed the following year after an earthquake and tsunami caused the meltdown of reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan, triggering fresh anti-nuclear protests and political resolve to exit the technology. Nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island in the US in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986 had already entrenched the push against nuclear in Germany, which had begun earlier in the 1970s. Germany has switched off 16 reactors since 2003. The final shutdowns have raised questions about security of energy supplies and the outlook for Germany\u2019s carbon emissions. The country plans to close all coal-fired power plants by 2038, with the first round of closures planned in 2030. However, its parliament approved emergency legislation to reopen mothballed coal-fired power plants to aid electricity generation last year. A push to build more terminals to import liquefied natural gas has also been accelerated since the Ukraine war began. Coal accounted for just over 30% of Germany\u2019s electricity generation in 2022, ahead of wind \u2013 responsible for 22%, gas-fired generation at 13% and solar at 10%. Biomass, nuclear and hydroelectric power made up the bulk of the remainder. The thinktank Ember has estimated that Germany and Poland will be the EU\u2019s two largest producers of coal-fired electricity in 2030, responsible for more than half of EU power sector emissions by that point. Advocates of nuclear power argue that it provides a low-carbon, reliable alternative to fossil fuels for electricity generation. Critics say new projects are costly, frequently delayed and present environmental concerns over the disposal of nuclear waste. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the UK\u2019s Nuclear Industry Association, said the phaseout would worsen carbon emissions and \u201cfor a country supposedly renowned for its logical and evidence-driven approach is environmentally damaging, economically illiterate and deeply irresponsible\u201d. He added: \u201cAt a time of heightened concern about energy security, Germany will be abandoning assets that can displace 34bn cubic metres of gas a year.\u201d But Tom Burke, chair of the thinktank E3G, played down fears over energy security, and said a mild winter and high levels of gas storage in Europe meant concerns about power supplies next winter had eased. He said Germany\u2019s renewables industry was growing and that improving grid connections and battery storage across the country would be key to moving the country\u2019s energy system away from fossil fuels. \u201cThe coal is mainly being burnt for social and economic reasons, making sure the industry doesn\u2019t shut down all at once,\u201d said Burke. \u201cYou cannot have a technology transformation without a social transformation.\u201d Germany\u2019s abandonment of nuclear power is in contrast to the stated ambitions of the UK government, which last month kickstarted a fresh push into nuclear. Ministers have set up a delivery body for new nuclear projects and are running a competition for small nuclear reactors. However, progress on developing two existing large projects, Sizewell C in Suffolk and Hinkley Point C in Somerset, has been slow, with the latter delayed and overbudget."

            "date": "2023-04-14T18:00:19Z",
            "content": "A huge underwater volcanic event in Tonga last year was of a magnitude comparable with the most powerful nuclear detonation by the US, researchers have revealed. Scientists have used eye and earwitnesses accounts, along with data from tide gauges, satellites, evidence of broken windows and other sources, to calculate that the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\u2019apai volcano, which occurred on 15 January 2022 and was felt around the world, likely involved five blasts. The last of them released energy equivalent to about 15 megatonnes of TNT. That is around 1,000 times more powerful than the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, and puts the volcanic event on a par with the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated by the US: the Castle Bravo bomb detonated at Bikini Atoll in 1954. The team, based at institutions in the US and New Zealand, added that the volcanic event, which occurred 65km (40 miles) from the country\u2019s main island, involved both eruptions \u2013 which resulted in huge volcanic plumes being thrust into the stratosphere \u2013 and explosions of steam, which caused sonic booms and were the main cause of the related tsunami. The researchers\u2019 computer simulations of the event, based on a combination of data sources, suggest the western coast of Tofua Island experienced waves of up to 45 metres in height, a result they say is backed up by signs of vegetation scars at the same altitude captured by satellite and drone data. The eruption brought reports of people experiencing the ground and buildings shaking for hours as far away as Fiji \u2013 nearly 500 miles away. It is thought that six people died as a result of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\u2019apai volcanic event, including four people in Tonga and two in Peru who drowned as a result of abnormally large waves caused by the volcanic activity. The team say the huge waves in parts of Tonga would have been expected to result in a larger death toll \u2013 yet this was not the case. \u201cThe main factors that led to this, we suggest, are the quirk of the location, a worldwide pandemic, and increased evaluation drills and awareness efforts carried out in the years prior,\u201d they write in the journal Science Advances. Tofua is uninhabited and other areas that experienced large waves were sparsely populated, while tourist resorts were closed because of Covid. \u201cThe main settlements in all of Tonga safely face Nuku\u2019alofa Lagoon, the best possible scenario to duck the full brunt of a mega-tsunami,\u201d the authors note, adding that other inhabited islands sit atop a carbonate platform where shallow waters damped down the waves. The new study follows research published last year that revealed that the Tonga volcano eruption had the highest plume ever recorded, with an ash cloud that reached 57km (35 miles) in height. Dr Mohammad Heidarzadeh of the University of Bath, who was not involved in the new study but has also carried out research into the event, said the latest work offered the most detailed modelling of the Tonga tsunami so far by benefiting from a diverse observation dataset. \u201cModelling tsunamis from volcano eruptions is a challenging task and this has been nicely done by [the team],\u201d he said. \u201cIt is interesting that the results are consistent with our previous study on this event, where we reported a maximum tsunami wave height of 90m.\u201d"

Thursday\u2019s 3-0 debacle at Sevilla that eliminated United 5-2 on aggregate from the Europa League has concentrated Ten Hag\u2019s assessment of his squad as he seeks to continue his rebuild. Other players Ten Hag is considering allowing to leave include Donny van de Beek, Anthony Elanga, Dean Henderson and Brandon Williams. Alex Telles, Hannibal Mejbri and Eric Bailly, who are out on loan, are almost certain to depart and the out-of-contract Phil Jones and Axel Tuanzebe are definitely leaving. Not all those whose futures are in doubt will depart because Ten Hag needs to balance moving on players he does not want as first choices with making a small number of elite signings and keeping an appropriate squad depth. Regarding Maguire and Lindel\u00f6f, he may not sanction a sale of both because it could be difficult to buy two new first-team squad centre-backs; the former is the favourite to be let go. David de Gea, part of the defensive horror show with Maguire in Seville, is yet to sign a new contract but it is understood he may do because Ten Hag\u2019s priorities in the summer market are an elite No 9 and strengthening midfield. Ten Hag also has to decide whether the loans of Marcel Sabitzer and Wout Weghorst should become permanent deals. It is thought the latter may not be retained but that a deal may be sought with Bayern Munich for Sabitzer. The amount Ten Hag is able to spend will be shaped by whether there is a takeover by the Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani or Sir Jim Ratcliffe or any injection of money from investment funds interested in working alongside the Glazers. It is a sign of Sancho\u2019s failure to live up to expectations that United may listen to offers for a winger who cost an initial \u00a373m from Borussia Dortmund in July 2021. Maguire joined from Leicester for \u00a380m in 2019 and remains the world\u2019s most expensive defender. An initial \u00a334.7m was paid to Ajax for Van de Beek, who has been unable to hold down a place."

            "date": "2023-04-03T23:01:30Z",
            "content": "The BBC is \u201cunder threat, politically,\u201d the novelist Ian McEwan has said, as he compared sections of the Conservative party to the populist right in Hungary. The author of Amsterdam, On Chesil Beach and Atonement recently collaborated with the BBC Symphony Orchestra for an evening of words and music at the Barbican. The event came as the BBC\u2019s classical music performing groups faced \u201ccatastrophic\u201d cuts, and the corporation\u2019s high-profile presenters including Gary Lineker clashed with the government over its policies. \u201cI am very worried for the BBC,\u201d McEwan said in an interview with the Radio Times. \u201cIt\u2019s under threat, politically. Generally, there\u2019s a playbook for the populist right and there are three or four targets: the civil service, the judiciary and independent broadcasters. \u201cYou see it in Hungary, and we have our homegrown version of that \u2013 maybe a little milder. It\u2019s become a very powerful impetus on a large and influential section of the Conservative party, that somehow the BBC is a head-banging, leftist, pointy-headed sanctuary for all their political enemies and has got to be taken down. It\u2019s just too bad.\u201d McEwan, 74, who broke through in the 1970s as part of a notorious gang of writers that included Martin Amis, Julian Barnes, Christopher Hitchens and Salman Rushdie, also addressed the eradication of male desire in literature, and recalled recently hearing a young male novelist say he could no longer write about the subject. \u201cI thought: god, that\u2019s terrible. Because that\u2019s the desire of half the world, and it\u2019s a subject just as much as female desire is, or a thousand other things. It needs to be handled. Whether it\u2019s done well or badly, let readers decide.\u201d While he welcomed the \u201copening up\u201d of publishing to under-represented voices, he said these should be in addition to what was already being published, \u201cnot replacement or subtraction. Let\u2019s keep the field as wide and open as possible.\u201d If he were a writer in his 20s today, he said, he \u201cwouldn\u2019t bother writing a novel\u201d and would \u201cgo straight to writing screenplays\u201d. Having adapted On Chesil Beach and The Children Act as films, he cited The Bridge, Breaking Bad and Call My Agent! among TV shows he admired. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of junk and mediocrity, but the good ones have all the thrill and compelling qualities of a serial Dickens novel,\u201d he said. In the same issue of the Radio Times, the veteran radio DJ Ken Bruce said he was not given the credit he deserved at the BBC and criticised the handling of his departure from Radio 2 after more than three decades. Bruce, 72, whose new show on Greatest Hits Radio began on Monday, said: \u201cOne of the reasons I went is because, having done the show for quite a long time, and with it being the highest-rated programme in Europe for four years, I thought: what\u2019s to achieve? What\u2019s left?\u201d But there were frustrations too, he added, including times when he felt he was not \u201creally noticed by either the BBC itself or some listeners\u201d \u2013 such as when he was not included in any BBC promotional materials about its presenters. \u201cSo I thought: I\u2019m going to make these people appreciate me. And having done that to my satisfaction, I felt it was time to give myself a little challenge, try something different, rather than become stale and wait for the axe.\u201d Bruce said he was disappointed when Radio 2 asked him to step down before his contract had fully expired. \u201cI thought that after 45 years I could be trusted to do the right thing for the next few weeks. But obviously it\u2019s up to them. It\u2019s their choice.\u201d"

Steve Barclay\u2019s decision to refer to the courts, revealed on Friday, is the latest twist in the long-running saga over pay between nurses and the government. Nurses are gearing up to strike from 8pm on 30 April until 8pm on 2 May, but the legality of the final day is currently in dispute \u2013 as it could fall out of the union\u2019s six-month mandate. The RCN general secretary, Pat Cullen, blasted the health secretary\u2019s decision as \u201ccruel\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d on Saturday morning. But Barclay said he had \u201cno choice\u201d but to take action after NHS Employers wrote to him asking to check if the 2 May strike was unlawful. He said the strikes would put patient safety and the professional registration of nurses \u201cat risk\u201d. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Cullen said: \u201cWe have managed six months of industrial action and we have done that in the most safe and effective way. \u201cWe will certainly not put our members at risk, we certainly won\u2019t put our patients at risk. \u201cBut for Steve Barclay to come out yesterday and say that he was doing this to protect the registration of nurses, well you can see how nurses interpreted that. \u201cThat was a blatant threat to our nursing staff to say: \u2018If you don\u2019t stop this and accept my pay offer then your registration perhaps may be at risk.\u2019 \u201cWe will never put our nurses at risk and we certainly won\u2019t put their registration at risk.\u201d Barclay had said: \u201cFollowing a request from NHS Employers I have regretfully provided notice of my intent to pursue legal action to ask the courts to declare the Royal College of Nursing\u2019s upcoming strike action planned for 30 April to 2 Mayto be unlawful. \u201cThe government firmly believes in the right to strike but it is vital that any industrial action is lawful and I have no choice but to take action. \u201cStrike action with no national exemptions agreed, including for emergency and cancer care, will also put patient safety at risk. \u201cThis legal action also seeks to protect nurses who could otherwise be asked to take part in unlawful activity that could in turn put their professional registration at risk and would breach the requirements set out in the nursing code of conduct.\u201d Cullen urged ministers to \u201ccalm this down\u201d and resume negotiations. She said the union had been planning with NHS England and other service leaders for the potential industrial action next month, including ensuring there were protocols for escalation to ensure patient safety was not put at risk. However, she went on: \u201cIf the court finds against us, then we will absolutely work within the parameters of the law. We will never do anything illegal. Nurses don\u2019t work like that, and I\u2019m a nurse myself. \u201cBut if nursing is defeated then it is, in my mind, and in our nurses\u2019 minds, an even darker day for this government.\u201d"

Two people have died after a crash in the car park of a Sydney hospital. Emergency services were called to Nepean Hospital near Penrith at about 3.20pm following reports of a crash. On arrival, officers were told a car \u2013 driven by a woman believed to be in her 60s \u2013 allegedly reversed into another car, before hitting a pedestrian \u2013 a woman believed to be in her 40s. According to a NSW police statement the driver and pedestrian were both assessed by NSW Ambulance paramedics; however, they were pronounced dead at the scene. The driver of the other car \u2013 a woman believed to be aged in her 30s \u2013 was treated by hospital staff for shock.

We know what the solutions to Australia\u2019s broken primary care system are \u2013 we urgently need to pay GPs more so Victorians pay less, increase university places to get a pipeline of new doctors across the nation, attract GPs from overseas to Australia faster \u2013 and break down the barriers between primary care and our hospital system. I\u2019m looking forward to a productive meeting of first ministers to continue advocating for a fair share for Victorians. State funeral for Father Bob Maguire to be open to public and streamed online Andrews has released a statement with more details on the state funeral for Father Bob Maguire: A state funeral to honour the extraordinary life of Father Bob Maguire AM AFD will be held at 11am on Friday 5 May 2023 at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in East Melbourne.

Catch up on today\u2019s biggest headlines so far with this wrap from my colleague Antoun Issa: Breaking promise over stage-three tax cuts would be politically unwise: Craig Emerson Next up is former Labor MP Craig Emerson who is asked about Labor\u2019s stance on the stage-three tax cuts \u2013 with the party voting in support of them while in opposition and going to the election promising no changes. Emerson shared his personal view and said \u201cit matters in politics\u201d that a party stands by the promises they take to an election: [If] every new government says [when] it\u2019s breaking a promise, \u2018But circumstances have changed \u2026\u2019 as if the public [is going to think], \u2018Oh, I never thought that would happen\u2019 \u2013 I think that\u2019s a very big consideration. I think if there are substantial proposals in relation to tax and you took them to the next election and said, \u2018We are seeking your support for that,\u2019 that\u2019s perfectly legitimate. The final point is \u2013 [progressives] say \u2026 these are so unfair and they\u2019re [benefiting] high-income earners and so on. The opposition won\u2019t say, \u2018Fair enough. They\u2019re high-income earners, so it\u2019s alright to break that promise.\u2019 The opposition will say, \u2018You can\u2019t trust anything that the politicians say when their lips are moving.\u2019 Christopher Pyne says Labor \u2018are on a bit of a tightrope\u2019 as budget approaches Former Liberal MP Christopher Pyne is speaking on Afternoon Briefing about the call for the rate of jobseeker to be raised, in the context of cost-of-living relief in the upcoming budget. He said he doesn\u2019t \u201cenvy\u201d treasurer Jim Chalmers\u2019 task to reduce debt and fund national security while coming out a period of extra spending with Covid and answering to \u201ca large chorus of people\u201d who are \u201cdemanding huge spending on social programs\u201d: The reality is the government only has so much money and the taxpayers will only bend so far, and if the government announces that they\u2019re not going to go ahead with the next stage of tax cuts, then I think Middle Australia will react very negatively to the idea that Labor has returned to type. I think they are on a bit of a tightrope. I don\u2019t expect to see substantial changes to social payments. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a new payment, perhaps around electricity or one of those kinds of staples that are necessary to deal with the cost-of-living increases, but that\u2019s because that would give the government some political lift. Just increasing current pensions and so forth doesn\u2019t actually do much for political parties. Assistant minister to PM says coronation of Charles is the biggest event in the world this year Assistant minister to the prime minister, Patrick Gorman, is asked about the upcoming coronation of King Charles III in nine days on Afternoon Briefing. He labelled it the biggest official event on the globe this year. When it comes to the coronation, we can\u2019t deny the reality of what Australia is in 2023. We are a constitutional monarchy. We have the King as our head of state. Him being crowned as King in Westminster Abbey is going to be an incredibly significant moment. Gorman said the coronation falls on a weekend, so no public holiday is necessary: I don\u2019t think any of the states or territories have chosen to grant a public holiday. He also said the prime minister had offered an invitation in person to King Charles III to visit Australia on a royal tour and that \u201cthe royal family are always welcome in Australia\u201d: We hope to see a visit in the near future. It is traditional, as we saw with Queen Elizabeth II, that a year after the coronation she came and did an incredibly big tour of Australia \u2013 I think there were some 57 different events that she attended. So that invitation is open-ended, it is always there, and the royal family are always welcome in Australia. Migration review about pathways for people already in the country, says Labor\u2019s Kristy McBain Labor frontbencher Kristy McBain is speaking about the government\u2019s migration review and said her office is always being contacted about visa issues. She said from a regional perspective, \u201cwe know that the system needs an overhaul\u201d: I think the important part of today\u2019s announcement was that there are so many people here on temporary skilled visas who had no pathway to Australian citizenship. So this isn\u2019t necessarily about having to increase that cap, it\u2019s about making that pathway there for people that are already in this country [and] who already have jobs in a number of our locations across a number of the skills shortages we have \u2013 giving them a pathway to citizenship for the first time. Which I think is going to be greatly accepted by [not just] those people but also their employers, who have been for some years now hoping that there will be a pathway for them going forward, \u2018cause you don\u2019t want to lose a worker in current jobs market we have. Liberal MP Angie Bell said she wants more details on how an increase of about 650,000 migrants will affect the budget and what it\u2019s going to cost: We haven\u2019t heard any details on where the extra numbers are coming from. We haven\u2019t heard any details on where they\u2019re going to be housed. We haven\u2019t heard any details on impact on infrastructure. We don\u2019t think the government\u2019s done the work at this point. We hold our breaths to see what happens at budget to see how this is going to be incorporated in the process, but we don\u2019t hold out much hope for what the government\u2019s going to do in this area in terms of good management. NSW health minister says investment needed to improve primary care across country Ahead of the national cabinet meeting tomorrow, Ryan Park is asked what will be on the agenda for Premier Chris Minns and NSW: We\u2019ll continue to advocate really strongly for New South Wales residents, as every other premier and first minister and health minister will do right across the country. We know that there is pressure on hospitals at the moment because of some pressure and strain on our primary care and a lack of access to GPs. That\u2019s a fact. We need to make sure that we\u2019ve got a very strong primary care setting across New South Wales and across the country \u2026 it\u2019s going to have to come with some significant investment because at the moment, too many of our emergency departments are taking patients into them because they can\u2019t access GP and primary care. Foreign workers \u2018likely to be part of the mix\u2019 to achieve safe staffing levels in hospitals, NSW minister says The NSW health minister, Ryan Park, is speaking on Afternoon Briefing about the Safe Staff Working Group. Announced today, this will drive the implementation of safe staffing levels across NSW\u2019s public hospital system, starting with emergency departments. In the context of today\u2019s migration reform, Park is asked how reliant the state government will be on foreign workers to achieve these benchmarks: They\u2019re likely to be part of the mix. He is also asked about the competition for staffing between the state and federal government when it comes to health workforces: Without a doubt. It\u2019s always the case in terms of labour across any industry, and healthcare is no different. There\u2019s only so many nurses and midwives and allied healthcare workers currently in the system. I think the community expect \u2026 cooperation between the state and the Commonwealth governments. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has issued a statement saying that regional and rural areas risk being left behind in migration reform announced today. He said the federal government\u2019s reforms of the migration system are \u201ca start\u201d, but lack a \u201cclear strategy\u201d to combat widespread worker shortages in the regions. This is why we introduced the dedicated agriculture visa, which would have helped alleviate the severe worker shortages that regional Australia, and the entire supply chain, is currently facing, while also creating a new pathway for permanent residency through the ag visa. Littleproud called the government\u2019s decision to scrap the visa \u201cunconscionable\u201d and \u201ca massive kick in the guts for our farmers\u201d. Littleproud also said he is concerned about \u201canother level of bureaucracy in identifying skill shortages\u201d when evidence of shortages is \u201calready plain to see\u201d in regional areas. Government buying defence contractor CEA to keep \u2018sovereign asset\u2019 in Australian hands: Marles The defence minister and deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, is appearing on the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing, where he is asked about the government\u2019s $500m deal to take Canberra-based defence contractor CEA Technologies Pty Ltd into public hands. Marles said CEA is \u201cone of the \u201cgreat products\u201d of the Australian defence industry and this is why they\u2019ve taken this step: We want to make sure that \u2026 this is a company that exists or resides in Australian hands, and the best way of doing that is making sure that the government is able to purchase it. That\u2019s the announcement that we\u2019ve made today and what it really means is that the technology and the capability of CEA remains a national sovereign asset. When asked how much of taxpayers\u2019 money will be invested, Marles said a figure isn\u2019t being put out there \u201cfor a range of commercial reasons\u201d But we are making sure that we\u2019re in a position where we are able to have CEA in Australian hands, and not just Australian hands \u2013 actually government hands. You can read more about the deal here: Every Australian home should be given energy performance rating: report A new joint report by the Property Council of Australia and the Green Building Council of Australia calls for every Australian home to be given an energy performance rating, allowing buyers or renters to know the energy efficiency of their home before moving in. The Every Building Counts report was launched in Sydney today and sets out a suite of property-focused policy recommendations that would help Australia achieve its decarbonisation goals. Among the report\u2019s 39 recommendations is the creation of a national rating scheme for the energy performance of homes, similar to white goods and electronic appliances. Labor has already revealed the federal budget will include funding to expand and upgrade the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme, which allows people to understand the energy performance of their home. The tool will be upgraded to apply to existing homes, not just new homes. At a doorstop in Sydney today, assistant minister for climate change and energy Jenny McAllister said: Many [homes] are decades old, but practically, a homeowner would ask an accredited assessor to come to their house and assess \u2026 the energy performance of their home. That\u2019ll also give them the information they need to decide where and how to make upgrades that might improve it \u2026 it\u2019ll give homeowners the opportunity to take control of their own energy performance and make decisions that are good for their home and their family.\u201d Aussie designer wins lawsuit against singer Katy Perry An Australian fashion designer has won a lawsuit against pop superstar Katy Perry over a long-running trademark dispute, AAP is reporting. Katie Jane Taylor (nee Perry) has sold and designed her clothing line under her Katie Perry label since 2007 after being inspired by a trip to Italy. While singer Katheryn Hudson, more popularly known as Katy Perry, initially fought the Australian registration of the Katie Perry brand, she later withdrew this opposition and the mark was registered. Taylor sued Hudson for infringement in the federal court in October 2019, more than 10 years after the singer started selling her own brand of merchandise including clothing under her own name. Justice Brigitte Markovic wrote in a judgment published on Thursday: This is a tale of two women, two teenage dreams and one name. The judge found Hudson had infringed the mark on Twitter ahead of the 2014 Prism tour in Australia. However, the judge found the singer did not owe any compensation to the designer because she had used the Katy Perry mark in \u201cgood faith\u201d. Only her firm Kitty Purry is now liable for damages because of the sale of clothing during the tour, at pop-up stores and on the Bravado website. Markovic rejected further claims the mark was infringed through clothing sold at Target and Myer and websites such as Amazon and eBay during the Prism tour or ahead of the Witness Tour which came to Australia in 2018. A bid by the pop star and her companies to cancel the Katie Perry mark was also dismissed by the federal court. Markovic will determine the amount of damages owed by Kitty Purry at a later date. Universities Australia welcomes migration review amid \u2018brain drain\u2019 caused by international student visa system Another peak body welcoming the government\u2019s migration review is Universities Australia, who say international students are \u201ckey\u201d to the country\u2019s migration future and should be able to use their Australian education as Australian residents. Chief executive Catriona Jackson said Australia needs a system that acknowledges the benefits of migration to our nation, \u201cand that means a system with greater certainty for international workers who complement our homegrown workforce\u201d: International students have a key role to play, and we welcome the review\u2019s focus in this area. The current skills crisis highlights the urgent need to retain more of these students, when and where there is a clear need for their skills, to spur productivity and economic growth. Jackson said Australia is a leading destination for international students yet \u201cthey remain one of our most underutilised assets\u201d: We educate hundreds of thousands of students from 144 countries each year, but only 16% stay on and use their Australian education as an Australian resident. Our current visa system has caused this brain drain, leaving Australia worse off as we battle skill shortages and productivity problems. We need a system that supports Australia\u2019s interests rather than working against them. Hospitals group welcomes news of migration system review The Australian Private Hospitals Association has welcomed today\u2019s news that Australia\u2019s skilled migration system will be simplified, with \u201cred tape reduced\u201d. In a statement, the APHA CEO, Michael Roff, said he is pleased that all temporary skilled workers will have a pathway to permanent residency by the end of the year. He said Australia is lagging behind in what it offers the workers we need: For example, Canada rapidly moved to offer health workers easy pathways to residency as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, France and the UK have made similar arrangements. We are on the back foot and will have to catch up, just opening up migration again has not been enough to entice people here. Roff said that in the private hospital sector alone there is a shortage of 8,000 nurses, and Australia continues to compete globally for a health workforce. Having measures in place that will ensure an easy pathway to residency in Australia is a very welcome move. Albanese government choosing to fund Tasmanian AFL stadium over addressing housing crisis, Greens senators say A second Greens senator has slammed the federal government for reportedly providing funding for an AFL stadium at Macquarie Point in Hobart, Tasmania. Tasmanian senator Nick McKim said on social media: Tasmania has the least affordable rents and the fastest increase in homelessness in the country. But instead of supporting the Greens\u2019 plan to fix housing and renting, Anthony Albanese plans to give $240 million for a footy stadium. According to the Age, the $715m stadium would receive $240m in federal funding (set to be announced this weekend), $275m from the state government and $15m from the AFL, with the rest to come from commercial deals. McKim argued that Tasmania is on the frontline of Australia\u2019s rental and housing crisis and that this needs urgent attention. [Albanese] should get cabinet to agree to freeze rents at tomorrow\u2019s meeting, double rent assistance and build 225,000 houses nationally over the next decade. Fund this by [reining] in tax breaks for property speculators. Work with the Greens and this could pass parliament within weeks. Earlier today, the Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson argued Tasmania\u2019s self-determination has been \u201csold out\u201d and that the prime minister must answer to Tasmanians \u201cwho are sleeping rough or struggling to put food on the table\u201d. Antonio Loiacono \u2018brought light and life into every room\u2019, says family of 20-year-old who died in football accident The family of Antonio Loiacono \u2013 a 20-year-old footballer who died after an on-field collision \u2013 has issued a statement. They describe Loiacono as a \u201clarrikin\u201d who \u201cbrought light and life into every room\u201d and reveal he was an organ donor. They said: We would like to thank the community for the overwhelming support we\u2019ve received \u2013 not just from friends and family, but from people across the state and even around the world. Antonio loved football \u2013 the camaraderie of the players, their families, and the local country teams. Antonio started playing Auskick when he was just four years old, and we are so thankful for the love and support we\u2019ve received from the football community over the past few days. Antonio was a larrikin who had a gift for bringing people together, young and old, and brought light and life into every room. We feel so blessed that his spirit continues to unite the community, as he always did in life. It was Antonio\u2019s wish for his organs to be donated and we take comfort in knowing that in his death, others have been given the gift of life. On behalf of Antonio\u2019s family, we\u2019d like to thank everyone who has sent us messages of love and support. We humbly request privacy for the family as we make arrangements for Antonio\u2019s funeral, where we will celebrate his life and the life he gave to others. Peak body for skills training and higher education welcomes migration system review The Independent Tertiary Education Council Australia has welcomed the government\u2019s review of Australia\u2019s migration system. Because independent skills training and higher education providers (which Iteca represents) support more than half of the onshore international student enrolments, the government\u2019s announcements are critical for Iteca members. The chief executive, Troy Williams, said students needed simple pathways to stay in Australia if they have the skills and capabilities that businesses need. The linkages between international education and addressing Australia\u2019s skills needs are critical areas of reform, according to Iteca. Williams said: From the perspective of the international education sector, it\u2019s great to see a commitment to closer alignment of the nation\u2019s skills needs and international education. The minister is correct to say that the migration system will never be a substitute for adequately skilling Australian workers, but there are also benefits in leveraging the skills of international students in Australia with the education and skills our economy needs. Williams said that international students are often \u201cbaffled\u201d by \u201ctoo many visa categories and lengthy processing arrangements\u201d that produce \u201cinconsistent outcomes\u201d. Iteca members welcome a more transparent and less complicated system. Iteca says it will work with the government as issues associated with implementing the recommendations are considered. Thanks to Natasha for leading us through the morning! I\u2019ll be with you for the remainder of the day, let\u2019s get into it. This is me signing off for the day and handing you over to Emily Wind! See you back here tomorrow morning. Why is student debt rising if loan system is interest-free? If you\u2019ve noticed rising Hecs debts making the headlines, but scratching your head about how that is when Australia\u2019s student loan system is supposed to be interest-free, our higher education reporter Caitlin Cassidy helps explain it in this video: ACTU president: we need to ensure \u2018local workers are not undercut\u2019 when workers brought into Australia are underpaid ACTU president Michele O\u2019Neil also welcomed the lifting of the temporary skilled migration income threshold (TSMIT) from $53,900 up to $70,000 but said there was still further changes she\u2019d like to see. The other thing we are pleased to hear in today\u2019s announcement is a lift to the TSMIT, the amount of money that skilled migrants as a minimum can be paid. This has been broken, frozen for over a decade under the previous government. It is important this threshold has been lifted to $70,000, but what we know is that more work needs to be done here. We need to make sure it is indexed and continues to provide protection so that local workers are not undercut by employers bringing workers into this country and paying them below industry standards. ACTU welcomes government\u2019s plan to overhaul migration policy Australian Council of Trade Unions\u2019 president Michele O\u2019Neil is speaking in Melbourne: Australia has a great and proud tradition of welcoming permanent migrants to this country. But what we have seen happen to our migration system is we have seen it shift to one of temporary short-term visas. That has led to a huge exploitation of migrant workers. Migrant workers are underpaid, often harassed, and don\u2019t have safe workplaces to work in. The other thing we really welcome in today\u2019s announcement from Minister O\u2019Neil is that the new migration system is going to be evidence-based. Way too long we have had a system where employers claimed skill shortages but often what it has been is a shortage of jobs with good wages and conditions, not a shortage of skills. Search for dog after woman mauled in Katherine A search continues for a dog involved in a serious attack on a woman in Katherine, AAP reports. Northern Territory police say they are investigating the incident, which occurred early on Thursday. In a statement they said: \u201cA dark brown dog with no collar attacked a woman, causing injuries.\u201d Reports indicated the woman had suffered a serious arm injury and was likely to be flown to Darwin for treatment. The dog was last seen at the intersection of Lucy Street and Riverbank Drive. Police urged the public to exercise caution in the area. Government to buy radar company for nearly $500m Our foreign affairs and defence correspondent, Daniel Hurst, brings you this exclusive: The Australian government will spend nearly $500m to take majority ownership of a Canberra-based defence contractor that makes radar systems. The deal to take CEA Technologies Pty Limited into public hands will ensure \u2018the continued development of Australia\u2019s radar capability in an increasingly complex strategic environment\u2019, the government says. Penny Wong on Sudan: \u2018The 72-hour ceasefire ends tonight and further flights after that cannot be guaranteed.\u2019 The minister for foreign affairs, Penny Wong, is urging Australians wishing to depart Sudan to leave as soon as possible. More than 60 Australians have already left safely, but flights out of the country could not be guaranteed after the ceasefire ends tonight, Wong said. Questioned on income support payments, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says the federal government is currently \u201cnot in the position\u201d to do everything within its first year, after inheriting \u201ctrillions of dollars of debt\u201d. Albanese told reporters the government is doing all it can to drive productivity and will reassess income support payments down the track. The issue of people\u2019s payments is one that the federal government is looking at. We have a budget in a couple of weeks\u2019 time, but we aren\u2019t in a position, with the trillion dollars of debt that we inherited, to do everything within our first year to address the inadequacy of the former government. But what we are doing is working with business to drive productivity. Australia \u2018open\u2019 to providing more cybersecurity assistance to Ukraine The National Press Club address from the home affairs minister has wrapped up, but just before it ended O\u2019Neill flagged Australia is open to providing further cybersecurity assistance to Ukraine. Andrew Tillett among the self-described \u201ccast of thousands from the [Financial Review] here today\u201d asked the minister: Australia provided assistance to Ukrainian government early on in the war last year with cybersecurity assistance. There have been reports this week that the government has not backed three requests from the Ukraine for further assistance. Can you explain what the situation is and are we open to providing further assistance? O\u2019Neill: I can\u2019t get into the detail of those but I can say we are open to discussions with Ukraine about how we can help them and we do consider proposals from time to time. Home affairs minister says Australia has \u2018serious labour shortages\u2019 Clare O\u2019Neil is taking questions. Our chief political correspondent Paul Karp asks her: The review talk about shifting from an exclusive focus on the permanent migration cap to considering net overseas migration. If 1.8m people being here permanently temporary is too many, is the government going to set a target for what that figure should be and what do you think it should be? O\u2019Neil says the \u201cprogram as a whole\u201d will be discussed tomorrow: There is virtually obsessive focus on the number of permanent visa holders that we grant each year. All the while we have people coming and going aren\u2019t accounted for or thought about or talked about. I think that will change as a consequence of this. Overall we absolutely believe in better planning for the migration output as a whole for the country. In terms of a desirable target the minister says \u201cfor me, quantity is not the really important question here\u201d but she flags that would like to see the program tightened in the medium term. Most of the migration debates I have observed as an Australian has become virtually obsessed with big Australia or small Australia and you have to push yourself into one of those dichotomies. I think inevitably the size of this program depends a little bit on the circumstances of the moment. In Covid, it was right [that] the borders and our migration rate is zero. Coming out of Covid, we are playing catch-up and have serious labour shortages and it is probably inevitable will run a slightly larger migration program over time. My desire is to see that program tightened and potentially smaller into the medium term and most of the proposals I have talked about today will assist us in doing that. Albanese reminisces about growing up next to a Wagon Wheel factory Prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has reminisced about growing up near a Wagon Wheel factory and how workers handed him broken biscuits as a child. Albanese told the story today while opening a Coles distribution centre in Redbank, south-west of Brisbane. I grew up in Camperdown in Sydney, and on the corner was the Westons factory [that] used to produce Wagon Wheels. The smell was permanently in my nostrils for my entire life. As kids ... we would just stand outside and we\u2019d always get broken Wagon Wheels and biscuits. Albanese joked that he considers himself the world record holder for the number of Wagon Wheels eaten in an hour \u2013 which he said he thinks is 35. PM flags healthcare on agenda at tomorrow\u2019s cabinet meeting Prime minister, Anthony Albanese, isn\u2019t giving much away ahead of tomorrow\u2019s cabinet meeting. Fronting a press conference in Redbank, west of Brisbane, Albanese flagged healthcare will be on the agenda, as well as housing issues. We need greater consistency and greater cooperation between the federal and state governments,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very confident tomorrow\u2019s meeting will be a very positive one in the lead-up to the budget. The government will make more announcements after tomorrow\u2019s press conference, the prime minister said. By the end of 2023, \u2018all skilled temporary workers will have a pathway to permanent residency\u2019 O\u2019Neil makes two announcements about the changes that will be taking place this year: We are not just proposing a pathway and a plan, we\u2019re putting a down payment on the system we want to build by taking a first set of actions in the federal budget and I want to announce two of those today. First, as of 1 July, the temporary skilled migration income threshold \u2013 also known as the TISMIT \u2013 will increase from $53,900 to $70,000. This is the first increase in a decade and has been a big deal. The Grattan Institute call $70,000 the Goldilocks threshold. We call it essential to ensuring this program is what it says it is, a skilled worker program, not a guest worker program. Second, I can announce as of the end of 2023, the end of this year, all skilled temporary workers will have a pathway to permanent residency. This does not mean an expansion of our capped program. It does not mean more people. It simply means a group of temporary workers who have been denied even the opportunity to apply for permanent residency will be able to do so. Read the full story from Paul Karp here: O\u2019Neill is now outlining the changes she\u2019s proposing to fixing Australia\u2019s migration system. Our chief political correspondent Paul Karp has summarised the major changes in this explainer you can read here: Migration system \u2018a national tragedy\u2019 says home affairs minister The bureaucratic hurdles making skilled migrants turn to other nations is a \u201cnational tragedy\u201d, O\u2019Neil says. She outlines this giving the hypothetical if Brian Schmidt had applied to come to Australia today: These problems are much more than just an irritation. Remember, other developed countries are competing for the same migrants that we need here in Australia. For aged care nurses, for engineers, for tech experts. Complexity and delay can put them off Australia altogether. Professor Brian Schmidt is the vice xhancellor of Australian National University and one of the finest minds of his generation. He came to Australia in the 1990s and he was granted a visa in four days. Today\u2019s world-leading young astrophysicist would wait many months just to get an answer from our system and that is if she or he were lucky and could find their occupation on the rigid skills list. So we can assume that the Brian Schmidt of today would take a Nobel prize and moved to Canada instead. And that is a national tragedy. But because of our migration system this is probably happening to us all the time. Our migration program is also failing once they have arrived in Australia. O\u2019Neil blames Dutton for creating \u2018an immigration system that favoured temporary migration\u2019 O\u2019Neil is blaming Peter Dutton in his time as home affairs minister for creating a temporary migration system. What he created was an immigration system that favoured temporary migration and increasingly lower paid jobs and these are the two essential ingredients to the worker exploitation that we know is occurring in Australia. O\u2019Neil to reveal how Labor plans to \u2018fix\u2019 the migration system O\u2019Neil says she is today releasing a draft outline of a new migration strategy for Australia \u201cbuilt in the national interest\u201d. She says her speech will address the twin problems of the migration program: that it\u2019s too temporary and a \u201cbureaucratic nightmare\u201d: I want to do two simple things. I want to explain what is going on in our migration system and how our government plans to fix it. The first big problem is that our migration system today is not delivering Australia the skills we need for the challenges that I have set out \u2026 Today, our system is dominated by a large temporary migration program and that program is not well designed. \u2026 The second problem I want to explain is how our migration system turned into a bureaucratic nightmare. The home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, is addressing the National Press Club, responding to the migration review. She harks back to Labor\u2019s history on migration history: a \u201cgutsy\u201d Ben Chifley warning that we must \u201cpopulate or perish\u201d in the 1940s, Gough Whitlam in the 1970s blowing open the \u201cdusty doors of power to bury the white Australia policy as well as Paul Keating using skilled migration to drive Australia out of recession. She tells the audience in Canberra: Today I want to have a conversation about migration which is direct and honest. In each of these historic instances migration helped us become a more prosperous and secure Australia because the system was designed to meet the challenges of the moment. And that is not true of our system today. I would challenge anyone in this room to explain what national problems our migration system is seeking to solve. Our migration system is suffering from a decade of genuinely breathtaking neglect. It is broken, it is failing our businesses and failing migrants themselves and, most important of all, it is failing Australians. And that cannot continue because we as a country face some big national challenges migration can help us change that. The Australian Electoral Commission says it is concerned about misinformation and disinformation around the Indigenous Voice referendum, planning a \u201csignificant\u201d series of information campaigns to stamp out falsehoods about the voting process. The AEC gave a media briefing this morning in Parliament House, ahead of the referendum to be held later this year (mid-October is seen as a likely option). Commissioner Tom Rogers stressed the AEC\u2019s role was to monitor misinformation and disinformation around the electoral process only, and would not weigh in on the content of the referendum \u2013 that is, they would for instance talk about how votes can be cast and how the referendum is decided, but not fact-check legal claims about how the Indigenous voice would operate or what it would do. The AEC is already running information campaigns on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and platforms such as Reddit. Rogers said the commission was already seeing a lot of previously debunked falsehoods around the electoral process, including claims about Dominion voting machines (which are not used in Australia), as well as people misunderstanding the rules of the referendum. He said the AEC was concerned some voters may confuse the rules of the marriage equality postal survey in 2017 with the rules of a referendum. Unlike the postal survey, it is compulsory to vote in a referendum; the result is binding; and most people will end up voting in-person, not via the post. There are also the same rules as at a federal election, including that voting is compulsory (lest you face a $20 fine). Rogers said national enrolment was hovering around 97%, with Indigenous enrolment around 84.5%. Rogers also stressed there may not be a definitive result in the referendum on the night of the vote. Remember, a referendum is run differently to a federal election \u2013 to pass, the vote requires a national majority of support on a national basis, and a majority of voters in a majority of states (that is, four of the six states). The AEC will publish results on a rolling basis through the night, once polls close at 6pm, just like a standard election \u2013 with results to be displayed on their website on a national count, a state-by-state count, plus by polling booth and electorate. There will be a lot of data. Six of Australia\u2019s top 10 most advantaged local government areas (LGA) are clustered in Sydney, while the 10 most disadvantaged areas are spread across Queensland and the Northern Territory, new government data reveals. Updated socioeconomic indexes based on 2021 census data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday reveal that Woollahra in Sydney\u2019s inner-east is the nation\u2019s most advantaged LGA, while Woorabinda, which is 170km south-west of Rockhampton in Central Queensland is the most disadvantaged. The top 10 most advantaged LGAs in Australia in order are: Woollahra (NSW), Mosman (NSW), Ku-ring-gai (NSW), Darwin Waterfront Precinct (NT), North Sydney (NSW), Waverley (NSW), Lane Cove (NSW), Peppermint Grove (WA), Nedlands (WA) and Cottesloe (WA). The 10 most disadvantaged LGAs in Australia in order are: Woorabinda (QLD), Cherbourg (QLD), Belyuen (NT), West Daly (NT), Yarrabah (QLD), Kowanyama (QLD), Wujal Wujal (QLD), East Arnhem (NT), Doomadgee (QLD) and Central Desert (NT). Victoria\u2019s child protection system under scrutiny at Yoorrook Justice Commission The Victorian government department that oversees the child protection system is fronting the state\u2019s Indigenous truth-telling commission. The hearing marks the first time a government witness has been grilled by the Yoorrook Justice Commission \u2013 Australia\u2019s first Indigenous truth-telling body. Premier Daniel Andrews last year vowed to overhaul Victoria\u2019s child protection system, saying too many First Nations children were being taken away from their families by the state. Argiri Alisandratos, acting associate secretary of the Department of Families, Fairness and Housing, says he wants the child protections system to be led by Indigenous organisations: The vision is for us to transfer decision-making responsibilities, greater decision-making responsibilities to Aboriginal community-controlled organisations. Greens senator says income support needs to be raised above poverty line Greens senator Janet Rice is calling on the government to raise the rate of all income support above the poverty line, three years since the Covid supplement was introduced. As the chair of the Senate poverty inquiry, Rice said she\u2019s heard numerous stories of how the Covid supplement \u201ccompletely changed\u201d people\u2019s lives and that the policy move demonstrated \u201craising income support is possible\u201d. In a series of tweets, she said: In opposition, Anthony Albanese is on the record saying that income support is inadequate. Just last week, he rejected the recommendations of his own experts who joined advocates, payment recipients and the Greens in calling for a raise in the rate of income support. Instead of helping those who need it, they are handing $254 billion to the ultra-wealthy through their stage 3 tax cuts, and another $368 billion for nuclear submarines. Australia-first study launched into impact of long Covid on victim-survivors Monash University researchers today launched an Australian-first study into the impact of long Covid on victim-survivors\u2019 experiences of intimate partner violence. The Monash Gender and Family Violence Prevention Centre-led study will address a gap in global research into how long Covid impacts victim-survivors\u2019 safety and support needs, despite the first-two years of the pandemic being well-researched. Centre director Professor Kate Fitz-Gibbon said: Globally there has been no attention paid to the intersection between long Covid and intimate partner violence. This is staggering given past research which documents that victim-survivors of intimate partner violence against women are twice as likely to develop long-term illnesses, including chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. The project \u2013 which involves a national survey \u2013 aims to elevate the interpersonal safety and support needs of individuals diagnosed with long Covid to ensure they are not overlooked and to improve outcomes. Finalists for Archibald prize revealed The 57 finalists of the 2023 Archibald prize have been revealed by the Art Gallery of NSW, including portraits of singer and activist Archie Roach, actors Claudia Karvan and Sam Neill and Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor Katharine Murphy. The winning painting will be announced on 5 May, with a $100,000 prize awarded to the best portrait of a person \u201cdistinguished in art, letters, science or politics\u201d painted by an Australian resident. The finalists for the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman prizes will be on show at Art Gallery of New South Wales from 6 May to 13 September. View a selection of the finalists here: \u2018White elephant on the waterfront\u2019: Greens senator rails against funding for Hobart AFL stadium Tasmanian Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson has slammed the Tasmanian Liberals and federal Labor government for reportedly funding an AFL stadium at Macquarie Point in Hobart. He argued that Tasmania\u2019s self-determination has been \u201csold out\u201d and that the prime minister must answer to Tasmanians \u201cwho are sleeping rough or struggling to put food on the table\u201d. According to the Age, the $715m stadium would receive $240m in federal funding (set to be announced this weekend), $275m from the state government and $15m from the AFL, with the rest to come from commercial deals. In a series of tweets, Whish-Wilson said: In bowing to the demands of the AFL the Tasmanian Liberals and federal Labor have sold out Tassie\u2019s self-determination and our future health and wellbeing. All for a vanity project that will *at best* lose more than $132 million - however the real cost will be much higher. When the PM arrives in nipaluna/Hobart this weekend to talk up his white elephant on the waterfront I hope he comes prepared to answer to Tasmanians who are sleeping rough or struggling to put food on the table. The search for an Australian man who went overboard from a cruise ship in the remote Pacific has been called off for the day after a US Coast Guard plane exhausted its fuel supply. A passenger went overboard from Royal Caribbean\u2019s Quantum of the Seas before 11pm Tuesday night local time two days out from when it was due to arrive in Honolulu. Ryan Fisher, petty officer second class and spokesperson for the 14th district coast guard based in Honolulu, said the US coast guard\u2019s Hercules plane had been searching for the Australian since 9am local time Wednesday morning. However, it was forced to end its search at 3pm local time (that\u2019s just over a half hour ago AEST) because it had exhausted its six hours of fuel supply. Fisher told Guardian Australia: The latest update I received which was four minutes ago: the [Hercules HC130 plane] completed five search patterns and they are returning to our air station for crew rest and fuel replenishment. They plan on resuming the search efforts tomorrow morning. And the safety net broadcast to any vessels in the area is still ongoing. That safety net broadcast is essentially an urgent call to any ships in the area that might be able to help. No other aircraft were available to continue the search, including the Coast Guard\u2019s navy partners who were contacted, Fisher said. Albanese says the government is continuing to provide consular support for over 100 Australian citizens in a \u201cdangerous\u201d position in Sudan. We would call upon all sides of the conflict in Sudan to refrain from the violence that is occurring in Sudan, but we\u2019re also working with our allies, including the United Kingdom, to make sure that our people in Sudan are looked after. I think that Australia always does a remarkable job through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to look after Australian citizens. This is a dangerous circumstance. There are over 100 Australians in Sudan and we are doing our best to reach out to them to provide them with support. Immigration overhaul for New Zealanders part of wider push to give migrants security, PM says Continuing talking about migration, Albanese says the recent change for New Zealanders is a wider push to give migrants security, meaning they\u2019ll be better able to contribute to Australia: I met someone coming through here on the way to this press conference, a Kiwi who has been in Australia for more than four years, but hasn\u2019t been able to become a citizen. Now, common sense tells you that if someone is working at a facility like this, has been here for 11 years in this gentleman\u2019s case, but hasn\u2019t been able to become a citizen, then smoothing that pathway so that it\u2019s equivalent to what Australians receive in New Zealand, is a sensible change that we announced on the weekend right here in Queensland with Prime Minister Hipkins. There\u2019s a particularly large number of people from New Zealand have made south-east Queensland their home. They\u2019re paying taxes. They\u2019re contributing. Their kids are going to local schools. They\u2019re raising a family here. And these changes, again, aimed at more permanency. Giving people that security will mean they\u2019re able to make a greater contribution to the Australian community. PM flags easier \u2018permanent pathway\u2019 to residency for migrants The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is giving a media conference visiting a Coles logistics outfit in Redbank in south-west Brisbane, and says he can \u201ccertainly\u201d see a good argument for greater permanent residency opportunities for migrants. Albanese is being asked about immigration ahead of the government releasing its response to the migration review later today: Prime minister, just on the skills shortage and the need for jobs to be filled, can you see a good argument for making a pathway to permanent residency? Albanese: I certainly can. If you look at this facility and you talk to Coles management \u2026 one of the things that happened with this facility was that some skilled labour was brought in with specialised expertise in order to make this vision a reality. What we need to do to be less reliant upon temporary labour and to give people that permanent pathway to being secure, to making a contribution here in Australia. The truth is that the migration system that we inherited was broken. There are over 1 million people waiting for visas in this country. What we need to do is to make sure that we identify the skills we need, identify the regions where we need additional workforce, and tailor our migration system so that it benefits those people who come to Australia, but more importantly as well, so that it benefits our national interests. And that is what our migration system is focused on. That\u2019s what Clare O\u2019Neil will be speaking more about today. Review into Landbridge Group\u2019s lease over the Port of Darwin nearly finished, Marles reveals The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, has revealed that officials may be close to finishing a review into a Chinese company\u2019s lease over the Port of Darwin. Marles was in Darwin this morning to announce nearly $4bn in funding over the next four years for upgrading and hardening Australian defence force bases in the north of Australia. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said in June last year that the government would review the circumstances surrounding the Port of Darwin lease \u201cin an orderly way\u201d. Asked today about the issue, Marles said: The review into the Port of Darwin has its own process which is being done through the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. It\u2019s a fair way down the track so we will be awaiting the outcome of that review but that sits separately to what we\u2019re doing with the defence strategic review \u2026 The outcome of that review is not far off \u2026 I\u2019m not about to speculate on the outcome of that review. Let\u2019s see what it comes up with, but it\u2019s not far off. The NT\u2019s then-Country Liberal party government granted a 99-year lease over the Port of Darwin to Landbridge Group in 2015, in a move that has been subject to several reviews. Animal right activists have welcomed reports that a slaughterhouse in Laverton, Melbourne has closed following the release of covertly filmed footage depicting the use of carbon dioxide stunning. Farm Transparency Project released footage earlier this month depicting the use of carbon dioxide stunning, described by industry as the safest method possible to stun pigs. The footage, first aired by the ABC, showed pigs writhing, gasping for air, screaming and frothing at the mouth while locked in packed cage gondolas. The ABC reported on Wednesday that one of the slaughterhouses depicted in the footage, operated by Australian Food Group, has now closed amid an investigation by the government regulator PrimeSafe. The executive director of Farm Transparency Project, Chris Delforce, described the closure as a \u201cmassive win for pigs\u201d. For decades now the Australian pork industry has held up gassing pigs to death as the gold standard in \u2018humane\u2019 pig slaughter. Despite numerous reports and investigations proving exactly the opposite, it took me hiding myself inside one of these horrific gas chambers in order to finally reveal this to a mainstream audience and start a long overdue national conversation about the way we treat farmed animals. Japanese brewer launches takeover for Blackmores Japanese beverages company Kirin Corporation has lodged a $1.9bn takeover bid to buy Blackmores in a deal supported by the vitamin maker\u2019s board. Blackmores, founded in the 1930s via a health food shop in Brisbane, told shareholders on Thursday they will receive $95 per share, representing a premium to recent trading levels of above 20%. The board said it unanimously recommends shareholders vote in favour of the deal in the absence of a superior offer. Blackmores chair Wendy Stops said: The Kirin scheme represents an attractive, all-cash transaction. Stops said the deal offered \u201cappropriate long-term value for the company and an attractive outcome for Blackmores shareholders\u201d. Marcus Blackmore, the company\u2019s largest shareholder and son of founder Maurice Blackmore, is supporting the proposal. The vitamins and supplements company has shed just over one-third of its share price during the past five years amid difficult pandemic trading conditions that also interrupted sales to Chinese customers. Headquartered in Tokyo, Kirin is a major brewer that owns Australia-based Lion, which holds the Tooheys and XXXX labels among its portfolio of drinks. Susan Provan, the director of the Melbourne international comedy festival (MICF) since 1994, has been speaking to 3RRRFM reflecting on the complicated legacy of Barry Humphries. Humphries death on Saturday coincided with the end of the festival. Its decision four years ago to rename \u201cThe Barry\u201d \u2013 the festival\u2019s prize for its most outstanding act, now known as the MICF award \u2013 quickly became the focus of discussion. Provan has defended the decision to rename the award four years ago \u201clargely because of \u2026 his really horrible comments about the transgender community\u201d. However, Proven says the fact this \u201ctiny part\u201d of Humphries\u2019 career has become the focus after his death is \u201ca bit sad really\u201d. We found this whole thing really distressing because as I said on Saturday night we posted a tribute. So much of the media have claimed that we did nothing \u2013 we were out there in the same way that everybody else was. And then this complete bin fire focusing everything on the comedy festival. I think it\u2019s just awful. How must his family be feeling that his whole legacy and everything has been turned into this shitstorm with the Melbourne comedy festival, it\u2019s just totally inappropriate and wrong and distressing? Syndicates ripping off the National Disability Insurance Scheme will be targeted in a fraud crackdown backed by nearly $50m in funding, AAP reports. The upcoming federal budget will include the funding to target fraud and non-compliant payments within the scheme. The $48.3m allocated will go towards 200 staff at the National Disability Insurance Agency, as well as new systems to detect fraud. NDIS minister Bill Shorten said the funding would make sure money going towards the scheme would assist people with disabilities. Shorten said today: We have found evidence of egregious fraud that involves complex criminal networks ripping off NDIS participants and Australian taxpayers. This funding will ensure the agency has the capability to address fraud and non-compliance. Shorten said a fraud task force set up in October last year was already investigating multiple criminal syndicates, some handling tens of millions in NDIS funds. Some of the syndicates have targeted people with false information on how the NDIS operates, some using the promise of cash or vouchers. Shorten said some syndicates had also encouraged people to access the scheme by faking medical evidence. Many have drawn down millions of dollars in funding from hundreds of participants. People ripping off the NDIS are going to prison. In the past 12 months, fraudsters have been sentenced to a combined 12.5 years in prison for ripping off the scheme. The NDIS was set up almost 10 years ago, and is on track to be the federal budget\u2019s biggest expense. Projections show it\u2019s on track to cost $50bn by 2025/26, overtaking the annual cost of Medicare. Cosgrove to fill in former role as governor general He may have been out of the job as governor general for four years, but Sir Peter Cosgrove is set to return for a brief stint at his old stomping ground at Government House. Cosgrove will step in for the current governor general, David Hurley, who will be out of the country for two weeks. Hurley and his wife Linda are set to fly out for a state visit to Greece on April 30. They will also attend the coronation of King Charles III, before returning on May 10. While a state governor would normally fill in for the governor general in an official capacity while they are out of the country, all state governors will also be overseas at the time of the visit. Due to the lack of state governors, Cosgrove will fill in for the current governor general during the 11-day period. The appointment had to be signed off by the King, following a recommendation by prime minister Anthony Albanese. Cosgrove served as the country\u2019s 26th governor general from 2014 to 2019. \u2013 via AAP Another passenger on the Quantum of the Seas cruise to Hawaii, Gale Doyle, a nurse from Yamba in NSW, has described to ABC News what happened when the passenger went overboard: Around 11 o\u2019clock last night, we were sitting at the bar and there was an Oscar Oscar Oscar call put across the intercom, and that is the man overboard signal. \u2026 We were told the ship was turning around, and we were all to go back to our cabins, to make sure all of our party were accounted for. Then the ship deployed the ribs, which are like the little lifeboat type boats, and they had spotlights out in the water. This went on for about an hour. Eventually they started calling a person\u2019s name, it was a male, because the person\u2019s name [was sad] several times so we assumed this person is the missing person. But this morning there has been no notification from the ship at all as to what\u2019s happened. Butler acknowledges nursing and aged care wages \u2018have been too low\u2019 A housing report from Anglicare out this morning has found the average enrolled nurse spends 60% of their income on rent. Butler was also asked by ABC News, given the cost of rent and the pay of nurses, why would anyone become a nurse and how will the government address the issue: Obviously, one of the things we\u2019ve been doing is reflecting and recognising the very low wages that people receive in the very large aged care sector. We supported a wage case conducted in the Fair Work Commission that will deliver a 15% pay increase to nurses in the aged care sector, traditionally paid less than colleagues in the hospital system for example. Because we recognise that in too many care sectors, usually worked by women overwhelmingly, the wages have been too low and have not reflected first of all the cost of living, and rent is critical among those pressures, and the value of the work they deliver to their community. Circling back to finance minister Katy Gallagher\u2019s interview on ABC Radio. Gallagher is asked about another live debate ahead of the budget - whether Labor will be reversing the change that saw single-parent payments shifted to jobseeker when their youngest child turns eight. The women\u2019s economic equality taskforce has called for the payment to be restored to the previous cutoff of a child turning 16. Media reports, and RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas, are confident the government has landed on 14 years old. Karvelas: You\u2019re a mum that actually lived on single-parent payments \u2026 So you get it. You also have kids. When they turned 14 and a half. It\u2019s not like things really dramatically change. It\u2019s still hard. You still have to feed them right? Gallagher: Yeah, and you\u2019re right, I did live on that payment. It changed my life. It saved me. It gave me the support I needed to, to get myself together to look after my baby and to get back into work. So I 100% understand the importance of these payments. They are life changing and so important. Children don\u2019t just don\u2019t stop needing their parents. I accept and I don\u2019t think anyone would pretend that costs just end at any particular year. Gallagher emphasises that as much as Karvelas presses her, ultimately \u201cany announcement around our position on all of these pressures that are coming to us would be in the budget in 12 days time.\u201d Another Labor backbencher has added his name to the growing list within the Albanese government\u2019s own ranks who would like to see jobseeker increased. Julian Hill has this morning taken to Twitter saying \u201cI would like to see an increase in Jobseeker\u201d while acknowledging the pressures on the budget are \u201cimmense.\u201d Four other Labor MPs yesterday signed an open letter to the prime minister. Mark Butler has been making the rounds of news breakfast shows amid this stoush with the Pharmacy Guild over the new prescription medicines policy. ABC News asks the health minister how he accounts for the disparity in how many medicines are in short supply. The Pharmacy Guild says 40% of the 320 medicines on the two-for-one list as part of the new policy are in shortage, but the government says it\u2019s only seven medicines. The pharmacy lobby also says the policy will cause supply problems and medicine shortages. But Butler continues to advise Australians against listening to the pharmacy lobby: I\u2019d advise your viewers and everyone else involved in this debate to take advice on medicine shortages from the medicines authorities\u2026 rather than advice from the pharmacy lobby. So I think this is a case of the pharmacy lobby seeking to ramp up concerns that people might have about a policy that just makes good sense. If you think about this for three or four minutes, the idea that this change is going to cause supply problems is patently ridiculous. The number of tablets dispensed for cholesterol, heart pressure, blood problems and other things in between now and next Christmas will not change one bit because of this policy. It is simply going to change the shape of the way in which people have to shell out co-payment to their local pharmacist. \u2018Good for health and the hip pocket\u2019: Mark Butler brushes off Pharmacy Guild backlash The health minister, Mark Butler, is defending the incoming changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme announced yesterday amid backlash from pharmacists. The Pharmacy Guild\u2019s national president Trent Twomey has been particularly outspoken with criticism and emotional about the pressure that pharmacists are under. Asked about those criticisms from the guild, Butler is defending the measure on the Today Show as an important measure for six million patients living with chronic disease. For five years now the independent authority, the experts who run our medicines system, has said that is ridiculous and people should only go to a pharmacy once every two months and get two months supply of medicines. It happens in UK and New Zealand and Canada and Europe and most of the US. We decided to effect that advice. The former government didn\u2019t. It would have saved patients hundreds of millions of dollars. We decided to accept the advice and convinced it is the right thing to do. It is good for health and the hip pocket. \u2018You just knew something was wrong\u2019: cruise passenger speaks after man goes overboard Quantum of the Seas passenger Georgina Thompson said she and her husband were in bed when they heard \u201cOscar, Oscar, Oscar\u201d \u2013 the Royal Carribbean\u2019s code for man overboard. Thompson told the Today show: We were in bed and we heard come over the PA system someone singing out \u201cOscar, Oscar, Oscar\u201d and then that\u2019s when everything started to happen. My husband got out of bed and he went outside on to our deck and started looking around. There were lights and, you know, the big lights shining on the ocean. And also there were a couple of boats out there in the water. And then I got up and I went out to see what was happening. We didn\u2019t know at that time what was going on. The light started searching along the outside of the ship, you know, shining along the outside right down the bottom. We were watching it. It lit up the whole ocean ... well, most of the ocean. But it was very dark. You just knew that something was wrong. First of all, my husband thought we might have hit something or something like that, the way the ship stopped, but then we realised that there was someone overboard. No one said anything at that time. Thompson said the mood on board the ship has been \u201cvery sombre.\u201d They\u2019re very sombre. Very sombre. We went to breakfast this morning and everyone was very sombre. The US coast guard says that the search for the overboard man will have to conclude for the day at 3pm local time \u2013 less than three hours away. Fisher said: The HC130 [Hercules airplane] that was deployed for the search arrived on scene at nine o\u2019clock. They have a fuel endurance of about six hours. So they will have to depart the scene at 3pm. So that will have to conclude the search from coast guard for the day. But if they don\u2019t end up finding him between now and 3pm, and they will continue to search tomorrow probably around the same timeframe. The plan is to continue the search if he\u2019s not found today \u2013 we will continue to search tomorrow. Fisher said no other aircraft would be available to continue the search after 3pm: We\u2019ve reached out to our Pac (Pacific) fleet Navy partners and they don\u2019t have any assets available, so at this time no. The US coast guard has confirmed that an Australian man fell overboard on the Quantum of the Seas cruise ship, which was travelling from Brisbane to Hawaii. The coast guard said the passenger went overboard 500 nautical miles (926 kilometres) from Hawaii\u2019s Big Island. Ryan Fisher, a petty officer second class and spokesperson for the 14th district coast guard, told Guardian Australia they received the report at 1am Hawaii time. 500 nautical miles south of Hawaii\u2019s Big Island a man fell overboard on Quantum of the Seas cruise ship. He is an Australian national. A Hercules airplane is on scene conducting a search. At the moment it is the only asset that\u2019s on scene searching. The cruise ship did a search for two hours and then they had to continue making way to the big island. Fisher says the coast guard\u2019s main focus is trying to locate the man \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d. We\u2019ve been on scene since 9am. And with the crew\u2019s endurance and the fuel constraints of the vessel they should be there for about six hours since arriving on scene. Katy Gallagher deflects question on jobseeker The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, is still not confirming whether or not the government has ruled out raising jobseeker. There are rising calls for the Albanese government to prioritise the most vulnerable in the upcoming budget, even from its own backbench. Asked if a raise to jobseeker is still a live option, Gallagher tells ABC Radio: What I can confirm is the budget will have a cost of living package that is targeted to the most vulnerable. We\u2019ve been clear about that. Obviously some of that is the assistance and support on energy relief. We\u2019ve had the announcements around medicines in the last day. We are focused on making sure we can do the right thing for those that are doing it tough, but within an environment where there are a lot of demands on the budget in a lot of areas. The budget you\u2019ll see is one that has a number of decisions that weigh up all of those different pressures and tries to find a way of accommodating that support for vulnerable people within the broader context and within a budget that\u2019s, you know, really strained and has, you know, pressures that are coming faster at it than they are declining. Royal Caribbean has confirmed that a passenger went overboard on the cruise to Hawaii and the crew immediately launched a search and rescue operation: While on its trans-pacific sailing, a guest onboard Quantum of the Seas went overboard. The ship\u2019s crew immediately launched a search and rescue operation and is working closely with local authorities. Quantum of the Seas departed Brisbane on 12th April and is scheduled to arrive in Honolulu 28th April. Australian man goes overboard on cruise to Hawaii - reports There are reports that an Australian man has gone overboard from a Royal Caribbean cruise ship from Brisbane to Hawaii. The ABC reports that the US coast guard confirmed that an Australian is missing after going overboard from a cruise ship off Hawaii. Two travel bloggers on board the Quantum of the Seas ship have posted this video of the search efforts to Instagram and described the situation for other passengers: The signal went out around 11pm and shortly after, we could feel the ship slowing and turning around. There were multiple announcements going through the whole ship, including staterooms, for certain guests to contact guest services. We were all told to go back to our cabins and make sure everyone in our party was accounted for. Turn sound on for the last video to listen to one of the announcements. Around 12.30am, a final announcement was made saying the search would be continuing but guests could leave their cabins and services across the ship would reopen. We are back on course this morning heading for Hawaii and haven\u2019t yet heard any further updates. The federal government will today announce more details of its defence plans, pledging to spend almost $4bn to harden bases in northern Australia over the next four years. But this funding will largely come from shifting money from other defence estate programs. The defence strategic review, released on Monday, called for a stronger network of bases, ports and barracks across northern Australia. It said it was \u201cimperative that our network of northern bases is urgently and comprehensively remediated\u201d, including work to make air bases harder to attack, boosting runway capacity, improving fuel storage and supply, and extra security. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, and the defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, will visit Darwin today to announce funding of $3.8bn to harden northern base infrastructure over the next four year budget period. This funding is expected to include about $2bn for \u201ccritical air bases stretching from RAAF Base Learmonth (WA), through Cocos Islands and our airbases in the Northern Territory to RAAF Base Scherger (QLD) and RAAF Base Townsville (QLD)\u201c. The overall figure also includes $1bn for land and joint estate capabilities. This includes major training area upgrades in the Northern Territory and upgrades to Robertson Barracks in Darwin and Lavarack Barracks in Townsville. The government will also pledge maritime estate investments of $600m, including for additional work at HMAS Coonawarra in the Northern Territory, upgrades to HMAS Cairns, and redevelopment of the Harold E Holt Naval Communications Station in Western Australia. The fine print is that the $3.8bn in funding comes through a combination of $3.6bn reprioritised from other now lower priority defence estate projects and $200m from other cancelled or adjusted defence programs. NSW Health launches working group to boost staffing levels in hospitals New South Wales health department officials and nursing union bosses will join forces as part of the new government\u2019s plan to improve staffing levels in state hospitals. The government will today announce the establishment of the safe staffing working group, which will first be tasked with boosting the number of nurses in the state\u2019s stretched emergency departments. The working group will meet for the first time in early May and be asked to provide advice on the reform plan that will then be rolled out across other hospital departments including intensive care units and maternity wards. NSW premier Chris Minns said: I\u2019m committed to ensuring the people who looked after us during the pandemic feel looked after by their government. This is the first step to safe staffing in hospitals \u2013 ensuring there\u2019s one nurse for every three patients in ED. It was one of the very first election commitments we made. Health minister Ryan Park said: It won\u2019t be easy to undo a decade of rising wait times and understaffing, but this government is determined to begin to turn things around. The new Labor government has committed to hiring an extra 1200 nurses and midwives before the next election. Good morning! Thanks to Martin for kicking things off, I\u2019m Natasha May and I\u2019ll be with you until the afternoon. The Committee for the Economic Development of Australia will today call for the government to establish an evaluator general, a function in treasury that checks which programs are working. Ceda analysed 103 federal, state and territory programs. Of the 20 federal programs analysed costing more than $200bn over the decade, Ceda found 95% had not been appropriately evaluated while one quarter had no evaluation framework at all. Programs with poor evaluations included: The cashless debit card, which had an evaluation with a \u201cflawed methodology and no cost-benefit analysis\u201d; Jobactive, which had an \u201cevaluation framework but did not address all aspects of the program\u201d; and The National Rental Affordability Scheme, which had \u201cno processes in place to evaluate whether the scheme had achieved some of the objectives identified, including whether it had any flow-on effect in the housing market\u201d Ceda chief executive Melinda Cilento said: The community rightfully expects that taxpayer funds are used to effectively improve economic and social outcomes for all citizens, but too often this is not the case.The Albanese government has committed to improve practice in this area, including the likely introduction of an evaluator-general. We must take steps now to improve evaluation, starting with major community services. Labor committed to an evaluator general before the 2019 election. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, recommitted to it in March 2022. In November, he told the economic and social outlook conference that he was \u201cby working with [assistant treasury minister] Andrew Leigh on putting in place an effective and rigorous evaluator-general so we have a better sense of what works, and what doesn\u2019t\u201d. Leigh is speaking at Ceda on Thursday, so there\u2019s a good bet Labor will recommit to this idea. \u2018It is a horrendously complex system\u2019: Clare O\u2019Neil on migration Home affairs minister Clare O\u2019Neil commissioned a review of the country\u2019s migration system last year and will flesh out the government\u2019s new policy to fill worker shortages exacerbated by the pandemic when she addresses the National Press Club on Thursday, reports Australian Associated Press. She told ABC\u2019s 7.30 Report on Wednesday night: Our migration system is broken. It\u2019s not delivering for Australians. It\u2019s not delivering for our businesses and it\u2019s not delivering for migrants themselves. It is a horrendously complex system that makes it really hard to bring high-skilled workers into the country who will lift productivity. She said for employers in tech-based industries, for example, the skills list was \u201carchaic\u201d and \u201cout of date\u201d. O\u2019Neil said wage exploitation of temporary migrant workers was also rife and needed to be curbed. She warned Australia risked falling behind other developed immigrant countries such as Canada by becoming a nation of \u201cpermanently temporary\u201d residents. Read our full report on the review here: Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the day\u2019s news. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and I\u2019ll be bringing you the overnight stories before my colleague takes over. Yesterday it was a long line of Labor backbenchers, and today it is a former Reserve Bank governor telling Jim Chalmers he has to raise the jobseeker rate. Bernie Fraser says the Albanese government \u201cneeds to start using its power for the people like it promised it would\u201d, as he added his weight to the idea. He said the unemployment payment was one of the \u201cmany areas desperately needing attention\u201d in the coming budget. And that pre-budget manoeuvring continues with defence minister Richard Marles due to announce today the allocation of $4bn to strengthen defence bases in northern Australia. Today the home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, will stand up at the National Press Club in Canberra and declare the migration system broken. She will release a landmark review of the system. The review claims the system encourages 1.8 million guest workers to be \u201cpermanently temporary\u201d due to strict caps on permanent migration. And although it\u2019s not clear how many of the review\u2019s recommendations will be implemented, O\u2019Neil will warn that it can\u2019t be fixed \u201cby further tinkering and incrementalism\u201d. We also have a lot of reporting around the cost-of-living crisis this morning, with research suggesting that the social divide between Sydney\u2019s western and eastern suburbs \u2013 along the so-called \u201clatte line\u201d \u2013 is deepening. And with landlords ramping up their rents, one in five renters are among more than 1 million people living in poverty in the state. The data on this issue is coming in thick and fast: a study by Anglicare says less than 1% of private rental properties are affordable for full-time workers on the minimum wage. And the latest Grogonomics points out that although the cost of living crisis is easing, renters are still feeling the pain."

            "date": "2023-04-19T16:48:47Z",
            "content": "Eight healthcare professionals will stand trial over the death of football great Diego Maradona in 2020, an Argentinian court has ruled. The date of the proceedings has yet to be set, but they are unlikely to begin before next year, the court said Tuesday. A medical board\u2019s report previously given to prosecutors concluded that Maradona was in agony for more than 12 hours, did not receive adequate treatment and could still be alive if he had been properly hospitalized. Three judges from an appeals court in San Isidro, outside Buenos Aires, confirmed the charges brought by prosecutors of homicide by negligence against the members of Maradona\u2019s medical team. Neurosurgeon Leopoldo Luque and psychiatrist Agustina Cosachov are accused of failing in their care for Maradona. Maradona\u2019s medical team also included psychologist Carlos D\u00edaz, doctors Nancy Forlini and Pedro Di Spagna, nursing coordinator Mariano Perroni and nurses Ricardo Almir\u00f3n and Dahiana Madrid. Maradona, who won the World Cup with Argentina in 1986, died of a heart attack on 25 November 2020, at a rented residence outside Buenos Aires following brain surgery two weeks earlier. He was 60. Maradona\u2019s autopsy showed he died of natural causes. One of Maradona\u2019s daughters, Dalma, wrote on Instagram in Spanish: \u201cMany times the process is painful and slow, but here we are and we will not stop until justice is done! Each one who stopped doing their job (at someone\u2019s request or because of ineffectiveness) will be judged for that!\u201d"

            "title": "Supplies running out at Sudan\u2019s remaining hospitals as healthcare disaster looms",
            "date": "2023-04-27T15:26:29Z",
            "content": "Until gunfire broke out on the streets of El Fasher this month, the state capital of North Darfur had several main hospitals. There was the big teaching hospital, the Saudi hospital, a paediatric hospital and the South hospital, a modest 35-bed facility with big ambitions and a specific remit: to help bring down the high numbers of local women dying in pregnancy and childbirth. Now, almost two weeks into the conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), two weeks of bloodshed that has seen terror return to a region once synonymous with human suffering, those options have narrowed. \u201cIn El Fasher town the only functional hospital now is the South hospital \u2026 The three main other hospitals are all down,\u201d said Dr Mohammed Musoke, deputy programme manager for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) for Sudan. Down, he said, because of a multitude of reasons: from staff not being able to get to work due to the intensity of the fighting to \u201cindiscriminate shelling\u201d damaging structures and equipment. The paediatric hospital, to which many of the city\u2019s sickest babies would normally be referred, has been looted by armed men. As a result, the South hospital has been repurposed from a specialist maternity hub with no surgical capacity into a multifunctional trauma centre where staff are doing their best to respond to the huge and horrifying influx of mostly civilian casualties. \u201c[The hospital has gone] from thirtysomething beds to close to 108,\u201d said Musoke. \u201cBut these are not in proper places: [you see] a corner, you put a bed there; [you see] a corridor, you put a bed there.\u201d Since the fighting began on 15 April, the hospital has received more than 400 wounded people, mostly with gunshot and shrapnel injuries, many of them children caught in the crossfire. Fifty-four of the injured have died. \u201cAnd because it is still the only functional hospital, yes, the wounded are coming in, but also other very sick people are [still] coming in; sick children are coming in; pregnant women have to come and deliver in this space,\u201d said Musoke. Now, in the maternity ward, there are two women for each bed. Emergency C-sections are taking place alongside trauma surgery. If babies are born prematurely or become sick with sepsis, there are no incubators to put them in. \u201cSo you can see how thinly stretched the few [remaining] hospitals [are],\u201d said Musoke. \u201cThe burden they have to cope with.\u201d This picture is becoming familiar across parts of Sudan engulfed in the fighting between two warring generals, army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his rival, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti. In the capital, Khartoum, only 16% of health facilities are still functioning, according to the World Health Organization. Observers are worried that whatever small steps were being made to address the country\u2019s enormous health problems \u2013 from extreme hunger and malnutrition to dengue fever and malaria, not to mention a widespread lack of basic sanitation \u2013 will be wiped out by the burgeoning civil war. In that sense, the South hospital, which MSF started to support last year after a leap in the number of local maternal deaths, is a sort of grim metaphor. \u201cSome of the health indicators in Sudan were really not good,\u201d said Musoke, citing the maternal mortality rate of 270 deaths per 100,000 live births and one of the highest prevalence rates of malnutrition among children in the world, with more than 3 million children suffering from wasting, 611,000 of them at high risk of death. Before the fighting erupted, 15.8 million people \u2013 about a third of the population \u2013 were already in need of aid, according to the UN. \u201cThe conflict, it just makes the situation get a lot worse,\u201d said Musoke. \u201cIt really shows the long-term impact.\u201d In the meantime, fears are growing among health officials that the indirect death toll of the conflict \u2013 stemming from these vast underlying health challenges \u2013 will be significant. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, warned of \u201cmany more deaths\u201d to come due to outbreaks of disease, a lack of access to food and clean water, and disruptions to health services such as immunisations. \u201cMany patients with chronic diseases, like kidney disease, diabetes and cancer, are unable to access the health facilities or medicines they need,\u201d he said. In a brutally stark illustration of the challenges facing those who depend on regular medical treatment, Dr Bushra Ibnauf Sulieman, a Sudanese-American professor of internal medicine, is understood to have been fatally stabbed on Tuesday outside his home in Khartoum while taking his father for dialysis treatment. There are fears, too, for the country\u2019s roughly 3.5 million diabetes patients, as power cuts destroy cold-chain storage facilities for insulin stocks. Dr Tedros, meanwhile, has warned that outages are \u201cthreatening to make the few remaining stocks of blood stored in the central blood bank unusable\u201d \u2013 a disastrous scenario when the casualties continue to mount. It does not stop there. In the coming weeks, he warned, an estimated 24,000 women will give birth without maternal care. Programmes to prevent transmission of dengue fever and malaria have had to stop, nutrition programmes have been suspended, and the risk of diarrhoeal disease \u2013 one of the biggest killers of children under five \u2013 is high because many people are drinking river water to survive. With the current, patchy truce about to expire and fresh violence raising fears it will not be renewed, medics, relief organisations and the WHO are hoping there will be sufficient lulls in fighting to be able to restock hospitals with the lifesaving equipment they need. At the South hospital, staff are \u201crapidly running out of supplies\u201d, according to Cyrus Paye, MSF project coordinator on the ground. They estimate they have enough to last just three more weeks. \u201cAnd I\u2019m giving this \u2018three weeks\u2019 with a lot of caution,\u201d said Musoke. \u201cBecause if the situation further escalates, and you have a lot more wounded coming in \u2026 this three weeks could turn into four days.\u201d In the short-term, then, the picture is bleak and precarious. In the long-term, many fear, particularly in the event of a protracted conflict, it could be even worse. But for the doctors working day in, day out to tend to the wounded, there is no time to ponder the unknowable. Amid threats, violence and ever-depleting supplies, they will work on, said Dr Attiya Abdullah, a spokesman for the Sudanese doctors\u2019 union. \u201cWe cannot let our people die,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4 this week, recounting how he had walked 20km to get to his hospital, disguised in traditional clothing, for fear of being targeted in his medical attire. \u201cThis is our job. All of us understand: this is our time. This is our moment. The Sudanese people need us. So we\u2019ll not stop, we\u2019ll not hide, we\u2019ll not excuse ourselves.\u201d"

            "content": "Good afternoon. Anthony Albanese has announced a major funding package in next week\u2019s federal budget to overhaul Medicare. The overhaul is part of a $2.2bn planned spend to strengthen the country\u2019s health system which will also expand the roles of pharmacists and paramedics. After Friday\u2019s national cabinet meeting in Brisbane, Albanese said state and territory leaders had agreed to a raft of measures, including developing plans to strengthen the rights of renters and to boost property supply and affordability, in a bid to address the nation\u2019s housing crisis and win support for the Albanese government\u2019s signature housing policy. In other news, Bruce Lehrmann has won his court bid to extend the usual 12-month time limit on defamation claims to pursue action against News Corp and Network 10. Let\u2019s get into it. Top news Medicare changes | The prime minister has announced $2.2bn in funding for health, including changes to Medicare. The funding, which will be in this year\u2019s federal budget, will also mean nurses and pharmacists play a greater role in the health system as well as more funding for GPs to open after hours and investment in digital health. National cabinet also signed off on a promise to boost the capability of the NDIS. Lehrmann given extension | Bruce Lehrmann is now free to pursue defamation claims against News Corp and Network Ten after the federal court gave him an extension on the usual 12-month time limit. The defendants will seek to prove the truth in their initial reporting of Brittany Higgins\u2019s allegation of rape. The trial will take place on 20 November and last for 20 days. Lehrmann denies raping Higgins in Parliament House. Speakman slams Latham comments | The incoming NSW Liberal leader, Mark Speakman, has added his name to the list of people to condemn Mark Latham\u2019s homophobic commentary. Latham has doubled down on his remarks, and suggested the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson \u2013 who has called on Latham to resign \u2013 does not understand \u201chow straight men feel about this\u201d. Cleopatra controversy | Even before its release, the upcoming Netflix docudrama Cleopatra has caused controversy.

Egypt\u2019s antiquities ministry insisted on Thursday that Cleopatra had \u201cwhite skin and Hellenistic characteristics\u201d. Racist flyer drops | Queensland police have released security camera footage in an attempt to identify three men who distributed racist flyers on the Sunshine Coast. The flyers carried the name of an interstate white supremacist group, contained a racial slur and had pictures of two local girls who are accused of assault. Indigenous children in care | In a letter, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has told Eleanor Bourke, the chair of the Yoorrook Justice Commission, that the overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in the care and justice system is \u201ca source of great shame\u201d. Victoria has the highest rate of Indigenous children in out-of-home care. Sheeran serenades courtroom | Did the English singer-songwriter copy Marvin Gaye\u2019s classic Let\u2019s Get it On when he wrote his hit song Thinking Out Loud? That is what the American federal court is set to decide. Testifying as the first witness in his own defence on Thursday, Sheeran played part of the song and said he had drawn inspiration for writing it from a new romantic relationship. Mike Pence fronts inquiry | The former vice-president\u2019s proximity to ex-president Donald Trump has made him a key witness in the criminal inquiry into the Capitol attack. Pence\u2019s testimony took seven hours and was held behind closed doors, meaning the evidence he gave remains private.

            "date": "2023-04-24T05:00:04Z",
            "content": "More than 830 UK health professionals and representatives from leading medical bodies have signed a letter to the prime minister expressing \u201cgrave concerns\u201d that the government\u2019s plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda will cause \u201ccatastrophic mental and physical harm\u201d to people seeking safety, in advance of a court of appeal hearing on the policy on Monday. Signatories to the letter include the BMA and the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists. \u201cSubjecting people seeking sanctuary in the UK, many of whom have mental health conditions and have histories of torture, trafficking and trauma, to such an inhumane process is a matter of significant concern for the medical community,\u201d the letter says. Like Brexit, the government\u2019s plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda has split the UK down the middle. According to a poll carried out by the More In Common thinktank carried out this month, almost half of those surveyed (46%) back the deal, announced just over a year ago. It has so far cost \u00a3140m, although no asylum seekers have yet been sent to the east African country. On Monday the plans will be considered in the court of appeal by three top judges \u2013 the lord chief justice, the master of the rolls and Lord Justice Underhill, vice-president of the court of appeal\u2019s civil division. A group of asylum seekers from countries including Iran, Iraq and Syria are bringing the appeal, along with the charity Asylum Aid. In the high court last December, two senior judges found that the government\u2019s plans were lawful but quashed the cases of eight individual asylum seekers threatened with removal to Rwanda. While the ruling was welcomed by the government and the former home secretary Priti Patel, who announced the Rwanda deal on 14 April 2022, permission to appeal was granted on some grounds. Last month, further permission to appeal was granted to consider whether the high court judges had properly examined if Rwanda is a safe place to send asylum seekers. Grave warnings were given by the UN refugee agency the UNHCR, which was given permission to intervene in the high court case and give additional information concerning Rwanda\u2019s poor track record of protecting refugees. The government insists that the plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda is workable and an essential deterrent to prevent large numbers of people crossing the Channel. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has made \u201cStop the boats\u201d one of his key undertakings before the next election. Last year a record 45,756 people crossed the Channel in small boats. So far this year more than 5,000 have made the crossing, a similar figure to this time last year before the Rwanda announcement was made. A decision known as an \u201cinterim measure\u201d was issued by the European court of human rights hours before the first Rwanda flight was due to take off on 14 June last year, which halted the flight. The ECHR said it took particular account of evidence that asylum seekers transferred from the UK to Rwanda will not have access to fair and efficient procedures for the determination of their asylum claims. The interim measure expired after the quashing of the individual asylum seeker\u2019s threatened removal to Rwanda by the two high court judges. But earlier this month the ECHR announced that it had accepted a new application. The asylum seeker from Iraq, known only as NSK, is claiming that it would be a breach of his human rights to send him to Rwanda as he would be at risk of \u201cinhuman and degrading treatment\u201d and could not expect a fair assessment of his application. The ECHR said it had \u201cgiven notice\u201d to the UK government about NSK\u2019s case and requested that ministers submit their observations. The Rwanda plans have been criticised by many human rights organisations. The UN\u2019s special rapporteur on trafficking in persons has been granted permission to intervene in this week\u2019s court of appeal hearing along with the UNHCR. The government has pledged to start sending asylum seekers to Rwanda as soon as legal proceedings have concluded. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cOur migration and economic development partnership will see people who come to the UK through dangerous and illegal routes relocated to Rwanda, where they will be given the opportunity to settle and rebuild their lives. \u201cIndividuals who are eligible for relocation will have all their needs looked after while their asylum claims are being considered in Rwanda including having access to safe and clean accommodation and healthcare.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-04-27T06:10:24Z",
            "content": "Cases of a new subvariant of Omicron Covid-19 circulating in Australia are not a cause for alarm \u2013 but they are a reminder that coronavirus still isn\u2019t behind us, experts say. The Arcturus subvariant \u2013 or XBB.1.16 as it is officially known \u2013 was designated a variant of interest by the World Health Organization in April after it was reported in 33 countries. The WHO has categorised the variant as low risk compared with other Omicron subvariants circulating in the community. India, which is experiencing its highest number of Covid-19 infections in months, has reported most of the world\u2019s Arcturus infections since the variant was first detected in January. In Australia, there were 143 cases reported as of 17 April, or 3.9% of the cases globally, according to the WHO. Prof Peter Collignon, an expert in infectious diseases at ANU, said Arcturus may be more transmissible, but people should not panic as there is no evidence to suggest it is more severe than other Omicron subvariants. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cWe\u2019ve got very good protection now against dying and getting into hospital and that\u2019s because of a mixture of vaccines and immunity from natural infection, but we\u2019ve also got drugs and other interventions to decrease your risk,\u201d he said. He said it was unlikely any new subvariant of Omicron will be classed as a variant of concern. Dr Sarah Palmer, an expert in infectious diseases and co-director of the centre for virus research at the Westmead institute for medical research, said the new subvariant reaching Australian shores is a reminder that Covid-19 is not behind us. She said Australians should remain vigilant with keeping their boosters up to date. The Australian technical advisory group on immunisation recommends adults with comorbidities, or who are aged 65 and over, should get a booster if their last dose or infection was six months ago or longer. According to the WHO, Arcturus may become dominant in some countries, but the strain has also proved to be no more severe than previous variants. In India there has been a slight increase in bed occupancy at hospitals, the WHO reported, but it is much lower than during previous Covid-19 waves. Collignon said it was difficult to know yet whether Arcturus will become the dominant strain in Australia. The numbers are still low, that could change during winter, he said. \u201cOmicron forms about 95% [of infections] but it\u2019s like a subvariant soup,\u201d he said. \u201cEach one goes up and down with time and it\u2019s not very predictable.\u201d Palmer said Omicron cases are increasing in Australia, particularly in New South Wales, although she said she would not yet classify the uptick as the start of a new Covid-19 wave. The rise was to be expected, given people are spending more time indoors as the weather turns colder, she said. Last week, there were 11,523 people diagnosed with Covid-19 in NSW, a 3.7% increase form the previous week. Emergency department presentations increased by 15 from the previous week to 266."

            "date": "2023-04-06T06:30:16Z",
            "content": "The Covid-19 pandemic has wreaked extraordinary destruction and misery, killing nearly 7 million people worldwide thus far and devastating the lives of many more. And yet, viewed through the long lens of human history, writes the public health sociologist Jonathan Kennedy, \u201cthere is little about it that is new or remarkable\u201d. Previous pandemics have killed many more, both in absolute numbers and as proportions of populations, and so may future ones. Covid should be a wakeup call that helps us manage deadlier plagues in the future. But will we heed it? Our very existence and success as a species, Kennedy argues in this fascinating book, has been shaped by bacteria and viruses. Where, for example, did all the other species of humans go? At one time, early Homo sapiens shared the Earth (and interbred with) the stronger, larger-brained and equally artistic Neanderthals, as well as the hobbit-like Denisovans. What happened to them? It could be, as some argue, that we simply killed them all, or that they were somehow less well able to adapt to climate change. But Kennedy explores the possibility that roving Homo sapiens from Africa, who had acquired strong immune systems on their travels, might have simply infected the already settled Neanderthals of Europe with a novel pathogen that they couldn\u2019t fight off \u2013 just as the colonising Spanish, tens of thousands of years later, decimated the Aztec population with smallpox as much as with weapons. A similar dynamic repeats itself over and over in human history, in Kennedy\u2019s telling, even if some of the details remain speculative. Why, for example, were dark-skinned Neolithic hunter-gatherers such as the celebrated \u201cCheddar Man\u201d, who first settled the British Isles after the last ice age, replaced throughout Europe by light-skinned farmers of Mediterranean origin? \u201cThe most likely answer,\u201d the author suggests, is that the farmers carried infectious diseases to which they had, over time, become immune, but which devastated the indigenous populations. Those farmers were in turn almost completely replaced by another wave of migrants, shepherds from the Eurasian steppe \u2013 thanks, perhaps, to a Neolithic wave of bubonic plague in Europe. Kennedy does not shy away from emphasising the point most relevant to modern politics: \u201cContemporary Europeans are neither genetically \u2018pure\u2019 nor are they the region\u2019s indigenous people.\u201d Modern genetic analysis shows that even the people who built Stonehenge were completely wiped out and replaced by a new wave of migration. As Spinal Tap so clairvoyantly put it: \u201cThe druids. No one knows who they were, or what they were doing.\u201d We can be more confident, at least, about the geopolitical effects of disease once we enter the era of written history. An epidemic of either typhus or smallpox devastated Athens from BC430, which \u201cundermined Athens\u2019s capacity to fight against the Spartans and had a profound impact on the course and outcome of the Peloponnesian War\u201d. A series of plagues beginning in 65AD, meanwhile, might have weakened the Roman empire to an extent that contributed to its eventual fall. Medieval waves of the Black Death, it is salutary to be reminded, killed astonishing numbers of people \u2013 as much as 60% of the entire population of Europe succumbed in a single decade of the 14th century. The subsequent introduction of rules of quarantine and cordons sanitaires, Kennedy argues, can be seen as marking the beginnings of the modern state, extending as they did its power into ordinary human life in unprecedented ways. Meanwhile, the shortage of agricultural labour caused by devastating recurrences of the plague was perhaps instrumental in the collapse of feudalism in favour of a capitalist system of flexible employment. Later on, the susceptibility to malaria of northern soldiers in the American civil war \u201cprobably delayed victory by months or even years\u201d, possibly giving Lincoln time to come round to the idea of abolishing slavery. The book thus performs that satisfying trick of encouraging the reader to think differently about familiar topics, though its ideas are inevitably variable in their persuasiveness. Among the most conjectural, for example, is the suggestion that the rise of Christianity in the imperial Roman era might itself have depended on the prevalence of disease, because of its consoling message. \u201cThe Christian faith skyrocketed because it provided a more appealing and assuring guide to life and death than paganism during the devastating pandemics that struck the Roman empire in the second and third centuries CE,\u201d Kennedy suggests. Well, maybe. But the conversion of Constantine, briefly mentioned on the same page, was surely the nearer and sufficient cause. There is, too, occasionally a slightly po-faced attitude to Kennedy\u2019s discussions, as when he cites the \u201cWhat have the Romans ever done for us riff\u201d from Life of Brian. (There is \u201csomething unsettling about a group of white, Oxford- and Cambridge-educated men extolling the virtues of colonialism, albeit for comedic effect,\u201d he complains piously.) And the depredations of \u201ccapitalism\u201d come to figure, in this story, as a villain as evil as any virus. The economic growth driven by the Industrial Revolution, Kennedy claims, did not, as is usually thought, increase welfare through improved living standards, though here his disagreement seems to be merely about timescales. (It didn\u2019t overall at first because many of the new cities and working environments were filthy and unsanitary, but it sure did in the long run.) The author seems to approve considerably more of capitalism with Chinese characteristics, celebrating the undoubted improvement in living standards of many millions of people in China over the last few decades. He is also curiously happy to accept the official Chinese figures on Covid death rates in order to argue that the US and \u201cliberal democracy\u201d in general are not obviously superior systems. Kennedy is convincing, though, in his emphasis on the way that disease can intersect and interact with social inequality, both globally \u2013 most sub-Saharan Africans remain unvaccinated for Sars-Cov-2, the rich countries having kept multiple doses for their own citizens \u2013 and within countries, where health outcomes are shockingly dependent on socioeconomic status. What is sometimes called \u201cshit life syndrome\u201d will harm you as surely as many infectious diseases, and \u201cpathogens thrive on inequality and injustice\u201d. So what will we do now? Perhaps, as Kennedy suggests, the recent, comparatively mild pandemic will cause us to rethink \u201chow humans see their place in the world\u201d, to stop creating super-pathogens with our incontinent use of antibiotics, and to realise that \u201cif we Homo sapiens don\u2019t strive to live in balance with the other living things on our planet, we face a very bleak future\u201d. That, however, is a tall order, and not just politically. Bacteria alone make up an estimated 13% of the biomass of Earth, while humans represent a mere 0.01%. In the war against disease, we are massively outnumbered. \u2022 Pathogenesis: How Germs Made History is published by Torva.

            "date": "2023-04-27T10:00:28Z",
            "content": "Young doctors just out of medical school working as resident physicians, fellows and interns at major US hospitals are organizing unions at an increasing rate, citing long-running problems highlighted by the Covid-19 pandemic and a need to rethink the struggles young doctors face in the profession. The Committee of Interns and Residents, an affiliate of SEIU, added five unionized sites in 2022 compared with about one a year before the pandemic and the surge has continued in 2023 with multiple union election filings. It currently represents over 25,000 residents, fellows and interns across the US, comprising about 15% of all resident and fellow physicians. Over 2,500 residents and fellows at Mass General Brigham in Boston are currently waiting to have a union election date set after filing this year. As with other industries facing a renewed interest in unionization from their staff, the US\u2019s rich and powerful hospitals have responded with well-funded anti-union campaigns and tactics to delay union elections and contract negotiations. Hospital management has opposed the unionization effort, declining to voluntarily recognize the union, encouraging residents not to sign union authorization cards ahead of the election filing and writing local op-eds in opposition to unionization. Since going public with their union plans, staff have been sent emails and been invited to meetings to try to dissuade residents from unionizing, \u201coften counting on myths around what unionizing would mean\u201d, said Dr Sascha Murillo, a third-year internal medicine resident at Massachusetts general hospital. \u201cThey tried to dangle some carrots with the salary increases and benefit changes that we\u2019re going to see next year, but the only way we\u2019re going to quantify that for the long term is by having a union and an actual contract,\u201d said Murillo. The unionizing campaign took off after vulnerabilities in the healthcare system were exposed by the Covid-19 pandemic, she said, with residents working on the frontlines and bearing the brunt of staffing shortages, an influx of Covid-19 patients, and patients who deferred medical care. Residents often work 80 hours or more a week while being paid barely enough to cover rent in expensive cities like Boston. They often cannot leave or change jobs before they complete the three-year residency program. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who are often the first faces that patients see. We\u2019re privy to the issues our patients face and want to be able to advocate for our patients,\u201d added Murillo. \u201cThese hospital systems are incredibly powerful. We\u2019re seeing a trend across healthcare of these huge mergers and consolidation of power and it\u2019s even more important for all workers in the healthcare system to be able to have a seat at the table to really ensure that those at the top understand what we face day to day in delivering patient care and that we\u2019re able to check that power.\u201d About 1,400 residents at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia filed for a union election being held in the beginning of May 2023. Penn Medicine has hired law firm Cozen O\u2019Connor, which specializes in union avoidance, in response to the union organizing effort and has encouraged residents to be wary of the union\u2019s promises. \u201cIt still feels like we aren\u2019t being heard. It feels like the institution is still sending a message that they know what\u2019s best for us, that they want to stay in a position of power,\u201d said Dr Chantal Tap\u00e9, a third-year resident in family medicine. Tap\u00e9 said there was also a need to change the perception of residency programs as an inherently exploitative stage that residents just need to struggle through. \u201cOur big push is to have a union so that we have a seat at the table, so that there\u2019s a system for accountability where resident voices are heard and hopefully persists across the years so that the issues that are most important to a resident at Penn 10 years from now have the same sort of venue for being heard as the issues that we\u2019re experiencing right now,\u201d she added. Over 450 residents, interns and fellows at George Washington University are voting in a union election on 25 and 26 April. \u201cThere\u2019s been a large uproar of residents unionizing because residents and fellows across the nation have felt exploited in their jobs, undervalued, underappreciated, overworked in really unsustainable working conditions,\u201d said Dr Maryssa Miller, a first-year internal medicine resident at George Washington. \u201cMy starting salary was right around $64,000, which when you divide that out into 80-hour work weeks, I make about $15 an hour, far below the living standard in the city, so more than half of my paycheck goes to rent.\u201d Ahead of their union election, the Dean of the GW School of Medicine, Dr Barbara Bass wrote an email to all residents where she argued in favor of a direct relationship, referring to the union as a third party and citing concerns about the impacts a union could have on professional and mentoring relationships between faculty and residents. \u201cI think that was really just a tactic to try to scare people. And it\u2019s really just not true, and not something that any unionized campaign amongst residents and fellows has seen across the country,\u201d added Miller. \u201cWe are really the ones that are on the frontlines,\u201d said Miller. \u201cBut ironically, we\u2019re the voice that\u2019s not listened to and I think that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s been seen throughout all of these union campaigns that are popping up through America.\u201d Some 1,200 residents and fellows at Montefiore hospital in New York City won their union election in February 2023, with 82% voting in favor of the union. Residents at Sutter Health California Pacific medical center and Lifelong Medical Care in California also won union elections in 2023. Ahead of the union vote in New York City, an anti-union video claimed \u201ca vote for this union is a vote against us, your educational leaders\u201d. The video presentation included slides with a misspelled \u201cno ragrets\u201d neck tattoo to warn about the \u201cpermanent decision\u201d of unionizing, followed by a slide of a brain where a doctor encourages residents to use the right part of their brain in deciding on their vote. Residents at the University of Vermont medical center, USC Keck and Greater Lawrence family health center in Massachusetts won union elections in 2022, and 1,500 residents at the University of Washington joined the CIR-SEIU. At Stanford Health Care in California 1,478 residents and fellows won their union election in May 2022. Stanford criticized unions ahead of the vote, claiming they prefer a direct relationship with individual residents. The National Labor Relations Board recently ruled against Stanford for refusing to furnish information before bargaining with the union. Dr Philip Sossenheimer, an internal medicine resident at Stanford, explained the union drive was driven by issues residents experienced during the pandemic and doctors wanting to use unionization as a vehicle to address ongoing issues throughout the healthcare system and how those impact residents and patients. \u201cOur generation collectively is starting to realize the sort of losses that have come from degradation of labor strength in this country and declining rate of union membership, and I think broadly, as a society, we\u2019re starting to reflect on what that power imbalance means for the average citizen, particularly since as people in this country, we spend a substantial amount of our time at work.\u201d At Children\u2019s national hospital in Washington DC, residents organized a demonstration across the street from the hospital during breaks to demand better pay, improved staffing, and other demands central to the union in new contract negotiations. Though a contract was settled in December 2022, the hospital is currently taking legal action against the union over the demonstration, claiming the union violated a \u201cno strike\u201d clause. The hospital has not commented on the action due to the pending litigation. \u201cIt feels like such a retaliation,\u201d said Dr Lydia Lissanu, a first-year resident at Children\u2019s national hospital. \u201cAt the very least if it feels like they want to intimidate us even if it doesn\u2019t work, they want us to know they\u2019re very upset with us.\u201d Lissanu added that residents have been increasingly organizing unions because of how they were the ones forced to pick up the slack for vulnerabilities exposed in the healthcare system during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re being asked to pick up the slack essentially from all of the other shortages in the hospital, all of the things that have happened in Covid, all of the pediatric respiratory viruses surging all at once. A lot was expected of us, a lot of slack that we had to pick up with very little recognition, very little reward. We\u2019re asking to be treated fairly and be paid for our labor, we no longer feel that we should be grateful for having this job, they should be grateful for us and what we bring to the table.\u201d"

            "title": "Exam grades are going \u2018back to normal\u2019. But for our stressed-out teenagers, normal is a long way off | Gaby Hinsliff",
            "date": "2023-04-27T15:44:44Z",
            "content": "The countdown clock is ticking, the panicky last-minute revision reaching feverish levels. No parent currently tiptoeing around snappy, stressed teenagers will need reminding that exam season now looms in England and Wales, or that it\u2019s already under way in Scotland. But if nerves are jangling more than usual this year, both in staff rooms and at home, that\u2019s hardly surprising. After three years of pandemic grade inflation, caused first by teachers having to conjure up grades and then by exam boards making understandable allowances for what children had been through, this is the year that exam regulator Ofqual finally plans to ratchet GCSE and A-level grades back down to normal (though with some leeway on the borderline). The trouble is that in many schools, normal still feels a very long way off. The teenagers currently hunched over their revision flashcards have endured years of adults moving the goalposts; shunting them in and out of lockdown, chopping and changing arrangements for exams, promising help to catch up and not quite delivering. Having balked at the \u00a315bn cost of the recommendations of its own \u201ccatchup tsar\u201d, Kevan Collins, Boris Johnson\u2019s government sought to fix things on the cheap \u2013 but even then, it turns out that a third of the money allocated to its national tutoring programme for extra lessons hasn\u2019t been drawn down. (Heads complain that the platform was difficult to use, didn\u2019t meet their needs or that they couldn\u2019t afford it, with costs part-subsidised by government and schools making up the difference.) Children have lost further classroom time this year because of teachers\u2019 strikes \u2013 although unions have promised to try to protect exam years from industrial action this week and next \u2013 and mental health problems are through the roof, with many parents struggling to get help for their children from an overstretched NHS. This year\u2019s results will be a crucial litmus test of what all this turbulence has meant, not just for secondary school pupils sitting formal exams, but for primary schoolchildren doing SATs. The Northern Powerhouse Partnership, set up to help close the north-south gap, has written to Ofqual pleading for more generous marking this year: the group\u2019s chief executive, Henri Murison, has said heads are now \u201creally worried\u201d about the impact on children\u2019s life chances. The NPP has already warned of a new north-south divide emerging in education, with children having missed more lessons in areas seeing persistently high Covid-19 rates, from Burnley in the north-west to Hull on the east coast. Heads in deprived neighbourhoods are particularly worried that children who became semidetached from school during lockdown and have since fallen farther and farther behind simply won\u2019t turn up to sit their papers. As one headteacher in a big northern city tells me, it\u2019s increasingly hard to untangle these consequences of the pandemic in schools from a deeper sense of economic gloom. At least in lockdown, he could reassure the kids that it wouldn\u2019t be this tough for ever, and hand out free food parcels. But as Covid-19 has receded, it has become painfully obvious that struggling is the new normal for many families in a cost of living crisis. He sees pupils beginning to question whether working hard for their exams really will pay off, when even people in \u201cgood\u201d jobs say they can\u2019t make ends meet. Lately this head spends much of his time battling social media myths that buying bitcoin or becoming a YouTuber are better options than getting good GCSEs. Even among middle-class parents whose children have every chance of bouncing back, there\u2019s anxiety about them being the guinea pigs for Ofqual\u2019s planned \u201cglide path\u201d back to normal. Will future employers remember, looking at their children\u2019s CVs, which year groups were unusually likely to get A*s and which were bumped back down to earth? Although Ofqual insists it\u2019s taking steps to cushion this year\u2019s cohort from the effects of a return to 2019 marking practices, several summers of uproar over exam results have left many parents distrustful of a seemingly opaque process. And for sixth-formers making university choices on the strength of predicted A-level grades, there\u2019s an extra layer of anxiety. How reliable can predictions be when they\u2019re made by teachers who haven\u2019t seen a \u201creal\u201d A grade since 2019? If some predictions are wildly out, does that mean a scramble for places in clearing this summer? But as ever, it\u2019s the most vulnerable kids who are at greatest risk in this rocky year, when nobody quite knows what to expect. After lockdown, there was a brief but genuinely hopeful moment when it felt as if something really could change. Children had been sent home from school largely \u2013 though not exclusively \u2013 to protect wider society from a virus that rarely kills the young, and that left adults with a profound sense of obligation to make up for everything they had missed. Parents grateful to have had gardens for their stir-crazy toddlers to play in understood as never before how lucky they were, compared with families trapped in overcrowded flats. There was a wellspring of empathy and goodwill there waiting to be tapped, but instead it\u2019s been allowed to trickle dry, leaving behind a sense of opportunity squandered and a nagging anxiety about the implications for these children as they grow up. If this summer\u2019s results confirm such fears, then we have to be ready to act, before the children of Covid-19 fall any further behind. Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"

            "title": "Netball World Cup: safety first as Australia names surprise-free 19-player squad ",
            "date": "2023-04-27T15:00:07Z",
            "content": "\u201cBetter the gold medallist you know\u201d appears to be the motto adopted by Australian Diamonds\u2019 coach Stacey Marinkovich after she named a surprise-free, 19-player squad for the World Cup. Despite calls from some quarters to add and adjust, Marinkovich and selectors Anne Sargeant and Michelle Wilkins resisted the temptation to tinker and named 11 of the 12 players from last year\u2019s triumphant Commonwealth Games campaign \u2013 minus the pregnant Gretel Bueta \u2013 and added seven existing squad members. The only material change is the addition of 24-year-old Adelaide Thunderbird defender Matilda Garrett, who is in red-hot domestic form, having recorded 11 deflections and nine intercepts across the opening six matches. She replaces NSW Swift Maddy Turner. While the squad of 19 \u2013 which could have been as large as 22 and will be cut to 12 plus three emergencies ahead of the tournament \u2013 reflects a certain level of conservatism, it\u2019s warranted given the Diamonds\u2019 recent success. After having a bare trophy cabinet for a while, Australia now holds them all, bar the World Cup. The \u201csteady as she goes\u201d approach also sends a clear signal to other nations that Marinkovich believes she already has the fixings for greatness. Australia is the first major nation to name a squad for the four-yearly tournament, which will begin in Cape Town on 28 July; the first time it has been held in Africa. Current world champions New Zealand will name its 15-player squad on 7 June, while England expects to unveil its 15 around 15 May. Australia\u2019s final list will be revealed at the end of the home and away season in mid-June. First-time squad member Garrett joins a defence line that includes the Birmingham quartet of Courtney Bruce, Jo Weston, Sarah Klau and Sunday Aryang, as well as Ruby Bakewell-Doran, who travelled to the UK last year but didn\u2019t make the final team. Squad member Tara Hinchliffe was omitted after rupturing her ACL in February. There are no shocks at the other end, with Commonwealth trio Steph Wood, Cara Koenen and Kiera Austin, as well as Sophie Garbin, Donnell Wallam and Sophie Dwyer, named. West Coast Fever long-bomb specialist Sasha Glasgow, who is eligible to play for Australia and England and made herself available for both, was overlooked. With most expecting Sunshine Coast Lightning pair Wood and Koenen and Melbourne Vixen Austin to fill three of the final four spots, the question of who takes Bueta\u2019s place will be intriguing, especially given how poorly Garbin is playing for struggling Collingwood. In the hotly contested midcourt, Marinkovich deferred any tough decisions, naming seven players: Commonwealth champions Liz Watson, Paige Hadley, Ash Brazill and Kate Moloney, as well as Amy Parmenter, Jamie-Lee Price and Maddy Proud. Unlike Brazill and Moloney, who have been below their best lately, Giants Parmenter and Price and Swift Proud are in \u201ctoo-good-to-ignore\u201d form and now have the rest of the Super Netball season to force their way into a four-player midcourt which will no doubt include Watson and Hadley. Brazill and Moloney however have the power of incumbency. Marinkovich was unapologetic about the lack of movement in her squad. \u201cI think you\u2019d definitely have to look at what the girls have done, particularly when they\u2019ve been in the (Diamonds) environment,\u201d she said. \u201cSuper Netball shows skillsets, but we need it to be able to combine and we\u2019ve got a very short preparation time going into World Cup, so it\u2019s not about trying to add so many different things in. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually got to solidify our strengths and we\u2019ve got some known gaps that we are trying to rectify,\u201d Marinkovich said. In a frightening sign for opponents, she also wants her side to get stronger. \u201cWe have to get a performance that is better than what we had at Commonwealth Games. So, we really need to entrust what we\u2019ve been building and the players that have been involved in that,\u201d she said. On Garrett, the coach rejected any suggestion she\u2019s a token inclusion and said she is \u201cabsolutely\u201d in the mix for the final 12. \u201cAs much as we haven\u2019t seen her in the (Diamonds) dynamic, we still see that there\u2019s things that we think will easily transfer,\u201d she said of her classic, grinding defensive style. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a big second half (of Super Netball) ... and we don\u2019t know what happens with injuries, combinations, things like that, so anyone in that squad needs to be ready to put their hand up and get on that plane,\u201d Marinkovich said. The player herself wasn\u2019t even expecting a call. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know selections were happening to be honest so it\u2019s fair to say I was pretty surprised. It\u2019s not something I really thought would happen for me \u2026 it\u2019s still hard to believe.\u201d"

            "content": "An artist who reflects on the challenges of the Covid pandemic and another who explores the impact of the Windrush scandal are among four shortlisted for this year\u2019s prestigious Turner prize, with the winner announced in December. The work of Jesse Darling, Ghislaine Leung, Rory Pilgrim and Barbara Walker will be exhibited at the Towner Eastbourne from 28 September before the jury\u2019s final choice. Alex Farquharson, the director of Tate Britain and the chair of the Turner prize jury, said it was a \u201cfantastic shortlist\u201d for a prize that \u201coffers the public a snapshot of British artistic talent today\u201d. He added: \u201cThese artists each explore the contrasts and contradictions of life, combining conceptual and political concerns with warmth, playfulness, sincerity and tenderness and often celebrating individual identity and community strength.\u201d Darling, an artist based in London and Berlin, uses sculptures and installations to \u201cevoke the vulnerability of the human body and the precariousness of power structures\u201d, the Tate said in its announcement. The jury was struck by the artist\u2019s ability to manipulate materials \u201cin ways that skilfully express the messy reality of life\u201d and expose \u201cthe world\u2019s underlying fragility\u201d. Darling was nominated for solo exhibitions No Medals No Ribbons at Modern Art Oxford and Enclosures at Camden Art Centre. Leung, a Swedish-born artist who lives and works in London, was particularly commended by the jury for the \u201cwarm, humorous and transcendental qualities that lay behind the sleek aesthetic and conceptual nature\u201d of her work. She was nominated for her solo exhibition Fountains at Simian, Copenhagen, in which a baby monitor, child safety gates, inflatable structures and toys were used to challenge the way art is produced and circulated. \u201cWe\u2019re not used to [seeing] baby monitors. You think everything\u2019s been done, not that art is a game, but it is about new approaches,\u201d said Farquharson. Pilgrim blends stories, poems, music and film created in collaboration with communities in the east London borough of Barking and Dagenham \u201cto reflect on times of change and struggle during the pandemic\u201d. He was nominated for Rafts at the Serpentine and Barking town hall and a live performance of the work at the Cadogan Hall in London. The project was a \u201cstandout example of social practice\u201d, according to the jury. Walker\u2019s work \u201cinterrogates past and present issues of racial identity, exclusion and power\u201d. She was nominated for her presentation Burden of Proof at the Sharjah Biennial 15 in the UAE, which explores the impact of the Windrush scandal. The jury was impressed with Walker\u2019s use of \u201cportraits of monumental scale to tell stories of a similarly monumental nature, while maintaining a profound tenderness and intimacy\u201d. Farquharson said: \u201cPart of her practice involves drawing directly on walls, and those drawings that literally take time, immense skill, [are] washed off at the end, in a practice that reflects \u2026 how people can be marginalised on account of their identity and injustice.\u201d The Turner prize, one of the best known prizes for visual arts, aims to promote public debate on new developments in contemporary British art. Last year it was won by Veronica Ryan, who created the UK\u2019s first permanent artwork to honour the Windrush generation and at 66 was the oldest artist yet to be awarded the prize. Each year, the winner receives \u00a325,000 with the runners up getting \u00a310,000 each. Joe Hill, the director and chief executive of Towner Eastbourne, said the shortlist consisted of \u201can incredibly strong set of exhibiting artists, who ask us to look at some of the most pertinent issues of today, and who will collectively bring a sense of place and community to our galleries, through their diverse range of practices, from film and performance to drawing and sculpture.\u201d The members of this year\u2019s jury are Martin Clark, director of Camden Art Centre; C\u00e9dric Fauq, chief curator of Capc mus\u00e9e d\u2019art contemporain de Bordeaux; Melanie Keen, director of Wellcome Collection; and Helen Nisbet, artistic director of Art Night."

            "content": "It\u2019s hard to pick my favorite thing about my family\u2019s pandemic rescue chihuahua, Weenie, but if I had to, I think it\u2019s when she\u2019s been napping under a blanket, as in when she\u2019s covered by the blanket completely, and a human she loves approaches and she can hear or smell us and her tail visibly wags beneath the blanket\u2019s fleece. Or perhaps it\u2019s her enthusiasm for car rides, and how when she notices that we\u2019ve put on our shoes and are approaching the back door, she becomes frantic to go along, barking and running in circles, and then in the hall by the garage, in the middle of her franticness, she makes eye contact with us and flips on to her back for an impromptu belly rub because, really, is it ever a bad time? Or maybe it\u2019s when I\u2019m sitting on the couch reading and she jumps up and wedges herself as close as she can beside me and sets her perfect little whiskered chin on my thigh, as if my thigh was designed to be a chihuahua chin platform, which, although I didn\u2019t know it for most of my life, maybe it was. Is this the moment to reveal that I\u2019m not really a dog person? But it turns out I\u2019m a Weenie person. (About her name: have you read the 1950s Eloise book about the spoiled yet neglected little girl who lives in the Plaza Hotel in New York and has a pet dog named Weenie and a pet turtle named Skipperdee? Weenie is named after Eloise\u2019s dog. Yes, the name has raised a few eyebrows, but no more than being a woman named Curtis has for me.) In spring 2020, our neighbors in Minneapolis were one of many American families who acquired so-called pandemic dogs, theirs a sweet beagle named Sophie. This was so early in the pandemic that it was unclear how Covid was transmitted, and I\u2019d tell my kids to stand at the edge of our neighbors\u2019 yard and just observe Sophie but not pet her. My children didn\u2019t exactly comply and I didn\u2019t exactly try to make them, but more than once, as my older child gazed at Sophie, her eyes would fill with tears of longing, and I would think: this is not a matter of wanting. We need a dog. I was at that time agnostic on chihuahuas. My husband is allergic to cats and wasn\u2019t sure if he was allergic to dogs, and I read that if a person did have such allergies, a smaller dog would be less irritating \u2013 it would shed less dander. Besides, a small dog seemed to me generally less daunting and more manageable, maybe like a glorified hamster? After scouring websites and writing up applications, most of which were ignored, I found a lead. My family drove an hour north to meet Weenie in her foster mother\u2019s driveway. Weenie had come up on a van from Texas (a state with a surplus of stray dogs), was estimated to be four years old, and was 9lbs of white fur with brown eyes and alert brown ears. She barked at us suspiciously. My children loved her immediately. The plan was that she\u2019d come to live with us in 10 days, after getting spayed. But to our surprise, it turned out that, thanks to that interstate van ride with other dogs \u2013 including one apparently frisky terrier \u2013 Weenie was pregnant. She\u2019d continue to live with her foster mom for another three months, during the gestation period, delivery and nursing of her puppies. In light of this delay, I asked my children if we should look for another dog. My children said that I was monstrous for even suggesting the possibility because Weenie was so clearly meant to be ours. Weenie has now lived with us for two and a half years, and sometimes my children still remind me of my monstrosity. But ironically, everyone agrees that I turned out to be Weenie\u2019s favorite. There are competing theories in our house about why Weenie loves me as much as she does. Is it because I do the grocery shopping, meaning I\u2019m the one who carries in bags containing deli ham, which is pretty much Weenie\u2019s favorite food? Is it because Weenie\u2019s favorite place is on someone\u2019s lap and my womanly thighs appear to be exceptionally comfortable? In a nightly ritual my younger child refers to as \u201chigh time for thigh time\u201d, Weenie approaches as I finish eating dinner and sets her front paws on my chair, and I move into a nearby armchair and let her climb on to me. Is it because, to my own astonishment, I not only sing to her but I sing to her constantly, every day, and the songs are made-up ditties about how brave, beautiful and dignified she is? My voice has never impressed any of my fellow humans, but when I croon to Weenie about her good looks and her courage in peeing outside in the Minnesota winter, she gazes into my eyes and wags her tail. Or is it because when she first arrived at our house, I slept with her for two weeks on a mattress on the floor of our walk-in closet, while she got used to her little bed there? I will concede that Weenie is not perfect. Like many chihuahuas, she\u2019s rather barky with both other dogs and humans \u2013 she especially dislikes men, tall men, tall men in hats, and tall men in hats on bicycles \u2013 though because of her size, the usual response to her aggression is \u201cOh, aren\u2019t you a ferocious beast!\u201d Her breath is so pungent that her yawns smell like farts, prompting us to refer to them as \u201cyarts\u201d. If she\u2019s on one of her beloved car rides and it gets dark, she whimpers as if to tell us we need to turn on the lights so she can better enjoy the scenery. But these minor flaws all pale in comparison to the joy Weenie brings us, to the purity of her excitement when we return home after being away, the sweetness of her affection when she curls up next to us, the guilelessness of her interest in food, and her fondness for being petted and snuggling under blankets. Though I\u2019m uncertain how much I believe in things like fate or destiny, my children were not wrong \u2013 Weenie was definitely meant to be ours.

            "date": "2023-04-04T18:00:48Z",
            "content": "The mental health impact of the pandemic was so severe that it prompted a \u201csecond midlife crisis\u201d for the over-50s, with women worst affected. A study has found that just before the second national lockdown began, those born in Britain in 1958 and 1970 were experiencing higher levels of psychological distress, on average, than they had ever experienced in adulthood before, surpassing previous peaks in their early 40s. Data collected over four decades from more than 16,000 British-born adults, which was analysed by academics from University College London and King\u2019s College London, also found that those born in 1946 had similar levels of psychological distress to their previous midlife peak in their early 50s. This peak of anxiety during the first year of the pandemic was higher for women than men across all age groups, widening the already substantial gender inequalities in mental health that existed before the pandemic. \u201cMost of the studies we analysed propose that this is due to a totally different share of the domestic and caring responsibilities during lockdown,\u201d said Dr Dari\u0301o Moreno-Agostino, lead author of the report. \u201cAn increase in gender-based violence and abuse, as well as additional financial constraints, are also suggested because there\u2019s evidence showing that women were in more precarious situations than men: for instance, from the work point of view, more care workers \u2013 typically women \u2013 were exposed to more difficulties than other professions,\u201d he added. This unforeseen second midlife mental health crisis may accelerate and exacerbate the onset and occurrence of chronic mental health and health difficulties, increasing pressures on the NHS, the study suggests. \u201cThere is the question of resilience, but we know that anxiety and depression are the top leading causes of disease worldwide,\u201d said Moreno-Agostino. \u201cThose mental health problems are closely linked to numerous physical health problems \u2013 right up to and including increased morbidity. \u201cThe fact that we are observing an unexpected new peak of the very mental health problems that can lead to these long-term trajectories is deeply concerning,\u201d he added. The study contradicts a recent study by McGill University researchers in Canada, which found Covid-19 may not have taken as great a toll on the mental health of most people as earlier research indicated. That research, based on a review of 137 studies from around the world, said some of the public narrative around the mental health impacts of Covid-19 were based on \u201cpoor-quality studies and anecdotes\u201d, which became \u201cself-fulfilling prophecies\u201d, adding that there was a need for more \u201crigorous science\u201d. Along with other experts, Moreno-Agostino disputed these findings. He warned that McGill\u2019s \u201cworldwide\u201d approach could not accurately assess the impact of the pandemic on individual groups such as children, women and people with low incomes or pre-existing mental health problems in specific countries. Even the McGill research, however, acknowledged that women had experienced worsening anxiety, depression or general mental health symptoms during the pandemic. That study also pointed to causes including juggling more family responsibilities, careers in health or social care, and domestic abuse. Other robust studies have reached different conclusions to the McGill paper, suggesting that the mental health impact of the pandemic has been severe. In 2021, researchers at the University of Queensland found that anxiety and depression around the world had increased dramatically in 2020. In April 2021, the Royal College of Psychiatrists observed a sharp rise in mental ill health. In February 2022, NHS leaders warned of a \u201csecond pandemic\u201d of depression, anxiety, psychosis and eating disorders. But Prof Peter Tyrer, emeritus professor in community psychiatry at Imperial College London, stressed that the McGill work was \u201cof good quality and reflects much of what we now know\u201d. He agreed with the researchers\u2019 conclusion that the pandemic had a similar positive effect on resilience to wars because \u201csocial cohesion, despite the handicaps of lockdown and social distancing, improves when there is a common enemy\u201d."

            "date": "2023-04-24T11:22:41Z",
            "content": "Vaccination rates have fallen among schoolchildren in England since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, health officials have said, amid a global crisis of confidence in vaccines. Fears have been expressed in recent months that thousands of children are at risk of catching deadly diseases, such as meningitis and blood poisoning, with significant outbreaks likely due to reduced vaccination rates. \u201cIn recent years, we have seen vaccine uptake fall due to the challenges posed by the pandemic,\u201d said Dr Vanessa Saliba, a consultant epidemiologist at UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Uptake of the jab that protects against the bacteria which lead to meningitis fell significantly last year, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said. The number of youngsters given a shot against polio, diphtheria and tetanus, also known as the three-in-one jab, also fell, it added. \u201cMany young people who missed out on their vaccinations have already been caught up, but more needs to be done to ensure all those eligible are vaccinated,\u201d Saliba added. \u201cThese vaccines offer the best protection as young people start their journey into adulthood and mixing more widely \u2013 whether going to college, starting work, travelling or going to summer festivals.\u201d The UKHSA said its data showed that uptake of the adolescent vaccines offered to 13- and 14-year-olds who were in school year nine during the 2021-22 academic year had fallen, leaving many young people unprotected from life-threatening diseases. \u201cAll the routine adolescent immunisation programmes have been impacted by the pandemic and coverage is not back up to pre-pandemic levels,\u201d it said. That came after Unicef said the public perception of the importance of vaccines for children declined during the pandemic in 52 out of the 55 countries it studied. The organisation said last week that its research suggested the perception of the importance of vaccines for children declined by more than a third in South Korea, Papua New Guinea, Ghana, Senegal and Japan after the start of the pandemic. And it said that, in most countries, people below the age of 35 were more likely to report less confidence about vaccines for children after the start of the pandemic. On Monday, the UKHSA said uptake of two jabs in particular were cause for concern. Health officials encouraged those eligible to get the teenage Td/IPV booster \u2013 the last routine dose for tetanus, diphtheria and polio, which provides young people with long-lasting protection into adulthood \u2013 and the MenACWY vaccine, which helps protect young people against four types of meningococcal disease.

The data suggests that the NHS has already caught up many children who missed out on their vaccines, with uptake improving to around 80% for children in year 10.\u201d The health minister Maria Caulfield said: \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important for children to stay up to date with routine vaccinations as this remains one of our best defences against infectious diseases, not just for the person being vaccinated but for their family, friends and those around them.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-04-16T16:32:07Z",
            "content": "The head of Lloyd\u2019s of London has offered to strike a world-first deal with the UK government to help the NHS meet unexpected increases in costs triggered by major events such as another pandemic. John Neal, who runs the world\u2019s largest insurance market, where 76 firms operate, floated the possibility of providing bespoke insurance contracts to the struggling health service, as well as government cover for floods or droughts caused by the climate crisis, when he met the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, for the first time last month. \u201cOne of the challenges the government has is around peak demand in the NHS relative to NHS budgets,\u201d said the Lloyd\u2019s of London\u2019s chair, Bruce Carnegie-Brown. \u201cIf we can provide an insurance solution that effectively funded the NHS if it breaches its capacity, or budget issues, then it would show the insurance industry responding in a positive way to something that was caused by an exogenous event,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously things like a pandemic might cause very dramatic increases in demand on the NHS and its resources.\u201d Such a deal would be a world first for the UK, which unlike some other countries relies heavily on a public system where most healthcare costs are covered by the taxpayer. However, wider concerns about the creeping privatisation of the NHS could be a stumbling block to a deal, particularly at a time when the government is in dispute with medical staff over pay. Carnegie-Brown acknowledged that historically it had been difficult to get the government to partner with the private sector because of a \u201clevel of mistrust on both sides\u201d. However, he highlighted some public-private partnerships, including for terrorism claims for large buildings in the UK. A health deal could help to avoid unexpected costs for taxpayers. According to the British Medical Association, the government was forced to spend \u00a397bn to cover the NHS Covid-19 response up to September 2021, on top of its regular NHS budget. It has also pledged a further \u00a39.6bn for Covid-19 funding between 2022 and 2025, including for vaccines and antiviral treatments. It is unclear what type of cover would be provided, though Lloyd\u2019s could offer products such as insurance-linked securities, which allow insurers to transfer some of the risk to external investors. \u201cHow we would structure it is yet to be determined,\u201d said Carnegie-Brown. \u201cAnd clearly, to the extent that you are specific about the risks you are protecting, then the insurance becomes more affordable.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s about understanding what the government\u2019s risk parameters are around these kinds of issues, and historically the government has borne 100% of the risks. What we\u2019re saying is that the private sector could take a share of this risk, but we would need to explore the precise terms on which we did that.\u201d Carnegie-Brown said the government had been receptive to the insurance market\u2019s proposal. \u201cWe\u2019re glad that they are listening and open to exploring the opportunity.\u201d The Treasury downplayed the idea. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWhile we appreciate the important role the insurance sector plays in building resilience to future risks, it generally does not represent good value for money for central government to purchase commercial insurance. \u201cThe government is committed to strengthening our own systems and capabilities that support our collective resilience against systemic risks.\u201d Lloyd\u2019s said it would continue to work with both the public and private sector to discuss the value insurance can add to protecting against risk. It has also offered services towards the UK\u2019s climate transition plans, as the frequency and severity of storms and flooding caused by the climate crisis increases. \u201cAgain, a bit like the NHS, the government owns all of the risk today if there is an extraordinary event. We think the insurance industry can be a partner with government in reducing the elements of risk,\u201d Carnegie-Brown said, noting that insurance is there to provide for unexpected loss. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work if the losses are expected and the premiums become too expensive \u2026 we want the government to be proactive about that rather than reactive.\u201d He called on the government to invest more in long-term infrastructure projects to build resilience against climate breakdown."

            "content": "Ghana has become the first country to approve a highly effective malaria vaccine developed at Oxford university in the UK. The R21/Matrix-M vaccine, the first to exceed the World Health Organization\u2019s target of 75% efficacy, has been cleared for use by Ghana\u2019s Food and Drugs Authority in children aged 5-36 months, the group at highest risk of death from malaria. Prof Adrian Hill, the director of the Jenner Institute, which is part of the Nuffield Department of medicine at Oxford University, said: \u201cThis marks a culmination of 30 years of malaria vaccine research at Oxford with the design and provision of a high efficacy vaccine that can be supplied at adequate scale to the countries who need it most.\u201d However, observers warned it was \u201cno silver bullet\u201d in the complex fight against the mosquito-borne disease. An estimated 619,000 people died from malaria in 2021, the vast majority of them children in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the WHO. In Ghana, where the disease is both endemic and perennial, an estimated 5.3m cases and 12,500 estimated deaths were recorded. The WHO has yet to recommend the R21 vaccine for widespread use and until it does there is a question mark over the amount of international funding available for it. The vaccine\u2019s phase 3 trial is ongoing, but earlier trials have shown efficacy levels of 77%, a level maintained after a single booster dose given a year later. In contrast, the RTS,S vaccine, which the WHO recommended for use in a landmark move in 2021, has more modest efficacy levels. The Serum Institute of India, the biotechnology giant that is manufacturing the R21 vaccine, said it has the potential to manufacture more than 200m doses annually. Adar Poonawalla, the CEO of the Serum Institute, said the licensure of the vaccine by Ghanaian authorities was a significant milestone in the fight against malaria. \u201cDeveloping a vaccine to greatly impact this huge disease burden has been extraordinarily difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cWe remain steadfast in our commitment to scaling up production of the vaccine to meet the needs of countries with high malaria burden and to support global efforts towards saving lives.\u201d The promising vaccine performance has been hailed as a rare ray of light in a fight that has stalled in recent years. Progress against malaria has been imperilled by insecticide resistance that is reducing the effectiveness of bed-nets, parasitic resistance to commonly used drugs, and the arrival in Africa of an insecticide-resistant mosquito that thrives in urban settings. Javier Guzman, the director of global health policy at the Center for Global Development, said that while it was exciting that R21 had been licensed for use in Ghana it did not mean donors or international vaccine procurers, such as Gavi, the vaccine alliance, would fund it. \u201cThese agencies still require that the vaccine is considered safe, effective and quality assured by the WHO pre-qualification programme,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, it is still uncertain if R21 is good value for money, especially when compared to other cost-effective malaria interventions that have not been fully deployed across endemic countries, such as insecticide-treated nets or indoor residual spraying. \u201cIn other words, while the vaccine might be heralded as a huge win in the fight against malaria, it is no silver bullet, and there are important points to consider before the R21 vaccine is rolled out for wider use.\u201d"

            "content": "Vaccination rates have fallen among schoolchildren in England since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, health officials have said, amid a global crisis of confidence in vaccines. Fears have been expressed in recent months that thousands of children are at risk of catching deadly diseases, such as meningitis and blood poisoning, with significant outbreaks likely due to reduced vaccination rates. \u201cIn recent years, we have seen vaccine uptake fall due to the challenges posed by the pandemic,\u201d said Dr Vanessa Saliba, a consultant epidemiologist at UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Uptake of the jab that protects against the bacteria which lead to meningitis fell significantly last year, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said. The number of youngsters given a shot against polio, diphtheria and tetanus, also known as the three-in-one jab, also fell, it added. \u201cMany young people who missed out on their vaccinations have already been caught up, but more needs to be done to ensure all those eligible are vaccinated,\u201d Saliba added. \u201cThese vaccines offer the best protection as young people start their journey into adulthood and mixing more widely \u2013 whether going to college, starting work, travelling or going to summer festivals.\u201d The UKHSA said its data showed that uptake of the adolescent vaccines offered to 13- and 14-year-olds who were in school year nine during the 2021-22 academic year had fallen, leaving many young people unprotected from life-threatening diseases. \u201cAll the routine adolescent immunisation programmes have been impacted by the pandemic and coverage is not back up to pre-pandemic levels,\u201d it said. That came after Unicef said the public perception of the importance of vaccines for children declined during the pandemic in 52 out of the 55 countries it studied. The organisation said last week that its research suggested the perception of the importance of vaccines for children declined by more than a third in South Korea, Papua New Guinea, Ghana, Senegal and Japan after the start of the pandemic. And it said that, in most countries, people below the age of 35 were more likely to report less confidence about vaccines for children after the start of the pandemic. On Monday, the UKHSA said uptake of two jabs in particular were cause for concern. Health officials encouraged those eligible to get the teenage Td/IPV booster \u2013 the last routine dose for tetanus, diphtheria and polio, which provides young people with long-lasting protection into adulthood \u2013 and the MenACWY vaccine, which helps protect young people against four types of meningococcal disease. They said the diseases they protected against were \u201crare but serious\u201d and could \u201ccause life-threatening illness leading to hospitalisation, permanent disability and even death\u201d. The UKHSA said: \u201cUptake of the Td/IPV and MenACWY vaccines for children in school year 9 was 69%, around 7% lower than the previous year and well below pre-pandemic levels (87.6% for Td/IPV and 88% for MenACYW in the 2018/19 academic year). The data suggests that the NHS has already caught up many children who missed out on their vaccines, with uptake improving to around 80% for children in year 10.\u201d The health minister Maria Caulfield said: \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important for children to stay up to date with routine vaccinations as this remains one of our best defences against infectious diseases, not just for the person being vaccinated but for their family, friends and those around them.\u201d"

            "content": "Children aged between six months and four years old who are deemed clinically vulnerable will be offered two doses of a Covid vaccine, public health bodies in the UK have announced. The move, revealed by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) after approval by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), comes after the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was approved for children of this age by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in December. Children who are not clinically vulnerable are not included in the UK-wide offer. \u201cFor the vast majority of infants and children, Covid-19 causes only mild symptoms, or sometimes no symptoms,\u201d said Prof Wei Shen Lim, the chair of the JCVI\u2019s Covid-19 committee. \u201cHowever, for a small group of children with pre-existing health conditions it can lead to more serious illness, and for them vaccination is the best way to increase their protection.\u201d According to NHS England, the vaccines will begin to be offered to those eligible in England from mid-June. The body has advised that parents should wait to be contacted before coming forward. UKHSA added that more than 1 million children aged six months to four years in the US had received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine since June. \u201cData from the US showed the most common side-effects reported were similar to those seen with other vaccines given in this age group, such as irritability or crying, sleepiness and fever,\u201d it stated. Dr Mary Ramsay, the head of immunisation at the UKHSA, said the protection offered by the vaccines could be important to children who were at greater risk of severe illness. \u201cThe virus is not going away, so I would encourage all parents to bring their child forward if they are eligible,\u201d she added. The health secretary, Steve Barclay, also noted that children were at very low risk of harm from Covid. \u201cHowever, there are a very small number of children with health conditions which make them particularly vulnerable, and for those children we want to give parents the choice as to whether they wish to vaccinate their at-risk child or not,\u201d he said. Christina Pagel, a professor of operational research at University College London and a member of the Independent Sage group, welcomed the decision but said it should cover the whole age group and not just those with other health conditions. \u201cHospitalisations with Covid are much higher in children under six than they are for children aged six to 17, with over 13,000 admissions in 2022 alone,\u201d she said, adding that intensive care admissions for children under the age of six with Covid were higher when adjusted for population than for any age group under the age of 45. \u201cSix months to under-fives are the least likely to have been previously infected because they are generally born uninfected, and after six months protection from maternal antibodies has mostly waned, so six-month-old babies are facing their first exposure unprotected from either vaccination or previous infection and this risk only increases as they mix more in nurseries or other childcare,\u201d she added. \u201cThe paediatric vaccines work very well to protect against severe outcomes, and they have been shown to be very safe. I think we should offer all parents the choice to protect their infants, toddlers and young children through vaccination before their first Covid infection.\u201d Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said the announcement would come as a relief to families with clinically vulnerable children around the UK, but said the vaccine should be included in pre-school regimens for all children in this age group. \u201cThe paediatric dose vaccines have an excellent safety profile and are known to offer very good protection against severe Covid and, although not long-lasting or 100%, against both transmission and the incidence of long Covid,\u201d he said."

            "content": "Millions of people in England will be offered a Covid booster jab next week, health officials have announced, as recent estimates show infections have climbed to their highest level this year. Care home residents will be the first to receive the spring Covid-19 booster vaccine from Monday, with millions more people invited to book an appointment from Wednesday. About 5 million people will be eligible for a booster until the end of June, including those aged 75 and over and anyone aged five and over who is immunosuppressed. Everyone will be able to book a jab online from 5 April, with the first appointments available from 17 April. Millions of people will be sent their initial invitations through the NHS app, where they can also book their appointment. Text messages and letters will be sent to those without the app or who are not using it regularly. The move comes after official UK estimates of Covid-19 last week showed infections in England had climbed to their highest level so far in 2023. The findings mark the final time regular estimates of coronavirus are being published, as the long-running survey \u2013 described by some as the \u201cenvy of the world\u201d for its success in tracking the virus \u2013 has been halted. Any further monitoring of Covid-19 will be announced after a review to ensure it is cost effective, according to the UK Health Security Agency. An estimated 1.5 million people in private households in England were likely to have had coronavirus in the week ending 13 March, up from 1.3 million in the previous week, according to the Office for National Statistics. It was the highest total for England since the week to 3 January. The NHS director of vaccinations and screening, Steve Russell, said: \u201cAs a society, we are learning to live with Covid but, for many, it is still a virus that can cause serious illness and hospitalisation, and so it is still really important that those at greatest risk come forward and boost their protection in the coming weeks. \u201cThere are still about 8,000 people in hospital with Covid, according to the latest data, and the NHS has now treated more than 1 million Covid inpatients since the pandemic began. \u201cSo if you are over 75 or you have a weakened immune system, please come forward as soon as possible to book a Covid vaccine this spring so you can enjoy summer with peace of mind.\u201d The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has said the booster campaign can include the Pfizer, Moderna, Sanofi/GSK jabs. The Novavax vaccine will be available for use only when alternatives are not considered clinically suitable. Children under 12 will be offered a child formulation of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine."

            "content": "The claim by Moderna\u2019s chief medical officer that vaccines may save millions of lives is misleading and will only fuel the perception that somehow medicine can eliminate death (Cancer and heart disease vaccines \u2018ready by end of the decade\u2019, 7 April). This in turn leads to a disproportionate fear of death and a belief that dying is somehow a failure. There will be instances in which vaccines could prevent young, active people with a good quality of life from developing cancer, which might be welcomed. But cancer is a disease that is much more prevalent in late middle age and in elderly people. In these cases, a vaccine, while preventing someone from dying from cancer, will enable them to live a little bit longer, by which time they will have developed other ailments. They are consigned to living out their latter years while enduring the many debilitating conditions of old age. In a health service that is stretched financially, we need to be much more realistic about what medicine can and cannot achieve. Scarce resources could prioritise adequate staffing levels and preventive measures rather than hugely expensive new technologies (if no one were obese or smoked, cancer rates would also be vastly reduced). A more timely message for the public would be: we all die and sometimes death is a better outcome than the continuation of life. It is sometimes preferable for medicine to stop curing, but never stop caring.

            "date": "2023-04-29T09:00:31Z",
            "content": "The Australian composer and entertainer Tim Minchin sits outside a rehearsal room in London. It is a pleasant day in April. Tooled up on tea and creative adrenaline, talking quickly and well, the 47-year-old is comparing the experience of working on two big stage musicals. In 2010, there was Matilda, the planet-devouring omni-smash, which flourished in the West End, on Broadway and on family car journeys, transforming Minchin from an anarchic musical comedian who could fill a good-sized room at the Edinburgh festival into a feted and wealthy man. \u201cI mean, Matilda, fuck,\u201d is all the loquacious Minchin can say about that show\u2019s successes for now. More interesting to him, because more troubled, was the follow-up, Groundhog Day, a 2016 musical adapted from the popular 90s movie of the same name. \u201cWhen you make something so detailed, over so many thousands of hours, something you think is broadly appealing, about how we\u2019re to be as people \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t fly? That\u2019s incredibly painful,\u201d Minchin says. Dressed today in muted colours, his famous untidy reddish hair tied back under a baseball cap, he lists the little catastrophes that hobbled Groundhog Day seven years ago: investors pulling out; the choreographer falling ill; a feeling of being rushed to New York after a strong London opening, before the show was quite ready. Groundhog Day closed on Broadway in autumn 2017, after 200-odd performances, and has more or less sat in a drawer since. \u201cIt\u2019s not a meritocracy,\u201d Minchin shrugs. \u201cMamma Mia\u2019s one of the highest-selling musicals ever \u2026 Broadway is not a measure of what is good, or not to me. If you want to go there to make your moolah, then you can\u2019t be surprised if you have a rough ride.\u201d Fittingly, given that Groundhog Day is a story about do-overs, Minchin and his collaborators will try to revive their beleaguered musical at the Old Vic in London next month. He is confident things will work out better this time. From inside the rehearsal room, loud enough to boom through a soundproofed door, the new cast of Groundhog Day burst into song. They\u2019re being taught the musical\u2019s opening number. \u201cTomorrow / There will be sun!\u201d goes the line they\u2019re belting out. Minchin tilts his head. Something is bugging him and when I ask what, he notes that the actors are singing \u201ctoo-morrow\u201d instead of \u201cta-morrow\u201d. Minchin lives in Sydney with his wife and two children. He has flown to London for a fortnight of rehearsals, specifically to pepper the Groundhog Day cast with pedantic corrections. \u201cIt has to be \u2018ta-morrow\u2019. Who ever says \u2018too-morrow\u2019?\u201d It is not unusual for artists to contain a combustible blend of high confidence and low self-esteem. In this, Minchin conforms to type: belief by the bucket-load and plenty of doubt. But he was trained on the British comedy circuit. After years in that cauldron, most of what he utters is buried under layers of protective irony. There are micro shifts of tone, eye-widenings, manic grins, flirty pouts, all meant to signal his constantly modulating levels of seriousness. Minchin is aware that some of what he says in interviews comes over badly, his humour sometimes flattened without the accompanying performance. He gives an example. \u201cI could lean forward to you and say: \u2018The trouble with you, Tom, is that you\u2019re clearly a cunt\u2019 \u2026 And you would hear from the juxtaposition of content and intent that I actually like you.\u201d Now write the C-word down. Now put the C-word in a quote in a newspaper. Suddenly it reads differently. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with the internet right now,\u201d Minchin says, bringing up a subject \u2013 what he sees as the shallowness and untruthfulness of progressive politics \u2013 that he\u2019ll return to later. \u201cEverybody clashes up against each other online, pretending irony doesn\u2019t exist. It drives me nuts.\u201d A luckless Groundhog Day publicist emailed Minchin on the morning of our interview, listing what he wasn\u2019t supposed to talk about. Minchin did not take well to that. Just as with the notes he was handed, the previous weekend, when he was invited to go on stage at the Royal Albert Hall and present an Olivier award, Minchin tends to ignore instructions on principle. \u201cMany, many people have put a huge amount of money and time into Groundhog Day. They are invested in making sure I toe the line. But this is my job. Talking about what matters to me is literally my job, whether through art or by the words that come out of my own mouth.\u201d Good to hear, because I want to ask Minchin about something sticky. His musical of Matilda is still running in London after more than 4,000 performances. It was recently made into a movie starring Emma Thompson. Minchin has a long-standing, lucrative relationship with Roald Dahl\u2019s estate, which, latterly, has meant a relationship with Netflix, which bought the rights to Dahl\u2019s work in 2021. That Netflix deal roughly coincided with a move by the children\u2019s publisher Puffin to make textual alterations to new editions of Dahl\u2019s books. Certain words (outmoded, unfashionable, offensive, harmless: it depended on your point of view) were edited out. In the revised Matilda, for instance, Dahl\u2019s rather abrupt use of \u201cfemale\u201d as a noun was replaced with \u201cwoman\u201d. A couple of plot points were tweaked, apparently to align the books more snugly with the 2010 musical and the 2022 movie. After an investigation by the Telegraph, and much public protest, Puffin has decided that two versions of Dahl\u2019s books will have to be published, one altered, one not. What are Minchin\u2019s thoughts on this? \u201cI decided not to wade in,\u201d he says. His diplomacy is so uncharacteristic I simply wait it out. \u201cI think I\u2019m not sure,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very happy sitting in that space.\u201d I wait. \u201cIt seems there\u2019s an incredible slippery slope problem with editing texts. I mean, my initial reaction, when I heard about it? \u2018Now we\u2019ll have to get all the rapes out of all the history books. Then the world will be a better place.\u2019\u201d I wait. \u201cIt\u2019s not actually about morality. It\u2019s about keeping the property, owned by the Dahls and Netflix, contemporary \u2026 It\u2019s an interesting part of modern progressivism, that a huge amount of change is happening because corporations have identified where their bottom-line is best served. \u201cProblem one, as I see it? If you do this once, you\u2019ll have to do it to all texts ever, taking out all the words that might upset people. Problem two? You\u2019ll have to change it all again in five years when the new words you put in are out of vogue. So that\u2019s two slippery-slope problems. You\u2019re standing at the top of a double slide. And now you\u2019re spraying soap on the fucking things.\u201d I wait. \u201cI find it baffling! I\u2019m perplexed by people\u2019s willingness to apply ideas that only work in one direction, as if there aren\u2019t going to be any bad outcomes of this.\u201d I thank Minchin for his honesty, and I ask him whether he would expect to get in trouble with his corporate collaborators for speaking so freely. He winces, as if in real pain that anyone would think so. \u201cNetflix know, and the Dahls know, that I\u2019m not a mouthpiece for them. I may not always say the right things. But I never, ever say what I am told. I don\u2019t owe anyone anything. Personal-me is agitated by the unsustainable idea of changing people\u2019s fiction. But my view about that is only as important about your view about that.\u201d * * * Minchin grew up in Perth on Australia\u2019s west coast, part of a close, socially conservative family. To illustrate his unthreatening middle-class averageness as a boy, he recounts the first two decades of his life at double speed. \u201cMy parents were a stay-at-home mum and a doctor. I went to a boys\u2019 school and I did fine. I played first-team hockey and third-team basketball. I was in the school play. I went to university and I did fine. I didn\u2019t take drugs. I married my first girlfriend. I had a job in a hardware store. Then I happened to get good at \u2026 this thing.\u201d The \u201cthing\u201d was musical comedy. Minchin had initially dreamed of being a rock star, performing through his teens and 20s in covers and original bands at weddings and cabaret shows. Unable to get a record deal, Minchin tried acting, though not much more successfully. In the early 2000s, newly married to Sarah Gardiner, whom he met at university, and living in Melbourne, Minchin auditioned for an Aussie supermarket chain ad. It would have involved dressing up as a till receipt. He didn\u2019t get the role. Shortly after, the Minchins moved to London, where they lived for many years. \u201cWhenever I come back to London now, my agent tells me: \u2018Welcome home.\u2019 I feel like this is where I belong. London is the girl I fell in love with but didn\u2019t marry. London is the first girl who fell in love with me back.\u201d He arrived in the city in 2005, when, he says, it was still just about fashionable to stumble on stage as if having arrived by accident: no costume, no makeup, no production values. Trying to make a name for himself, he showed up at gigs wearing eyeliner, his hair sprayed, and carrying a list of pedantic cues for the stage technician. Drawing on his years playing keyboards, he found that a cabaret-like format suited him. A bit of piano, a bit of ranting, bit of personal oversharing, song for an encore, done. Around 2007, when his daughter Violet was born, Minchin wrote a sentimental ballad called White Wine in the Sun, about atheism and the search for contentment. He started playing it to end his gigs. He often ranted about organised religion from the stage, and audiences seemed to appreciate this softer finale. Minchin was performing in London one night when the director Matthew Warchus came to watch. It was 2009. Warchus was looking for a composer for a germinating Matilda musical. White Wine in the Sun, which often left people in tears, was the clincher. Warchus brought along a collaborator, the playwright Dennis Kelly, to see Minchin, too. Soon the trio were in discussion about how Matilda might work on stage, in song. \u201cI never reread Dahl\u2019s book,\u201d Minchin tells me now, \u201cI never watched the [1996] movie.\u201d Instead, in typical fashion, his opening chat with Warchus and Kelly contained a rant. \u201cIf you get someone else,\u201d Minchin concluded, \u201cdon\u2019t let them fuck this up.\u201d A year later, in 2010, the trio were together at Matilda\u2019s press night in Stratford-upon-Avon, about to get five stars from virtually every critic there, about to begin a flawless run of glory that would include tours, transfers, Tonys and Oliviers. Minchin\u2019s post-interval number When I Grow Up quickly established itself as a musical-theatre all-timer, on a level with Sondheim\u2019s Being Alive or Lerner and Loewe\u2019s On the Street Where You Live \u2013 a song that does almost nothing, plot-wise, but that leaves the audience achy and elated. The popularity of Matilda supercharged Minchin\u2019s performing career, in tandem. He got a part in the TV show Californication and played Judas in a 2012 revival of Jesus Christ: Superstar. After that, Minchin took time off to concentrate on writing. He and Sarah had their second child, Caspar, and moved to Los Angeles, where Minchin signed a deal with DreamWorks to make an animated feature film. Collaborating again with Warchus and other members of the Matilda team, he wrote the music and lyrics for Groundhog Day, which won five-star reviews, another Olivier and moved in 2017 from the Old Vic to Broadway, where it was less fondly received. That year, DreamWorks abruptly cancelled Minchin\u2019s feature film, Larrikins, after the company was bought by Universal, and, in Minchin\u2019s account, made it too costly for another studio to acquire. (He has spoken about being told this high cost was \u201cschmuck insurance\u201d \u2013 the price of not being made to look like a schmuck if another company made it into a hit.) Four years of work, he says, nixed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more affirmed,\u201d Minchin says. \u201cThousands and thousands of messages from people who love my stuff. And I don\u2019t undervalue that. But you just get used to it.\u201d He means, each time a post-Matilda project has stuttered, the lingering glow of Matilda has not afforded much protection. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, oh, your $100m film got shut down? Well you went to Hollywood, mate! It\u2019s not a craft fair over there. Losing a movie is not really grief. But having time taken away from you? You grieve that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt put me in a really negative space, one I had to write my way out of.\u201d The family moved back to Australia. To get over the DreamWorks disappointment, Minchin created a surreal TV show about a pair of misfits, Upright. \u201cI\u2019m gratified by Upright. It\u2019s 8.4 on IMDb. It\u2019s won awards. But fucking no one\u2019s seen it. And that\u2019s a bit sad.\u201d These experiences of damp squibs or flops have taught him that doing the job is what counts; creation, not reception. \u201cIt\u2019s always a bit of an anticlimax to put something new into the world. You\u2019re, like, \u2018It\u2019s done! Everybody liked it! Or nobody liked it! I guess I\u2019ll just keep going?\u2019\u201d Of course, it is easier to keep going when you have the bank of Matilda issuing dividends. The 2022 movie will have made Minchin even wealthier, without him having to do that much more than mutter encouragement to the director, Warchus. Er, I say to Minchin \u2026 can we talk about the Matilda loot? \u201cBrits don\u2019t talk about that, do they? Money?\u201d He smiles. What can he tell me? \u201cI think my retirement\u2019s probably OK. Unless the ideas in Matilda become cancellable. There are some in there! I\u2019ve heard people say that the line \u2018Only you can change your story\u2019 [from the song Naughty] is like blaming the victim. Owning your own fate is untrendy.\u201d Do any of Matilda\u2019s lyrics, written by thirtysomething Tim, make fortysomething Tim wince? \u201cThere are a couple where I think, \u2018Shit! I was playing fast-and-loose there.\u2019 And there are lyrics I\u2019ve changed, for instance the word \u2018midget\u2019. I never thought of that word as a slur. I thought of it as a word for a small thing, a midget submarine, a midget plant \u2026 What you want to do is not hurt anyone. But as an artist \u2013 or as a person in life \u2013 you have to understand that you are going to sometimes hurt people.\u201d The song Revolting Children from Matilda expresses Minchin\u2019s worldview pretty well. His lyrics play on the word revolt: to rebel, and to appal. Minchin is keen on mutiny, even where that means causing offence. In his comedy-cabaret days, he often attacked what he saw as the illogic of religious faith. In 2016, Minchin debuted a song about Cardinal Pell, the late Australian priest who had figured in multiple child sexual abuse scandals. It has been viewed 4m times on YouTube. In all this revolting, Minchin was cheered on by the liberal progressives of his core audience. However, Minchin has found himself out of step with aspects of his own politics. When he speaks about making geographic relocations, he says: \u201cThere\u2019s something fundamentally difficult about not knowing where home is.\u201d I sense he no longer knows where his political home is. And this unnerves him. Time and again as we talk, Minchin returns to the subject of modern progressivism and his gradual unmooring from it. \u201cI keep watching liberals assert stuff. And there\u2019s this backfire effect. There are unintended consequences to the pushing-through of our ideals. \u201cWhat I\u2019m anxious about is that in our attempts to push forward social justice we are losing people. We\u2019re insisting people catch up very quickly. And when they fail to, they find themselves in opposition. If you tell people that they have to come on board very quickly with new ideas of social justice, and you don\u2019t seduce them, if you simply demand it, it doesn\u2019t work. They\u2019re gonna look for another narrative. They\u2019re gonna look for someone who makes them feel all right for not being on board with that shit \u2026 So a Trump comes along, and finds success by saying, \u2018I give you permission to fuck all that off.\u2019\u201d Minchin removes his cap and pushes back his hair. He does this a few times, a gesture of mounting frustration. \u201cWhere I think politics affects my mental health is that I feel gaslit. It feels like everyone\u2019s playacting. On the right, it\u2019s the playacting of pretending you\u2019re not wealthy, the \u2018common man\u2019 stuff, the skullduggery of that. And on the left, it\u2019s the idea that all of us perform this self-protecting brand [of politics] on social media, then go home, have dinner, and roll our eyes \u2026 I\u2019ve been accused of drifting right. But, it\u2019s like, hold on! I\u2019ve spent my entire career criticising illogic. I feel like I\u2019m still doing that, except that the religion I now see a problem with is identity fundamentalism. I feel like that is more damaging than monotheism. I don\u2019t think my values have changed.\u201d Whoever does think their values have changed? From inside our own heads, it always looks as if the scenery is shifting, not us. I sketch out for Minchin my theory about political righteousness. Liberals, long used to the comfortable high of supposing they were on the right side of history, got addicted to that drug, and are now suffering the effects of its withdrawal. Younger liberals might just have cut off their supply. Minchin nods. \u201cPeople under 30 have always been incredibly passionate,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve always been a little bit dumb. Under 30? You\u2019re passionate but you don\u2019t actually know quite enough. Now we\u2019ve made a mode of communication where those people have a huge amount of power, to have people lose their jobs or whatever. And as a 47-year-old, mostly what I see is immaturity with a gun.\u201d Isn\u2019t that what Minchin practised, as a young comedian? \u201cImmaturity with a microphone,\u201d he nods, \u201cyeah.\u201d The Groundhog Day rehearsal has resumed. Morning is about to hit on that fateful Groundhog Day in small-town America. Normal forward progress is about to be disrupted and, to capture this, Minchin has arranged his song so that the cast all get lodged on a note. Instead of singing \u201cIf not tomorrow / Perhaps the day after\u201d, they sing \u201cIf not tomorrow / Perhaps the day aaaaarrrgh\u201d. The final note starts to sound like an anguished howl. Minchin knows he cannot control political winds, not today and not the day aaaaarrrgh either. Watching his kids become young adults, watching them develop passions of their own, has helped him accept this. \u201cWhat my kids have taught me is humility about your control over shit. When my kids were small, I thought they were blank slates, or things to be moulded. In fact, all you do as a parent is bear witness to their emergence. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d His kids are teenagers now. They sometimes get things wrong. Minchin is nearly 50. He sometimes get things wrong, too. He says: \u201cWe try to get things wrong together.\u201d It\u2019s probably the best that any of us can do. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 May 2023. Minchin moved to London in 2005, not 2002 as an earlier version said. \u2022 Groundhog Day is at the Old Vic, London, from 20 May to 12 August."

            "date": "2023-04-20T09:00:42Z",
            "content": "Leaders of specialist NHS mental health trusts are warning that patients will be at risk of self-harm or suicide as a result of next week\u2019s nurses\u2019 strike in England unless an exemption for their staff is agreed. Some areas of mental health nursing were agreed as an exemption in earlier industrial action because psychiatric wards require particularly high levels of staffing. This is to mitigate the risk of patients quickly deteriorating and suddenly requiring one on one supervision, as well as to ensure nurses\u2019 safety. Nurses are also needed to support Mental Health Act assessments, which detain people in hospital involuntarily, or to support those living with severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder outside of hospitals. Sean Duggan, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation\u2019s mental health network, said patient safety would be \u201cput at direct risk\u201d unless the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) agreed a national exemption for its strike on 30 April. The RCN has said previously that unlike earlier industrial action, it will not put in place any derogations, which are exemptions intended to provide safe staffing levels during strike action. \u201cIn particular, high secure and inpatient mental health services, as well as emergency departments, and critical services must be considered as life and limb services and therefore nursing provision must be granted in these areas,\u201d said Duggan. The NHS Confederation said understaffed services, including in high security units, could result in some patients posing a risk to others, as some mental illnesses can result in aggressive or violent behaviour if they are untreated. Last December, before the first round of strikes, the UK\u2019s four chief nursing officers and the NHS Confederation wrote to the RCN calling for specific derogations to some areas of mental health nursing to ensure \u201cparity of esteem\u201d with physical health after exemptions for cancer services and emergency care had already been agreed nationally by the union. The RCN agreed to derogations for mental health, learning disability and autism services across children and adolescent mental health services, as well as the emergency response provided to adults experiencing mental health crises. It is seeking to turn up the pressure on the government after its members voted narrowly to reject an offer of a 5% pay rise this year and a cash payment for last year, and subsequently announced a new round-the-clock strike lasting 48 hours from 8pm on 30 April until 8pm on 2 May. An RCN spokesperson said: \u201cThere will be nurses working those days but we are asking the NHS to run what services it can safely without our members while they take legal action. As part of stepping up the action as nurses decided, we will not be asking any individual to go into work on strike days regardless of their service.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-04-07T06:00:46Z",
            "content": "Bereaved relatives have said an independent inquiry into the death of almost 2,000 mental health patients across NHS trusts in Essex is not \u201cfit for purpose\u201d in the absence of legal powers to compel witnesses to give evidence. The call for a statutory inquiry by 83 families comes after the chair of the review, Dr Geraldine Strathdee, published an open letter saying it would \u201cnot be able to meet its terms of reference with a non-statutory status\u201d. In the same letter she said the inquiry team had written to 14,000 former or current members of staff at Essex Partnership University NHS trust (EPUT) or its successors and only 11 had replied saying they would give oral evidence. The 83 families, represented by Hodge, Jones and Allen (HJA), are refusing to engage with the inquiry, because they believe there can be no accountability for the deaths of loved ones without greater powers, as evidenced by Strathdee\u2019s letter. Allegations include sexual assault against patients, staff taunting or neglect of patients, improper use of restraint, and patients absconding or being discharged with insufficient care in place. HJA says it has evidence of what would appear to be criminal liability. Lisa Wolff, 51, the mother of Abbigail Smith, who killed herself, aged 26, in February 2021, the day after being discharged from the Linden centre, in Chelmsford, said: \u201cThere has to be transparency in these mental health services that are failing. I work in health, I want to welcome the thought that these places can be beacons of hope, that they can be a light in the dark for those people who are like Abbi \u2013 who are troubled, who need support \u2013 and for families to think: \u2018Thank God they\u2019ve gone in, they\u2019re going to get the help they need,\u2019 because right now, we can\u2019t do that. Right now, we\u2019re thinking: \u2018Oh my God, they\u2019ve gone in there. What\u2019s going to happen to them?\u2019\u201d She said less than a fortnight before her release and subsequent death, her daughter, who was first sectioned when she was 15, was downgraded from constant observation by two members of staff to no observation. The inquiry, set up in 2021, was originally investigating 1,500 deaths of highly vulnerable people, including children, either while they were inpatients or within three months of discharge. The number has since risesn to almost 2,000. Alan Oxton\u2019s father, Steve, killed himself, aged 53, at the Lakes mental health hospital in Colchester. He said the inquest found failings with respect to not removing a belt from his father on admission, reducing the frequency that he was checked on by staff, and placing him in a room where a ligature could be suspended. Oxton, who has been on antidepressants since his father\u2019s death, said he believed the staff who had come forward were likely to be those with nothing to hide. \u201cWithout it being a statutory inquiry it\u2019s pointless, and I\u2019ve never engaged [with it]. The [number of] people they\u2019ve got coming forward is so low, it\u2019s pointless and not fit for purpose.\u201d More staff are said to have come forward since a plea by Strathdee but the number has not been revealed. There are also concerns that failings have not been addressed and suicides have continued. Daisy Simpson, 34, who has been under the care of EPUT since 2009, said: \u201cThis is bigger than just one person and the 80 families. There are people on a daily basis that are repeatedly failed and there are no lessons learned. I fear that if I ever ended up back in their inpatient service they would kill me.\u201d The former cabinet ministers John Whittingdale and Priti Patel have called for a statutory inquiry and were among a delegation of six Essex MPs who went to see the health secretary, Steve Barclay, last week to make the case. Whittingdale said Barclay was \u201cvery sympathetic\u201d and the government seemed to be moving from a position where it was \u201cvery reluctant\u201d to make the inquiry statutory, to acceptance that it \u201cmay need to be\u201d. An EPUT spokesperson said: \u201cWe are absolutely committed to learning lessons and improving the care and support offered to those who rely on us in often challenging circumstances. Our sincere apologies go out for the shortfall in care identified here and we continue to fully support the independent inquiry to provide the answers families rightly deserve. We continue to encourage staff to come forward and give evidence as part of this.\u201d The Department of Health and Social Care said the progress of the inquiry was being \u201ccarefully considered\u201d, adding: \u201cIt is disappointing that current and former staff have not engaged to the extent expected nor that the inquiry has been able to access all the information it has requested.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 7 April 2023 to correct Daisy Simpson\u2019s first name."

            "date": "2023-04-16T19:21:22Z",
            "content": "A quarter of a million children in the UK with mental health problems have been denied help by the NHS as it struggles to manage surging case loads against a backdrop of a crisis in child mental health. Some NHS trusts are failing to offer treatment to 60% of those referred by GPs, the research based on freedom of information request responses has found. The research carried out by the House magazine and shared with the Guardian also revealed a postcode lottery, with spending per child four times higher in some parts of the country than others, while average waits for a first appointment vary by trust from 10 days to three years. In 2021-22, trusts were forced to raise the threshold at which they would offer support to tackle backlogs, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of children being turned away or abandoning treatment after long waits. The total represents 32% of all referrals, up from a quarter the previous year, according to the FoI requests sent to 70 UK trusts and boards providing children and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). Previous studies have shown that many of the NHS\u2019s 54 mental health trusts in England have raised the threshold of how ill under-18s have to be before they get treatment, in response to the major and ongoing increase in demand for care, which Covid has exacerbated. That has sparked complaints from the troubled young people affected, their families and GPs who have referred to Camhs that even under-18s who are seriously unwell and have self-harmed or considered suicide are being denied care because they are deemed not ill enough. Mental health services are also struggling with major shortages of psychiatrists and specialist nurses. Former children\u2019s commissioner Anne Longfield said long waits are resulting in only the worst crises being prioritised. She has heard repeated stories of children who had attempted suicide failing to be offered support because they did not meet a threshold of multiple attempts. \u201cFirst there is a judgment of whether they actually meant it,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cthe threshold is so high because the system is buckling. It was struggling pre-Covid but the pandemic poured rocket fuel on it.\u201d Olly Parker, head of external affairs at YoungMinds, said the FoI findings showed a \u201csystem is in total shutdown\u201d with \u201cno clear government plan to rescue it\u201d, after the 10-year mental health plan was scrapped. \u201cIn the meantime, young people are self-harming and attempting suicide as they wait months and even years for help after being referred by doctors,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not children saying \u2018I\u2019m unhappy.\u2019 They are ill, they are desperate and they need urgent help.\u201d Average waiting lists rose by two-thirds over two years in England, meaning children are waiting on average 21 weeks for a first appointment in England, although the figure drops to just three weeks in Wales. Only 12% of the trusts which responded to the FoI have met a four-week government target for first appointments. Almost three-quarters of the English trusts surveyed said they had at least one young person who had been waiting at least a year to be seen, and two-fifths had someone waiting at least two years. The longest wait was 217 weeks, with the average longest wait at all trusts currently 87 weeks across the UK. This has been Roanna Brewer\u2019s experience. She has two children, 15 and 11, who have been diagnosed with ADHD and autism, and have mental health problems including self-harm. She has spent more than four years on a CAMHS waiting list for her son, who is still waiting for his formal ADHD assessment, while her daughter has only been offered online group therapy, which is inappropriate for her. \u201cNo parent wants to do what I\u2019ve done, which is lie on the floor of my child\u2019s bedroom every night because they are so terrified and so anxious. They\u2019ve been traumatised enough,\u201d she said. She has had to take her children out of school due to the lack of support, and despite being a low earner has spent thousands of pounds on private doctors, who have prescribed her children SSRIs. She believes that CAMHS lumps all her daughter\u2019s mental health problems under the umbrella of autism, which has made it hard to get targeted support, despite promises from before the pandemic of a new funded neurodiversity pathway at the trust which would speed up progress through the waiting list. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t seen anyone,\u201d she said. The figures are echoed in a recent report from the children\u2019s commissioner for England, which warned that too many children are being seen in crisis and hospitalised, which earlier intervention could have prevented. Dame Rachel de Souza, the children\u2019s commissioner, said children\u2019s mental health was a \u201ckey pillar\u201d of her work. \u201cI am particularly concerned to see such a surge in demand for help in my recent research. We\u2019re seeing waiting times increase for the first time in years, and evidence of an increasing postcode lottery for children referred for treatment.\u201d She urged the government to roll out mental health support teams in every school by the end of 2025, and for any mental health investment to target children. \u201cIt is vital that this support is available \u2013 without it, too many children may end up in crisis.\u201d Responding to the FoI findings, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re determined to do everything we can to support children and young people with their mental health, no matter their background or location. \u201cSupport in school is vital and that\u2019s why we are increasing the number of school mental health teams to almost 400 by April 2023, providing support to 3 million children and young people. \u201cWe\u2019re also working closely with NHS England to introduce new access and waiting time standards for mental health services, ensuring quicker access to high-quality care across the country.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 4 May 2023.

            "content": "Many people have seen their mental health suffer as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the cost of living crisis. However, accessing help may be difficult, with often long waiting times, and paying for support is out of reach for many people. In the UK more than 8 million people are experiencing an anxiety disorder at any one time. Meanwhile, research by the Health and Safety Executive found that, of the people suffering from a work-related illness in Britain, more than 800,000 were reporting signs of work-related stress, depression or anxiety. Dr Zoe Watson, a GP who runs Wellgood Wellbeing, a social enterprise health platform, believes good mental wellbeing comes down to three basic elements: looking after and connecting to your body, connecting to other humans, and connecting to the world around you, such as nature. Take some gentle exercise Exercise can help clear your thoughts and make you feel more tired at the end of the day, so you should sleep better. Rosaria Barreto is the founder of Vitality Hub, which works with older people with a variety of health conditions. She says: \u201cStimulating your eyes and brain while surrounding yourself with nature\u2019s beauty immediately boosts your mood. Breathing in fresh air can also boost your mood, reduce anxiety and worry. The social element to walking has a significant impact on loneliness and can encourage and promote stronger feelings of self-purpose and self-value.\u201d Check your council\u2019s website or search for \u201cwellness walks\u201d or \u201cwellbeing walks\u201d for groups to join near you. Take exercise a little further If you are a little more adventurous, Watson suggests wild swimming. \u201cIt\u2019s bonkers, life-affirming, joyous and freeing. It shocks you into being aware of your body, and you meet other people who are similarly bonkers along the way. The best bit: it\u2019s no longer only a playground for steely abbed triathletes or hardcore cold-water swimmers. Many are middle-aged, wobbly thighed, potty-mouthed women like me!\u201d Check out groups such as the Bluetits Chill Swimmers. Go out of your comfort zone Nicki Bass, a resilience and leadership coach, runs Resilience at Work. She says: \u201cResilience is the ability to come back from and grow as a result of challenge and adversity. It\u2019s about managing difficult experiences, learning from them and ultimately being able to thrive.\u201d This might be through activities such as surfing but it can also be via everyday adventures \u2013 things as simple as standing barefoot in a stream or taking a new dog-walking route. \u201cThe cumulative effect can be as powerful in building resilience and confidence as the bigger \u2018life-changing ones\u2019\u201d. Check out free NHS guides There are numerous free resources on the NHS website. These range from information on calming breathing exercises for dealing with stress, anxiety and panic, to guides offering help with getting to sleep and sleeping better. Learn new skills Learning new skills could be a hobby, or something you can do as a side hustle. For example, you could take a free trial of Skillshare and choose from thousands of hands-on online courses. This will help boost your self-confidence and sense of purpose while allowing you to connect with other people. Volunteer Watson says: \u201cSometimes the best thing to do when we\u2019re struggling is actually to look outwards instead of inwards. It can reset our brains, help us realise all the things we have to be grateful for.\u201d Volunteering has numerous benefits for health and wellbeing. Creating and sustaining social bonds is essential in tackling loneliness and depression. Explore options that you would enjoy and can contribute to with skills or time. If you have children, see if their school would like volunteers for reading, or join the PTA (parent-teacher association). Visit your local volunteer centre or log on to a site such as Do IT, which is a database of UK volunteering opportunities. You can search more than a million volunteering opportunities by interest, activity or location, then apply online. Sing and dance like no one is listening or watching Paying attention to the moment and being more aware of your body and thoughts is often referred to as mindfulness. Singing and dancing allow you to turn off your stream of consciousness and live in the moment. Sing and dance along to the radio, when cooking or cleaning. Sing in the car or shower, or join a group. Keep talking The psychologist Dr Tara Quinn-Cirillo says: \u201cThere is a huge evidence base for the psychological benefits of talking, including reduced stress, elevated mood, reduced anxiety and more effective problem solving.\u201d She and Shirley Blanch founded the Conversation Starter Project, running free sessions where participants benefit psychologically from talking and walking with others. Similar ways to connect with others can be found via local council wellbeing hubs. Write a journal This can take many forms, from simply writing thoughts down in a diary to a more structured approach such as picking apart a particular challenge you are facing. You can do it on your phone, PC or in a notebook. Ranting also has a place: Watson suggests \u201clet it out\u201d journalling to explore difficult emotions rather than pushing them down, and being grateful for ordinary things, even the negative ones. Those feelings need to be acknowledged and accepted, too. Take some \u2018me time\u2019 Finding \u201cme time\u201d can be easier said than done. Clare Flaxen is a psychotherapist and advises making a conscious choice to laugh every day and stay playful and curious. \u201cSpend time with people who support and inspire you. Identify the things in your life that make you feel happy and content \u2013 eg a nice cuppa and a biscuit with a friend \u2013 and actively choose to bring them into your days.\u201d Do something you enjoy at any time, even while doing the chores. Sarah Birchall says: \u201cEating dark chocolate daily brings me happiness, and listening to comedy podcasts, too.\u201d Wellbeing is an individual phenomenon, so what works for one person won\u2019t for someone else. Try to find what you enjoy and helps you to feel well."

            "title": "Australia\u2019s richest captured 93% of economic growth between 2009 financial crisis and Covid, paper shows",
            "date": "2023-04-11T00:06:14Z",
            "content": "A new paper from the Australia Institute shows 93% of the benefits of economic growth between 2009 and 2019 went to the top 10%, while the bottom 90% received just 7%. The paper shows the share of economic growth going to the top 10% over that period was far higher in Australia than in other developed countries, including the US and Canada. It also showed the phenomenon has been getting worse \u2013 in the postwar period, larger shares of the benefit of economic growth have been going to the top of Australia\u2019s income recipients. Senior economist with the thinktank, Matt Grudnoff, said most Australians would feel \u201cthey are not getting ahead\u201d since the global financial crisis in 2007-09. \u201cIt is really a story about wages and profits,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of us \u2013 90% \u2013 receive income from wages, which have gone backwards in real terms. But profits are doing very well and the ownership concentration on those profits is that 10% who are benefiting.\u201d The Australia Institute believes the stage-three tax cuts, legislated to begin from July next year, will make inequality even worse in Australia. People earning more than $180,000 will see the greatest benefit from the stage-three tax cuts, while low income earners will receive no benefit. The low and middle income tax offset which benefited most Australian workers ended in the last financial year. The Morrison government had designed it to be temporary, whereas the third stage of the tax reform continues in perpetuity. Grundoff said inequality in Australia had been increasing, even before those stage-three tax cuts. His latest paper examined income per adult on a pre-tax basis, which means it shows how incomes are apportioned before the tax-and-transfer system kicks in to redistribute some income to lower income households via welfare and public services. It shows what\u2019s happened to Australian incomes through five distinct economic cycles, from the 1950s up to 2019, with each period starting with a recession or economic crisis and ending just before the next economic disruption (what economists call a \u201cbusiness cycle\u201d). The analysis reveals there has been a complete change in outcomes over those 70 years. In earlier periods, the bottom 90 per cent of income recipients clearly shared the benefits of economic expansion, with higher per adult incomes. Their share has slowly decreased over time, but since the GFC, their share has been dramatically reduced. The first cycle, from 1950 to 1960, shows the bottom 90% of income recipients received the vast bulk of the benefits of economic growth. But by the final cycle, from 2009 to 2019, that phenomenon had reversed. \u201cSuch an outcome has not been the norm over Australia\u2019s post-war history. In all previous expansions, the bottom 90 per cent received at least 50 per cent of the economic growth, on a per adult basis,\u201d the paper found. The thinktank uses data from the World Inequality Database, which was developed by leading international researchers on inequality, including the French economist Thomas Piketty. Inequality has been rising across the globe, driven by a significant rise in income and wealth for households at the top of the distribution. The WID researchers collect their data from national accounts, household surveys, fiscal data, such as taxes on income and wealth, and wealth rankings, to compile their distributional national accounts that show how the incomes of different groups change over time as economies evolve."

            "date": "2023-04-11T06:09:27Z",
            "content": "The fast delivery company MilkRun will close this week and all staff will be made redundant after the much-hyped startup failed in its quest to change the way people receive their groceries. The Australian Financial Review first reported on Tuesday that one of the local pioneers of the ultra-fast delivery model would shut down after its founder, Dany Milham, blamed worsening economic conditions. \u201cI\u2019m writing to let you know that we have made the difficult decision to wind down the business, and as a result, MilkRun will cease trading this Friday,\u201d he said in an email to staff. Milham said that while the business had performed well, market conditions had deteriorated. More than 400 employees will be made redundant. Rapid grocery delivery companies gained popularity around the world during the early pandemic years, with venture capitalists ploughing cash into a sector promising to get groceries to their urban customers often within 10 to 20 minutes. Backed by fleets of either push bikes, electric bicycles or mopeds, the startups are now collapsing in large numbers after funding ran dry in a global economy grappling with high inflation. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Milham, who formerly headed mattress and furniture company Koala, helped secure a $75m investment in the company early last year, which included backing from the billionaire Atlassian founders, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes. MilkRun launched in Sydney before expanding to Melbourne, using a network of warehouses to store groceries near customers. The company began significant job layoffs in February as financial pressures mounted, just months before announcing its plans to shut down entirely. It told staff they would receive their pay entitlements and ongoing support including access to redeployment services. Local rivals Voly and Send closed last year, as have numerous similar businesses in the US and UK. Another popular pandemic-era business sector, fast meal delivery services, has also struggled to create a profitable model, with Deliveroo among those to have closed in Australia. The closure of MilkRun is another indirect casualty of surging inflation that hit many economies last year, prompting central banks to raise interest rates. The rapid increase in borrowing costs prompted many venture capitalists, who finance startups, to preserve cash, giving new companies less time to turn a profit. \u201cSince we announced our structural changes in February, economic and capital market conditions have continued to deteriorate, and while the business has continued to perform well, we feel strongly that this is the right decision in the current environment,\u201d Milham told employees."

            "date": "2023-04-18T15:00:12Z",
            "content": "Almost a third of the globe\u2019s coastal environments rely on kelp to reduce local pollution and sustain fisheries that provide billions of dollars in benefits, according to a new study. But the climate crisis, overfishing, invasions of voracious sea urchins and pollution are putting at risk the world\u2019s kelp forests, threatening the economic benefits they provide and the huge array of species they support. \u201cThey are the forests of the sea,\u201d said Dr Aaron Eger, the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cIf we lose these kelp forests, then we lose the oceans as we know it across massive regions all over the globe.\u201d About 740 million people around the world live within 50km (30 miles) of kelp-dominated marine environments, the study published in Nature Communications said. But the critical role kelp plays in absorbing nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon, and keeping coastal environments healthy had gone underappreciated and understudied, said Eger, a marine ecologist at the University of New South Wales. He led the study alongside 18 other researchers from 10 countries to examine how six common types of kelp provided so-called \u201cservices\u201d that benefit societies. They calculated the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon dioxide being absorbed by kelp forests worldwide and monetary values for each \u2013 the first time a global assessment of the value of kelp forests has been attempted. The world\u2019s kelp forests absorb excess nitrogen and phosphorus running in to oceans from the land, and were likely absorbing the equivalent of about 18m tonnes of CO2 every year. Kelp also offers the building blocks for fisheries of abalone, lobsters and reef fish. Every hectare of kelp forest provides habitat for an average of about 900kg of harvested fish and seafood annually, the study says. Eger said when nitrogen washed into oceans from activities on the land, such as farming and industry, this could promote the rapid growth of microscopic algae that, when it died, depleted the waters of oxygen. But the world\u2019s kelp forests were absorbing vast amounts of nitrogen which, in turn, improved water quality and gave marine life habitats to live. \u201cThis is just a baseline study, so we expect the approximations will get more accurate as the field advances,\u201d Eger said. \u201cThere were also many other services we didn\u2019t assess, including tourism, educational and learning experiences, and kelp as a source of food, so we anticipate the actual value of kelp forests in the world to be higher.\u201d In some areas, including northern Tasmania, Western Australia and northern California, losses of up to 95% of kelp have been recorded. Eger said often the underlying cause of kelp losses was marine heatwaves that killed it off, but overfishing that removed the natural predators of urchins that eat through the forests also contributed. Last month a study found more than 500 Australian reef species had declined in number over the past decade, with many of the losses concentrated along the kelp-dominated rocky reefs in the continent\u2019s southern waters. \u201cThey are taking it from all fronts, but leading those is temperature,\u201d Eger said. \u201cIn most places, we\u2019re looking at slow or precipitous declines of kelp forests. \u201cThe kelp is what\u2019s holding everything together and, if you pull at it like a thread, then you unweave the whole tapestry.\u201d Eger is the founder of the Kelp Forest Alliance \u2013 a not-for-profit group trying to raise awareness of the role of kelp and encourage voluntary pledges for conservation projects around the globe. He said some steps being taken included the physical removal of urchins, improvements in controlling pollution and the replanting of kelp that, under the right conditions, could grow rapidly."

            "title": "US economic growth slows sharply as interest rate hikes kick in",
            "date": "2023-04-27T16:30:22Z",
            "content": "US economic growth slowed sharply in the first quarter of the year, despite strong consumer spending resilient to interest-rate rises designed to tame historic inflation. The latest GDP figures released by the US commerce department show that the world\u2019s largest economy slowed sharply from January through March, to just a 1.1% annual pace as businesses reduced inventories amid a decline in housing investment. The abrupt deceleration from 2.6% growth in the final three months of 2022 and 3.2% from July to September came in significantly under economists\u2019 expectations of a 2% increase. The figures indicate that aggressive interest rises designed to tame inflation are beginning to produce what US central bankers desired \u2013 a slowing economy coupled with reduced wage increases and a tighter job market without tipping it into outright recession. \u201cThe data confirm the message from other indicators that while economic growth is slowing, it isn\u2019t yet collapsing,\u201d said Andrew Hunter, chief US economist at Capital Economics. \u201cNevertheless, with most leading indicators of recession still flashing red and the drag from tighter credit conditions still to feed through, we expect a more marked weakening soon.\u201d Resiliency in consumer spending, which rose 3.7%, reflected gains in goods and services and came as business investment in equipment recorded the biggest drop since the start of the pandemic in 2020 and inventories dropped the most in two years. The Federal Reserve has indicated that while it has slowed the rate of interest rises, it expects commercial lenders, buffeted by the collapse of two regional banks this year, to tighten lending standards. Many economists say the cumulative impact of Fed rate hikes and tighter lending requirements have yet to work their way through the system, presenting central bankers with a dilemma over whether to continue raising rates. \u201cThe last thing the Federal Reserve wants to be doing is raising rates as the economy begins to grind to a halt and potentially exacerbating the situation,\u201d said Marcus Brookes, chief investment officer at Quilter Investors. \u201cThe coveted soft landing is looking increasingly difficult to achieve and we are now getting towards a position where the market may become concerned that stagflation could be a likely possibility.\u201d There is widespread skepticism that the Fed will succeed in averting a recession. An economic model used by the Conference Board, a business research group, puts the probability of a US recession over the next year at 99%. That expectation is compounded by political risk, given congressional Republicans could let the US default on its debts by refusing to raise the statutory limit on what it can borrow. Wider global economic conditions are also in play. Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecast for worldwide economic growth, citing rising interest rates around the world, financial uncertainty and chronic inflation. The IMF chief, Kristalina Georgieva, said global growth would remain about 3% over the next five years: its lowest such forecast since 1990."

            "date": "2023-04-05T16:38:37Z",
            "content": "The Co-operative Group has warned its profits are likely to fall in the year ahead as the food to funerals group expects \u201cturbulent economic headwinds, including inflationary pressures\u201d to continue. While that \u201cvolatile external environment\u201d contributed to an 11% fall in profits at the 160-year-old mutual\u2019s grocery arm, which has more than 2,000 stores, the group said underlying operating profits across the business had remained steady at \u00a3100m. However, pre-tax profits soared to \u00a3247m in the year to 31 December from \u00a357m a year before, thanks to a one-off profit from the sale of its petrol forecourts business to Asda in October and a strong performance by its funerals and legal business. Sales for the group rose 3% to \u00a311.5bn, including a 1.3% increase at its grocery business, where the volume of goods sold slid back as shoppers put fewer items in their baskets because of high price rises on food and other bills and some availability problems for the group as a result of IT glitches in the first part of the year. Profits at the grocery business were affected by a \u00a355m increase in pay and a \u00a337m investment in trying to keep prices down for shoppers. Sales and profits at the group\u2019s funeral and legal businesses rose strongly as the group took market share from rivals amid a death rate that remained higher than historical averages for most of the year. Shirine Khoury-Haq, the chief executive of the Co-op, credited the group with \u201ca robust performance in what has been a difficult and disruptive trading year for many businesses\u201d. Khoury-Haq, who took on the top job in August 2022 after stepping up from her role as finance director, took home \u00a31.5m in pay last year, including \u00a3766,000 in bonuses relating to this year and 2020. The details, revealed in the company\u2019s annual report published on Wednesday, show she could earn up to \u00a32.6m this year if she hits all her targets. The outgoing chief executive, Steve Murrells, meanwhile, took home almost \u00a31.4m pay, despite leaving in May. He received \u00a3375,000 in lieu of notice on top of his basic salary and a share of the 2020 bonus. Khoury-Haq said profits had been underpinned by \u00a3101m in cost savings, including some job cuts at head office last year, while the group cut its debts to \u00a3330m from \u00a3920m after the sale of the forecourts business. She said profits in the year ahead were likely to fall as the group was facing energy costs that were as much as double those in previous years, while labour costs had also increased sharply. \u201cWe, along with many others, fully expect the challenging external conditions to continue throughout 2023. High levels of inflation are predicted to continue until at least mid-year, before beginning to fall, and a recession, both here in the UK and globally, remains a significant possibility,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are committed to doing all we can to shield members, colleagues and customers from this, and other rising costs, as much as we possibly can.\u201d Khoury-Haq said the group was focused on growth for the year ahead but was aiming to achieve this through low-cost means such as more franchise outlets and wholesale business after buying the Nisa group of convenience stores, and doing more online. Online grocery sales rose by 24% last year as the retailer teamed up with specialists, including Deliveroo, to take 15% of the fast-track grocery delivery market. The Co-op said it was now seeking to double its market share. The Co-op also wants to attract 1 million more members, after adding 140,000 in the past year. It was the first increase in five years, and took the total number to 4.27 million members. Khoury-Haq said special offers for members had helped attract younger shoppers. Asked whether the Co-op would consider following John Lewis in looking at opening up to outside investment, she said the group had no plans to do so after cutting its debt last year. \u201cWe have taken action last year so we are well positioned to grow the business,\u201d she said. Allan Leighton, the chair of the Co-op who is to step down in February next year when his nine-year term ends, said: \u201cWe are of course not immune to the stark realities facing all consumer-led businesses, with soaring energy and other inflation-related costs continuing to weigh heavily on short-term expenses and operating profits. \u201cThe actions we have taken already have provided us with the ability to weather this over the short-term and to capitalise more fully over the longer term.\u201d The Co-op said it had already begun searching for a successor to Leighton and several other board members who are due to step down in the next year."

            "date": "2023-04-24T08:38:32Z",
            "content": "The first company launched under Rishi Sunak\u2019s newly relaxed rules to attract special purpose acquisition companies to London after Brexit has said it will shut down, without finding a suitable merger target. Hambro Perks Acquisition Company said in a statement to the stock market on Monday that it had ceased all operations except for the purposes of winding up the company and returning money to shareholders. Sir Anthony Salz, the chair of the tech investment company, blamed \u201cchallenging circumstances\u201d for stock market listings. Special purpose acquisition companies (Spacs) are cash shell companies that raise money to list on a stock exchange \u2013 often with celebrity sponsors \u2013 before finding a target in need of funding and merging with them. They offer an easier route for companies to list on the stock market without going through much of the difficult standard listing process. Spacs became a phenomenon in the two years after the first coronavirus lockdowns, amid a global investment frenzy. They were mostly associated with US markets, where a deluge of listings raised billions of dollars, including for prominent UK-based companies, such as the now struggling automotive startup Arrival and the car dealer Cazoo. Many of those listings ended with investors losing large sums of money, leading to a sharp decline in the number of Spacs in the past year. As Boris Johnson\u2019s chancellor, Sunak ordered an urgent review to help London catch up and attract new stock market listings. A key aim of that review was \u201cliberalising the rules\u201d regarding Spacs. He asked for \u201cbold ideas\u201d to revive the fortunes of the London Stock Exchange, which has seen a dearth of new listings and regular flurries of takeovers by foreign investors. Announcing the liberalisation, Sunak said: \u201cThe UK is one of the best places in the world to start, grow and list a business \u2013 and we\u2019re determined to enhance this reputation now we\u2019ve left the EU.\u201d In the autumn of 2021 Hambro Perks said it had raised \u00a3143.5m from the stock market to find an investment target, slightly shy of the \u00a3150m it had hoped for. However, Salz said the company would probably be unable to find a suitable target for acquisition before the end of a two-year deadline in November, after talks fell through this year with the drug developer Istesso. Closing it was a \u201cdifficult decision\u201d, he said. \u201cPublic equity markets have faced challenging circumstances in the past year, and several new listings have suffered. We have had discussions with some excellent companies, but given the current market conditions, we have concluded that there is little likelihood of achieving a successful business combination within our permitted timeframe.\u201d Hambro Perks, the investor that was a sponsor of the Spac, has had its own difficulties: its co-founder Dominic Perks, who was involved in finding a target for a merger, resigned last week for undisclosed reasons."

The triplex used by Succession\u2019s Kendall Roy, played by Jeremy Strong, in HBO\u2019s hit series is up for sale with a price tag befitting the Roy dynasty. The three-story apartment penthouse complex of 180 East 88th Street was featured in the latest season of the show and clocks in at 5,508 sq ft. It features five bedrooms and four bathrooms with floor-to-ceiling windows and panoramic skyline and Central Park views, a huge spiral staircase and a private elevator. If that is not enough space, the unit comes with 3,500 sq ft of outdoor space \u2013 practically a private park in Manhattan, where the average apartment is 740 sq ft. A bulk of that is the penthouse\u2019s 2,100 sq ft rooftop terrace that overlooks the city. The 50-story building was completed in 2021 and is the tallest north of East 72nd Street, making it one of the tallest in the Upper East Side. Most apartments in the building have sold for well over a million dollars, with the cheapest \u2013 studios between 600 and 750 sq ft \u2013 being listed for over a million. Building amenities include a basketball court, playroom and a catering kitchen. If you have a little more pocket change to spend, the apartment of Kendall\u2019s brother Roman Roy, played by Kieran Culkin, is on the market for $38m. The two-story complex is the penthouse unit for 200 Amsterdam Avenue, a building on the Upper West Side. Residents of the neighborhood sued building developers over the building\u2019s height, which stands at 52 stories, making it the tallest building in the neighborhood. A judge ruled that 20 stories would need to be shaved off the building, but an appeals court overruled the decision and allowed sales of units to commence. Other swanky pads featured in Succession have also hit the market in recent years. The 6,711 sq ft apartment of Kendall Roy\u2019s ex-wife, Rava, played by Natalie Gold, was put up for sale in 2021 for $23.3m. A huge Hamptons complex featured in the show\u2019s third season as the home of billionaire investor Josh Aaronson, played by Adrien Brody, was sold for $45m in 2021. While the net worth of the Roy family has never been explicitly mentioned in the film, Forbes has estimated that Logan Roy\u2019s net worth would be $18bn, which would have made him close to the 100th wealthiest person in the world."

            "date": "2023-04-07T13:38:36Z",
            "content": "The US added 236,000 jobs in March, a sign of gradual weakening in the labor market as the effects of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increases start to be seen in the economy. Friday\u2019s closely watched jobs report provides data that will heavily influence the Fed\u2019s decision to either halt or continue interest rate hikes at its next board meeting in early May. The non-farm payrolls data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 (BLS) suggested a slowdown in the jobs market in the world\u2019s largest economy last month, after an upwardly revised 326,000 jobs were added in February and 504,000 in January. The March number was also 3,000 lower than the 239,000 forecast by economists. The unemployment rate dropped 0.1% to 3.5%. Fewer jobs were added to the leisure and hospitality and healthcare sectors than in previous months, though the industries are still trending up in job availability. Government and professional and business services continued to grow at a similar paces to previous months. \u201cThe 236,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in March adds to the evidence that the economy\u2019s strong start to the year was partly weather related, with momentum fading again,\u201d said Andrew Hunter, deputy chief US economist at Capital Economics. \u201cWith the sharp fall in job openings and upward trend in jobless claims also pointing to cooling labor demand, and the drag from the recent banking turmoil still to feed through, we expect jobs growth to slow more sharply soon.\u201d Ahead of the government\u2019s job survey other reports gave hints that the labor market, while still growing, is cooling from highs seen over the last two years. BLS\u2019s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey last week showed that employers are starting to slow the pace of hiring. There were less than 10m active job openings by the end of February for the first time in nearly two years. Payroll company ADP released its national employment report on Wednesday, showing that private employers added 145,000 jobs in March \u2013 down from the 261,000 jobs in the private sector added in February. Meanwhile, a report released Thursday from outplacement consultant firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas showed an uptick in job cuts in March. Last month, US-based employers cut 89,703 jobs \u2013 a 15% increase compared with the 77,770 cuts that were seen in February. The losses were predominantly seen in the tech sector, which saw mass layoffs after companies over-hired during the pandemic, followed by the job cuts in the financial sector. Ahead of Friday\u2019s report, stock markets \u2013 which are closed on Friday in observance of Good Friday \u2013 wavered on Thursday\u2019s as investors showed ambivalence over the incoming report and what it could mean for interest rates. The Fed will have to weigh the latest job report against incoming inflation news as it decides whether or not to hike interest rates again. Inflation reached a 40-year high last year and while it is declining, it remains stubbornly high. The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has consistently said getting prices under control is the central bank\u2019s top priority. Despite the banking crisis caused by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the Fed went ahead and increased interest rates by a quarter point last month, bringing rates to 4.75% to 5% \u2013 its ninth consecutive raise and the highest since 2007. When discussing the Fed\u2019s decision to increase rates, Powell cited economic data from January, including the jobs report, that showed the economy was not slowing down as much as the Fed would like. Powell acknowledged the banking crisis\u2019s effect on the broader economy, but remained adamant on the Fed\u2019s goal to bring inflation down to 2%. Inflation in February slowed to 6%, but Powell said the rate is still far from their goal. March\u2019s inflation figures will be released on 12 April. Some economists have criticised Powell for taking such a stringent approach to lowering inflation, saying that being too hawkish could push the economy toward a recession. \u201cThe effects of the Federal Reserve\u2019s unrelenting rate hikes are apparent: job growth is slowing and unemployment insurance claims are up, now breaking 200,000 a week,\u201d said Chris Becker, senior economist at Groundwork Collaborative. \u201cBut the labor market is the wrong target for the Fed because workers and their wages have not driven inflation \u2013 supply disruptions and corporate profits have. Additional rate hikes will only edge us closer to a painful, avoidable recession.\u201d Still, Powell has continued to reiterate that lowering inflation is the Fed\u2019s priority, and that recent coolings have not been enough. \u201cInflation remains too high, and the labor market continues to be very tight,\u201d Powell said at a press conference 22 March, after the latest quarter-point increase. \u201cMy colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal.\u201d"

            "title": "High costs and uncertainties cast a chill over Britain\u2019s  heat pump market",
            "date": "2023-04-15T16:00:46Z",
            "content": "Cutting carbon emissions in the home is a key part of the UK\u2019s drive to meet net zero climate targets and one of the most promising alternatives to a domestic gas boiler is a heat pump, which uses electricity to channel warmth from the ground or the air into the home. Yet although heat pumps can transform 1 kilowatt of green electricity into 3kW-worth of heat, their benefits have been overshadowed by concerns about cost, and uptake has been low. The government\u2019s aim is to have 600,000 heat pumps a year being installed by 2028. But only 55,000 were fitted in 2021, while 1.5m gas boilers were installed. A \u00a3450m scheme offering grants of \u00a35,000 towards the cost of a heat pump was launched last May to a tepid response. Figures released last week by Ofgem show that by the end of March the scheme had only managed to give out slightly more than a third of the grants available for the financial year. It issued just 11,996 vouchers out of the 30,000 available, of which 9,981 were redeemed \u2013 equivalent to \u00a350.16m of the \u00a3150m of grants on offer annually for the next three years. So why has the UK\u2019s home decarbonisation strategy gone cold and what can be done to restart it? The blame for the \u201cdisappointingly low\u201d take-up lies mostly with the government, according to a recent parliamentary report. In a letter to ministers, the House of Lords environment and climate change committee said public awareness of low-carbon heating systems was \u201cvery limited\u201d and promotion of the scheme had been \u201cinadequate\u201d. A shortage of installers and \u201cinsufficient independent advice\u201d were also hindering take-up, the committee said. Then there is the issue of cost. Even with a \u00a35,000 grant, households still need to pay the balance of the upfront cost of installing a pump, which is on a par with many new boilers and can be too great for households to bear. The technology works best in homes which are well insulated and warmed by wide radiators. This is true of boilers too, but a heat pump is less able to mask an inefficient heating system, meaning extra upgrades costing thousands of pounds may be required before installing the pump itself. The government\u2019s plans to improve energy efficiency and insulation have also been sluggish and widely criticised. Britain sold the fewest heat pumps relative to population size in Europe last year, according to the European Heat Pump Association. Such resistance runs decades deeper than recent concerns over costs and logistics, according to Dave Sowden of energy consultancy Gemserv. \u201cThe reason the UK is different from the rest of Europe is that it has got the most dense penetration of the gas network of all European countries and, with that, easy access to gas for heating and cooking,\u201d he says. \u201cBoilers have become really popular in the UK and that is what people have got used to. There is a fear of the unknown, and some of that fear is unfounded.\u201d Britain\u2019s earliest central heating boilers, installed between the 1960s and 1980s, typically ran at very high temperatures. This has set up an expectation that a well functioning heating system should be able to deliver strong blasts of heat on demand, Sowden says. By contrast, a heat pump gently maintains the ambient temperature of a room by using more efficient, lower-temperature top-ups through the day. \u201cPeople think a heating system isn\u2019t \u2018on\u2019 if they touch a radiator and it doesn\u2019t burn their hand,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t need to be belting out heat to keep a room at a comfortable temperature.\u201d In fact, by running at lower temperatures with more consistency, a heat pump is able to be more efficient and help save households money over its lifetime. \u201cThinking about the lifetime cost is well understood when we\u2019re talking about cars but it\u2019s not so well understood for heating systems,\u201d Sowden adds. Things may be beginning to change. Jan Rosenow, a director at the Regulatory Assistance Project, an energy thinktank, believes a planned tweak to energy levies could make all the difference. The government plans to shift the collection of green levies from electricity bills to gas bills, which could tip the balance in favour of heat pumps by making relying on gas more expensive. \u201cGovernment has announced a review of how levies are attributed to electricity versus gas bills and will put forward reforms later in the year,\u201d he says. \u201cThis will help drive heat pump uptake.\u201d Already, Octopus Energy claims to have a waiting list of about 50,000 households interested in having a pump installed. The energy company is training up hundreds of installers at UK bases to help meet demand, and has invested in a Northern Ireland based heat pump manufacturer, Renewable Energy Devices, to produce around 1,000 pumps every month. \u201cThe government\u2019s boiler upgrade scheme has catalysed massive growth in the market,\u201d according to Clementine Cowton, Octopus\u2019s director of external affairs. \u201cIn terms of total numbers, the UK still lags the rest of Europe but the take-up is becoming much faster.\u201d She expects heat pump installations to benefit from the \u201cvirtuous circle of scale and demand\u201d that has helped to drive down the cost of gas boilers in the past. As more heat pumps are installed, the costs will fall, she says, and as costs begin to fall, more households will opt to install a heat pump. A price war could quicken the pace. Octopus\u2019s biggest rival in this respect is British Gas, the UK\u2019s largest energy supplier, which has offered a starting price for installation of \u00a32,999 \u2013 taking into account the \u00a35,000 grant \u2013 or \u00a31 less than Octopus\u2019s cheapest deal. Octopus says it has since installed heat pumps for as little as \u00a32,300, including the government grant, although a typical household pays between \u00a33,000 and \u00a34,000 depending on how powerful a heat pump is required. \u201cThe idea is that eventually we stop needing a grant altogether. Soon buying and running a heat pump will be cheaper than a gas boiler \u2013 without a subsidy,\u201d says Cowton."

            "date": "2023-04-05T14:42:55Z",
            "content": "Drought, conflict and famine have racked Somalia, but there has been very little international coverage of its plight recently. I visited last November, hoping to draw attention to the humanitarian crisis facing its people, and document not just their struggles but also their resilience. I spent some time exploring the consequences of drought, the struggle of refugees and the problem of overwhelmed hospitals. But the sadness of those stories needed a counterweight. In Mogadishu, the capital, I found positive stories. This is Hamar Weyne fish market, an important hub near the centre. I was amazed at its vibrancy. Hundreds of fishermen depend on the market to sell their catch: tuna, swordfish and the like, caught off the coast. It was full of energy, colour and people. Everyone was pushing through crowds, some struggling to carry these massive tuna out of the market. After documenting so much tragedy in the country, the market felt like a beacon of hope \u2013 a testament to the strength of people whose ordinary lives went on. Taking photos there wasn\u2019t easy, though. Stand still for too long and you would get whacked by a fin or a tail, or barged out of the way by busy shoppers. Moving through it, you had to watch you didn\u2019t trip over a giant tuna or put your foot in a pile of fish guts. I was struck by this woman the moment I saw her. There was such dignity in the way she moved, tiptoeing with grace amid the chaos. The vibrancy of the yellow against the darkness of the fish guts made her look like a kind of noblewoman going about her duties. I\u2019m always searching for moments of serendipity \u2013 when the light falls a certain way, or a movement can be perfectly captured. This was one of those times. I had maybe a second or two. Then, as soon as I took it, she was gone. Looking at it on my return, I felt as if it had captured something of Somalia\u2019s beauty and, unfortunately, some of its bloodshed. But, more than anything, it represented the resilience of its people. I\u2019m no stranger to challenging environments. I\u2019ve worked in Chad, South Sudan, Afghanistan and gang-controlled communities in Haiti and El Salvador. I\u2019ve witnessed the impact of poverty and conflict. But Somalia was different. There was something so acute about its suffering, the combination of crises it faces. I found it hard to shake. Going to Somalia is not a trivial thing. Security considerations are extensive, and nothing is guaranteed. You can plan as much as you want but everything can change in an instant. On the day I took this, there was an attack on a hotel not dissimilar to mine. A month before, a double car bombing shook the city. Insecurity is a fact of life for many. It gets hairy very quickly. Somalia\u2019s struggles are not likely to ease in the short term. According to some calculations, it is the world\u2019s second most vulnerable country to the climate crisis. The three million or so internally displaced persons are testament to its effects in the here and now. Only action, domestic and international, will change that. Tariq Zaidi\u2019s CV Born: Karachi, Pakistan. Trained: Self-taught. Influences: \u201cJames Nachtwey, Susan Meiselas, Martin Parr, Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado, John Stanmeyer.\u201d High point: \u201cI worked alongside remarkable Salvadorans for more than three years to document the effects of MS-13 and Barrio 18 gangs in El Salvador. Their powerful stories served as the basis for my second book, Sin Salida, which portrays the realities of life in a society controlled by violent gangs. The incredible support and courage they displayed throughout this project was inspiring.\u201d Low point: \u201cSince travelling is a crucial aspect of my work, I found the Covid lockdowns quite challenging.

            "title": "How can the UK tackle double-digit inflation?",
            "date": "2023-04-21T05:00:05Z",
            "content": "Inflation has remained stubbornly high in the UK, with the latest data released this week showing it dropped only slightly in March, staying above 10% for the eighth time in the past nine months. The government has so far mostly relied on the Bank of England to try to return the annual rate of price rises to its 2% target, something it has clearly failed to do. So what are the options for a country coping with double-digit inflation? Raising interest rates This is the Bank\u2019s main method of tackling the problem, and its monetary policy committee (MPC) has already raised the base rate 11 times since December 2021 \u2013 it now stands at 4.25%. Yet during that time the annual inflation rate has nearly doubled, from 5.4% to its current level. The logic behind such moves is that higher rates make it more expensive to borrow money and encourage saving and lower spending, therefore discouraging price rises. Yet they are indiscriminate, hitting everyone who borrows, not just the better off. Critics such as the former MPC member Danny Blanchflower have argued that the current inflation is down to supply and energy shocks after the pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, so dampening consumer spending is the wrong response. Regardless, money markets predict it is nearly a certainty that a majority of the MPC will take the view when they meet on 11 May that high inflation means interest rates are not high enough, and will push the base measure to 4.5% and possibly as high as 5% by the end of the year. Lower interest rates Turkey has taken a more a controversial and unorthodox approach \u2013 with unpromising results. Its president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, ordered the country\u2019s central bank to lower its rates in response to rocketing prices. The failure of this policy appeared obvious when inflation topped 85% in October 2022. Erdo\u011fan goes into an election next month championing inflation at 50%, but that still leaves prices rising at one of the fastest rates in the world. Price controls France has taken a more successful tack, with Emmanuel Macron capping how much the French state energy companies could charge their customers last January, giving them subsidies to fill the financial hole. The controls were lifted in January this year when gas and electricity prices began to fall steeply. It meant inflation in France was almost half the rate seen in the UK throughout 2022. Such measures are far from new: the economist John Kenneth Galbraith designed price controls for the Roosevelt administration during the second world war, which were supported by many of the most famous financial minds of the time. Perhaps the UK could target producers and retailers with price controls to try to lower the food inflation rate, which hit a 46-year high of 19.1% in March, sending a signal to other industries that they should refrain from large increases themselves. However, it would be difficult to monitor prices and impose caps in the internet age. Wage controls The labour market is not what it was when Britain last experienced huge price surges, in the 1970s. Unions were powerful then and demanded pay rises to compensate for the rising cost of living. In 1975, when inflation hit 25%, wage rates for manual workers jumped at an annual rate of 31.7% while average earnings for all employees rose by about 28% a year. A year later, to prevent a repeat, the then prime minister, Labour\u2019s Harold Wilson, called on unions to cap wage demands. By 1977 the deal was beginning to fall apart, and in early 1979 a series of strikes led to a \u201cwinter of discontent\u201d. The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, has argued that workers asking for real-terms salary increases risk repeating the mistakes of that decade, embedding inflation in a wage-price spiral. However, despite the recent round of pay rises amid labour shortages and industrial action across the public sector, few of the recent pay settlements match the current double-digit headline inflation rate, never mind exceed it. Higher taxes While the Bank is trying to use rates to crush consumer spending, there are millions of people in Britain who have saved or made large amounts of money during the period of Covid restrictions who are now looking to go out and spend it. Estimates put the level of \u201cpandemic savings\u201d at between \u00a3200bn and \u00a3250bn. While much of it has already been spent, many analysts believe a significant amount remains. A \u201cwindfall\u201d tax on incomes or wealth of the better off might be justified on the grounds of wealth redistribution and reducing the risk of this spending pushing prices even higher. A \u2018rip-off Britain\u2019 campaign There is a growing argument that corporate profits have played a large part in rising prices, with accusations that companies have pushed up prices to maintain their profit margins, a phenomenon nicknamed \u201cgreedflation\u201d. Paul Donovan, the chief economist at UBS Wealth Management, said this month that a social media campaign led by the heads of the US and eurozone central banks would kill such profiteering stone dead. He cites a 43% increase in milk prices when \u201cfactory gate\u201d prices only increased by 33%. \u201cWhat is somewhat different in this profit-led inflation episode is the potential of social media to amplify those forms of resistance,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIf only Fed chair [Jerome] Powell and ECB president [Christine] Lagarde would collaborate on a TikTok dance routine about profit-led inflation, it could all be over.\u201d"

            "content": "The UK\u2019s unemployment rate has edged higher and pay growth continues to lag well behind high inflation, according to the latest official data highlighting the dilemma faced by the Bank of England. Reflecting softer conditions in the jobs market as Britain\u2019s economy struggles for growth momentum, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 3.8% from 3.7%, the Office for National Statistics figures showed. The number of job vacancies also fell for a ninth consecutive month, although it remained high at more than 1.1m as companies struggle to recruit staff. The Office for National Statistics said annual growth in average pay, excluding bonuses, held steady at 6.6% in the three months to February despite a small rise in unemployment and decline in the number of job vacancies. Fuelled by bumper pay for bankers and accountants in the City of London, wage growth including bonuses rose by 5.9%. Economists had forecast weaker rates of pay growth, in a potential dilemma for the Bank of England as it considers whether to raise interest rates for a 12th consecutive time in May. However, the ONS said total pay fell by 4.1% on the year after taking inflation into account \u2013 among the largest falls since 2009. Official figures for March are expected to show on Wednesday that headline inflation fell to 9.8% from 10.4% in February. However, that would still leave the cost of living well above the Bank\u2019s 2% target, and well ahead of wage growth. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cWhile unemployment remains close to historic lows, rising prices continue to eat into pay cheques which is why halving inflation this year is one of our top economic priorities.\u201d The latest snapshot showed a rise in the number of working days lost to strikes in February amid action by civil service staff and teachers, with 348,000 working days lost during the month. Average wage growth in the public sector picked up to 5.3% on the year, the fastest annual rate since 2005, contributing to the narrowest gap with the private sector since 2021. Pay in the public sector had fallen behind by the most on record. Private sector wage growth slowed for a third consecutive month to 6.9%, still significantly ahead of the public sector. Paul Nowak, the TUC general secretary, said the figures showed workers were suffering the longest wages slump in modern history. Calling on ministers to resolve pay disputes, he said: \u201cHard-pressed families can\u2019t take much more. It is no surprise that workers are having to take strike action to defend their living standards.\u201d In a mixed update from the jobs market, the latest figures showed an increase in the size of the workforce as more young people left full-time education to find a job, helping to cut the UK\u2019s rate of economic inactivity \u2013 when working-age adults are neither in a job or looking for one \u2013 by 0.4 percentage points. Britain has lagged behind almost every other advanced economy in the world for increasing workforce participation since the Covid pandemic, making it one of the government\u2019s top priorities as companies struggle to recruit staff. However, long-term sickness rose to a fresh record high of 2.7 million among those still economically inactive, continuing an increase since the Covid pandemic that some economists have attributed to record NHS waiting lists and years of public sector funding cuts. Economists said stronger than expected pay growth, before inflation was taken into account, could add pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates from the current level of 4.25% when its monetary policy committee next meets on 11 May. The central bank is closely watching pay growth amid concerns that a tight jobs market could fuel persistently high levels of inflation. Official inflation figures for March, due to be published on Wednesday, are expected to show the annual rate cooling to below 10% for the first time in six months. Ashley Webb, a UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe labour market became a bit less tight in February and wage growth continued to ease, albeit slowly. \u201cThat leaves the Bank of England with a tough call on whether to raise interest rates further.\u201d"

            "content": "Victory is delayed. Inflation had been expected to fall below 10% but there was a shock on Wednesday morning when that didn\u2019t happen, after the annual growth in food and nonalcoholic beverage prices unexpectedly jumped in March to its highest level since 1977. Fresh fish, cooking oil and biscuits all rose in price to push up the overall annual increase in food bills from 18% in February to 19.1% in March. Inflation is still on track to halve by the end of the year \u2013 allowing ministers to boast of its near defeat \u2013 because the full effect of a drop in wholesale gas prices has yet to feed through into the overall rate. Along the same lines, policymakers at the Bank of England are expected to say when they meet next month that inflation remains on course to slide below its 2% target next year. However, City economists agree that while inflation is now back on a downward trajectory \u2013 dipping to 10.1% in March after a surprise rise to 10.4% the previous month \u2013 there is a 97% chance the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) will increase interest rates one more time in May. The MPC is likely to be unmoved by the plight of mortgage payers when a majority of its nine members vote for an increase of 0.25 percentage point in the base rate to 4.5%. If they are to come close to eventually achieving their target of annual prices growth of 2%, the rate-setting committee believes its only recourse must be to increase borrowing costs and further dampen consumer spending. Only then does it expect shops to begin to restrict price increases. There is another factor weighing on the MPC \u2013 the ugly comparison with inflation among the UK\u2019s main competitors. In the eurozone it stands at 6.9% and only 5% in the US. Kitty Ussher, the chief economist at the Institute of Directors said these trends meant \u201cthe Bank of England\u2019s job is not yet done\u201d, highlighting issues with core inflation \u2013 a measure that strips out volatile elements such as fuel and food prices, which has become the focus of the MPC\u2019s concerns in recent months. \u201cWhile it is a relief that the headline rate of inflation is now pointing downwards again \u2026 the improvement this month is predominantly due to falling transport prices which, although welcome, hides an underlying stickiness in core inflation, which at 6.2% has not yet started to fall,\u201d she said. Why then are prices still rising at such a high rate? The head of the Unite union, Sharon Graham, is certain the cause is price gouging by big companies keen to pass on all the rise in costs they face and then some. Paul Donovan, the chief economist at UBS wealth management, endorses the view that corporate greed plays a part, although he says the latest inflationary pressures emanate from convenience stores as much as the supermarkets. Wheat prices cannot explain the soaring cost of bread. Like most commodities, they have fallen back dramatically from last year\u2019s peaks. So maybe it is the level of wages \u2013 which on average accounts for about 70% of a firm\u2019s costs \u2013 that is behind the relentless increases in shop prices. But annual private sector earnings growth is running at just under 7%. Although that is a historically high level, it is not enough to determine the current level of price rises. Although markets believe it is almost certain the MPC will raise rates on 11 May, the director of economics at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, Suren Thiru, is not so sure. He suggests the potential damage a further interest rate rise would inflict could lead to a bigger split in the MPC vote, leaving the outcome uncertain. Last time, two MPC members voted to keep rates on hold. Next time more could join their ranks. However, anything but a rise would seem to be an unlikely scenario, albeit one that borrowers will be praying for."

            "content": "Britain\u2019s annual inflation rate is poised to fall below 10% for the first time since last August when the latest official figures for the cost of living are released on Wednesday. A sharp fall in energy prices is thought likely to have dragged down the government\u2019s preferred measure of inflation from 10.4% in February to 9.8% in March, according to a poll of economists conducted by Reuters. The Bank of England, which is responsible for hitting the official 2% inflation target, believes there will be further falls over the coming months as the impact fades of last year\u2019s invasion of Ukraine by Russia. The consumer prices index rose by 1.1% in March alone last year, followed by a further 2.5% increase in April, but the price of gas on global wholesale markets is now lower than it was before the war began on 24 February 2022. Threadneedle Street interest-rate setters on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee are, however, concerned that core inflation \u2013 which excludes items such as food and energy \u2013 will prove harder to bring down than the headline rate. While MPC members do not have a target for core inflation, they see it as a proxy for price pressures generated by the domestic economy. On this measure, the annual cost of living rose from 5.8% to 6.2% in March. Headline inflation was expected to drop below 10% when the February figures were released last month but instead rose from 10.1% to 10.4% as a result of the biggest increase in food prices in 45 years. The former MPC member Andrew Sentance said on Tuesday the Bank was itself partly responsible for double-digit inflation by continuing with its money creation programme \u2013 quantitative easing \u2013 for too long. He told MPs on the Treasury committee: \u201cWe had this long period of extremely low interest rates and further injections of QE after the immediate problems and the financial crisis have passed. That all, I think, has contributed over a period of time to the inflationary pressures that we\u2019re now seeing.\u201d Even if the economists\u2019 prediction proves accurate, UK inflation will remain markedly higher than in the US and the eurozone, where it currently stands at 5% and 6.9% respectively."

            "content": "The eurozone has defied predictions that the Ukraine war would plunge it into recession after a warm winter blunted the impact of higher energy prices. Data from Eurostat \u2013 the EU\u2019s statistical agency \u2013 showed that growth in the 20 countries using the single currency stood at 0.1% in the first three months of 2023. The small overall increase disguised a wide variation across member states. The eurozone\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, stagnated in the first quarter of 2023 after contracting by 0.5% in the final three months of 2022. Italy and Spain, the third and fourth-biggest eurozone economies, performed better than the markets had been expecting, each posting quarterly growth of 0.5%. France grew by 0.2%. However, analysts said growth prospects were likely to remain weak because of the determination of the European Central Bank (ECB) to combat strong underlying inflationary pressures with higher interest rates. Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe very small increase in GDP in the first quarter means a technical recession has been avoided by a whisker. \u201cHowever, the economy has essentially stalled as domestic demand has been hit hard by the energy shock followed by monetary tightening. We think activity will remain weak in the coming quarters.\u201d The small increase in growth in early 2023 followed a flat picture in the final three months of 2022 and reduced the year-on-year increase in output from 1.8% to 1.3%. Even though the eurozone economy has been flatlining for the past six months, its success in staving off a severe downturn has surprised economists, who this time last year were predicting a severe recession. Carsten Brzeski, the global head of macro at ING bank, said: \u201cMore resilient than expected is clearly one label to put on the eurozone\u2019s economic performance. In fact, the eurozone economy has now been able to avoid what a few months ago was probably the best predicted recession ever. \u201cThe warmer winter weather, lower wholesale energy prices, the reopening of China and fiscal stimulus are the key drivers behind this better-than-expected performance.\u201d Neil Birrell, the chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors, said: \u201cThe eurozone economy has been resilient in the face of energy price increases and rate hikes over the past few months, and while growth is slowing, this remained the case in the first quarter. \u201cHowever, we are still likely to see the ECB press ahead with tighter policy measures when they meet on 4 May. There is nothing in this dataset to suggest that the economy is stalling or that inflation is beaten. In fact, the inflation data at country level suggests the opposite.\u201d The annual inflation rate in the eurozone came down sharply in March from 8.5% to 6.9% but the ECB is concerned about core inflation, which excludes food and energy. This rose from 5.6% to a new record high of 5.7% last month, prompting forecasts that the ECB will raise rates by 0.25 percentage points when it meets next week."

            "date": "2023-04-27T16:30:22Z",
            "content": "US economic growth slowed sharply in the first quarter of the year, despite strong consumer spending resilient to interest-rate rises designed to tame historic inflation. The latest GDP figures released by the US commerce department show that the world\u2019s largest economy slowed sharply from January through March, to just a 1.1% annual pace as businesses reduced inventories amid a decline in housing investment. The abrupt deceleration from 2.6% growth in the final three months of 2022 and 3.2% from July to September came in significantly under economists\u2019 expectations of a 2% increase. The figures indicate that aggressive interest rises designed to tame inflation are beginning to produce what US central bankers desired \u2013 a slowing economy coupled with reduced wage increases and a tighter job market without tipping it into outright recession. \u201cThe data confirm the message from other indicators that while economic growth is slowing, it isn\u2019t yet collapsing,\u201d said Andrew Hunter, chief US economist at Capital Economics. \u201cNevertheless, with most leading indicators of recession still flashing red and the drag from tighter credit conditions still to feed through, we expect a more marked weakening soon.\u201d Resiliency in consumer spending, which rose 3.7%, reflected gains in goods and services and came as business investment in equipment recorded the biggest drop since the start of the pandemic in 2020 and inventories dropped the most in two years. The Federal Reserve has indicated that while it has slowed the rate of interest rises, it expects commercial lenders, buffeted by the collapse of two regional banks this year, to tighten lending standards. Many economists say the cumulative impact of Fed rate hikes and tighter lending requirements have yet to work their way through the system, presenting central bankers with a dilemma over whether to continue raising rates. \u201cThe last thing the Federal Reserve wants to be doing is raising rates as the economy begins to grind to a halt and potentially exacerbating the situation,\u201d said Marcus Brookes, chief investment officer at Quilter Investors. \u201cThe coveted soft landing is looking increasingly difficult to achieve and we are now getting towards a position where the market may become concerned that stagflation could be a likely possibility.\u201d There is widespread skepticism that the Fed will succeed in averting a recession. An economic model used by the Conference Board, a business research group, puts the probability of a US recession over the next year at 99%. That expectation is compounded by political risk, given congressional Republicans could let the US default on its debts by refusing to raise the statutory limit on what it can borrow. Wider global economic conditions are also in play. Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecast for worldwide economic growth, citing rising interest rates around the world, financial uncertainty and chronic inflation. The IMF chief, Kristalina Georgieva, said global growth would remain about 3% over the next five years: its lowest such forecast since 1990."

            "content": "The Albanese government \u201cneeds to start using its power for the people like it promised it would,\u201d a former RBA governor has said, as he joined calls for a lift to the jobseeker rate. Bernie Fraser, who was tasked with guiding Australia\u2019s monetary policy through 18% interest rates and \u201cthe recession we had to have\u201d, said the unemployment payment was one of the \u201cmany areas desperately needing attention\u201d in the coming budget. His voice joins the chorus of people \u2013 including Labor backbenchers \u2013 to publicly demand the government do more to raise the jobseeker rate, which has condemned recipients to poverty. The government is also facing an internal battle, with MPs demanding the cabinet react to the increasingly loud calls. Fraser said it was the duty of the government to act in the best interests of its people and during this time of record low unemployment, it had a chance to change some people\u2019s lives for the better. \u201cI am supportive of an increase in the jobseeker allowance \u2013 it is not only necessary but timely,\u201d he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cBy providing extra support, it might help enable people to get a good-paying job to change their circumstances.\u201d The government\u2019s own expert panel recommended an urgent increase to jobseeker and associated welfare payments, arguing the rate as it was had become a barrier to finding work. Labor MP Peter Khalil on Wednesday night became the latest Labor MP to publicly pressure his own government to raise the rate. He tweeted that he had joined a growing list of colleagues in signing an open letter from the Australian Council of Social Services calling for a jobseeker increase. \u201cMy comments supporting raising jobseeker are on the record. I\u2019ve advocated on this issue publicly &amp; internally with colleagues since elected in 2016,\u201d Khalil wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s the fair &amp; right thing to do so people can live in dignity.\u201d The former Treasury secretary Dr Ken Henry agreed, writing in an opinion piece for Guardian Australia that it was time to raise the rate. \u201cPeople who are unable to secure employment within a short period of time, in a labour market this tight, clearly need special help,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEqually clearly, they are not getting what they need. Denying them such help, while insisting that they should have to survive on $50 a day for more than 12 months, is simply cruel.\u201d Fraser said it was a \u201cdifficult job to fit in all the worthy things\u201d needed in the budget and there were some difficult decisions for the government to make. But he said there was also a clear choice. \u201cThey have got a bit of power. They should be using it for the people.\u201d The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has not committed to raising the rate, although he has said there will be cost of living relief in the budget with a focus on helping the most vulnerable. Chalmers said the focus was helping people into work, given Australia\u2019s tight labour market. But advocates argue that ignores the realities for the long-term unemployed, who are more likely to be older, low-skilled, experiencing chronic health difficulties or have a disability. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the budget was yet to be finalised and the expenditure review committee had one more meeting before signing off on the economic plan, which will be handed down on 9 May. But both Chalmers and Albanese, as well as the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, are facing increasing pressure from the caucus to act, with many backbenchers nervous about the electorate\u2019s reaction to a Labor government not living up to expectations. \u201cThe Greens are really nipping at our heels on this and housing and if we don\u2019t come up with the solutions people expect from us, then we may not get a second chance,\u201d one MP said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there would be many Labor MPs who are not worried about the impact for people trying to live on welfare. There\u2019s a public campaign, but there is also a lot happening privately to try and push this.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-04-13T10:14:52Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy recorded growth of 0.0% in February as a wave of public sector strikes weighed on activity, offsetting a recovery in consumer spending despite the cost of living crisis. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the economy ground to a halt in February, falling below City expectations for a 0.1% month-on-month rise in gross domestic product (GDP), the total value added by the production of goods and services across the economy. It followed growth of 0.4% in January, as revisions to earlier estimates pushed the economy back above pre-pandemic levels. However, the UK\u2019s recovery to pre-Covid levels remained slower than that of any other G7 economy. The ONS said construction grew strongly after a poor start to the year, with increased repair work taking place, alongside a boost from retail as many shops had a strong month for sales. However, it said this had been offset by civil service and teachers\u2019 strikes, hitting activity in the public sector, while unseasonably mild weather led to a fall in the use of electricity and gas. Manufacturing showed zero growth, while the UK\u2019s dominant services sector fell by 0.1%, down from a revised growth rate of 0.7% a month earlier. The figures come hours after the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, insisted the UK would do \u201csignificantly better\u201d than the International Monetary Fund\u2019s forecast on Tuesday that the economy was expected to shrink by 0.3% this year. Speaking to Bloomberg News on the sidelines of the fund\u2019s spring meetings in Washington on Wednesday night, he said: \u201cWe will do better than that.\u201d Despite February\u2019s flat performance, the chancellor said on Thursday that Britain\u2019s economic outlook was \u201cbrighter than expected\u201d, as he argued the country was set to avoid a recession this year. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said the figures showed the economy was inching along. \u201cDespite our enormous promise and potential as a country, Britain is still lagging behind on the global stage with growth on the floor,\u201d she said. Strikes by teachers nationwide at the start of the month and in some regions of England on 28 February had the biggest drag on growth, pulling down output in the education sector by 1.7%. Strikes in the civil service at the start of February also weighed on growth. Highlighting the impact of industrial action on the economy, the figures came as junior doctors in England staged a four-day strike in a deteriorating dispute over pay, amid government resistance to bigger wage increases across the public sector. Output in the rest of the economy \u2013 the private sector \u2013 rose by 0.2%, as analysts said Britain\u2019s economy appeared to be performing better than feared thanks to unexpected resilience in consumer spending. In consumer-facing services output grew by 0.4%, an acceleration on January\u2019s growth of 0.3%. Production output \u2013 which includes energy generation, mining, and manufacturing \u2013 fell on the month, as warmer weather led to a drop in demand as many families turned down the thermostat. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said stronger wage growth and cost of living support from the government was helping to bolster household incomes, supporting the economy\u2019s stronger than expected performance in recent months. \u201cThe overall sense is that the economy is still proving resilient to the twin drags of high inflation and high interest rates,\u201d he said. Economists said Britain was likely to avoid a recession at the start of the year, but warned that high inflation and the delayed impact of previous interest rate increases from the Bank of England would likely spell a weak growth outlook at best. After a stronger than expected January and flat performance in February, analysts said GDP would need to shrink by 0.5% or more in March for the economy to record a quarter of contraction. Two quarters of falling GDP are considered the technical definition of a recession. Thomas Pugh, an economist at the accountancy firm RSM UK, said: \u201cIt\u2019s more or less a 50:50 call as to whether the UK falls into a technical recession this year, the degree of strike activity may tip the balance. But even if the UK avoids a recession, growth is likely to be meagre through the rest of this year.\u201d"

            "title": "Why are oil prices rising and what does it mean for inflation?",
            "date": "2023-04-03T11:37:15Z",
            "content": "Oil prices jumped on Monday after some of the world\u2019s biggest producers agreed to cut production. Here we explain what happened and what it might mean for inflation and interest rates. Why are oil prices rising? The reason oil prices jumped by more than 7% in early London trading was that members of the Opec+ cartel agreed a surprise cut in production over the weekend. The move, led by Saudi Arabia, will take effect next month and will reduce the supply of crude by more than 1m barrels a day. All other things being equal, limiting supply of oil leads to an increase in its price, and that explains why a barrel of Brent crude \u2013 one of the benchmarks for the market \u2013 hit nearly $86 a barrel. Why has Opec+ taken this step? This looks like a pre-emptive move from the cartel ahead of a likely economic slowdown \u2013 and possible recession in the US \u2013 later this year. Opec+ said its decision was aimed at ensuring stability in the oil market, by which it means putting a floor under oil prices of about $80 a barrel. Even so, the production cut represents a gamble that stronger demand from China \u2013 where the economy is recovering from its strict lockdown \u2013 will offset the dampening effect on demand in the west. It is a sign of the cooling of relations between Washington and Riyadh that the Saudis went ahead with their voluntary production cut despite strong opposition from Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Will higher prices stick? This is the $64m dollar question. In the past, Opec+ has announced production cuts and then failed to follow through on the commitments. Traders will be looking closely for evidence of quota busting this time. But even if there is no cheating, today\u2019s surge in the oil price to the highest level since January will only stick if the global economy can shrug off the impact of dearer energy. If it can\u2019t, prices will come under downward pressure. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says it is possible \u201cbut hard\u201d for oil prices to reach $100 a barrel, adding: \u201cIf the rising oil prices hit the global demand prospects at quite an uneasy time for the world economy (due to the bank stress) and further spurs recession worries, there is a chance that the rally in oil prices fades quickly.\u201d What does this mean for inflation in the west? The surprise move by Opec+ could scarcely have come at a worse time for the US, the UK and the EU \u2013 all of which are battling to reduce upward pressure on the cost of living. Although western economies are less oil-intensive than they were when Opec first became a household name 50 years ago, the cost of crude still matters. Higher oil prices make production and transport more expensive, and reduce the spending power of consumers. Central banks have been expecting inflation to fall sharply this year on the grounds that there will be no repeat of last year\u2019s increase in energy costs triggered by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The Opec+ move threatens to make the fall in inflation a more protracted affair. What does it mean for interest rates? In theory, central banks should not respond immediately to a rise in oil prices and would only do so if there are knock-on effects \u2013 businesses raising their prices or offering more generous pay awards to their workers. In practice, higher oil prices at this juncture will almost certainly make the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank more cautious. If \u2013 and it remains a big if \u2013 Opec+ succeeds in permanently pushing up oil prices, the result will be that interest rates stay higher for longer. That will increase the risk of recession."

            "date": "2023-04-08T18:16:11Z",
            "content": "The Republican megadonor whose gifts to the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas have come under the spotlight has a private collection including a garden of statues of dictators, including Mussolini and Stalin; Nazi memorabilia; and paintings including two works by Adolf Hitler, the Washingtonian reported. \u201cI still can\u2019t get over the collection of Nazi memorabilia,\u201d the Washingtonian quoted an anonymous source as saying, regarding a visit to Harlan Crow\u2019s Texas home. \u201cIt would have been helpful to have someone explain the significance of all the items. Without that context, you sort of just gasp when you walk into the room.\u201d Crow, the source said, also had paintings \u201cdone by George W Bush next to a Norman Rockwell next to one by Hitler\u201d. A painting of Thomas and Crow smoking cigars in company including the rightwing activist Leonard Leo was included in an explosive report by ProPublica, detailing Crow\u2019s lavish gifts to Thomas over more than 25 years. ProPublica also described trips on private planes and yachts and stays at lavish resorts. In a rare statement, Thomas said he had been advised such \u201cpersonal hospitality\u201d did not have to be declared under federal rules. He added: \u201cI have endeavoured to follow that counsel throughout my tenure and have always sought to comply with the disclosure guidelines.\u201d Critics said Thomas had \u201cclearly\u201d broken the law regarding the declaration of gifts. The Washington Post noted Thomas has declared just two since 2004. Crow denied discussing or seeking to influence the court through his friendship with Thomas and his wife, the far-right activist Ginni Thomas. Critics questioned that, given Crow\u2019s seat on the board of the American Enterprise Institute, a rightwing thinktank which Accountable.US, an advocacy group, said \u201chas published and taken credit for multiple amicus briefs filed with the supreme court by the group\u2019s president and scholars\u201d. Outraged Democrats promised investigations and, in the case of the New York Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, threatened to introduce articles of impeachment. Thomas is the senior conservative on a conservative-dominated court that has issued controversial rulings including Dobbs v Jackson, which last year removed the federal right to abortion. But impeachment and removal is highly unlikely. Supreme court justices effectively govern themselves. Only one has ever been impeached, in 1804, before being acquitted. Republicans hold the House, where impeachment would start. Still, news of Crow\u2019s far-right memorabilia seemed bound to add to Thomas\u2019s embarrassment \u2013 perhaps in part because Thomas has written that arguments for abortion rights spring from theories of eugenics, as espoused by Hitler and the Nazis. When Thomas made that argument, in an opinion in 2019, Philippa Levine, a University of Texas history professor, told the Washington Post the justice was \u201cguilty of a gross misuse of historical facts\u201d. On Friday, the Washingtonian published pictures of Thomas\u2019s friend\u2019s collection of Nazi artefacts, which includes a signed copy of Hitler\u2019s memoir, Mein Kampf. The magazine also noted how the Florida senator Marco Rubio ran into problems in 2015, over a Crow-hosted fundraiser on the eve of Yom Kippur. The year before that, the Dallas Morning News reported that Crow became \u201cvisibly uncomfortable\u201d with questions about his dictator statues and collectibles of Hitler, whose regime murdered 6 million Jews during the Holocaust. The paper described the statues of dictators as \u201ca historical nod to the facts of man\u2019s inhumanity to man\u201d. Crow also reportedly owns statues of two British prime ministers he counts among his heroes: Winston Churchill \u2013 who defeated Hitler \u2013 and Margaret Thatcher. The megadonor and his wife were \u201csuch hospitable Texas hosts\u201d, according to the Washingtonian\u2019s source. But, the source added, it was \u201cjust strange \u2013 they had family photos in one room, then all this world war II stuff in another room, and dictators in the backyard\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 and 14 April 2023. An earlier version said the American Enterprise Institute files amicus briefs with the supreme court. This claim should have been attributed to Accountable.US and this has been clarified."

            "content": "Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Unforgotten season five. Don\u2019t read on unless you\u2019ve watched episode six. ITV\u2019s cold-case drama concluded with tearful confessions and killer twists. Would justice be done? And what\u2019s the overall series verdict? Here\u2019s your evidence board for the finale \u2026 Swiss neutrality was no help here As we returned to that floodlit residential garden, DCI Jessica James (Sin\u00e9ad Keenan) and DI Sunil Khan (Sanjeev Bhaskar) faced the very real possibility of a double murder. Police had dug up the decomposed body of a young male with two bullet holes in his skull, likely killed around the same time as Precious Falade. Jessie was convinced that Lord Tony Hume (Ian McElhinney) was involved, so had him taken off his plane to Switzerland before it left the tarmac. Dignitas wouldn\u2019t provide sanctuary after all. DNA tests revealed that the corpse was Joseph Bell, son of Precious and cult leader David Bell. Ballistics confirmed that the second bullet found in the wall at 64 Waterman Road came from the same gun as the one that was used to kill Precious. Tenant of the garden flat at the time? Precious\u2019s estranged mother Ebele (Martina Laird). The net was closing on the Tory peer and the troubled restaurateur. Karol was in the clear In an adjacent holding cell to Tory Tone sat ex-social worker Karol Wojski (Max Rinehart). He explained how, owing to burnout and antisemitic attacks, he\u2019d had a mental breakdown and fixated on upskirting women. When he accidentally left his laptop behind after visiting Precious, she found his illicit photos and blackmailed him. Bank statements showed that he had withdrawn \u00a32,000 in cash but deposited it the following day. If he hadn\u2019t paid her off, how did he get the laptop back? Karol had arrived at the Hammersmith house to find no sign of Precious, just a freshly mopped floor (taps nose). As he collected his laptop, he encountered a well-spoken old man with a mop and bucket (taps nose again). Fearing she would continue to extort him and had probably downloaded the pics elsewhere (she had), he fled the country. Karol was remorseful but hadn\u2019t hurt Precious. Detectives (and viewers) believed him, not least when he confided in his parents. One suspect was out of the frame. Several to go. Hume was economical with the truth Naturally, Teflon Tony denied everything. When a petrol station transaction placed him near the scene of the crime and he realised he\u2019d been seen with bloody mop in hand, his slick facade crumbled. He admitted a fling with Ebele\u2019s teenage mother, Yetunde, in 1963. She was a cleaner at the City stock brokerage where Hume was interning. When he learned he had a daughter 23 years later, Hume offered financial support. His granddaughter Precious later contacted him. Cue another standing order. When she was homeless, he gave her the keys to the empty Hammersmith house. The night she died, Precious\u2019s son Joseph called Hume from Waterman Road, demanding money and threatening all sorts. Hume rang Ebele and both headed for Hammersmith. Hume arrived first to find a disturbed Joseph on a drug comedown. When he pointed a gun at Hume, Precious lunged and it went off, hitting Joseph in the head. As Hume tried to administer first aid, Precious turned the gun on herself. Ebele walked into a scene of carnage. Hume promised to dispose of Joseph\u2019s body, leaving Ebele with her daughter. Six years later, he panicked and anonymously tipped off police about where the corpse was buried, before trying to flee the country. A convincing account? Come now, this is a politician we\u2019re talking about. \u2018I loathe the pair of you\u2019 En route to Bishop Street nick, Ebele visited Emma Hume (Hayley Mills) to drop a few truth bombs. She told the grandee\u2019s wife that she was his secret daughter, that their \u201calmost entirely financial relationship\u201d for the past 35 years had been \u201creparation for screwing over multiple generations of my family\u201d and \u201cyour privilege was built on the bones of people like me\u201d. An air-punching speech. We found out exactly what Ebele meant in her final police interview. It hadn\u2019t been \u201ca fling\u201d. Hume raped Yetunde (hence his reaction to his grandson\u2019s similar sex crime) but it had been hushed up by Hume\u2019s father. Yetunde took her own life, leaving baby Ebele to be brought up by her disapproving grandparents. Hume hadn\u2019t done the decent thing, he had solely been concerned with protecting his reputation. It was only when Ebele threatened to go public that he fessed up. Her father might be a serial liar but Ebele corroborated his account of that fateful night. Hume paid her rent and had keys to her flat, so had buried Joseph there. She had spent all night with Precious and in the morning, spooked by workmen outside, hid her daughter\u2019s body up the chimney and had the area covered with plasterboard. Surely Teflon Tony wasn\u2019t in the clear? Enter the hooded gamechanger \u2026 Putting the Jay into justice Gazing across the Thames estuary, Jay Royce (Rhys Yates) had reached a watershed. He dropped off flowers for his mugging victim (\u201cTell her I\u2019m sorry\u201d). His girlfriend left him. He was reluctant to testify (\u201cPeople like me don\u2019t win against people like him\u201d) but persuasive Sunny won his trust. Just as he\u2019d said, Jay \u201cwas there that night and saw everything\u201d. Aged 14, he had watched unseen from the stairs as Hume slammed Joseph against the wall and was choking him. When Joe pulled a gun, Precious made a grab for it and was accidentally shot during the tussle. In shock, Joe meekly handed Hume the firearm and knelt by his dying mother, at which point Hume shot him in the head. Terrified Jay hid for two days, then ran and never looked back. Hume gave his best impersonation of contrition, claiming that he\u2019d been making amends ever since. Jessie gave his performance a sarcastic slow handclap, scoffing: \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to improve your Wiki page.\u201d He was duly charged with a 59-year-old crime, an Unforgotten record (for now). Yet there was still time for a head-spinning late twist. When Ebele finally met Jay in an affecting scene (\u201cI\u2019m your nan\u201d, \u201cHello, Nan\u201d), he quietly admitted that he had lied. Precious had accidentally shot Joe, then turned the gun on herself. Pinning it on Hume was payback for all the pain he\u2019d visited upon their family. With mere months to live and haunted by guilt, Hume took the fall for a rape he had committed and a murder he hadn\u2019t. An angrily ambitious series As always with Unforgotten, the plot threads knitted together in powerful fashion. This fifth series was a politicised, panoramic tale of generational trauma, social inequality and the devastating impact of austerity. The letter of the law might not have prevailed but justice of a different kind was served. The verdict on Jessie? I thought she worked better than we could have hoped. Writer Chris Lang ensured the hole left by Nicola Walker\u2019s Cassie was rightly acknowledged. Sin\u00e9ad Keenan was terrific and her initial clashes with the team felt realistic. Yet Jessie found her feet and forged a new relationship with Sunny. Their dynamic has plenty of promise, her signature sweater vest a worthy foil for his rucksack. Signing off with some cowboy bantz, the duo look set fair for series six. Yeehaw. Line of the week \u201cYou will only ever be remembered as a rapist who murdered his own great-grandson. That\u2019s your fucking legacy, fella.\u201d. Burning with righteous fury, Jessie goes a bit Ted Hastings. Notes and observations We left both our heroes with unhappy home lives: Sunny alone without Sal, Jessie reluctantly reconciling with \u201cmy gorgeous hubby\u2122\u201d for the sake of their children. Time to distract themselves with work again? It wasn\u2019t all about the lead pair. Shout-outs to DC Fran, DS Murray and DC Kaz, who all made vital breakthroughs. Wonder if DC Jake Collier (Lewis Reeves) will be back next time? Martina Laird excelled as Ebele in the home stretch but Rhys Yates, AKA Jay, announced himself as an actor with real potential. More than 8.5 million people have now watched this series, making it ITV\u2019s highest rated show of 2023 so far. Treat yourself to two takeaway coffees, Sunny. Thanks for your wit and wisdom over the past six weeks, Team Bishop Street. Was this a satisfying finale? Was Jessie a worthy successor to Cassie? For one last time, please share your thoughts and theories below."

            "date": "2023-04-19T07:44:09Z",
            "content": "Black people are still not seen as deserving justice, while police officers in the UK\u2019s capital are able to act with near-impunity, Doreen Lawrence has said, as the 30th anniversary of the racist murder of her son approaches. Stephen Lawrence was killed in a racist attack by a gang at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London, in 1993. Two men were convicted of the murder in 2012 but others remain free. It was seen as a watershed moment when the Macpherson report on Scotland Yard\u2019s failed investigation into the murder found the Metropolitan police to be institutionally racist. But, nearly a quarter of a century on, a second report by Louise Casey this year made strikingly similar findings. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many more inquiries and how many reviews you need to have to say the same thing and still no changes, and still denials. Officers [are] able to be as brutal as they want, and nobody holds them to account,\u201d Lady Lawrence told the BBC. Only two of Stephen Lawrence\u2019s five suspected murderers \u2013 David Norris and Gary Dobson \u2013 have been jailed for the crime. Lawrence added that she did not believe she would ever truly get justice, telling the broadcaster that without her family\u2019s constant pressure, even those two convictions in 2012 would not have happened. \u201cWithin the black community, how we\u2019re treated, how crime\u2019s investigated, we\u2019re never seen as a group of people that should have justice. So everything that we\u2019ve had, we\u2019ve had to fight for \u2013 and continue to fight.\u201d The Casey report, commissioned in response to the abduction and murder of Sarah Everard by a serving Met police officer and released in March, denounced the force as a broken institution suffering from a collapse in public confidence \u2013 particularly among black people. \u201cThe Met has yet to free itself of institutional racism. Public consent is broken. The Met has become unanchored from the Peelian principle of policing by consent set out when it was established.\u201d Lady Casey warned that \u201cpublic consent is broken\u201d, with only 50% of the public expressing confidence, even before revelations about the force\u2019s worst recent scandals \u2013 placing the blame on its past leadership. The new Met commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, has acknowledged past failings by the force, though he has insisted it is nowhere near as bad as when Macpherson reported in 1999. But Lady Lawrence, who will mark the anniversary of her son\u2019s death on 22 April, told the BBC Rowley could not be allowed to judge the Met\u2019s progress \u2013 arguing that could only be done by the public. As long as police continued to deny their failings, there would be no change, she said, adding that she had heard \u201ca lot of rhetoric\u201d from Rowley, \u201cbut unless we see the changes ourselves, we\u2019re never going to believe that\u201d. She added: \u201cBut, over the past \u2013 in Stephen\u2019s case \u2013 30 years, nothing much has changed.\u201d"

            "content": "John Roberts, the US supreme court chief justice, has declined to testify at a forthcoming hearing before the Senate judiciary committee that is expected to focus on judicial ethics. The committee\u2019s Democratic chairman, Dick Durbin, had asked the chief justice to appear before the panel to address potential reforms to ethical rules governing the justices. The senator cited \u201ca steady stream of revelations regarding justices falling short of the ethical standards\u201d. Roberts\u2019 brief response, issued by a supreme court spokesperson, said he would \u201crespectfully decline\u201d the invitation. In a letter to Durbin, Roberts said such appearances by chief justices were exceedingly rare given concerns about the separation of powers between the branches of US government and the \u201cimportance of preserving judicial independence\u201d. Durbin had earlier asked Roberts to investigate ties between Justice Clarence Thomas and a wealthy Republican donor. Thomas, the longest-serving of the court\u2019s nine justices, has been under pressure after published reports by the news outlet ProPublica detailing his relationship with Harlan Crow, including real estate purchases and luxury travel paid for by the billionaire Dallas businessman. In a statement on Tuesday, Durbin said: \u201cI am surprised that the chief justice\u2019s recounting of existing legal standards of ethics suggests current law is adequate and ignores the obvious. The actions of one justice, including trips on yachts and private jets, were not reported to the public. That same justice failed to disclose the sale of properties he partly owned to a party with interests before the supreme court.\u201d The Senate judiciary committee would proceed with a 2 May hearing as planned, according to Durbin. \u201cIt is time for Congress to accept its responsibility to establish an enforceable code of ethics for the supreme court, the only agency of our government without it,\u201d Durbin said."

            "date": "2023-04-19T07:00:32Z",
            "content": "I was travelling home on the London Underground when more than 100 unsolicited images of an erect penis, sent over Apple\u2019s AirDrop, appeared on my phone. The Bluetooth-enabled feature only works between iPhones that are within 10m (30 feet) of each other \u2013 around half the length of a tube carriage. I knew the sender was nearby, but I didn\u2019t know who he was. Should I get off the train? Would I be safe to walk home if I did? Did he single me out from my fellow passengers to be his victim, or was I just a random female target picked from a list of nearby devices? What was his intent in sending the images: to threaten? To get sexual gratification? To feel powerful in his anonymity? Or just to amuse himself? For me, the consequences were akin to experiencing real-life flashing. I felt scared, embarrassed and angry. I wanted to simultaneously scream and to hide. But the consequences for the sender were nonexistent. I reported it to the police and nothing happened. The nature of the crime makes it almost impossible to trace the offender. For years, the Law Commission has been advising the government to plug this gap in legislation \u2013 a chasm between how we punish real-world behaviours and the same behaviour online \u2013 by introducing a specific cyber-flashing offence. In March 2022, the government announced it would do so as part of its huge, and much-discussed, online safety bill. If found guilty, perpetrators could face up to two years in prison. But campaigners have noted major loopholes in the proposed legislation, and have recently launched campaigns including petitions, and appeals to ministers, to close them. At the moment, the proposed legislation would only punish perpetrators who showed harmful intent, rather than working on the basis that the recipient didn\u2019t consent to receive an image. This would mean that prosecutors would have to argue that a sender intended to either cause the victim to be \u201chumiliated, alarmed or distressed\u201d, or that the sender did it for their own sexual fulfilment. How do you prove what someone was thinking when they carried out such an action? How do you know if someone is getting a kick out of it when they do? This loophole will indisputably diminish the effectiveness of any new cyber-flashing law. We have seen this before. Until November 2022, the same loophole existed in the \u201cimage-based abuse\u201d law. This similarly well-intentioned but piecemeal legislation was designed to stop so-called revenge porn \u2013 sexually explicit images or videos shared online without the subject\u2019s approval. While there have been some high-profile successes \u2013 reality TV star Stephen Bear was jailed in March \u2013 some other image-based abuse cases have fallen apart as a result of the \u201cintent to harm\u201d clause. I have interviewed women on the frontline of this failure: one woman was told by police there was no case to answer even though her ex-boyfriend admitted to sharing naked images and videos of her online. After she discovered them and went to law enforcement, her former partner texted to say he hadn\u2019t meant to cause her any harm. The case ended. A get-out-of-jail-free card, if you will. In November the government announced it was changing the image-based abuse law to include a consent clause. Having acknowledged the flaw in that law, and made amends, it\u2019s nonsensical to repeat the same mistake in new legislation with cyber-flashing. Cyber-flashing is not a niche crime. The latest research by dating app Bumble found almost half (48%) of 18- to 24-year-olds in the UK have received a sexual photo they did not ask for, or consent to. This corroborates a 2018 study by YouGov that found 40% of women aged between 18 and 34 had been sent an unsolicited sexual image. Research by Clare McGlynn, a professor of law at Durham University, and Kelly Johnson, found that the harms to victims included sexual violation, humiliation, fear and changes to everyday behaviour (such as getting a different train). I have interviewed more than 70 women about their experiences and found the same. Cyber-flashing is not experienced as a less harmful or less damaging behaviour just because it happens digitally rather than on the street. In some cases it is reported to have felt even more violating, because it doesn\u2019t just taint a particular place or a pavement, it taints all digital life. For those who have been AirDropped in a public place, there is not even the comfort of knowing for certain who is guilty. As our lives are lived increasingly online \u2013 our jobs, our social lives, our shopping, our news, our communities \u2013 we cannot tolerate a discrepancy in the way the law works for this space. If, as a society, we accept that people have the right to go about their day without being flashed, that should be the case wherever it happens.

            "date": "2023-04-19T14:40:05Z",
            "content": "In the 30 years since Stephen Lawrence was murdered on a dark street by racists, he has come to be seen as an iconic symbol of the herculean attempt by his parents to make that outrage mean something. They have become symbolic figures after leading a campaign that made Britain look at itself and face up to the unfairness and racist inequalities that blighted it. But as their lawyer, working closely with them for so many years, I was privileged to see behind the symbols and to know something of Stephen for what he was: a young, lively, bright and sociable Black Londoner navigating his way through what was left of his teenage years and planning his future. And to see his parents for what they were and are: ordinary, brave, warm, public-spirited people who speak to the truth that society can be changed for the better by courageous people who raise a voice. On behalf of their son, on behalf of us all, they raised a voice. It was hoped back then that Stephen\u2019s murder would be a turning point, and the inquiry that followed would lead to a reckoning for police services across the country and, in particular, the Metropolitan police. That reckoning has been delayed by three decades. It is only now said to be beginning. When Stephen was murdered he was the fourth victim of a racist killing in south-east London, which had been dubbed the racist capital of the country. As a lawyer, I had been painfully aware of the racism of the police, having defended Black individuals as suspects and represented them as victims of police misconduct. Police racism was rife but, as in the rest of society, it was seen as an accepted part of everyday life, whether it was on our Saturday night TV screens or on the football terraces. Of course, there were many who fought against it, but the state, through its institutions, was far stronger. Britain had had centuries of learning from its imperial past how to instil racism into every aspect of society. The police were just part of that institutional scaffolding. It is this situation that gave rise to Sir William Macpherson\u2019s definition of institutional racism, which sought to explain why the Met failed Stephen\u2019s family so badly. It was not that one individual Met police officer was racist: it was the procedures, processes and conduct of the institution that had produced a discriminatory outcome. Lawyers such as me, familiar with police practices, recognised that well, but many in society, including the Lawrences, were unaware of it, largely because they had no cause to be in contact with the police. As a result, before 1993 it was an uphill task trying to convince the public that young Black men were being stopped just because of their skin colour and not because they had done anything wrong. It was the same when it came to trying to explain why there were so many young Black men in prison or why they were more likely to die at the hands of the police compared with their white counterparts; or why getting a complaint upheld against a police officer was nigh on impossible. On 22 April 1993 this narrative began to change. As the brutality of Stephen\u2019s murder and the vicious racism of his killers came to be known, together with the sheer magnitude of the police failures to catch those responsible, there was a realisation that all was not as it appeared with the police. The subsequent public inquiry and report six years later into the killing turned that suspicion into fact: the police were institutionally racist. With his advisers, Macpherson\u2019s findings had pricked the chimeric vision that Britain was a tolerant, fair and just land with equal opportunities for all. Racist tropes on our TV screens may no longer be acceptable, while footballers display their anti-racist credentials by taking the knee, but scratch the surface and it is clear racism is still rife in our society; whether it is the continuing alarming rate of deaths of Black men in custody or the differential treatment of Black mothers-to-be in the health system. On the last day of the public inquiry, I recall thinking how life would change now discrimination had been so comprehensively exposed. It never happened. There were individual success stories here and there. Some pointed to the marriage of Meghan Markle to a royal, and to the diverse nature of the Tory cabinet, but that just highlights the paradoxical nature of the society we live in. They give the appearance of change without there being any actual change because at the same time we see that more than a third of people from ethnic and religious minorities have experienced some form of racist assault. This is precisely why we need to acknowledge and accept the concept of institutional racism. If those in power don\u2019t change the procedures, processes and conduct of those in their charge, discriminatory outcomes will continue to occur. This is why it was baffling to hear the Met commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, unequivocally accept Louise Casey\u2019s damning report into his force recently but then refuse to admit institutional racism. When the Macpherson report was published in 1999, many chief police officers robotically accepted the notion of institutional racism, as did other public services. It became a badge of honour. But it was simply an outward sign of penitence, for public consumption \u2013 and we bought it. The real driver for the Met has never really changed. It is to protect its own, and that has repercussions. When your chief operating officer gives you licence to act in a racist, misogynistic, homophobic and corrupt manner, many will do so. When they oversee a complaints system designed to protect you at all costs, what stops you from acting with complete impunity? I had high hopes, even pride, standing at Doreen Lawrence\u2019s side after the public inquiry, and thinking that we were at the start of a huge wave of change for the better. How depressing to now feel that the police were thinking the complete opposite. On this anniversary of Stephen\u2019s death, the sad truth is this: the Met has wasted 30 years in which it could have fully implemented the Macpherson recommendations; decades in which untold millions of taxpayers\u2019 money has been misspent; in which thousands of complaints have been dismissed; in which untold numbers of Black young men have been unnecessarily stopped and searched. There was a chance to root out the racism, the misogyny, the homophobia and corruption. Perhaps the lives of so many who have died at the hands of serving police officers could have been saved. After Stephen\u2019s death we demanded change; we still demand it. We owe him no less.

            "date": "2023-04-27T17:26:57Z",
            "content": "Over the years, a variety of national troubles have been characterised as the British disease \u2013 among them economic stagnation, football hooliganism and nostalgia for empire. But there is a strong case for saying that the real British disease is and always has been gambling. According to the Gambling Commission, 44% of Britons today aged over 16 are gamblers of some kind, with 27% taking part in online gambling. That\u2019s about 30 million gamblers, with the numbers concentrated in the under-50s. The truth is that we are not a nation of shopkeepers but a nation of punters. The law was last redrawn in Labour\u2019s 2005 Gambling Act. Its underlying intention, extraordinary though it now seems, was to promote legal but regulated gambling. Though this was itself dubious, and although the bill was improved during its passage through parliament, it reckoned altogether without two important things. The first was that many people\u2019s real disposable income would contract, not increase, over the years, making easier gambling a significant factor in any cost of living crisis. The second was that online gambling was about to mushroom into the main form of recreational gambling. The need to update the law in the light of the online gambling explosion is the main reason why the Conservatives have finally returned to the subject. Today, almost anyone can gamble cashlessly by smartphone from their sitting room or wherever else they happen to be, using gambling services provided by multinational tech companies, whose data analytics and advertising dominate the industry. The new white paper proposes a mandatory levy on the industry, compulsory limits on stakes and curbs on bonus offers. Updated law is undoubtedly needed. It is also overdue. It ought not to have taken so long since the start of the online revolution for the regulation to enter the modern gambling world. Part of this is due to the instability in the government since Brexit, with four different prime ministers and no fewer than eight culture secretaries in six years. The latest of them, Lucy Frazer, who launched the white paper on Thursday, has been in the job for a mere two months. Part of the problem is that the Conservative party remains disunited about how firmly to regulate. A section of the party is fundamentally sceptical about controls, arguing that people should always be free to do what they want with their money. A majority in all parties are in favour of controls, but want them to focus on problem gamblers and, in particular, on children. Although most forms of licensed gambling are illegal for under 18s, a 2022 survey found that 31% of 11- to 16-year-olds were spending their own money on gambling. As many as 50,000 children are problem gamblers. The white paper moves in the right direction \u2013 but only in a limited way. The principle of the mandatory levy, which would help finance addiction treatment and research, is good, but the proposals are vague. Nor is enough being done to roll back the colonisation of football by gambling companies, which continue to advertise so defiantly on shirts, hoardings, the internet and on television. Problem gambling and child gambling are unquestionably highly serious problems, but the white paper fights shy of the challenge posed by the modern globalised gambling industry itself. The firms are good at circumventing controls, and the government\u2019s promise of yet more consultation before the changes are implemented may encourage them to delay further.

            "title": "Emmanuel Macron insists pension reform is necessary in TV address",
            "date": "2023-04-17T20:05:34Z",
            "content": "Emmanuel Macron has said he has heard the public\u2019s anger over his contested pension reform which has sparked three months of protests but insisted once again the measure was necessary. In a televised address late on Monday, the French president said he regretted no \u201ccommon ground\u201d could be reached over the legislation which raises the official retirement age from 62 to 64. The measures \u201cneeded to guarantee everyone\u2019s pension\u201d will come into effect in stages from the autumn, he said. He admitted increasing prices and certain jobs \u201cdon\u2019t allow many French people to live well\u201d, but insisted that \u201cgradually working more means also producing more wealth for the whole nation\u201d. The recorded 15-minute broadcast on prime-time television was the first announcement Macron had made since signing the new bill into law on Saturday just hours after it had been approved by France\u2019s highest court. After the stick came the carrot: in an attempt to soothe the public mood, Macron promised a series of \u201cconcrete measures\u201d to boost pay and careers, as well as improve the education, health and justice systems, to be announced within the next 100 days. He called for \u201cconciliation and unity\u201d, an appeal addressed to the unions who have vowed to continue their protests. If Macron was hoping his speech would calm a volatile public mood and reset his and the government\u2019s image \u2013 both tarnished by the way the bill was passed \u2013 Laurent Berger, secretary general of France\u2019s biggest union the CFDT and considered a moderate, suggested it had failed. He said the president had offered \u201cnothing concrete\u201d and the demonstrations would continue with a national day of action on 1 May. \u201cRegret doesn\u2019t change much for the workers who now have to work longer, many of whom have mobilised over the last three months and many of whom will do so on the 1st of May,\u201d Berger told French television. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to hear that he has heard the anger but has now moved on from the question of pensions. He said nothing that showed consideration for the workers who are affected because they have to work two years more.\u201d Berger added: \u201cWe\u2019re not in a poetry contest \u2026 it\u2019s about acts and the acts over the last months have been unfair for those in the workforce. I don\u2019t think what I have heard this evening is going to calm the anger.\u201d Protesters gathered around the country banging saucepans to suggest that if the president would not listen to them, they would make enough noise to drown him out. Polls suggest around three-quarters of French people are opposed to the bill, which will also require workers to make increased contributions to obtain a full pension. Public fury intensified after the government was forced to push the legislation through parliament using a constitutional measure called the 49-3 that avoided a final vote in National Assembly. The bill was then referred to France\u2019s highest court, the constitutional council, which declared the process and the text were \u201cnot contrary to the constitution\u201d. Macron ignored pleas from opponents to delay signing it into law by promulgating it a few hours later, infuriating opponents. Union leaders accused the president of acting with indecent haste. The president said nothing about the prime minister, \u00c9lisabeth Borne, who he has instructed to negotiate with opposition parties to find some kind of working majority in the national assembly and to agree on a legislative timetable. The indications are that she will fail, meaning political coalitions will have to be negotiated on a bill-by-bill basis, which will be complicated, slow the legislative timetable and water down Macron\u2019s key election pledges. Macron\u2019s reelection programme included a labour law and legislation covering energy, the climate and immigration to be introduced to parliament before July, but now postponed. How and when these texts will be considered, and what will be in them, is not clear."

            "date": "2023-04-16T17:30:16Z",
            "content": "As France\u2019s constitutional council debated the legality of Emmanuel Macron\u2019s unpopular pension reform last week, massed ranks of riot police stood by in central Paris. It was an unsettling sign of the times. Mr Macron\u2019s reckless decision to use executive powers to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 \u2013 avoiding a parliamentary vote he thought he might lose \u2013 has turned a highly charged national debate into a wider crisis of democratic legitimacy. On Friday, the nine members of the great and the good who make up the council found themselves at the eye of the storm. Following the court\u2019s verdict that the reform is constitutionally sound, Mr Macron will hope to draw a line and move on. On Friday evening, his embattled prime minister, \u00c9lisabeth Borne, optimistically tweeted: \u201cThe law has reached the end of its democratic process.\u201d That may technically be true, but the political reality is very different. Though the council rejected an opposition proposal for a citizens\u2019 referendum on the retirement age, a second request is yet to be adjudicated upon. And after three months of nationwide demonstrations and strikes, France\u2019s reinvigorated unions have vowed to fight on; Labour Day protests on 1 May are certain to be large, possibly presaging a summer of discontent. The disquiet caused by Mr Macron\u2019s strong-arm tactics has left him with little or no political capital, only a year into his second term. With personal approval ratings nearing record lows, and hamstrung by his lack of a majority in the National Assembly, he looks like a lame\u2011duck president. So much for Mr Macron\u2019s diminished prospects. By far the most serious damage done has been that inflicted on the French body politic. The president\u2019s haughty mishandling of the pensions controversy has deepened mistrust in mainstream political institutions, to the likely benefit of Marine Le Pen and the French far right. Soaring rates of abstention at elections \u2013 especially among young people \u2013 already testified to a widespread alienation amid declining living standards, as did the gilets jaunes insurgency during Mr Macron\u2019s first term. The violent targeting of public buildings and officials during the pension protests, and Ms Le Pen\u2019s insidious attacks on the integrity of the constitutional court, should be ringing loud alarm bells. Mr Macron\u2019s supporters will point to the council\u2019s ruling, which confirmed the president was within his rights to double down on the reform. But taking that option despite opposition from two-thirds of the population, and deep concern in his own party, was needlessly provocative and rash. The result is a crisis of consent that is likely to find new forms of expression, with unpredictable consequences. As the International Monetary Fund warns that the global economy is heading for the weakest period of growth for 30 years, and the challenge posed by the climate emergency becomes ever more pressing, political leaders should be seeking to work with, rather than ignore, their electorates. But despite pledges to \u201clisten\u201d after previous setbacks, the president has brazenly reverted to Jupiterian type. Mr Macron\u2019s remarkable journey to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e in 2017 was achieved on the back of popular disillusionment with \u201cestablishment\u201d politics. Six years on, he symbolises the failings of the over-centralised, top-down system he pledged to reform. As calls for democratic renewal grow louder, including the greater use of referendums, proportional voting and citizens\u2019 assemblies, the case for reviewing the quasi\u2011monarchical powers of the French presidency looks compelling. Mr Macron could usefully use the remainder of his second term to kickstart that process. French voters won\u2019t hold their breath."

            "date": "2023-04-17T05:00:31Z",
            "content": "The Windrush compensation scheme is failing claimants and violating their rights, the first international study into the government\u2019s handling of the immigration scandal has concluded. The Human Rights Watch report is critical of the Home Office\u2019s slow progress towards compensating those affected by the scandal in which thousands of UK residents were wrongly categorised as immigration offenders, and called on the government to launch \u201curgent reform to protect the rights of claimants\u201d. The rights organisation has questioned the wisdom of allowing the Home Office to be in charge of the compensation programme designed to deliver justice to those affected by the department\u2019s mistakes, and recommends handing the scheme to an independent, neutral organisation. The report highlighted the complexity of the 44-page compensation application form, and criticises the absence of legal aid to support applicants, who have found it challenging to provide evidence demonstrating that they lost work, housing, healthcare and benefits as a direct result of the Home Office\u2019s errors. Anna Steiner, a solicitor and senior lecturer at the University of Westminster who co-founded the pro bono Windrush Justice Clinic that assists Windrush claimants, told researchers it took lawyers a minimum of 40 hours to prepare a claim for compensation, with much of that time dedicated to making a detailed statement about the impact the ordeal has had on those affected. The report noted that initial offers of compensation were often very low, but were regularly later increased on appeal. All 11 claimants interviewed for the research said they had appealed against their initial compensation offer, and this was confirmed as standard practice by lawyers who assisted claimants. Steiner said in some cases where applications were resubmitted without new evidence the Home Office had doubled its first compensation offer, suggesting that the officials did not pay close attention to the evidence the first time around. Two claimants interviewed for the study said they had been made homeless after being misclassified as immigration offenders, but had later been unable to prove to the satisfaction of compensation scheme caseworkers that their homelessness was the result of being unable to prove their lawful immigration status, because they had no paperwork stating clearly that this was the case. \u201cI can\u2019t put across how tiring and traumatic the scheme is. It\u2019s so draining,\u201d Charlotte Tobierre, who helped her father claim compensation after he lost his job when he was stripped of his legal status, told researchers. The Human Rights Watch study is published exactly five years after Theresa May apologised for the mistakes made by her Home Office, many of which were the direct result of the introduction of a series of hostile environment policies. \u201cFive years after the Windrush scandal came to light, the Home Office compensation scheme is compounding its injustice by denying claimants their right to redress for the life-altering losses and negative effects it has had on their lives for years,\u201d said Almaz Teffera, researcher on racism in Europe at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe failure of the Windrush compensation scheme and the scandal itself are connected to unresolved institutional racism that dates back to the British Empire. To avoid more Windrush-style scandals, the UK government should urgently reform its immigration system in response to international and national concerns about the existence of deeply rooted racism.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said a series of improvements had been made to the scheme, adding: \u201cWe remain absolutely committed to righting the wrongs of Windrush and have paid or offered more than \u00a368m in compensation to the people affected. The home secretary continues to co-host Windrush Working Group meetings to discuss how we can work together to drive further improvements.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-04-27T00:22:06Z",
            "content": "As appears to be almost compulsory for high-profile, rightwing television presenters, Fox News\u2019 recently departed prime-time host Tucker Carlson is a climate science denier. Carlson would preach regularly to his nightly audience of more than 3 million viewers about how concerns over climate change were like a religion, and that \u201cthe entire theory [of human-caused climate] is absurd\u201d. In 2020 with fierce wildfires burning in the country\u2019s west, Carlson rejected links between the fires and global heating, saying that to Democrats \u201cclimate change is like systemic racism in the sky. You can\u2019t see it, but rest assured it\u2019s everywhere and it\u2019s deadly.\u201d Last month, Carlson said while \u201cthe climate is changing now\u201d humans hadn\u2019t caused it. Even then, he said, climate change was a \u201cmixed blessing\u201d with upsides and downsides. Just before we go on, let\u2019s just put a marker down there on the scale of denial on show. Carlson\u2019s position contradicts every major scientific academy on the planet, and more than half a century of detailed study, observation and experimentation. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In last month\u2019s 13-minute diatribe, Carlson told viewers they shouldn\u2019t trust climate change experts, rattling through a laundry list of claimed errors from scientists in the past. Let\u2019s check on a few of them. Carlson said \u201cthe world\u2019s most famous climate change expert, Greta Thunberg\u201d had recently deleted a tweet that said a scientist had claimed climate change would \u201cwipe out all of humanity unless we stop using fossil fuels over the next five years\u201d. Leaving aside that Thunberg isn\u2019t a climate scientist, she did delete a tweet earlier this year that she posted in 2018 when she was 15. That tweet linked to an article with the headline \u201cTop climate scientist: humans will go extinct if we don\u2019t fix climate change by 2023\u201d. But as factcheckers at Snopes and Associated Press have both pointed out, the article it linked to didn\u2019t say humanity would vanish by 2023. The scientist quoted in the article told AP the headline was \u201ca total distortion of what I said\u201d. Next, Carlson quoted several articles and headlines from the 1970s that warned the world was heading for an ice age. \u201cBut by the early 1980s, when the ice didn\u2019t arrive, the expert decided the problem wasn\u2019t too much cold. It was too much heat. It was global warming,\u201d said Carlson. Climate science deniers like to reach for newspaper cuttings from the 1970s that warned of a coming ice age to suggest scientists might be wrong now about global heating. But a review of scientific papers between 1965 and 1979 found that of 71 studies on the trajectory of future global temperatures, just seven thought the world would cool, with 44 projecting warming (with 20 papers neutral). So despite the existence of some news reports, the consensus among scientists even in the 1970s was that the world would warm. And it has. Carlson also showed a clip of an interview with famed astrophysicist and science presenter Neil deGrasse Tyson \u201csaying that by 2014, the Statue of Liberty will soon be underwater\u201d. Actually, no. The clip used by Carlson was from 2014, not a prediction of what would happen soon after. DeGrasse Tyson wasn\u2019t predicting anything, but rather illustrating how high sea levels could eventually rise if the ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland melted. Carlson credited the Competitive Enterprise Institute for the \u201cresearch\u201d on past predictions \u2013 an organisation with a long history promoting climate science denial while accepting donations from fossil fuel companies and conservative foundations. Dr John Cook, an expert on climate science denial at the Melbourne Centre for Behaviour Change at the University of Melbourne, said: \u201cOne of the most common techniques in climate misinformation is trying to erode public trust in climate science through personal attacks and straw man arguments. \u201cThe hypocrisy is that inconsistencies and failed predictions from climate deniers \u2013 of which there are many \u2013 are studiously ignored.\u201d Defence gone woke? The Sky News Australia host Chris Kenny was deeply worried this week that the government\u2019s defence strategic review mentioned climate change. \u201cThis is an important document. It should be hard-nosed and clear,\u201d said Kenny. \u201cOur defence posture is no place for virtue signalling and woke nonsense. \u201cBut yes, you guessed it, this document includes a section on climate change, declaring it as a national security issue.\u201d But discussion of climate change in government defence documents is nothing new and goes back well before conservatives came up with the nondescript catch-all phrase \u201cwoke\u201d for anything that upsets them. A 2009 Rudd government defence white paper discussed climate change extensively. The Gillard government\u2019s national security strategy said climate change \u201cmay contribute to instability and tension around the globe\u201d. A 2013 defence white paper warned armed forces needed to \u201cbe prepared for some of the consequences of global climate system changes, such as potentially increased demands for the Australian Defence Force to undertake humanitarian and disaster relief responses both domestically and across the region\u201d. In a 2021 report to the US National Security Council, the famously-woke US Department of Defense wrote that climate change was \u201creshaping the geostrategic, operational, and tactical environments with significant implications for US national security and defense\u201d. Robert Glasser, the head of the Climate and Security Policy Centre at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said the suggestion the latest review was \u201cno place\u201d for climate change was \u201cwrong and ill-informed\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s just not controversial and it\u2019s well accepted across our closest allies,\u201d he said."

            "title": "Cyclone damage shows New Zealand\u2019s beekeepers are unprepared for climate change",
            "date": "2023-04-21T20:00:50Z",
            "content": "Two months after a cyclone swept away thousands of beehives in the fertile fruit bowl of New Zealand\u2019s North Island and left thousands more unreachable, beekeepers are facing a painful and costly recovery that has prompted questions of how they will adapt to the intensifying climate crisis. When Cyclone Gabrielle roared across the North Island in February, killing 11 people and wreaking billions of dollars in damage, it tore apart the orchards and vineyards of Hawke\u2019s Bay and the East Coast \u2013 where pip fruit, kiwifruit and wine are export earners \u2013 and destroyed 5,000 to 6,000 of the beehives that pollinate them. It represented \u201cseverity and damage that \u2026 has not been experienced in a generation\u201d, the prime minister, Chris Hipkins, said. The storm came just a fortnight after record floods in Auckland, and followed declarations from insurers that 2022 had been the most costly on record for climate-related weather claims in New Zealand, a country that has 15,000km of coastline and is vulnerable to rising and heating seas. As the cyclone cleanup began, beekeepers said the disaster had underscored the need for more climate planning. \u201cWe can\u2019t just carry on doing what we\u2019ve done before and hoping things will be OK,\u201d says Barry Foster, an East Coast beekeeper who has been coordinating recovery efforts. \u201cClimate change is here and it\u2019s going to get more intense and worse.\u201d The sector has not \u201creally had that sort of discussion\u201d, Foster says, adding it would have to be facilitated across primary industries because beekeepers rely on farm and orchard land to host their hives. Honey represented less than 1% of New Zealand\u2019s export products in the year to June 2022 \u2013 earning $453m in revenue \u2013 but its footprint is larger than sales. Beekeeping sustains the country\u2019s horticulture sector, and honey \u2013 particularly the indigenous m\u0101nuka type \u2013 has had outsized marketing and tourism appeal abroad. The hives wrecked in the cyclone were a small number of the about 650,000 to 750,000 across New Zealand, and towering stockpiles of honey that grew during the past two years of the pandemic prevented the cyclone from denting supply for now. But beekeepers say the full scale of the damage is not known yet and their fates are closely tied to those of orchardists who use their hives for pollination. Thousands of hives in remote areas remain unreachable, with dozens of roads and bridges in the region impassable. Some beekeepers in Hawke\u2019s Bay are facing six-hour drives to check beehives 50km away, while others say their hives would take days to reach. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably know the number of hives lost in a year\u2019s time,\u201d says David Hills, the secretary of Beekeepers Hawke\u2019s Bay. \u201cSo many of these rural roads just don\u2019t have access and actually getting around some of those farms where the beehives are may not be possible until maybe October or November next year.\u201d That poses threats \u2013 both to the bees, which need to be fed after a harsh winter and an unproductive summer, and from diseases like varroa mite and American foul brood, which are destructive if not treated. The final straw The ministry for primary industries announced last month that the sector body Apiculture New Zealand would distribute $250,000 in funding to affected beekeepers to tackle biosecurity risks. The grants can be used for fuel, equipment hire and additional wages needed to assist in the recovery and retrieval of damaged gear and hives \u2013 but not to replace destroyed hives, or for the cost of disease treatments. Beekeepers welcomed the funding, but say it will only help those with access to their hives, or who still have hives to clear up. Some beehives had simply vanished during the storm; others were found kilometres away, buried under silt. Civil defence funding was offered by the government after the disaster, but it only covers salaries and wages. No further recovery funds have been announced for the sector. \u201cMost beekeepers don\u2019t have insurance on bees because most people can\u2019t get that,\u201d says Lars Janson, chief executive of Melita Honey in Hawke\u2019s Bay, who lost nearly 768 hives in the cyclone. The company has plenty of honey stocked and its exports will not be affected, he says. But beekeepers in the region say they know of others for whom Cyclone Gabrielle was the final straw. \u201cSome people had been leaving the industry already, because it has been pretty tough,\u201d says Karin Kos, chief executive of Apiculture New Zealand. \u201cMost definitely for some of those beekeepers in affected areas, there will be commercial decisions made that it\u2019s probably time for them to leave the industry.\u201d Some beekeepers say that vying for available land to place hives on has become such a hot contest that a cooling of the industry was welcome \u2013 but the fact it has been prompted in part by a savage natural disaster was not. \u201cIt truly hasn\u2019t been easy for beekeepers over the past two or three years, particularly if you don\u2019t own a brand,\u201d says Janson. \u201cWe do need some of the young guys that have got into the industry over the last few years who are good beekeepers to remain, otherwise it\u2019s not good for us in the long term.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-04-13T14:39:56Z",
            "content": "The German CEO of Europe\u2019s largest media publisher tried to use his flagship tabloid, Bild, to influence the outcome of Germany\u2019s last election and fed the newspaper his personal views attacking climate change activism, Covid measures and the former chancellor Angela Merkel, leaked messages suggest. The internal chats, emails and text messages published by the German weekly Die Zeit on Wednesday clash with the public presentation of Axel Springer SE\u2019s chief executive, Mathias D\u00f6pfner, who recently said he wanted to bring \u201cnon-partisan\u201d journalism to a too-polarised US media landscape through his acquisition of the English-language title Politico. In one of the messages quoted verbatim in Die Zeit, from 2017, D\u00f6pfner says: \u201cI am all for climate change,\u201d seemingly arguing that human civilisation in periods of warm climate was always \u201cmore successful\u201d than during cold-climate periods. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t fight climate change but adjust to it.\u201d The comments are part of a longer message in which D\u00f6pfner sums up his foreign policy views as \u201cFree west, fuck the intolerant Muslims and all the other riff-raff.\u201d D\u00f6pfner, who holds a 22% share in the Berlin-based company Axel Springer and sits on the board of directors of Netflix, repeatedly voiced his distrust of the population of the formerly socialist states of eastern Germany. \u201cThe ossis [east Germans] are either communists or fascists. They don\u2019t do in-between. Disgusting.\u201d In a message from October 2019, the top executive ponders writing an article on the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall in which he calls for rescinding reunification and turning the former GDR into an \u201cagrarian and production zone with uniform wage payments\u201d. \u201cMy mother always said it. The ossis are never going to be democrats.\u201d In a statement uploaded to Axel Springer\u2019s internal message board on Thursday and seen by the Guardian, D\u00f6pfner said: \u201cArticles of mine published over four decades show the way I think. I let myself be taken to account for every published word. But out-of-context fragments of texts and conservations cannot be held up as my \u2018true way of thinking\u2019.\u201d Referencing the passages on climate change, east Germany and Islam, D\u00f6pfner said he believed that \u201cclimate change is real and threatening\u201d but that he reserved the right to make fun of some of the reactions to the subject. He said he held \u201cno prejudices\u201d against east Germans or Muslims, but he was concerned about the success of the far right in the east and radical Islam. In its report, Die Zeit said D\u00f6pfner\u2019s personal dislike of the GDR-raised ex-chancellor Merkel had put D\u00f6pfner on a collision course with Friede Springer, the widow of the company founder Axel and its majority shareholder. While Friede Springer wrote to Bild\u2019s then editor, Julian Reichelt, at the start of the pandemic in 2020 to praise Merkel\u2019s leadership, D\u00f6pfner railed against pandemic restrictions brought in by the then chancellor. \u201cThat is the end of the market economy,\u201d he wrote after the German parliament passed a historic aid package to shield the economy from coronavirus-related shocks. \u201cAnd the beginning of 33,\u201d D\u00f6pfner added, seemingly a reference to the year Adolf Hitler was appointed chancellor and turned Germany into a dictatorship. Messages quoted by Die Zeit also show the publishing executive enthusiastic in his praise for Donald Trump after the January 2020 killing of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani by an American drone strike. \u201cMy suggestion. Nobel peace prize for Trump,\u201d one message reads. \u201cAnd take it away from ibama [sic].\u201d Barack Obama was given the Nobel peace prize in 2009. The publication of the leaked messages comes a year and a half after D\u00f6pfner cut ties with the editor of Bild over allegations of sexual misconduct. At the time, the executive presented the issue as a \u201cculture problem\u201d specific to the notoriously pugilistic rightwing tabloid, unconnected to the modern publishing empire. Last September, D\u00f6pfner told the Washington Post that through his acquisition of Politico he wanted to \u201cprove that being nonpartisan is actually the more successful positioning\u201d, describing that approach as his \u201cbiggest and most contrarian bet\u201d. In Germany, the publication of the leaked texts has sent shock waves through the country\u2019s political circles, not least because D\u00f6pfner has long successfully presented himself as something more akin to a public intellectual than a business manager. While his standing as a respectable figure was shaken by the scandal around Julian Reichelt, D\u00f6pfner\u2019s former protege at Bild, the fallout was limited. In June last year, D\u00f6pfner stepped down as president of the Federation of German Newspaper Publishers. The leaked messages also raise specific questions about close links between the Springer publishing empire \u2013 whose flagship titles includes Bild, Die Welt, Business Insider and Politico \u2013 and the pro-business Free Democratic party (FDP), a junior partner in Olaf Scholz\u2019s three-party coalition government. Citing a dinner with the FDP leader, Christian Lindner, D\u00f6pfner repeatedly urged Reichelt as Bild editor to \u201cdo more for the FDP\u201d in the run-up to the September 2021 federal elections. \u201cPlease strengthen the FDP,\u201d he wrote two days before the vote. \u201cIf they do well they can act with such authority in the traffic light [coalition of Social Democrats, Green party and FDP] that it collapses.\u201d Such a collapse, the message intimates, would bring about his preferred outcome of a conservative-led so-called \u201cJamaica\u201d coalition between Christian Democrats, Greens and FDP. In his statement issued on Thursday afternoon, D\u00f6pfner responded to the allegation that he used Bild as a tool to further his own political interests. \u201cIn the spirit of freedom and variety of speech I enjoy having arguments \u2013 especially with our editors, who are all responsible and self-confident,\u201d he said. \u201cThat also explicitly applies to alleged influence taken in regards to the FDP. I am very close to the values of this party. But thank God our journalists won\u2019t let themselves be influenced.\u201d Reichelt has not responded to German media requests on the leaked messages. Die Zeit cited Reichelt\u2019s lawyer questioning the legality of the disciplinary procedure that led to his ousting and announcing his intention to take legal steps against Axel Springer in Germany and the US."

            "date": "2023-04-11T09:00:44Z",
            "content": "Is there any hope? Are we all doomed? I write books about the climate crisis, so I am often asked fearful questions like these. But I\u2019m being asked them more and more often and by younger people, an alarming trend not unconnected to the number of scientific reports detailing how humans are pushing the Earth\u2019s systems to dangerous extremes. I write about planetary-scale ecosystem destruction but, importantly, I also focus on our species\u2019 extraordinary capacity to adapt; this has been key to our success in the past \u2013 and it is key to surviving our future. There are radical, yet pragmatic, solutions to our crises. But fear of what will happen if we don\u2019t act is imprisoning people in a mindset that makes alternatives seem unthinkable. I am frequently told my solutions are unrealistic and will never happen; that people would rather fight each other in wars than adapt to share food and land, for instance. We make our own future, even if it\u2019s hard to see the process. So let me try to make the case for hope. We are living inside the imagination of our ancestors. Everything we see around us exists only because it first took shape in somebody\u2019s mind. Ideas such as democracy, public libraries, the abolition of slavery, municipal sewage, aeroplanes, seatbelt regulations, eating with cutlery, the very building you\u2019re sitting inside right now \u2026 they were all birthed in a person\u2019s imagination, then actively formed into a shareable vision that others could collectively mould, modify, reimagine and nurture in their minds. Eventually, a concept that once existed solely inside a person\u2019s mind \u2013 an idea that may have seemed impossible, wildly unachievable, even crazy to that person\u2019s society \u2013 became our unremarkable reality, part of what is normal. This is the magic that made our wonderful, imperfect world. Today, looking at the state of, well, everything, it can seem as if we are stuck in a socioeconomic status quo, condemned to a scary future. We are experiencing worsening global crises, ranging from climate chaos to biodiversity loss and food shortages. Looking ahead to more extreme weather conditions, and an ever larger human population that will need to be fed even as agriculture becomes more precarious, can feel desperately bleak. The scale and urgency of our crises are overwhelming and the mismatch in the ambition of our leaders to address these challenges feels frightening. It\u2019s a burden that weighs particularly heavily on young people, who naturally have the greatest stake in the decades to come. People are anxious and afraid. Eco-anxiety stems from a sense of hopelessness and the realisation that there are limits to how much agency we have as individuals to affect global change. But we are not hopeless, far from it. The future is still unwritten; we cannot know what it holds, but we will make it first in our minds, in our imaginations. In this time of multiple global crises, we need true leadership with vision to help us forge a path towards a sustainable future \u2013 yet we have the lowest calibre of leaders right now. Instead of aligning policy to clearly stated goals on climate targets or poverty reduction or biodiversity, governments are blundering around with mixed messages and policies that undermine their goals or deliver little progress. We need honesty from our leaders about what our choices are and what the trade-offs will be for each of us. There are no easy options now, but there are still plenty of choices for us to discuss, debate and democratically decide on. But we need first to decide what kind of future we want, what is important to us, and what kind of society we want to live in. Only then can we take pragmatic steps towards a future we envision. First, we have to notice. We have to raise our heads from the all-consuming business of daily life and pay attention to what is wrong with today\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d: notice who in our society is being failed and which of our human activities are damaging our communities and natural spaces. See the opportunities in what needs to be fixed. Understand not just intellectually, but emotionally what we face as our world heats. And then actively choose to imagine an alternative, a future that is livable. Be pragmatic: how do we get to this future from our current reality? We may lack leadership, but we have our own imaginations. Choose to conjure that vision of a livable future. What does your ideal neighbourhood look like? For me, it is vibrant with people and plants, safe to walk and cycle in, comfortably sheltered from extreme weathers and rich in community spaces. It will mean rethinking our cities, planning the architecture, materials and energy systems for sustainability, so our buildings generate rather than simply use energy, for instance. We\u2019re in a transition right now to a greener economy \u2013 we can seize this opportunity to reset all aspects of our society, to make things fairer and more sustainable. Do you want a world where the verges are lined with flowers? Then plant them. Be a guerrilla gardener everywhere, sowing ideas like seeds. Find a tribe of like-minded people or make your own, and focus on achievable tasks: litter-picking to improve your local environment immediately; campaign for safer cycle routes; increase the plant-based meal options in your workplace or school; welcome migrants into your group. One person can generate an idea, but it takes a community to create a reality, to come together and shift policy. Take heart, as I do, from the many groups already striving around the world. Think more broadly, think longer-term. Refuse to limit your mind to the narrow realm of today\u2019s political circus. Don\u2019t get stuck thinking that things have to be the same as before \u2013 stasis is death. Don\u2019t think they will inevitably get worse. Be brave as you explore your futures. Imagine 9 billion people having enough nutritious food, clean rivers bubbling with fish, restored wildlands, cheap, abundant energy, a livable future. If anyone tells you it\u2019s impossible, ask why. Is it impossible because of the laws of physics, or is it impossible because of the rules of society? Because society changes. We change it; often extremely fast. The scale and nature of the challenges we face demand a step-change in response \u2013 a vision that is more than an iteration. We need bold, imaginative ideas and true leadership. And nothing can be done without collaboration, a shared vision for a better world. Let\u2019s do this!

            "content": "On some otherwise cloudless days, the sky over England is criss-crossed with contrails from high-flying aircraft. These are a rapid accelerator of climate change. Contrails may last only half a day but they cause as much global heating in that time as the carbon dioxide released on the entire flight, although this exhaust gas will survive in the atmosphere for 100 years. This startling fact came up in a general discussion about how to cut emissions from aviation with new fuels, hydrogen, biofuels and electric engines. None of these possible solutions will be developed quickly and all will be more expensive than existing technology, but the Whittle Laboratory in Cambridge believes that reducing contrails on the routes in the northern hemisphere with the heaviest traffic would have an immediate beneficial impact. Although contrails are common, their formation largely depends on the atmospheric conditions. At different times on different days, flights may produce long-lasting cloud formations or none. With aircraft travelling so fast, it is impossible for pilots to see the contrails far behind. Flying at lower heights would slightly increase fuel costs but massively reduce contrails. Scientists are trying to find a workable solution to help governments eliminate the familiar white lines across our skies that are so rapidly warming the planet."

            "date": "2023-04-20T15:00:48Z",
            "content": "Emissions from Chevron\u2019s Gorgon gas development off Western Australia have increased by more than 50% despite it being home to the world\u2019s largest industrial carbon capture and storage system. There has been a sharp drop in the amount of CO2 stored underground at the liquefied natural gas plant over the last three years, data released by Chevron showed. The development off the Pilbara coast was approved on the condition the company store about 4m tonnes of CO2 a year that would have otherwise escaped from reservoirs during extraction and been released into the atmosphere. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The company was to pump that CO2 into a natural reservoir 2km beneath Barrow Island. But the CCS development was delayed for more than three years and has failed to reach its promised storage level since it began operating in August 2019. The Gorgon facility injected 1.6m tonnes into the reservoir last financial year, down from 2.2m tonnes in 2020-21 and 2.7m in 2019-20. Last year\u2019s drop in CO2 storage coincided with a big jump in onsite emissions from the Gorgon LNG operation, from 5.5m tonnes to 8.3m tonnes. It made the facility Australia\u2019s biggest single major industrial emitter, according to government data. Chevron Australia exported a record 16.7m tonnes of LNG for the year from Gorgon as international gas prices surged after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. A company spokesperson acknowledged the decline in emissions storage, and said it was working on a project to improve a pressure management system that was preventing more CO2 being injected under the island. This would \u201cenable carbon dioxide storage rates to increase over time\u201d. Climate campaigners say the failure of the Gorgon CCS project to deliver what was promised illustrates how little progress the technology has made despite decades of promises. Kim Garratt, an investigator with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said CCS developments were \u201cbeing slapped on to otherwise unacceptable projects to make them seem like reasonable options\u201d. She said the situation at Gorgon was foreseeable, pointing to a 2006 recommendation by the WA Environment Protection Authority that the development should not be approved as there would be \u201cunacceptable impacts\u201d if the CCS plan did not capture a high percentage of reservoir emissions. \u201cHere we are, almost two decades later, and this unacceptable project is up and running and pumping out as much pollution as 2.5m cars every year,\u201d Garratt said. Big promises but little progress The problems in getting the Gorgon CCS development fully operational comes as international organisations, governments and particularly the gas industry continue to stress the technology\u2019s importance in meeting global climate goals. It is regularly included in modelling to support targets of net zero emissions by 2050. In Australia the technology has been promised billions of dollars in public funding this century for little result. The Gorgon project, which remains the sole commercial CCS development operating in Australia, received $60m in federal support. Internationally, according to the Global CCS Institute, there were 30 CCS projects in operation last year, with a combined maximum capacity of 42m tonnes of CO2 a year \u2013 about 0.1% of global emissions. It said 11 more were under construction. Under its terms of approval, the Gorgon development was expected to sequester at least 80% of reservoir gas across a rolling five-year period starting in 2016. The company was not required to capture emissions released during LNG processing. It meant even a fully successful CCS facility would reduce total onsite emissions from Gorgon by only about 40%. The company missed this target by more than 5m tonnes. It agreed to buy the equivalent amount in carbon offsets and invest $40m in \u201clow carbon energy projects\u201d. The forecast cost of the offsets at the time was between $78m and $194m. Chevron, which operates the Gorgon facility on behalf of partners including Shell and ExxonMobil, said managing emissions was \u201can integral part\u201d of how it planned and ran its business. Its spokesperson said the CCS project had stored more than 7.8m tonnes of CO2 since it started operating, demonstrating the \u201cmeaningful contribution CCS technology can play in the pursuit of a lower carbon future\u201d. The company had also bought more than 7.5m tonnes worth of carbon offsets over the life of the project. \u201cEmissions increased in 2021/22, primarily as a result of the return to three-train operations and increased reliability at the Gorgon natural gas facility following reduced production in the prior period due to equipment repairs,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cReduced CO2 injection rates at the Gorgon CCS system also contributed to the overall increase in emissions.\u201d Garratt said the latest government data showed the Gorgon plant was a bigger emitter within Australia than any coalmine. She said it led to much higher emissions after its LNG was shipped and burned in Asian countries. New LNG developments have led to a significant increase in national industrial emissions over the past decade, and wiped out cuts in pollution from electricity generation due to an influx of solar and wind energy. The Albanese government says a revamp of the climate policy known as the safeguard mechanism, which passed through parliament with support from the Greens and independents, would prevent further combined increases in industrial emissions and lead to cuts over time. Combined CO2 emissions from the 215 polluting facilities covered by the safeguard mechanism last year were 137.5m tonnes \u2013 higher than in 2020-21, but still slightly less than pre-pandemic levels. Under the changes to the scheme, emitting sites will be set new emissions intensity limits \u2013 known as baselines \u2013 before 1 July that will be reduced in most cases by 4.9% a year. Companies can meet targets through direct onsite cuts in pollution and by buying contentious carbon offsets. It is unclear if Gorgon\u2019s baseline will be set at a level that assumes the CCS project is working as promised when the project was approved."

            "date": "2023-04-27T15:00:07Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s record levels of renewable energy helped extend the slide in wholesale power prices in the first three months of 2023, displacing fossil fuels and sending carbon emissions from the sector to new lows for the first quarter. The latest energy dynamics report by the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) showed wholesale spot prices in the national electricity market (NEM) averaged $83/MWh, down more than a 10th from the December quarter and two-thirds lower than the record average $264/MWh in the June quarter last year. Rooftop solar output alone averaged almost 3GW for the March quarter, up 23% from a year earlier. That increase contributed to a drop in \u201coperational demand\u201d in the NEM to an average of 14.38GW, or the lowest since 2005. Low demand records were set in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. \u201cGrowing renewable output across the NEM helped drive a first-quarter record with 12% of dispatch intervals having negative or zero prices,\u201d the Aemo chief executive, Daniel Westerman, said. \u201cBetween 9am and 5pm, wholesale electricity prices were negative in South Australia and Victoria 60% and 55% of the time, respectively.\u201d Gas, typically the most costly fuel for electricity generation, provided its smallest first-quarter share of supplies since 2005. Overall gas demand in eastern Australia fell 9%, with domestic consumption dropping to its lowest for any March quarter since 2016, Aemo said. Aemo\u2019s quarterly energy reports offer snapshots of the electricity sector\u2019s trajectory. Rising energy costs in the past year have been one propellant for inflation, while supply has arguably become less reliable as ageing coal-fired power plants close or break down. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup However the pace of renewable energy\u2019s advance, according to the Clean Energy Council, is not yet sufficient to meet Australia\u2019s emission goals Last winter, authorities suspended the NEM after a cold snap and power station outages strained the grid. Wholesale prices also spiked in February and March in northern regions during late-season heatwaves, revealing shortfalls even after three relatively mild summers in a row. Renewables continue to expand their share of the market, cutting emissions from electricity generation in the process. New and recently commissioned grid-scale solar and wind units lifted generation by an average 330MW and 134MW, respectively, Aemo said. Output averaged 4.65GW, or 11% more than for the March quarter of 2022. For a half hour on 5 March, renewables supplied 65.8% of NEM generation, a record share for that quarter, topping the previous high set a year earlier by 4.4 percentage points. NEM emissions both in total and per MWh declined to record lows for the first quarter of the year. Electricity makes up about one-third of Australia\u2019s carbon pollution, the largest share of the economy. For the quarter, emissions totalled 28.8m tonnes of CO2-equivalent, down by 5.1% from a year earlier. Coal and gas-fired generation dropped 710MW over the year. Gas shed 20%, or 280MW on average from a year ago, to 1.113GW. Black coal-fired generation output eased 1.3%, or 137MW, to about 10.5GW, while brown coal dropped 7.4%, or 293MW, to 3.65GW. The federal climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the report showed the government\u2019s energy price relief plan to cap gas and coal prices in December had \u201cdelivered a near-halving of electricity future prices, which are a big factor on future energy bills\u201d. Future prices for the mainland states in the NEM for the 2023-24 financial year peaked at $230/MWh in the December quarter, before ending 2022 at an average $102/MWh, the report said. However, while those future prices averaged $107/MWh during the March quarter, they ended the month on the rise. New South Wales, which will see the Liddell coal-fired power plant close on Friday, posted the largest rise at 31% among the states to $145/MWh. Queensland\u2019s future prices rose 26% to $126/MWh and Victoria\u2019s 25% to $96/MWh, while South Australia\u2019s was little changed for the quarter at $113/MWh. Separately, NSW regulator IPART will lift the price paid to households exporting surplus solar power to the grid by as much as 89%, reflecting higher wholesale electricity prices. Exporters will receive 7.7 to 9.4 cents/kWh in 2023-24 from their electricity retailer. \u201cWholesale prices have increased significantly over the last year, mainly due to the war in Ukraine which has led to higher gas and coal prices and disruptions in several large coal-fired power plants,\u201d IPART chair, Carmel Donnelly, said. \u201cIPART\u2019s feed-in tariff benchmark is up from around five cents this time last year.\u201d The last big increase was in 2017-18, when IPART effectively doubled the benchmark feed-in tariff."

            "content": "The UK\u2019s net zero targets will be missed because of a planned \u201croad-building spree\u201d by the Department for Transport, campaigners have said. Officials had to edit the department\u2019s \u201ctransport decarbonisation plan\u201d to add 26 megatonnes of carbon emissions because of an oversight regarding polluting hybrid vehicles, and projections for an increase in van traffic. Documents released by the DfT state: \u201cRecent evidence suggests PHEVs [plug-in hybrid electric vehicles] are 3-5 times more polluting in the real world than in test drives. This adjustment raises baseline emissions. Post-Covid car demand has been lowered by 5% to reflect lower levels of commuting. However, the Department for Transport forecasts that HGV and van miles will be higher than that forecast \u2026 due to outturn data showing higher van and HGV traffic than previously assumed.\u201d Campaigners also criticised a new policy by the DfT which requires decision-makers to ignore the negative climate impact of road-building and traffic but to give weight to tree planting around schemes as a nature-based solution to climate change. It says an increase in emissions from road schemes is \u201cnot a reason to prohibit\u201d their approval. There are 32m cars on the UK\u2019s roads, and they are growing in number and size. Transport is the country\u2019s largest emitting sector and produced 24% of the UK\u2019s total emissions in 2020. Chris Todd, the director of campaign group Transport Action Network, said: \u201cThe DfT claims this new policy will ensure transport projects \u2018meet environmental targets\u2019. Yet it states that an increase in emissions from road schemes is not \u2018reason to prohibit\u2019 or restrict their approval. \u201cWith the revised net zero strategy admitting we are off track to meet 2030 targets, ministers are deliberately accelerating us towards runaway climate change. We need the public to tell them to slam the brakes on this road-building spree. Instead, we urgently need world-class public transport and active travel, not world-destroying temperature rises.\u201d Friends of the Earth\u2019s head of policy, Mike Childs, said: \u201cFor far too long transport policy has been dominated by motoring and road building, with its consequential and largely ignored impact on climate change and air pollution. \u201cBritain\u2019s transport system needs a change of direction with priority given to better public transport and cycling infrastructure instead of more motoring. Billions of pounds are being squandered on more road-building when more pressing needs are vastly underfunded \u2013 from rural buses to home insulation.\u201d Dr Doug Parr, policy director for Greenpeace UK, added: \u201cAny government which, in the middle of a climate emergency, finds itself planning for a major programme of new roads can count itself as a failure.\u201d The government recently blocked the release of the carbon emission figures behind its transport decarbonisation plan. It blocked academics from seeing the figures, which include data on how much car use would have to be reduced in order to reach net zero commitments. Campaigners say meeting these legally binding targets will be possible only with a drastic reduction in motor traffic, which could make many new road projects financially unviable. A DfT spokesperson said: \u201cThis is incorrect. We are committed to delivering our net zero ambition and this hasn\u2019t changed since we published our world-leading transport decarbonisation plan. In line with best analytical practice, the department continually reviews its projections and makes changes when appropriate to ensure plans are based on the latest scientific data.\u201d"

The geography professor quoted in the article as being unaware of any CCS that works should perhaps take a trip to see one. There are a diversity of opinions on the viability of CCS, and scientists are not uniformly doubting \u2013 see the Royal Society report from 2022. It is also clear from Emily Shuckburgh and Bob Ward that CCS is imperative, which flows directly from the executive summary of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s March 2023 sixth assessment report that mentions \u201cTransition from fossil fuels \u2026 To very low carbon fossil fuels with CCS\u201d.

            "content": "The Australian-US cybersecurity company that last year revealed the extent of TikTok\u2019s data collection says the social media company has increased what location information it collects to include altitude, which could tell it what floor of a building a user is on. Last year Internet 2.0 released a study on the data TikTok attempts to collect on user devices, which includes contact lists and calendars, and its scanning of hard drives and geolocating devices on an hourly basis. At the time TikTok described the report as \u201cbaseless\u201d and said it was no different to the data other social media apps seek. After the report a number of western countries, including Australia, banned the app from government-issued devices amid fears about whether the Chinese government could access data under national security law.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201c[TikTok] have never come back to us and argued the points about the data and their source code,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s their word against the source code. \u201cThey\u2019ve called us names. They said we don\u2019t understand what the code is. But they\u2019ve never come back and qualified or quantify their position.\u201d He said the company had undertaken another analysis of the updated source code and discovered that in addition to latitude and longitude data from a user\u2019s device, the app was now seeking altitude information. \u201cSo if you\u2019re in a high-rise building, they can tell what floor you\u2019re on now,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cAnd that wasn\u2019t previously in their code last year.\u201d A spokesperson for TikTok rejected the claim, saying GPS data was not collected in Australia, and only collected overseas where users enabled it. \u201cWe do not collect GPS location data from users in Australia, nor do we seek permission for this,\u201d they said. \u201cTo clarify, in other regions where a user has enabled and grants access to location services, TikTok collects this information based on device GPS data.\u201d The spokesperson said Internet 2.0 admits their analysis is \u201cnot conclusive and doesn\u2019t include a detailed source code review, which they admit is the best way to assess data collection practices\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s been presented are misleading, inconsistent results based on a flawed and biased analysis that lacked any real depth.\u201d Robinson said with other apps where Internet 2.0 had analysed the source code \u2013 such as with Telegram and Proton \u2013 the companies explained their code or provided more evidence as to what the code does.

            "content": "Russian hackers organised along the lines of the paramilitary Wagner group are seeking \u201cto disrupt or destroy\u201d parts of the UK\u2019s critical national infrastructure, a cabinet minister will warn at a cyber conference in Belfast on Wednesday. Oliver Dowden, the Cabinet Office minister, will issue a national alert to key businesses amid growing international concern that as Russia struggles in Ukraine, an under-pressure Kremlin is searching for new ways to threaten the west. US intelligence that leaked earlier this month warned that Russian hackers had claimed to have taken over control systems belonging to a Canadian gas pipeline at the end of February, with the aim of causing an explosion. Dowden is expected to tell the Cyber UK event that disclosing the threat is \u201cnot something we do lightly\u201d. He will argue it is necessary to get companies in utilities and other critical sectors to realise they have to invest as needed in cybersecurity \u201cto defend themselves and the country\u201d. He will describe the adversaries as \u201cideologically motivated, rather than financially motivated\u201d, adding that they are less likely to show the same level of restraint as those directly employed by a nation state, making the situation \u201cparticularly concerning\u201d. A top-secret intelligence snippet in the Pentagon files that leaked earlier this month warned that a Russian cybercriminal group called Zarya had claimed to have taken over the control systems of the unnamed pipeline. The hackers then asked the country\u2019s FSB spy agency for instructions on what to do next. The hackers \u201cshared screenshots\u201d with the FSB \u201calleging capability to increase valve pressure, disable alarms and initiate an emergency shutdown of an unspecified gas distribution station\u201d, according to the report, based on electronic eavesdropping of communications between the two sides. However, there is no corroborating evidence in the public domain that a natural-gas pipeline company in Canada suffered the hacker attack described or that any explosion took place. The intelligence may also have helped prevent the attack, although it was labelled as being for US eyes only. Royal Mail was targeted by Russian criminal hackers earlier this year, with the LockBit group demanding an $80m ransom, after the attackers had encrypted files crucial to the company\u2019s international operations. It rejected the demands as \u201cabsurd\u201d according to a transcript of the negotiations leaked by the hackers online. Dowden did not name any of the hacker groups, but the reference to Wagner, the large paramilitary group that is playing an important role on the ground in Ukraine, suggests the UK believes efforts are being made to organise the criminal groups of hackers into something more permanent. Critical national infrastructure covers areas such as gas, electricity, telecoms and postal networks as well as the emergency services and other organisations on which daily life relies. Serious attacks remain rare, but in the US, an oil pipeline on the east coast briefly shut down its operations two years ago after it was hacked by an online extortion gang, leading to shortages of petrol and jet fuel. Russian hackers have also targeted Ukrainian utilities, both before and since last year\u2019s full invasion. Ukraine has been able to maintain supplies with the help of the west, although some of the cyber-attacks last autumn were conducted in tandem with missile strikes aimed at power and substations on its energy grid."

            "date": "2023-04-21T12:59:01Z",
            "content": "Mike Lynch, the tech entrepreneur once hailed as Britain\u2019s answer to Bill Gates, has lost an appeal against extradition to the US to answer criminal fraud charges. Lynch, the founding investor of the British cybersecurity firm Darktrace, is facing allegations that he duped the US firm Hewlett-Packard into overpaying when it struck an $11bn deal (\u00a38.2bn) for his software firm Autonomy in 2011. Two high court judges considered Mike Lynch\u2019s challenge at a recent hearing in London and on Friday issued a ruling rejecting his appeal against extradition to face the charges. A spokesperson for Lynch said he was considering appealing to the European court of human rights. \u201cDr Lynch is very disappointed, but is reviewing the judgment and will continue to explore his options to appeal, including to the European court of human rights (ECHR),\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States\u2019 legal overreach into the UK is a threat to the rights of all British citizens and the sovereignty of the UK.\u201d However, criminal defence law firm Corker Binning said that only 8% of applications to the ECHR in such cases \u2013 seeking a Rule 39 order to stop the UK extradition until it has considered the case \u2013 were successful last year. \u201cThe decision signifies the exhaustion of domestic remedies in the UK against the order for his extradition,\u201d said Edward Grange, a partner at Corker Binning. \u201cThere can be no appeal to the supreme court.\u201d Grange said the decision also set an uneasy precedent for UK/US business deals. \u201cThe decision by the high court will do little to ease the anxieties of many UK executives who had an eye on this case, fearing that fallout from business deals involving the US could see them being hauled before US courts many years later,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite this case involving a British national and a British company, the court that will now try the matter will be in the US.\u201d Last year, Hewlett-Packard won a six-year civil fraud case in the UK against Lynch after a high court judge ruled that he had defrauded HP by manipulating Autonomy\u2019s accounts to inflate the value of the company. The then home secretary, Priti Patel, subsequently approved the extradition of Lynch to face criminal trial in the US for 14 counts of conspiracy and fraud over claims that investors in HP lost billions due to his actions. Lynch, who could face a maximum prison sentence of 25 years if found guilty, has always denied the allegations and any wrongdoing. Lord Justice Lewis and Justice Julian Knowles ruled on Friday that Lynch, who made \u00a3500m from the sale to HP and was hailed as one of Britain\u2019s few global tech champions, should be extradited to the US to stand trial. Sushovan Hussain, Autonomy\u2019s former finance director, is already serving time in jail in the US after being found guilty of fraud relating to the same deal Darktrace, which is aiming to become a European cybersecurity power in the US-dominated cybersecurity space, continues to struggle to emerge from Lynch\u2019s shadow. His investment fund Invoke Capital, which was Darktrace\u2019s first and biggest shareholder, retains a 4.2% stake, while his wife, Angela Bacares, owns 6.5%. Jointly, they own shares worth almost \u00a3200m. To create distance, Lynch stepped down from Darktrace\u2019s board in 2018. However, he remained on its advisory council until 2021, when he moved to a newly created science and technology council, which he stepped down from last February. \u201cDr Lynch has no operational, advisory or any other role at Darktrace,\u201d said a spokesperson for the cybersecurity firm. \u201cHis relationship with Darktrace is purely limited to his shareholding in the business.\u201d Darktrace was founded in 2013 by mathematicians from the University of Cambridge, artificial intelligence (AI) experts and cyber specialists from GCHQ. Many of its staff formerly worked at Autonomy, including the chief executive, Poppy Gustafsson. In 2018, Darktrace, which listed on the London Stock Exchange two years ago, was subpoenaed by US authorities for information about Invoke, warning there was a risk of money laundering claims if its backing money included cash from the Autonomy sale. Darktrace has said its liability in this regard is \u201clow-risk\u201d. The company, which has seen its market valuation fall to \u00a31.8bn after hitting a high of almost \u00a37bn as investors rushed to buy in to the firm after its flotation, has also faced attacks from short sellers that have criticised its business practices and management ties with Autonomy."

            "content": "Australia must prepare for a \u201cdystopian future\u201d in which increasingly digitally connected cities may be \u201cheld hostage through interference in everything from traffic lights to surgery schedules\u201d, a senior minister has warned. Clare O\u2019Neil said the Medibank, Optus and Latitude data breaches were only the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d in the cyber threats Australia faced in the years ahead. The minister for home affairs and cybersecurity announced the launch of a new series of exercises to respond to attacks on critical infrastructure. O\u2019Neil told the Sydney Dialogue conference on Tuesday that Australia faced \u201ca scale and intensity in the threat landscape that far outstrips the recent cases we have seen\u201d. She described state-sponsored attackers as \u201cthe apex predators\u201d and said Australia and other like-minded countries would \u201ccall out and attribute these threats where it is in our national interest to do so\u201d. \u201cBut today I want to make the case that the global gang of bad cyber actors and those operating in the grey zone between nation state intent and financially motivated criminal conduct are also just as important when considering cybersecurity as national security.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup O\u2019Neil said financially motivated cyber actors and extortionists were \u201cpublic enemy number one\u201d. \u201cThese groups subvert legitimate business models for financial gain, creating online portals for \u2018hacking as a service\u2019 where anyone can purchase the tools and support necessary to conduct a cyber incident or data, especially in the form of a ransomware attack,\u201d she said. O\u2019Neil, who is overseeing the creation of a new 2030 cyber strategy, said she believed the conversation about cyber threats was \u201ctoo much in the here and now\u201d. She said technology was reshaping cybercrime. While a majority of data breaches today could be traced to human error, she expected to see \u201cmore attacks that are purely technological, and that makes them harder to defend against\u201d. More and more aspects of life were moving online. \u201cThe Internet of Things will see billions more devices connected to the internet \u2013 from our baby monitors to our toasters \u2013 and we\u2019ll have more digitised cities,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. She said she did not want to be alarmist, because \u201cultimately technological shifts are at their core neutral \u2013 it is all about how you harness them\u201d. \u201cLet me be clear, I\u2019m not saying the following dystopian future will happen, but if there is one thing I\u2019ve learned in the cybersecurity portfolio is that you need to plan for the most consequential scenario and work to stop it,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. She asked her audience to \u201cconsider a world\u201d where artificial intelligence-driven movements outpaced cyber defences and quantum computing allowed an attacker to compromise previously secure highly sensitive data. \u201cInstead of data breaches, we could have data integrity attacks \u2013 where small errors are induced in compromised sets with outsize implications, such as financial records,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. \u201cAnd our interconnected cities are held hostage through interference in everything from traffic lights to surgery schedules.\u201d O\u2019Neil announced that the federal government would launch a series of national cyber exercises focusing on critical infrastructure. These aimed to \u201cbuild muscle memory in how to deal with a cyber-attack \u2013 and importantly cover the types of incidents we have not yet experienced on a national scale \u2013 such as a lock-up of critical infrastructure or integrity attacks on critical data\u201d. O\u2019Neil praised Australians for being steadfast \u201cdespite their data, in some cases their most sensitive information, being needlessly compromised\u201d. \u201cFirst of all, ordinary Australians and the media didn\u2019t even think of playing the voyeur in seeing what data they could access on the dark web,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the national mind, diving into stolen data, people\u2019s personal data, was a red line that very few actors had crossed.\u201d O\u2019Neil was speaking at an event organised by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, told the same event earlier on Tuesday that Australia must be at the forefront of technological innovation. While there had been intense focus on the nuclear-powered submarine element of the Aukus agreement with the US and the UK, Marles said the three countries were also collaborating in areas such as hypersonics and artificial intelligence. He said this work on emerging tech would be \u201cfundamentally important for our nation as well\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 April 2023 to change incorrect references to Medicare that should have said Medibank."

At the same time he spoke of his hope of an epoch of renewal in Northern Ireland, restating the \u201cincredible\u201d US investment opportunities that lay ahead if peace endures. Speaking to reporters in Ireland before leaving Ireland West airport on the last leg of his four-day visit to Ireland, Biden was asked whether the last few days had changed his calculus on when to make his announcement on his plans to run. \u201cNo, no I have already made that calculus. We will announce it relatively soon,\u201d he said. \u201cThe trip here just reinforced my sense of optimism about what can be done. I told you my plan is to run again.\u201d On Friday night he bounded on to the stage in Ballina by the banks of the River Moy in a display of energy and stamina after a hectic four-day visit. Arguably, the speech was pitched at the US teatime audience to put to bed voter doubts that, at the age of 80, he is too old to run for another term in the White House. Asked if he had got what he wanted from his four-day trip where he was welcomed like a deity, he said there was \u201cmore to be done\u201d in Northern Ireland. But he said he wanted to imbue a sense of \u201coptimism\u201d about the future there, once again citing the huge economic opportunities for the region, particularly in the cybersecurity sector, a tech sector for which Northern Ireland is already known. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot at stake. A lot at stake. And I think the combination of Ireland \u2013 the whole island \u2013 Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the United States can change the way things occur on the continent. \u201cLook, think about it. Think about how much the economy is growing. Think about what\u2019s happening here. Think about the technology. Think about the cybersecurity capabilities.\u201d At the start of his visit on Wednesday, Biden dangled a $6bn (\u00a35bn) carrot in front of Northern Ireland\u2019s leaders with a promise to boost the country\u2019s economy with US investment if power sharing is restored. The towns of Carlingford and Ballina can expect an enduring tourism bump after the visit, echoing that experienced by New Ross in County Wexford, which has turned itself into a shrine to John F Kennedy that is popular with Irish Americans. Paul Kelly, the chief executive of F\u00e1ilte Ireland, said the tourism board was already building on the global media attention around the two picturesque towns, the birthplaces of two of Biden\u2019s ancestors. Next week, F\u00e1ilte Ireland will host 85 international journalists at the five-star Ashford Castle hotel on the edge of Connemara in a post-pandemic effort to lure US tourists. \u201cFor every euro a visitor spends, they spend two other euros in other parts of the economy, be that eating or going to the local pub or visitor attraction,\u201d Kelly said. The US focus on Northern Ireland has now been handed over to the former US president Bill Clinton, a key player in securing the Belfast Good Friday agreement. As the 46th US president delivered his passionate speech in front of a crowd of 27,000 in Ballina, County Mayo, the 42nd POTUS was landing in Belfast. He is in Northern Ireland for a series of events scheduled for Monday to Wednesday bringing together the key figures behind the peace deal, including Tony Blair, Bertie Ahern and the former US senator George Mitchell. Rishi Sunak and the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will also visit Belfast on Wednesday as efforts continue to get power-sharing restored in Stormont. While Biden\u2019s visit to Ireland was seen as a political and diplomatic success, questions were being asked about taxpayers funding such an extended trip involving a huge delegation that involved the secretary of state and countless other politicians. Asked if he was sad to leave, he said: \u201cNo, I\u2019m anxious to get home. I\u2019m always \u2013 I love Ireland, I love the people, and I love working with the taoiseach. But, you know, home is where my heart is. And it\u2019s real.\u201d Biden was also asked about the suspected leak of hundreds of secret defence documents by a former air national guardsman Jack Teixeira. \u201cI\u2019ve instructed the department to make sure that they get to the root of why he had access in the first place, number one. \u201cAnd number two, to focus extensively on the extent to which it all occurred. And that\u2019s going on right now. I have nothing to report beyond what\u2019s already been reported.\u201d Asked how long it would take, Biden said: \u201cThere\u2019s no way to predict how long an investigation will take. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to take very long.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-04-28T10:50:12Z",
            "content": "The eurozone has defied predictions that the Ukraine war would plunge it into recession after a warm winter blunted the impact of higher energy prices. Data from Eurostat \u2013 the EU\u2019s statistical agency \u2013 showed that growth in the 20 countries using the single currency stood at 0.1% in the first three months of 2023. The small overall increase disguised a wide variation across member states. The eurozone\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, stagnated in the first quarter of 2023 after contracting by 0.5% in the final three months of 2022. Italy and Spain, the third and fourth-biggest eurozone economies, performed better than the markets had been expecting, each posting quarterly growth of 0.5%. France grew by 0.2%. However, analysts said growth prospects were likely to remain weak because of the determination of the European Central Bank (ECB) to combat strong underlying inflationary pressures with higher interest rates. Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe very small increase in GDP in the first quarter means a technical recession has been avoided by a whisker. \u201cHowever, the economy has essentially stalled as domestic demand has been hit hard by the energy shock followed by monetary tightening. We think activity will remain weak in the coming quarters.\u201d The small increase in growth in early 2023 followed a flat picture in the final three months of 2022 and reduced the year-on-year increase in output from 1.8% to 1.3%. Even though the eurozone economy has been flatlining for the past six months, its success in staving off a severe downturn has surprised economists, who this time last year were predicting a severe recession. Carsten Brzeski, the global head of macro at ING bank, said: \u201cMore resilient than expected is clearly one label to put on the eurozone\u2019s economic performance. In fact, the eurozone economy has now been able to avoid what a few months ago was probably the best predicted recession ever. \u201cThe warmer winter weather, lower wholesale energy prices, the reopening of China and fiscal stimulus are the key drivers behind this better-than-expected performance.\u201d Neil Birrell, the chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors, said: \u201cThe eurozone economy has been resilient in the face of energy price increases and rate hikes over the past few months, and while growth is slowing, this remained the case in the first quarter. \u201cHowever, we are still likely to see the ECB press ahead with tighter policy measures when they meet on 4 May. There is nothing in this dataset to suggest that the economy is stalling or that inflation is beaten. In fact, the inflation data at country level suggests the opposite.\u201d The annual inflation rate in the eurozone came down sharply in March from 8.5% to 6.9% but the ECB is concerned about core inflation, which excludes food and energy. This rose from 5.6% to a new record high of 5.7% last month, prompting forecasts that the ECB will raise rates by 0.25 percentage points when it meets next week."

            "content": "China\u2019s economy rebounded faster than expected, surpassing growth estimates for the first quarter of the year, after the country relaxed its onerous Covid-19 restrictions and consumer spending surged. The world\u2019s second largest economy grew at a rate of 4.5% compared with the same quarter a year earlier, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The pace of increase was the fastest in a year and beat the 4% rise forecast by analysts polled by Reuters. China\u2019s consumer economy showed signs of resurgence, with retail sales rising 10.6% in March, representing the biggest jump in almost two years and more than double the forecast rate. During the same month, industrial production also rose 3.9% compared with a year earlier, a five-month high. \u201cThe speed of the recovery has exceeded even our relatively upbeat expectations,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, adding that full-year growth could reach 6%, exceeding the government\u2019s official target of about 5%. \u201cWith consumer confidence on the mend and credit growth accelerating, there is still scope for a further pickup in activity over the coming months,\u201d he said. China\u2019s economy is accelerating after pandemic restrictions and trade restrictions with the US slowed growth. For almost three years the Chinese government persisted with rolling lockdowns and mass testing to stop Covid-19 from spreading. In 2022, China\u2019s GDP expanded at its slowest pace since the mid-1970s, bar the Covid-hit 2020 year. After widespread protests in November, health authorities abruptly ended most quarantine requirements and reopened borders for international travellers, creating chaotic scenes across the country as the death toll from Covid-19 suddenly spiked. Analysts has expressed concern that disruptions to supply chains could dent China\u2019s economic recovery. In March, China set a modest annual growth target of 5%, while admitting that Covid-19 and other domestic and international factors had affected the country\u2019s economy \u201cbeyond our expectations\u201d."

            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy recorded growth of 0.0% in February as a wave of public sector strikes weighed on activity, offsetting a recovery in consumer spending despite the cost of living crisis. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the economy ground to a halt in February, falling below City expectations for a 0.1% month-on-month rise in gross domestic product (GDP), the total value added by the production of goods and services across the economy. It followed growth of 0.4% in January, as revisions to earlier estimates pushed the economy back above pre-pandemic levels. However, the UK\u2019s recovery to pre-Covid levels remained slower than that of any other G7 economy. The ONS said construction grew strongly after a poor start to the year, with increased repair work taking place, alongside a boost from retail as many shops had a strong month for sales. However, it said this had been offset by civil service and teachers\u2019 strikes, hitting activity in the public sector, while unseasonably mild weather led to a fall in the use of electricity and gas. Manufacturing showed zero growth, while the UK\u2019s dominant services sector fell by 0.1%, down from a revised growth rate of 0.7% a month earlier. The figures come hours after the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, insisted the UK would do \u201csignificantly better\u201d than the International Monetary Fund\u2019s forecast on Tuesday that the economy was expected to shrink by 0.3% this year. Speaking to Bloomberg News on the sidelines of the fund\u2019s spring meetings in Washington on Wednesday night, he said: \u201cWe will do better than that.\u201d Despite February\u2019s flat performance, the chancellor said on Thursday that Britain\u2019s economic outlook was \u201cbrighter than expected\u201d, as he argued the country was set to avoid a recession this year. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said the figures showed the economy was inching along. \u201cDespite our enormous promise and potential as a country, Britain is still lagging behind on the global stage with growth on the floor,\u201d she said. Strikes by teachers nationwide at the start of the month and in some regions of England on 28 February had the biggest drag on growth, pulling down output in the education sector by 1.7%. Strikes in the civil service at the start of February also weighed on growth. Highlighting the impact of industrial action on the economy, the figures came as junior doctors in England staged a four-day strike in a deteriorating dispute over pay, amid government resistance to bigger wage increases across the public sector. Output in the rest of the economy \u2013 the private sector \u2013 rose by 0.2%, as analysts said Britain\u2019s economy appeared to be performing better than feared thanks to unexpected resilience in consumer spending. In consumer-facing services output grew by 0.4%, an acceleration on January\u2019s growth of 0.3%. Production output \u2013 which includes energy generation, mining, and manufacturing \u2013 fell on the month, as warmer weather led to a drop in demand as many families turned down the thermostat. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said stronger wage growth and cost of living support from the government was helping to bolster household incomes, supporting the economy\u2019s stronger than expected performance in recent months. \u201cThe overall sense is that the economy is still proving resilient to the twin drags of high inflation and high interest rates,\u201d he said. Economists said Britain was likely to avoid a recession at the start of the year, but warned that high inflation and the delayed impact of previous interest rate increases from the Bank of England would likely spell a weak growth outlook at best. After a stronger than expected January and flat performance in February, analysts said GDP would need to shrink by 0.5% or more in March for the economy to record a quarter of contraction. Two quarters of falling GDP are considered the technical definition of a recession. Thomas Pugh, an economist at the accountancy firm RSM UK, said: \u201cIt\u2019s more or less a 50:50 call as to whether the UK falls into a technical recession this year, the degree of strike activity may tip the balance. But even if the UK avoids a recession, growth is likely to be meagre through the rest of this year.\u201d"

            "content": "Consumers splashing out on holidays has helped put Britain\u2019s economy on track to avoid predictions of a contraction in the first three months of the year, paving the way for the Bank of England to raise interest rates next month. The latest monthly snapshot from S&amp;P Global and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) showed the fastest rebound in private sector output in a year, fuelled by rising spending on travel, leisure and entertainment. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said the report indicated the economy grew by 0.4% in the first quarter. That would be a much stronger performance than predicted by the Bank of England, which has forecast the UK economy would contract by 0.1% between January and March, as households and businesses come under growing pressure from the highest levels of inflation for four decades. The figure will be published by the Office for National Statistics next month. A 12th consecutive interest rate increase at the Bank\u2019s next meeting on 11 May was \u201can increasingly done deal\u201d, Williamson added. \u201cThe key takeaway is that the economy as a whole is not only showing encouraging resilience but has gained growth momentum heading into the second quarter.\u201d The monthly survey of 1,300 service sector and manufacturing firms, which is closely watched by the Bank and the Treasury, showed pockets of resilience in the economy despite the cost of living crisis. The flash composite purchasing managers index, compiled from firms\u2019 survey responses on current economic conditions, rose from 52.2 in March to 53.9 in April, the highest level for 12 months. A reading of 50.0 separates private sector growth from contraction. The figures come after the boss of easyJet suggested earlier this week that British consumers were shrugging off cost of living crisis concerns to focus their spending on experiences. \u201cWhile there is a squeeze on people\u2019s incomes, people prioritise holidays and travel even more than they did before,\u201d Johan Lundgren said. \u201cThis is driven by the fact that people are refocusing on experiences and doing things rather than investing in their homes, perhaps.\u201d According to the latest reading on the PMI, robust levels of service sector activity were offset by a sharp fall in manufacturing output, with factory orders for white goods coming under pressure amid weaker consumer demand. John Glen, the chief economist at Cips, said there were stark differences in the fortunes of both sectors, adding: \u201cConsumers chose holidays over white goods.\u201d Manufacturers blamed a fall in new work on customers running down stockpiles, soaring energy costs and subdued demand from consumers for big-ticket purchases. Companies had filled their inventories amid global supply chain disruption during the Covid pandemic, at a time when consumers rushed to buy goods as travel and hospitality were closed or severely disrupted. The monthly survey showed pressure on supply chains eased further in April, as delivery times fell for the third month running because of the improved availability of raw materials and lower demand. However, firms noted difficulties with sourcing electrical items amid supply constraints across Asia. Rhys Herbert, a senior economist at Lloyds Bank, said consumers were yet to fully feel the impact from higher interest rates. \u201cPrivate sector services continue to perform well, helped by consumer spending holding up better than expected. However, consumers are yet to feel the full impact of rising interest rates. \u201cFew expect a sharp rebound in manufacturing given the sector\u2019s relative weakness globally, and the rebound in the pound could pose some competitiveness issues if it gathers pace.\u201d"

            "content": "Unwelcome though it is for a government facing strikes by doctors and nurses in the months ahead, the message from the latest labour market figures is clear: Britain is already the sick man of Europe. More than 2.5 million people who are economically inactive cite long-term sickness as the reason why they are not looking for a job \u2013 and the number is rising sharply. Data from the Office for National Statistics shows the total number of people inactive because of ill-health up by more than 150,000 in the past year and by 89,000 in the three months to February. Clearly this matters for the individuals affected and the upward trend appears to reflect the lingering impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. But it also matters for the economy at a time when \u2013 despite a fall in inactivity overall as a result of more young people working \u2013 there are still more than 1m job vacancies. As Jane Gratton of the British Chambers of Commerce noted, the unfilled posts represent a drag on firms, preventing them from taking on new work and leading to upward pressure on pay. Annual private sector earnings growth is running at just under 7%. Ideally, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, would like to have the NHS working at full speed to reduce the record numbers of people waiting for hospital treatment. In England alone, the figure is more than 7 million. In reality, the opposite is the case. Strikes over pay and conditions will lead to even longer waiting lists, making it harder to reduce the number of people inactive because of long-term sickness. Ben Harrison, the director of the Work Foundation at Lancaster University thinktank, said: \u201cThe OECD recently found that the UK has suffered the biggest decline in workforce participation of any G7 economy since the pandemic.\u201d Tony Wilson, the director at the Institute for Employment Studies, said: \u201cFigures for long-term ill-health are particularly worrying, rising again in the latest data to a new peak of over 2.5 million. This is being driven in particular by people staying out of work longer, rather than more people leaving work now. \u201cSo we need to focus in particular on how we help those who want to work to get back in \u2013 with specialist employment support, faster access to health services and more inclusive recruitment and workplace support.\u201d Reducing NHS waiting lists was one of the five policy pledges made by Sunak to voters at the start of the year, and a summer of strikes will make it harder to meet that promise. It will also make it harder to meet one of the prime minister\u2019s other objectives: to return the economy to growth."

Beyond the fact that no former president has ever faced a criminal indictment, Donald Trump\u2019s arraignment in Manhattan on criminal charges offers little by way of news. An arraignment leading to a criminal trial that takes place months (if not years) from now is a dull technical legal proceeding. To satisfy the public\u2019s seemingly insatiable craving for Trump entertainment notwithstanding, the media are filling the void with Trump swag: wall-to-wall \u201cspecial coverage\u201d, on-the-spot correspondents, panels of pundits, interviews with current and past Trump lawyers and former prosecutors, opinion polls, interviews with \u201caverage\u201d Trump supporters, and mindless chatter about Trump\u2019s moods (\u201ctroubled\u201d, \u201cangry\u201d, \u201cdefiant\u201d, \u201cexhilarated\u201d). Tonight, Trump is expected to deliver a prime-time address from Mar-a-Lago. No news there, either. Predictably, it will be little more than lies and smears \u2013 more free media coverage for Trump\u2019s venomous bluster. A larger challenge to American democracy is occurring in Wisconsin, where voters will choose a new judge for the state\u2019s supreme court and a senator for its legislature, but that\u2019s getting far less attention than what\u2019s occurring in New York. Wisconsin is a key swing state in the upcoming 2024 presidential election. Its supreme court and legislature could be critical to the outcome. And it is the most gerrymandered state in the nation. Although voters in the state divide almost evenly between Democrats and Republicans, Republicans hold 63 out of 99 seats in the state assembly and 21 of 33 seats in the state senate. Four years ago, the US supreme court decided to leave partisan gerrymandering cases to state courts. This means that if the justice who\u2019s elected today alters the Wisconsin supreme court\u2019s seven-person majority, it could strike down the state\u2019s wildly gerrymandered voting maps \u2013 a major advance for democracy. But even this might not be enough to restore democracy in Wisconsin. Tuesday\u2019s special election to fill an open state senate seat will decide whether Republicans gain a supermajority that could allow them to impeach the new justice. The Republican candidate for that seat, Dan Knodl, has suggested he might try to do so if he doesn\u2019t like who\u2019s elected to the court. Not incidentally, Knodl was one of 15 Wisconsin Republican lawmakers who in January 2022 sent a letter to then vice-president Mike Pence asking him to delay certifying presidential results that showed Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump. The underlying issue in Wisconsin is the same as it\u2019s been since Trump lied and smeared his way into the national consciousness seven years ago: whether an authoritarian demagogue can take over a national political party so that the party can then control enough state legislatures to elect that authoritarian \u2013 even though a large majority of voters reject him. Trump lost his 2020 presidential bid by 7m votes. But he could have won the electoral college, and therefore been elected president, had he won just 42,919 more votes spread across just three swing states \u2013 Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin. So the rules about who gets to vote are crucial, especially in these swing states. And who sets those rules? State legislatures, along with state courts that decide whether the legislatures are acting constitutionally. Hence, the importance of Tuesday\u2019s two races in Wisconsin. Wisconsin Republicans have already changed state law to make voting more onerous by enacting a strict voter ID law. And last year, the state\u2019s conservative supreme court banned drop boxes for absentee ballots. Wisconsin now ranks 47th out of 50 states on how easy it is to vote. Not incidentally, Wisconsin\u2019s supreme court was the only state supreme court in the nation that agreed to hear Trump\u2019s challenge to the 2020 election, eventually rejecting \u2013 by a single vote \u2013 his attempt to throw out 200,000 ballots in the state\u2019s two large Democratic counties. Another way Trump could have won in 2020 is if the outcome of the election had been determined by Republican-controlled state legislatures in Wisconsin and other swing states \u2013 as Trump and many Republican members of Congress sought. Yet another reason why the Wisconsin races are so important. Friends, this is how authoritarian minorities steal democracies: they do it step by step. They design voting districts to freeze out a majority of voters. They then gain legislative supermajorities that allow them to control the state executive and state courts. Then they capture electoral college majorities despite the popular vote. Or they sow so much doubt about the popular vote that they decide the outcome. This was Trump\u2019s playbook in 2020. He didn\u2019t succeed then, but he might in 2024. What\u2019s happening in Manhattan\u2019s criminal court is obviously important. Holding a former president accountable to the rule of law is essential. But what\u2019s happening today in Wisconsin may prove as, if not more, important to the future of American democracy. It will either strengthen or weaken the levers of self-government in a state where those levers could make all the difference.

            "title": "Liberal judge\u2019s Wisconsin supreme court race win shows a shake-up in US politics",
            "date": "2023-04-05T12:59:00Z",
            "content": "Janet Protasiewicz\u2019s victory in the Wisconsin supreme court race on Tuesday amounted to a political earthquake in Wisconsin, one of America\u2019s most volatile political battlegrounds. Her victory underscores the continued political salience of abortion rights for Democrats. Her election to the court means that the Wisconsin 1849 abortion ban will be struck down (a case is already coming through the courts). Just as they did across the country in 2022, Democrats made it a central issue in the supreme court campaign and voters turned out. \u201cWisconsin voters have made their voices heard. They\u2019ve chosen to reject partisan extremism,\u201d Protasiewicz said during remarks at her election night party in Milwaukee. \u201cIt means our democracy will always prevail.\u201d When Protasiewicz is seated in August, the ideological balance of Wisconsin\u2019s seven-member supreme court will shift from conservative to liberal. A challenge is expected shortly thereafter to Wisconsin\u2019s electoral maps, which are so heavily distorted in favor of Republicans that it is virtually impossible for Democrats to ever win a majority. Protasiewicz has said the maps are \u201crigged\u201d and the court is likely to strike them down, making elections much more competitive in the state. These two significant consequences show how Democrats may have finally been able to catch up to Republicans when it comes to focusing on so-called down-ballot races \u2013 little-known contests for offices like state legislatures and state supreme courts that can have huge policy consequences. In 2010, Republicans focused on state legislative races in Wisconsin as part of a nationwide effort to have control over the decennial process of drawing district lines. They were successful and able to cement their majorities for the next decade. As recently as 2019, Democrats were struggling to catch up. That year Lisa Neubauer, a liberal candidate, lost an election for the Wisconsin state supreme court, a contest in which she was favored, by 6,000 votes. Eric Holder, the former US attorney general, publicly lamented that no prominent Democrats had come to the state to campaign. \u201cThis should be a wake-up call for us. I felt a little lonely out there in Wisconsin,\u201d he told Mother Jones after the election. Democrats got the wake-up call. In 2020, Jill Karofsky, a liberal, ousted conservative Dan Kelly \u2013 the loser in Tuesday\u2019s election \u2013 from the court. This year, high-profile surrogates including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton weighed in on the race. The liberal podcast Pod Save America hosted an episode focused on the race in Madison. The race was also the most expensive in US history, with spending topping $42m, nearly tripling the previous record for an American judicial election. Protasiewicz was able to keep up with a flood of spending from outside groups backing Kelly. She raised at least $14.5m, nearly $9m of which came from the state Democratic party, according to recent campaign finance reports. Those huge contributions were enabled by a Republican effort to weaken campaign finance laws. \u201cIt has taken a while to get this kind of focus, but we are on a hot streak,\u201d Mandela Barnes, the former state lieutenant governor, who ran an unsuccessful US Senate campaign last year, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cWe built a presidential-scale campaign through the state party and then never stopped. And that\u2019s why we were able to win the governor\u2019s race and now a state supreme court race,\u201d Ben Wikler, the chair of the Wisconsin Democratic party said at Protasiewicz\u2019s election night party in Milwaukee, where he could be seen dancing off to the side of the stage where the newly elected justice gave her remarks. \u201cThat\u2019s possible when you don\u2019t shut everything down after every election.\u201d New maps could have a big effect in places like the Milwaukee suburbs, where Republicans wiped out Democratic gains last year by redrawing district lines. Sarah Harrison, a Democrat who unsuccessfully ran for one of those redrawn seats in the state assembly, was ecstatic at Protasiewicz\u2019s watch party on Tuesday evening. \u201cFor me to think that we might get a fair map is outstanding,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to mean our voters can be represented \u201cappropriately\u201d. She declined to say directly whether she would run again for the state legislature. Protasiewicz\u2019s victory marks the latest in a series of consequential down-ballot wins for Democrats. Last year, the party flipped both chambers of the state legislature in Michigan and the state senate in Minnesota. They also have since been able to win control of the Pennsylvania state legislature. \u201cI think the big lesson for competitive states is build a permanent infrastructure that operates with a presidential integrity at every level of the ballot,\u201d Wikler said. The Wisconsin supreme court race also marked a new era of highly politicized supreme court races. It comes at a moment when state supreme courts across the country are being asked to weigh in on a number of important issues, including abortion and voting rights. After her victory remarks on Tuesday evening, the three other liberal justices joined Protasiewicz onstage and raised their hands with her in triumph \u2013 a milieu that left little pretense of the alignment of the new majority on the state court. But not everyone agrees with the outside money that propelled the justices\u2019 campaigns. \u201cEverybody hates that,\u201d Sonya Bice, 57, a lawyer from Madison, said at Protasiewicz\u2019s watch party. The success Democrats had under Wisconsin\u2019s existing campaign finance rules may also weaken the appetite for tightening them. More turmoil could also lie ahead. Republicans on Tuesday earned a supermajority in the state senate, giving them the requisite votes to impeach state officials. It is unclear if they would exercise that power on the state supreme court. As they showed up to vote on Tuesday, Wisconsinites said that amid the stronger messaging this year, they liked knowing where a candidate for state supreme court stood on important issues. \u201cI do like to know their beliefs. Not that they are voting specifically on their beliefs. Because they need to follow the law,\u201d said Karen Bitzan, a 64-year-old voter in Menomonee Falls, a Milwaukee suburb. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019re just looking at \u2018oh, they\u2019ve got blue eyes\u2019 or \u2018she\u2019s got pretty hair\u2019, or whatever.\u201d Holder, meanwhile, acknowledged a very different race than the ones he remembered from past years. \u201cDespite the fact that, for more than a decade, Wisconsin Republicans have put in place multiple structural barriers to fair representation, including a gerrymandered legislature, voter suppression laws and a conservative court majority that was wildly out of step with the public, the people did not give up \u2013 instead they stayed engaged,\u201d he said in a statement on Tuesday celebrating Protasiewicz\u2019s victory. \u201cAnd that is an important lesson for how democracy can ultimately win in this ever enduring fight.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-04-13T16:33:07Z",
            "content": "A bipartisan group in Congress is drafting US sanctions that would target leading Hungarian political figures tied to the Orb\u00e1n government, as the relationship between the two countries continues to spiral downwards. The sanctions bill would name former officials and government supporters, mostly affiliated with the Fidesz party of the prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. The legislation has been in preparation since last year and is expected to go before Congress as soon as next month where it is likely to draw broad support, according to officials familiar with the drafting process. The sanctions bill, first reported by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, is being drafted at a time of steadily worsening relations between Washington and Budapest. Orb\u00e1n was a close political ally of Donald Trump, and Fidesz maintains strong links with hardline US conservatives. This week, leaked Pentagon documents, based on intelligence, reported that the Hungarian prime minister had described the US as one of his party\u2019s top three adversaries. On Thursday, Hungary announced that it plans to leave the Russia-controlled International Investment Bank (IIB), a day after the US imposed sanctions on the Budapest-based institution widely referred to as Moscow\u2019s \u201cTrojan horse\u201d inside Europe. The treasury department had also announced punitive measures against the former IIB board chair, Nikolay Kosov, and two senior management officials, Georgy Potapov and Imre Laszl\u00f3czki. Announcing its decision to withdraw its representatives from the bank, Hungary expressed frustration at the US pressure. \u201cWe accept and understand that we represent different positions, but we don\u2019t understand why pressuring other states to change theirs is necessary,\u201d the foreign minister, P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, said at a press conference. \u201cHungary is a state, therefore it should be treated as one, instead of a colony.\u201d A day earlier, the US ambassador, David Pressman, said that, unlike other Nato allies, the Hungarian government had ignored US warnings about the bank\u2019s activities. \u201cHungary has dismissed the concerns of the United States government regarding the risks its continued presence poses to the alliance,\u201d Pressman said. \u201cWe have concerns about the continued eagerness of Hungarian leaders to expand and deepen ties with the Russian Federation.\u201d Pressman has emerged as a lightning rod for tension in the relationship, and is frequently derided in pro-government media. \u201cMr Pressman is one of the least classy ambassadors ever to set foot on Hungarian soil representing his own country,\u201d the parliamentary speaker L\u00e1szl\u00f3 K\u00f6v\u00e9r said on pro-government H\u00edr TV last week. \u201cHe talks nonsense, and he does it aggressively.\u201d In March, Pressman went to Washington to consult the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and senior White House officials. The US embassy said they discussed \u201crecent developments\u201d in the relationship with Hungary, \u201cincluding uniquely anti-American rhetoric from senior Hungarian officials and pervasive anti-American rhetoric in the media controlled by the government of Hungary\u201d. Orb\u00e1n is seen by his critics as Vladimir Putin\u2019s closest ally in the EU. His government\u2019s blocking of Sweden\u2019s Nato accession has further soured the relationship with Washington and, until the end of March, Budapest had been delaying Finland\u2019s bid to join, too. Hungary has also blocked Ukrainian participation in several high-level Nato meetings since 2017. After P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, the Hungarian foreign minister, visited Moscow to sign a series of energy deals on Tuesday, Politico reported that Oleg Ustenko, economic adviser to Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said that Budapest\u2019s new energy deals with Russia would only prolong the war in Ukraine. \u201cIf you\u2019ve seen the video where Russians cut the head off a Ukrainian soldier, the Hungarians are paying for the knife,\u201d Ustenko said. The most recent state department human rights country report noted an alarming level of corruption in Hungary. \u201cWhile the government took some steps to identify, investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, action against high-level, politically connected corruption was limited,\u201d the report said. Transparency International\u2019s corruption survey, the Corruption Perceptions Index, ranked Hungary as the most corrupt EU member state in 2022. This is not the first time the US has placed sanctions on individuals close to Orb\u00e1n. In 2014 Washington banned multiple Hungarian figures from entering the US, including the head of the national tax office, over concerns of corruption. On that occasion, however, the targeted individuals were not named."

            "content": "Aleksander Ceferin has said the possibility of staging the Champions League final in the US has been discussed, with the Uefa president admitting he hopes to cash in on football\u2019s growing popularity in the country. Last September Ceferin, who also wants to introduce a salary cap in European football \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, denied reports that discussions about playing Champions League matches outside Europe had been held. But in an interview with the US outlet Men In Blazers released on Tuesday, he revealed that talks about potentially hosting Uefa\u2019s showpiece club event in the US before the 2026 World Cup is held there had taken place and that he regarded it as a \u201cpromising market for the future\u201d. Ceferin said: \u201cIt\u2019s possible. We started to discuss about that but then one year it was the World Cup, [20]24 is Euro, this year [the final] is [in] Istanbul, \u201924 is London and \u201925 is Munich and after that, let\u2019s see.\u201d In reference to the US market Ceferin said: \u201cFootball is extremely popular in [the] United States these days. Americans are willing to pay for best and nothing for the less. So they will follow European football as basketball lovers in Europe follow NBA. \u201cit\u2019s a very important promising market for the future. The thing is that we are selling rights very well. Sponsorship is so-so for now from the US, but here [in the US] commercialisation is completely different than in Europe. They [Americans] are much more talented for that than us [Europeans].\u201d Although the Euro 2020 final between England and Italy attracted only eight million viewers in the US, Ceferin believes there is a growing appetite for top-level European football there. \u201cWhat shocked me is our Euro finals [in 2021] were watched by more people in the United States than the NBA finals,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat shocked me in 30 matches of the Euro, every match viewership was a Super Bowl viewership, so I think we\u2019re doing well. The problem is the time difference, because if you play [Champions League games on] Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 12 noon in LA, it\u2019s a problem.\u201d Ceferin, who was re-elected this month for a third term, hopes a salary cap could be the solution to protecting competitive balance and revealed it was under discussion with clubs and the European Commission. \u201cIn the future we have to seriously think about a salary cap,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the budgets go sky-high then our competitive balance is a problem. It\u2019s not about the owners, it\u2019s about the value of the competition, because if five clubs will always win then it doesn\u2019t make sense any more. But it has to be a collective agreement \u2013 every league and Uefa. Because if we do it and the other leagues don\u2019t, then it doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d"

            "content": "Mexico\u2019s president has written to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, urging him to help control shipments of fentanyl, while also complaining of \u201crude\u201d US pressure to curb the drug trade. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has previously said that fentanyl is the US\u2019s problem and is caused by \u201ca lack of hugs\u201d in US families. On Tuesday he read out the letter to Xi dated 22 March in which he defended efforts to curb supply of the deadly drug, while rounding on US critics. L\u00f3pez Obrador complained about calls in the US to designate Mexican drug gangs as terrorist organisations. Some Republicans have said they favour using the US military to crack down on Mexican cartels. \u201cUnjustly, they are blaming us for problems that in large measure have to do with their loss of values, their welfare crisis,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador wrote to Xi in the letter. \u201cThese positions are in themselves a lack of respect and a threat to our sovereignty, and moreover they are based on an absurd, manipulative, propagandistic and demagogic attitude.\u201d Only after several paragraphs of venting, L\u00f3pez Obrador brings up China\u2019s exports of fentanyl precursors, and asked him to help stop shipments of chemicals that Mexican cartels import from China. \u201cI write to you, President Xi Jinping, not to ask your help on these rude threats, but to ask you for humanitarian reasons to help us by controlling the shipments of fentanyl,\u201d the Mexican president wrote. China has taken some steps to limit fentanyl exports, but mislabelled or harder-to-detect precursor chemicals continue to pour out of Chinese factories. It was not immediately clear if Xi had received the letter or if he had responded to it. L\u00f3pez Obrador has a history of writing confrontational letters to world leaders without getting a response. L\u00f3pez Obrador has angrily denied that fentanyl is produced in Mexico. However, his own administration has acknowledged finding dozens of labs where it is produced, mainly in the northern state of Sinaloa. Most illegal fentanyl is pressed by Mexican cartels into counterfeit pills made to look like other medications such as Xanax, oxycodone or Percocet, or mixed into other drugs, including heroin and cocaine. Many people who die of overdoses in the US do not know they are taking fentanyl. L\u00f3pez Obrador doubled down on his advice to strengthen family values in the US on Tuesday. He claims that close-knit families have allowed Mexico to avoid a fentanyl crisis, though the country has a huge problem with domestic methamphetamine consumption. \u201cI would tell them, for example, to keep their children at home longer, don\u2019t kick them out of the house, keep them (at home) for two or three years more,\u201d he said during a news conference. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that has been blamed for about 70,000 overdose deaths a year in the US. Experts say Mexican cartels are making so much money from the US market that they see no need to sell fentanyl in their home market. In the US, Republican senator Lindsey Graham has been at the forefront of pressure on Mexico, and on Monday he said he would put forward legislation on fentanyl that would include designating Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organisations. The Mexican foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, pushed back against Graham\u2019s criticism, saying on Tuesday that the vast majority of people arrested in the US for trafficking fentanyl are Americans. \u201cThere\u2019s no other country in the world that\u2019s doing as much against fentanyl trafficking to the United States as Mexico,\u201d Ebrard said."

            "date": "2023-04-06T03:39:14Z",
            "content": "Taiwan authorities are monitoring Chinese military activity including a carrier strike group about 200 nautical miles (370km) off the main island\u2019s coastline, after the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, met US House speaker Kevin McCarthy in Los Angeles. In the meeting, held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, McCarthy stressed the urgency of arms deliveries to Taiwan, while Tsai praised the \u201cstrong and unique partnership\u201d with the US.. Taiwan\u2019s defence minister, Chiu Kuo-cheng, said on Thursday that the island\u2019s military was studying the carrier group, led by the Shandong aircraft carrier. Chiu said the group \u2013 a fleet of navy vessels led by an aircraft carrier \u2013 appeared to be on a training exercise and no planes had been detected taking off from the ship, but the timing was \u201csensitive\u201d. He later confirmed that the US aircraft carrier Nimitz, which had been participating in joint drills with Japan and Korea in the East China Sea this week, was also in the same area as the Shandong on Thursday. The carrier group was sent to waters south-east of Taiwan\u2019s main island on Wednesday, shortly before Tsai and McCarthy met in Los Angeles. Japan\u2019s defence ministry confirmed it was also monitoring the strike group, which it detected 300km from Okinawa on Wednesday evening. The ministry said the Shandong was accompanied by the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) frigate Liuzhou and a fast combat support ship as it travelled east towards the Philippines Sea, entering the Pacific Ocean for the first time. Separately, Japan said a PLAN guided-missile destroyer had been detected sailing between Taiwan and the Japanese island of Yonaguni, about 100km off Taiwan\u2019s coast on Tuesday. Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry would not confirm or comment on the detection. Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry also reported three additional PLAN vessels and one anti-submarine helicopter operating near Taiwan in the 24 hours to Thursday morning. Chiu said a separate patrol of the Taiwan Strait announced by Chinese maritime authorities on Wednesday was not a military exercise, but appeared to be Beijing attempting to set a \u201cnew normal\u201d in terms of enforcing their domestic law in wider maritime spaces. China\u2019s coastguard, which comes under the command of the central military commission, claims authority to stop and inspect vessels in the area under a controversial 2021 law, though it is not believed to have done so before. The Taiwan defence ministry has instructed Taiwanese vessels, including cargo and ferry services, to not cooperate with attempts by this patrol to board and inspect them. Beijing has reacted angrily to the meeting between Taiwan\u2019s leader and McCarthy, who is the second in line to the US presidency, accusing the pair of undermining its claim over Taiwan, conniving on \u201cseparatist\u201d aims, and degrading China-US relations. McCarthy, a Republican who became the most senior figure to meet a Taiwanese leader on American soil in decades, was joined by a bipartisan group of US politicians who voiced support for dialogue with Taiwan amid simmering tensions with China. \u201cWe must continue the arms sales to Taiwan and make sure such sales reach Taiwan on a very timely basis,\u201d McCarthy said at a news conference after the meeting, adding that he believed there was bipartisan agreement on this. \u201cSecond, we must strengthen our economic cooperation, particularly with trade and technology.\u201d Beijing quickly denounced the meeting. Its foreign ministry said in statement that China will take \u201cresolute and effective measures to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d A China defence ministry spokesperson called on the US to \u201cstop its blatant interference in China\u2019s internal affairs\u201d. \u201cWe firmly oppose all forms of official interaction between the United States and Taiwan and any visit by leader of the Taiwan authorities to the United States in any name or under whatever pretext,\u201d it said in a statement. China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, a position the government in Taipei strongly contests. Tsai says they are already a sovereign nation, and Taiwan\u2019s future is for its people to decide. It is the second time Tsai has met the holder of the high-ranking office in less than a year, having welcomed McCarthy\u2019s predecessor, Nancy Pelosi, to Taiwan in August. That visit, which took place on what China considers to be sovereign soil, provoked a stronger reaction from Beijing, including days of live-fire military exercises around Taiwan. So far, the reaction to the California meeting is far more muted. It is understood the McCarthy meeting was held on US soil instead of in Taiwan as McCarthy originally wanted, at least in part to reduce its provocativeness. On Thursday, Taiwan\u2019s national security chief also noted the presidents of France and the European Union were currently visiting China, and \u201cChina must practice peaceful diplomacy\u201d. McCarthy told Tsai a shared belief in democracy and freedom formed \u201cthe bedrock\u201d of their enduring relationship. \u201cThe friendship between the people of Taiwan and America is a matter of profound importance to the free world, and it is critical to maintain economic freedom peace and regional stability,\u201d he said. While stressing that there was no need for retaliation from China after the meeting, McCarthy also said he looked forward to, \u201cmore meeting like this in the future\u201d. Republican Mike Gallagher, chair of the House Chinese Communist party committee, responded to China\u2019s objections to the meeting, saying: \u201cIf the duly elected leader of one of our most important democratic partners can\u2019t meet with American leaders on American soil, then we are merely feeding the crocodile that will eventually eat us.\u201d Tsai\u2019s US stops have been attended by crowds of pro- and anti-Taiwan protesters. The opposing groups scuffled outside the Ronald Reagan library, and were separated by police. Wednesday\u2019s meeting was also attended by more than a dozen Democratic and Republican lawmakers, highlighting the bipartisan consensus in Congress when it comes to supporting Taiwan. Tsai thanked them for their \u201cunwavering support\u201d, which she said \u201creassures the people of Taiwan that we are not isolated and we are not alone\u201d. Since 1979, the US has officially recognised the People\u2019s Republic of China as the sole government of the \u201cone China\u201d that is mainland China and Taiwan. But the US also sells arms to Taiwan to deter any military advances from Beijing, something that McCarthy said should continue. He drew an explicit comparison between Hong Kong and Taiwan, saying that when China \u201creneged\u201d on its promise to allow Hong Kong autonomy for 50 years after the handover to Chinese rule, \u201cthat harmed [Beijing\u2019s reputation] around the world\u201d. Michael Swaine, a senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a thinktank, warned that the meeting could accelerate the downward spiral of US-China relations. He warned that it could trigger a \u201cshow of resolve\u201d from Beijing, which could itself \u201cdrive Washington to move even closer to Taiwan in order to demonstrate its own resolve\u201d. On Wednesday the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told Euronews that a move by China to annex Taiwan would have far reaching repercussions \u201cfor quite literally every country on Earth\u201d.

            "date": "2023-04-03T23:01:09Z",
            "content": "Taiwan\u2019s president Tsai Ing-wen will meet with US House speaker Kevin McCarthy on Wednesday, the Republican\u2019s office has confirmed, in defiance of warnings from Beijing that such a meeting would be a \u201cprovocation\u201d. Tsai is scheduled to make a stopover in California after state visits to Belize and Guatemala, Taiwan\u2019s last remaining Central American diplomatic allies. McCarthy\u2019s office said on Monday the \u201cbipartisan\u201d meeting would take place at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, outside Los Angeles. In response, China\u2019s LA consulate on Tuesday said that it \u201cfirmly opposed\u201d Tsai\u2019s US transits, and that the meeting was \u201cnot conducive to regional peace, security and stability\u201d. The meeting will \u201cgreatly hurt the national feelings of 1.4 billion Chinese people\u201d and undermine \u201cthe political foundation of China-US relations,\u201d a consulate spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson said China would \u201cresolutely and vigorously defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d. As speaker of the House of Representatives, McCarthy is the most senior Republican lawmaker and is second in line to the US presidency, after vice-president Kamala Harris. McCarthy had previously voiced his intention to visit Taiwan, following the example of his House Speaker predecessor, Democrat Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi\u2019s visit in August last year prompted China\u2019s military to encircle Taiwan\u2019s main island with days of intense live-fire exercises. A meeting with Tsai on US soil during her stopover in the country had been interpreted as an attempt to avoid a repeat of that situation, but Beijing has reacted with fury to the news, and promised to \u201cresolutely fight back\u201d. Last week Xu Xueyuan, the charge d\u2019affaires of China\u2019s embassy to the US, told reporters that Washington risked \u201cserious confrontation\u201d no matter whether US leaders visited Taiwan or the reverse. The ministry of foreign affairs said such a meeting would be considered a \u201cprovocation\u201d. The US \u2013 which supports Taiwan\u2019s defence but does not recognise it as a country \u2013 has said Tsai\u2019s stopovers are normal and warned Beijing not to use it as a pretext for hostile behaviour. On Friday 10 Chinese warplanes flew across the median line, the de facto border with China in the Taiwan Strait. On Monday another 10 planes made the crossing. Flights over the median line used to be rare but have become more frequent since the Pelosi visit. Beijing claims Taiwan is a province of China, and has sworn to annex it under what it terms \u201creunification\u201d. Tsai maintains Taiwan is a sovereign nation, and its future is for its people to decide. Polling released on Monday by Taiwan\u2019s National Cultural Foundation Policy Center found that more than 60% of the country believes that Tsai\u2019s visit will help improve Taiwan\u2019s international status. More than half of respondents believed Beijing was undermining cross-strait peace, and 73% opposed Xi Jinping\u2019s plan of \u201creunification\u201d. Beijing has not ruled out using force to achieve its aims, and in recent years has greatly increased military and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan in an effort to encourage a peaceful surrender. Since Tsai became president in 2016, nine diplomatic allies have cut ties with Taiwan in favour of China, which does not allow its allies to recognise both governments. The most recent switch came last month, with Honduras severing relations with Taiwan and signing on to Beijing\u2019s claim that it is a part of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Tsai\u2019s 10-day trip to Belize and Guatemala aimed to shore up relations with the two governments. On Monday Belize\u2019s prime minister, John Briceno, reaffirmed his nation\u2019s support for Taiwan. \u201cBelize welcomes you into our home with open arms,\u201d Briceno told Tsai during a joint session of the national assembly in Belmopan, the capital of the small Central American country of 400,000 people. Briceno ticked off some of Taipei\u2019s largesse, thanking it for scholarships, farming programs and a $16.5m grant to build a hospital in the island town and popular tourist hub of San Pedro. As Tsai listened, Briceno applauded a declaration lawmakers passed last month reaffirming Belize\u2019s formal recognition of Taiwan as a sovereign and independent country. In her remarks, Tsai spoke of \u201cexpansionist threats from authoritarian regimes\u201d, adding that \u201cthe people of Taiwan face constant threats from the neighbour on the other side of the Taiwan Straits,\u201d referring to China. Tsai thanked Belize for its diplomatic support amid \u201cconstant threats and pressure\u201d from Beijing. While in Guatemala, Tsai was accompanied by president Alejandro Giammattei on a visit to a hospital which Taiwan had helped finance. During a photocall with Tsai at a Maya civilisation citadel, Giammattei called Taiwan \u201cthe one and only true China\u201d. Beijing has sought to lure away Taiwan\u2019s diplomatic allies \u2013 predominately through promises of investment, loans or aid, which Taiwan cannot match. However, retaining Belize and Guatemala as allies enables Taiwan\u2019s leadership to make informal visits to the US. \u201cThere is an instrumental value in Taiwan\u2019s diplomatic relationships in enabling the president to travel internationally as a head of state, with \u2018stop-overs\u2019 being used to bend the rules by the US,\u201d said Dr Mark Harrison, an expert on China and Taiwan from the University of Tasmania in Australia. \u201cTaiwan\u2019s de facto independence can be seen in forms other than diplomatic relations, especially trade, but relations do confer legitimacy on Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d Additional research by Chi Hui Lin"

            "date": "2023-04-25T20:02:58Z",
            "content": "Washington digested Joe Biden\u2019s announcement that he is running for a second term, with Democrats sounding very much ready for him to remain in office for another four years, and Republicans giving Americans all sorts of reasons not to vote for him. We\u2019re 560 days away from the 2024 election; prepare for lots more of this. Here\u2019s what else happened today: Biden said he would veto the Republican debt ceiling bill if it ever gets to his desk, which it probably won\u2019t, at least not in its current form. Senator Ed Markey has called on supreme court justice Clarence Thomas to resign over his recently revealed links to a Republican megadonor. The Democrat is the first senator to make such a demand. Neil Gorsuch, a conservative supreme court justice, sold a property to the head of a law firm who argues cases before the tribunal shortly after his confirmation, according to a new report. Donald Trump\u2019s civil trial over a rape allegation is under way in New York City. Please don\u2019t talk about Biden or Trump\u2019s age, a UK-based charity that focuses on ageing, asked. The White House congratulated Washington state for enacting tighter restrictions on guns today, including a ban on the sale of certain assault weapons. \u201cToday, Washington State has become the tenth state in the nation alongside Washington DC to ban assault weapons and get weapons of war off America\u2019s streets. President Biden commends the leadership of Washington Governor Jay Inslee, and legislative leaders, as well as the advocates, survivors and elected officials who fought for years to make today a reality. In so doing, they have made every community in the state \u2013 from Seattle to Spokane and everywhere in between \u2013 safer and more secure,\u201d press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. According to the Associated Press, Democratic governor Jay Inslee signed three bills today that impose a 10-day waiting period on gun purchases, bans dozens of semi-automatic firearms and allow family members of people who die from gun violence to sue a seller or manufacturer if it \u201cis irresponsible in how they handle, store or sell those weapons\u201d. Joe Biden was the oldest president ever elected when he won in 2020, and the 80-year-old will continue that record-breaking streak if he wins a second term. Many of Biden\u2019s potential GOP candidates are in their 40s or 50s, but the current frontrunner Donald Trump is 76. Age seems certain to be one of the considerations voters will weigh, should the 2024 election come down to the two men. But the UK-based Centre for Ageing Better has a message for Trump, Biden and the 2024 primary field as a whole: leave age out of it. Here\u2019s what their chief executive Carole Easton had to say: Whatever happens over the next 18 months in the US Presidential elections, at the Centre for Ageing Better we have one simple request. No one mentions the age of any of the candidates. The date of birth of Joe Biden or Donald Trump or any other candidate is a completely irrelevant factor in the race. Their competency, their policies, their personal integrity, even their personal finances and health, are all relevant factors in deciding who should be the next occupant of the White House. Their age is not. Whatever the strengths or weaknesses of the candidates, that is a matter of their individual character, not their age. Ageism is so prevalent within society, we are still only now getting to grips with its impact and its seriousness. Ageism assumes that all experiences of getting older are homogenous when we know that is not the case. We must end the continual use of harmful stereotypes about ageing and older age and avoid fuelling intergenerational conflict. The race to become the next US President should be about the competency of individuals. Our concern at Ageing Better is that the campaign provides the background for an outpouring of outdated and offensive stereotypes which will only serve to demonstrate how far we still need to travel to eradicate the scourge of ageism from society.\u201d Joe Biden will veto a Republican proposal to raise the debt ceiling while slashing spending and implementing a number of conservative policies, the White House announced today. GOP leaders in the House of Representatives are expected to this week call a vote on the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023. Biden has refused to negotiate with Republicans over the debt limit, saying it should be increased without conditions ahead of an estimated June deadline where the US government will run out of money and potentially default on its obligations. \u201cThe Congress has a solemn obligation to prevent default and ensure that the United States meets its obligations. The Administration strongly opposes the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023, which is a reckless attempt to extract extreme concessions as a condition for the United States simply paying the bills it has already incurred,\u201d the White House office of management and budget (OMB) said in a statement. The office takes specific issue with the bill\u2019s mandatory spending reductions, which would \u201cforce severe cuts to education (including for students with disabilities), food safety inspections, rail safety, healthy meals for seniors, research on cancer and other diseases, border security, public safety and veterans\u2019 medical care\u201d. The OMB also objected to the bill\u2019s provisions blocking Biden from relieving some student loan debt, and repealing tax credits included the Inflation Reduction Act, among other issues. \u201cThe bill stands in stark contrast to the President\u2019s vision for the economy. The President\u2019s budget invests in America, lowers costs for families, grows the economy, and reduces the deficit by nearly $3tn by asking the wealthy and large corporations to pay their fair share. Therefore, if the president were presented with the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023, he would veto it,\u201d the OMB said. Republicans hold a slim majority in the House, and it\u2019s unclear if they have the votes yet to pass the bill, since some rightwing lawmakers have refused to increase the debt ceiling for any reason. It\u2019s also unlike the measure would attract enough Democratic support to pass the Senate, which they control. Nate Silver is reportedly being forced out of his data-driven political journalism outlet FiveThirtyEight amid the latest round of job cuts at ABC News\u2019s corporate owner, Disney. Silver sent an internal message to employees at FiveThirtyEight \u2013 which is hosted by ABC News \u2013 that he expects to leave Disney when his contract expires \u201csoon\u201d, according to an article published by the Hollywood Reporter on Tuesday. The Hollywood Reporter said ABC News plans to retain the FiveThirtyEight brand but aims to generally streamline the site ahead of the 2024 presidential election. A statement that ABC issued to the Hollywood Reporter added: \u201cWe are grateful for the invaluable contributions of the team members who will be departing the organization and know they will continue to make an important impact on the future of journalism.\u201d Silver founded FiveThirtyEight in 2008 before taking it with him to the New York Times and selling it to the Disney-owned sports network ESPN. Disney later moved FiveThirtyEight to ABC News. According to the internal message from Silver, whose expected departure would mark the first time he hasn\u2019t been involved with the site he started, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s staff was in for \u201ca hard day\u201d sooner rather than later because of upcoming layoffs. \u201cUnfortunately the day we\u2019ve been worried about has arrived,\u201d Silver\u2019s message read, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Suggested he was among those who would be leaving the site soon, Silver\u2019s missive added: \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know the scope of these layoffs, exactly who is [affected], or the terms under which they are departing, but it is going to be a hard day for all of us.\u201d Silver later went on Twitter and said he \u201chad been worried about an outcome like this\u201d and had already been engaging in conversations about \u201copportunities elsewhere\u201d. \u201cI am so proud of the work of FiveThirtyEight staff,\u201d Silver said. \u201cIt has never been easy. I\u2019m sorry to the people [affected] by this.\u201d The cuts which have ensnared Silver are part of a larger cost-reduction campaign at Disney, which seeks to eliminate 7,000 jobs to save $5.5bn in expenses, according to Reuters. It is the second wave of layoffs associated with the cost-cutting plan, Reuters added. Washington is digesting Joe Biden\u2019s announcement that he\u2019s running for a second term, with Democrats sounding very much ready for him to stay in office for another four years, and Republicans giving Americans all sorts of reasons not to vote for him. We\u2019re 560 days away from the 2024 election; prepare for lots more of this. Here\u2019s what else has happened today: Senator Ed Markey has called on supreme court justice Clarence Thomas to resign over his recently revealed links to a Republican megadonor. The Democrat is the first senator to make such a demand. Neil Gorsuch, a conservative supreme court justice, sold a property to the head of a law firm who argues cases before the tribunal shortly after his confirmation, according to a new report. Donald Trump\u2019s civil trial over a rape allegation is under way in New York City. Joe Biden wrapped up his speech, with an exhortation that he\u2019s been using for months: \u201cFinish the job!\u201d \u201cManufacturing has come alive again. People can afford decent healthcare. Towns that have been forgotten and left behind for dead are coming alive again because of you all and what we\u2019re doing now. Now we\u2019ve just got to keep going. Finish the job!\u201d the president said as he concluded his remarks. He used the same line in his re-election announcement today, but the speech otherwise avoided mentioning the campaign. That may be because of rules governing the separation between his activities as president \u2013 such as today\u2019s speech \u2013 and as a candidate. Thus far, this address has proven to be a standard Joe Biden stump speech, with no mention of his campaign for re-election. The president is talking about infrastructure, the importance of unions and his promotion of policies that encourage more consumption of American-produced goods. Biden has left the big news of the day \u2013 that he\u2019s running for a second term \u2013 unmentioned, at least so far. The crowd, however, has clearly heard the news. \u201cFour more years! Four more years!\u201d they began chanting a few minutes ago. Biden, taking a breather in speech, hung his head and smiled. Joe Biden has kicked off his speech focusing on manufacturing and his legislative accomplishments. It\u2019s before a friendly crowd of union workers, many of whom chanted \u201cJoe, Joe\u201d as he walked onstage. Watch it as it happens at the live stream embedded at the top of the page. Joe Biden will in a few minutes make his first public appearance since announcing his re-election campaign, with an address to a North America\u2019s Building Trades Unions conference in Washington DC. According to excerpts released by the White House, the president will cover familiar ground, such as the 2021 infrastructure measure he succeeded in getting Congress to enact. \u201cUnder my predecessor, Infrastructure Week was a punchline. On my watch, we\u2019re making Infrastructure Decade a headline,\u201d Biden will say. This blog will be keeping an eye out for any comments the president makes about his campaign for a second term. On Fox News, Republican congressman John James sought to place blame on Joe Biden for not getting Americans out of harm\u2019s way in conflict-torn Sudan: Democratic candidates have counted on Black voters for decades, and Biden is no exception. Their support was viewed as key to turning around his flagging presidential campaign in 2020, and to his defeat of Donald Trump later that year. Massachusetts\u2019s Democratic senator Ed Markey has called on supreme court justice Clarence Thomas to resign: Thomas has faced mounting questions over his ethics after investigative news outlet ProPublica revealed his ties to a Republican megadonor. Last week, the Senate judiciary committee, led by its Democratic chair Richard Durbin, asked supreme court chief justice John Roberts to testify about the court\u2019s ethics code. Days after he was confirmed to the supreme court, Neil Gorsuch sold a property he co-owned to the head of a law firm that has argued cases before the justices, Politico reports. The story reveals another entanglement between the high court and parties outside it, after ProPublica reported on ties between Clarence Thomas, one of the court\u2019s best-known conservative jurors, and a Republican mega-donor. Gorsuch, a conservative, was appointed by Donald Trump to the court in 2017, filling a vacancy created by the death of fellow conservative Antonin Scalia the year before \u2013 which Mitch McConnell, then the Republican Senate majority leader, prevented Barack Obama from filling. Here\u2019s more from Politico\u2019s story: For nearly two years beginning in 2015, Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch sought a buyer for a 40-acre tract of property he co-owned in rural Granby, Colorado. Nine days after he was confirmed by the Senate for a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court, the then-circuit court judge got one: The chief executive of Greenberg Traurig, one of the nation\u2019s biggest law firms with a robust practice before the high court. Gorsuch owned the property with two other individuals. On April 16 of 2017, Greenberg\u2019s Brian Duffy put under contract the 3,000-square foot log home on the Colorado River and nestled in the mountains northwest of Denver, according to real estate records. He and his wife closed on the house a month later, paying $1.825 million, according to a deed in the county\u2019s record system. Gorsuch, who held a 20 percent stake, reported making between $250,001 and $500,000 from the sale on his federal disclosure forms. Gorsuch did not disclose the identity of the purchaser. That box was left blank. Since then, Greenberg Traurig has been involved in at least 22 cases before or presented to the court, according to a POLITICO review of the court\u2019s docket. They include cases in which Greenberg either filed amicus briefs or represented parties. In the 12 cases where Gorsuch\u2019s opinion is recorded, he sided with Greenberg Traurig clients eight times and against them four times. On Capitol Hill, Republican speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy continues to push Joe Biden to negotiate with him over raising the debt ceiling: Biden has refused to consider anything but a simple increase to America\u2019s borrowing limit, but McCarthy wants the White House and Democrats to agree to big spending cuts and other conservative priorities, and has proposed legislation to implement those. The US government has already reached the limit on how much it can borrow, and could default on its debt around early June if it isn\u2019t able to borrow more cash. In the Senate, Republican lawmaker Tom Cotton, who has ruled out a presidential run next year, also hit Biden for not negotiating with McCarthy: Donald Trump\u2019s legal entanglements are many, but polls have repeatedly shown he remains the most popular candidates among Republicans. A rematch of the 2020 election, where Joe Biden ousted Trump from the White House appears possible, but Jim Clyburn, a Democratic congressman and co-chair of Biden\u2019s campaign, downplayed the two men\u2019s rivalry in an interview with MSNBC: While Washington digests the official start of Joe Biden\u2019s re-election campaign, Donald Trump is probably keeping an eye on a New York courthouse, where a civil case alleging he committed rape is going to trial today. Here\u2019s the latest on that, from the Guardian\u2019s Chris McGreal. A federal court in New York will begin selecting a jury on Tuesday to hear evidence that Donald Trump raped the famed advice columnist E Jean Carroll nearly three decades ago. Carroll alleges that Trump pinned her against the wall of a New York department store and sexually assaulted her in late 1995 or early the following year as they shopped together. She brought the case last year under a New York state law opening a one-year window for adult victims of sexual assault to file civil cases after the statute of limitations has expired. The case is, at least so far, the only one to come to court among more than a dozen allegations of rape, groping and other sexual assaults against the former president as well as accusations that he walked unannounced into women\u2019s dressing rooms at beauty pageants. While Joe Biden is running for president in part to protect reproductive rights, another Republican-led state moved yesterday to almost entirely ban abortion. It\u2019s exactly the sort of split-screen the Biden campaign is hoping Americans pay attention to. Here\u2019s more, from the Associated Press: North Dakota on Monday adopted one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the US as the Republican governor Doug Burgum signed legislation banning the procedure throughout pregnancy, with slim exceptions up to six weeks\u2019 gestation. In those early weeks, abortion would be allowed only in cases of rape, incest or medical emergency, such as ectopic pregnancy. \u201cThis bill clarifies and refines existing state law \u2026 and reaffirms North Dakota as a pro-life state,\u201d Burgum said in a statement. Last year\u2019s US supreme court ruling overturning the 1973 Roe v Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide has triggered multiple state laws banning or restricting the procedure. Many were met with legal challenges. Currently, bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy are in place in at least 13 states and on hold in others because of court injunctions. On the other side, Democratic governors in at least 20 states this year launched a network intended to strengthen abortion access in the wake of the supreme court decision that eliminated women\u2019s constitutional right to end a pregnancy and shifted regulatory powers over the procedure to state governments. On the Joe Biden re-election train: Barack Obama. Here he is with a show of support for his former deputy: Also congratulating Biden is California\u2019s Democratic governor Gavin Newsom, who was considered a potential replacement for Biden if the president decided not to run again: It\u2019s a big day for Joe Biden, but there are plenty of obstacles standing between him and another four years in the White House. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s David Smith with a look at some of them: Legend has it that when the artist Benjamin West told King George III that George Washington, the first US president, had decided to resign, the king replied: \u201cIf he does that, he will be the greatest man in the world.\u201d Some urged Joe Biden, the 46th president, to follow suit and, at the age of 80, hand power to a new generation. Who were they kidding? The worst-kept secret in Washington is out: Biden is running for re-election next year. There was an air of inevitability around the announcement. Biden coveted the job for decades, mounting failed campaigns in 1988 and 2008 then succeeding in 2020, motivated by a need to rescue \u201cthe soul of America\u201d from Donald Trump. He relishes the most powerful office in the world. He is having too much fun. In addition to making his campaign official, Joe Biden announced key members of its staff. As co-chairs, he named Democratic house representatives Lisa Blunt-Rochester, Jim Clyburn, Veronica Escobar and Jeffrey Katzenberg, senators Chris Coons and Tammy Duckworth as well as Gretchen Whitmer, Michigan\u2019s up-and-coming governor. His campaign manager is Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez, currently one of his senior advisors and the director of intergovernmental affairs at the White House. She was previously deputy manager of his 2020 campaign, and worked on Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential bid. You\u2019ll notice Joe Biden\u2019s re-election campaign announcement video almost immediately draws viewers\u2019 attention to the topic of abortion. Democrats have been on a streak of wins at the ballot box ever since the conservative-dominated supreme court overturned Roe v Wade last year and allowed states to ban it entirely. Biden clearly hopes that enthusiasm continues when they go to the polls in 2024. To press the message home, vice-president Kamala Harris will this evening speak at Washington DC\u2019s Howard University during \u201ca political event with reproductive rights organizations and advocates\u201d, according to her office. Expect to hear plenty about how a second term in the White House would allow Biden to continue protecting abortion access where he can \u2013 and how a GOP president would do the opposite. Chris Coons, the Democratic senator from Biden\u2019s home state of Delaware, went on CNN this morning to talk up the president\u2019s accomplishments, now that he\u2019s made his campaign for a second term official: The Republicans are meanwhile rolling out videos attacking Biden for various statements he\u2019s made in the past. Here\u2019s one about his stance on fossil fuels: Here it is, folks, Joe Biden\u2019s official word that he wants a second term in the White House: There\u2019s a lot in there, including the January 6 insurrection and abortion, which come first in the video and give a sense of which issues he thinks Americans care most about, as well as Ketanji Brown Jackson, the supreme court justice he appointed who is also the first Black woman on the court, and even his old boss Barack Obama, who you can glimpse for a split second. In response, the Republican National Committee has prepared a post-apocalyptic-style video that Axios reports is AI generated. It asks viewers to ponder \u201cwhat if\u201d Biden remains president while various crises break out: Donald Trump has a lengthy statement in response to Biden\u2019s renewed candidacy, which starts with these lines: \u201cYou could take the five worst presidents in American history, and put them together, and they would not have done the damage Joe Biden has done to our Nation in just a few short years. Not even close.\u201d You can read the rest here. Good morning, US politics blog readers. Joe Biden has announced his campaign for a second term as president with a video address released this morning. It\u2019s a big decision by the 80-year-old, who has been dogged by low approval ratings throughout most of his term thus far, but managed to get several major pieces of legislation passed by Congress and help Democrats defend a surprising number of seats in last November\u2019s midterm elections. There will be lots to say about this announcement, which is not at all a surprise, but here\u2019s one takeaway: with Biden facing no serious primary contenders and Donald Trump back on the campaign trail and well ahead in the polls among Republicans, presidential ballots in 2024 could look a lot like they did in 2020. Here\u2019s what else we expect to happen today: Biden\u2019s first speech since announcing his bid for a second term is at 12.30pm ET in Washington, where he\u2019s set to talk about manufacturing. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre briefs reporters at 2pm. The trial of author E Jean Carroll\u2019s defamation suit against Donald Trump begins in New York at 9.30am."
