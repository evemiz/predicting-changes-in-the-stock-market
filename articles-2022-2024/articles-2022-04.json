            "date": "2022-04-18T09:11:59Z",
            "content": "On a wet Wednesday in April, spent picking litter and spotting sewage in the River Wandle in Merton, south London, the Lib Dems look beside themselves with enthusiasm. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, is here to rally his activists with a speech highlighting Tory failures to clean up Britain\u2019s waterways. He arrives in a sharp suit to deliver his party\u2019s local election launch to waiting TV cameras, before gamely changing into wellies for a photo op in the water. \u201cSoaring energy bills are overwhelming millions of families but this Conservative government doesn\u2019t care or doesn\u2019t get it. Instead of help, the Conservatives are raising unfair taxes again and again,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd Conservative MPs have voted time and time again to pour filthy sewage into our rivers like the Wandle.\u201d It may seem an odd message to be giving out in Labour-held Merton \u2013 and in fact, a strange place for the party to kickstart its local election effort when it is unmistakably going after Tory rather than Labour voters. This council has never been held by the Lib Dems, unlike nearby Sutton or Kingston. In fact, it has swung from Labour towards the Tories, back to firmly Labour again. But this set of local elections is about gaining and building on \u201cfootholds\u201d where the Lib Dems are strong in nearby areas, says one of the party\u2019s senior electoral strategists. The party is fairly entrenched in about 27 councils in the UK, with disparate pockets of Lib Dem power in south-west London, Somerset and Cumbria. However, there are few places where the party is poised to take over any councils or even knock the governing parties into no overall control from second place, although they are hoping for a miracle in Labour-held Hull. The Lib Dem activists have the energy of insurgents, as they hope to replace the Tories as the second biggest party on Merton council. But it is hard to know whether their optimism will translate into hard wins \u2013 and the party leadership is not sounding confident about any taking any new councils, despite the scandal-hit position of the Tories nationally. \u201cIt will be tough for us because we won a lot of councils four years ago \u2013 Kingston, Richmond and South Cambs. So we are fighting from a high base. There\u2019s a few we can win, but it\u2019s difficult,\u201d Davey says, setting a low bar for success in gaining councillors on 5 May. The last council election in Merton saw 34 Labour councillors elected, 17 Tory, six Lib Dem and three independents. But there is a fairly strong geographical divide between the Labour-Merton and Tory-Wimbledon sides of the council area \u2013 and it is Wimbledon, the Conservative-voting seat of the Tory MP Stephen Hammond that the party has its sights on at a national contest. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to make lots and lots of gains in Merton,\u201d says Munira Wilson, the Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, who succeeded Vince Cable in the seat in 2019. One of the reasons the Lib Dems are feeling hopeful about Wimbledon is Paul Kohler, their parliamentary candidate who came within 628 votes of ousting Hammond in 2019. A university law lecturer, Kohler is well known in the area for being beaten up so badly in 2014 that he required facial reconstruction surgery. After his attackers were jailed for aggravated burglary, he visited one of them in jail in a restorative justice process. \u201cPeople are angry about national politics, they are angry about Partygate and they can see the cost of living affecting them or others,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of decent, soft, \u2018One Nation\u2019 Tories who can\u2019t abide the lies or hypocrisy of the Johnson Tory party. It\u2019s not the party they recognise. It\u2019s changed out of all proportion.\u201d In terms of local issues, he says a big focus is \u201cMucky Merton\u201d \u2013 with people annoyed by mess and rubbish collections. On the doorstep in Trinity ward, which has two Tory councillors along with one Lib Dem, Kohler is recognised by many of those he approaches along a street he says he will have canvassed three times before the campaign is out. His reception is generally positive, with his first resident, Louise, saying she will vote a mixture of two Lib Dem and one Green for an \u201cunambiguous vote\u201d in favour of environmental action, and she will not go for \u201ccomplacent\u201d Labour. Another resident, Andrew, says he will \u201cpossibly\u201d support the Lib Dems but is weighing up them up with the Tories. But he gets a roasting from one woman, Jennifer, who lays into Davey\u2019s stance on trans rights as \u201ca disgrace\u201d because she says he cannot define what a woman is and that women are under threat of \u201chaving our rights taken away behind our backs\u201d. The former Labour voter says she feels similarly about Keir Starmer, saying \u201cLabour is finished\u201d and that she does not like the way they have been running the council. Despite her harsh words for Davey, she says she will probably vote Lib Dem at the locals anyway. Among the Conservative activists in Wimbledon, one of them says the contest is harder fought than ever, describing his most recent outing on the Saturday doorstop as \u201ca bit of a disastrous reception\u201d. He says the view is \u201chardening\u201d against Johnson among liberal metropolitan centre-right Tories, with little sympathy for his excuses over Partygate and concern about tax rises. The Lib Dems are feeling chipper after surprise byelection wins at Chesham and Amersham and North Shropshire. They believe this test at the local elections in places like Wimbledon will show they have the potential to break new electoral ground in 2023-24."

            "content": "Emmanuel Macron narrowly missed being hit by a bag of tomatoes during a surprise visit to a working-class area north of Paris, as he promised a new style of \u201clistening to people\u201d after his re-election as president. In his first public appearance since Sunday\u2019s vote, Macron strolled around a food market in the town of Cergy, north-west of Paris, shaking hands and posing for selfies. Most people were friendly, some shouted congratulations and others asked for help in finding a job, dealing with health problems or making ends meet. But at one point there were briefly boos, and a bag of tomatoes was thrown towards Macron\u2019s back but missed. A bodyguard opened an umbrella to shield the president, who quickly sidestepped the projectile and continued to greet people and shake hands. The \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said the trip was Macron\u2019s way of \u201clistening to people\u2019s concerns, expectations and needs\u201d. He told local young people that he wanted to get out on the ground \u201cfrom the start\u201d. One young woman replied: \u201cDon\u2019t just come here for the photos.\u201d Another onlooker said: \u201cIt\u2019s good that he\u2019s getting out of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e.\u201d Macron won a second term at the weekend, beating the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen by 58.5% to her 41.5%, but on the campaign trail he faced accusations of being haughty and aloof and of not understanding people\u2019s concerns about the cost of living, housing, jobs and poverty. He had struggled to shake off the tag of \u201cpresident of the rich\u201d. Macron said in Cergy: \u201cI want to give a message of respect and consideration to these areas that are among the poorest in the country, right from the start of my mandate.\u201d He acknowledged that deprived, high-rise neighbourhoods surrounding Paris had some of the highest abstention rates in the presidential vote. Macron said \u201clife was hard\u201d there and some people felt angry or cut off from politics, and not enough progress had been made in recent years to improve their lives. He said there were problems of discrimination, and a need for training schemes, more doctors and better health care in these areas, as well as job creation. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought down unemployment here, but it\u2019s still above the national average because of discrimination and not enough training,\u201d he said after meeting young local entrepreneurs. Macron, the first French leader to be re-elected for a second term in 20 years, is now focused on parliamentary elections in June. He will need a centrist majority in the 577-seat house in order to put in place his manifesto plans, including overhauling the benefits system and raising the pension age. Pollsters believe he has a good chance of winning a majority. Cergy is a leftwing area where the radical-left leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon topped the presidential vote\u2019s first round. M\u00e9lenchon is attempting to strike alliances with other parties on the left to challenge Macron\u2019s centrists in the parliamentary elections. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s party, La France Insoumise, which has 17 seats in parliament\u2019s lower house, wants to expand by hundreds more to win a majority for the left. The Socialist party and the Greens (EELV) on Wednesday began talks on possible parliamentary alliances with M\u00e9lenchon to increase the number of seats on the left. Hurdles remain. The Socialists are traditional rivals to La France Insoumise, and some older Socialists warn against \u201csurrendering\u201d the party\u2019s principles. The Greens favour an alliance, but some Green figures have said they will not compromise on their pro-Europe and anti-nuclear stance."

Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen topped that earlier poll. The runoff is decided by simple majority of valid votes: if either candidate gets one more vote than the other, he or she is elected. There is no electoral college and no role for parliament. For most of the campaign, it seemed that Macron, the incumbent president, would win comfortably in the second round. But a surge in Le Pen\u2019s polling in the final weeks made this more doubtful. A key factor will be how much support Macron can garner from those who voted for leftwinger Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon in the first round. M\u00e9lenchon has enjoined his voters not to give a single vote to Marine Le Pen, but for Macron this support is more ambivalent than he might have hoped."

If, as seems likely, no candidate wins that majority in the first round, the top two candidates go through to a run-off election two weeks later, on April 24. Although the French interior ministry reports the results by commune, department and region, only the overall national result counts. The breakdowns are interesting because they often show regional patterns in voting - Le Pen has in the past done well in the south and the north-east. Polls close at 1900CEST in most districts, but at 2000CEST in Paris and other large cities. French departments in the Pacific, Atlantic and Caribbean voted on Saturday. French citizens living overseas can also vote, and 1.4m of them are on the electoral register this time. The interior ministry said it was expecting some results from rural areas as soon as polls closed in Paris, with a majority of communes reporting by about midnight."

            "content": "For undecided French voters tempted to back the far-right populist Marine Le Pen in next Sunday\u2019s presidential election, the situation resembles a midlife crisis. They\u2019re fed up with the same old, same old \u2013 the boss is a pain and the bills keep on rising. How great it would be to throw it all up, escape the system, buy a smallholding somewhere and grow veg. In the end, most people decide against so drastic a break with all that is familiar and secure, however unsatisfactory their present circumstances. That\u2019s what France\u2019s friends and neighbours must hope will happen when Le Pen faces the centrist incumbent, Emmanuel Macron, in the second round run-off. Macron, though unpopular, represents continuity. Le Pen is the candidate of chaos. Just how truly anarchic a Le Pen presidency could be was laid bare last week when the candidate for the National Rally (formerly the National Front) outlined her \u201cvision\u201d of France\u2019s place in the world. Like Donald Trump in 2016, Le Pen\u2019s stress is on tearing down, not building up. She knows what she doesn\u2019t like. But she\u2019s recklessly vague about what replaces that she would destroy. The EU is a particular target. Contradicting past positions, Le Pen no longer wants to leave the EU or the eurozone. But her proposed referendum on a new \u201cFrance-first\u201d law giving French citizens priority in employment, welfare benefits and public housing, and asserting the primacy of national over European law, amounts to \u201cFrexit\u201d by any other name. Le Pen\u2019s plans to curb immigration by re-establishing national border controls, unilaterally cut EU budget contributions and slash taxes on essential goods and fuel also breach France\u2019s legal obligations. Such policies risk a deeply existential crisis within the EU, of which France, along with Germany, is a founding member. Franco-German cooperation, the fabled \u201cmotor\u201d that keeps Europe running, would splutter to a halt if Le Pen has her way. Pointing to \u201cirreconcilable strategic differences\u201d, she rejected the \u201cdiscreet and clever hegemony\u201d pursued by Angela Merkel. Germany\u2019s former chancellor, she claimed, had tried to subvert French sovereignty, weaken its identity and undercut its defence and nuclear industries. Attempting a grotesque balancing act, Le Pen said she would seek \u201cstrategic rapprochement\u201d with Russia, her party\u2019s former backer, once the Ukraine war was over and distance France from the US by withdrawing from Nato\u2019s military command. At the same time, she scorned Macron\u2019s ideas about European defence autonomy. A \u201cnon-aligned\u201d France, she said, would go its own way, pursuing the global \u201cgrandeur\u201d that was its historical mission. Were she to gain power, Le Pen\u2019s geopolitical wrecking ball would be disastrous for Britain and the west. The democratic majority among UN security council permanent members would be in doubt. With France on board, rightwing nationalist-populists in Italy, Poland, Hungary and elsewhere would be encouraged to press their divisive, xenophobic, pan-European agendas. The struggle for western values in the teeth of Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, and for the international rules-based order, could be forfeited. Cooperative efforts to combat the climate crisis might founder. At home, intolerance, racism and institutionalised Islamophobia would reign\u2026 the nightmare possibilities are endless. Yet now, as Sunday\u2019s sudden death showdown looms, they are coming into much-needed, sharper focus. It is no longer possible to ignore or minimise the truly destructive horror of Le Pen\u2019s twisted idea of France. Surely this will concentrate wavering and disaffected voters\u2019 minds \u2013 and arouse them at last from iconoclastic daydreams. Polls suggest Macron is eight points ahead. But it\u2019s tense. As Wellington said after Waterloo, it could yet be \u201cthe nearest-run thing you ever saw\u201d."

            "title": "What the presidential election really revealed about fractured France | J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fourquet",
            "date": "2022-04-28T13:00:06Z",
            "content": "The decisive round of the presidential race in France revealed it to be a deeply fractured country. Just as the Brexit referendum laid bare the UK\u2019s divisions, in France we now have two electoral blocs characterised by opposing geographic and sociological profiles. The gap between them is first of all generational, since Emmanuel Macron attracted 70% of the votes of the over-65s and 68% among 18- to 24-year-old voters. These two groups share a common trait: neither has a significant active presence in the labour market. The pandemic, the war in Ukraine and inflationary pressures may have helped Macron to rally older people, already concerned about the threat to political stability posed by Marine Le Pen. Macron\u2019s highly contentious pledge to raise the retirement age by three years to 65 (which he later softened to 64) also boosted his support in this older age bracket. Those already retired were, after all, happy with a reform that promised to financially future-proof the pensions system while costing them no personal sacrifice. Le Pen, in contrast, mounted a massive attack on the proposal, which boosted her support across a large segment of the working population alarmed at the prospect of having to wait several more years to draw the state pension. Among working-age citizens, Macron and Le Pen were evenly matched in the polls. But the gulf between these two different French nations that took shape as the votes were counted on 24 April is more than generational, it is sociological. Macron won 74% of the votes of senior business executives and the highest-qualified professional classes, while his rival scored 58% among working-class voters from manual labourers to those employed in clerical jobs. Across the self-employed and middle classes, Macron also had the advantage, winning by 60% to 40%. This divide between the haves and have-nots in France relates partly to income differentials (76% of votes among those earning more than 2,500 euros net a month were for Macron, against only 44% among those on less than 900 euros), but is also a cultural split. In France, as in the UK, an educational divide has become a defining issue, associated as it is with professional and income inequality, but also because it leads to differences in cultural outlook. Educational levels tend to have a big influence on people\u2019s attitudes to society, the world around them, to minorities and to authority. This phenomenon translated at the ballot box in an almost cartoonish way in France. Thus, 78% of higher-level degree holders voted for Macron, as did 63% of those with a basic university qualification. It was much closer-run contest when it came to the votes of people who had no education or training beyond the baccalaureate: 53% came out for him, against 47% for Le Pen. As for French voters who left school without a bacc, Le Pen won with 56% of their votes. The sociologist Emmanuel Todd has rightly identified the phenomenon of educational stratification causing a \u201cmodification\u201d or shift in voting patterns. From the 1980s-90s in France, the proportion of young people obtaining the bacc and then pursuing higher education rose sharply. Eventually, this move to a situation where bacc holders and graduates are in the majority has resulted in a profound restratification of the entire population according to educational attainment, and not just young people. The cultural and social repercussions of this educational transformation are immense. While not having a baccalaureate was the norm in France in the 1980s, people without one are now in the minority. In the same way, having the bacc in the 1980s was a valued sociocultural marker, whereas today it is often the minimum required. Job seekers without a bacc or basic diploma 40 years ago had access to a range of jobs. Now the possibilities have shrunk, with these groups largely confined to unskilled roles or trades. They are the lowest paid and the least valued. It is almost as if this vast effort to raise the average educational level had conspired to allow Le Pen\u2019s movement to exploit the resentment and perceived sense of cultural and social exclusion among those who haven\u2019t managed to climb the educational ladder. A regional divide can be added to this sociocultural tension. Macron won easily in the capital with 85% of the votes of Parisians but he also scored big majorities in the main French cities: 81% in Nantes, 80% in Lyon and Bordeaux, 77.7% in Strasbourg and even 77.5% in Toulouse. Le Pen meanwhile prevailed in \u201cperipheral\u201d France, in other words in the small towns, rural municipalities and declining former heavy industrial belts. If this sociological and cultural description bears a striking resemblance to the electoral landscape that took shape during the 2016 US presidential election or during Brexit, it is because the same tectonic shifts are at work everywhere. Globalisation, synonymous with post-industrial decline, the concentration of wealth and graduates in large cities, but also an increase in migratory flows, combined with an educational revolution have profoundly reconfigured western societies. The old left/right political divide no longer caters for a socioeconomic landscape that will continue to pit the winners and losers of the new order against each other. In the French presidential contest, the country\u2019s two \u201cclans\u201d found their respective heroes.

            "content": "A majority of French people feel the 2022 presidential election campaign has been poor quality and never really got off the ground, which could lead to protest votes and a historically low turnout in Sunday\u2019s first round, pollsters and analysts have said. An Ifop poll this month found 80% of French people felt the campaign was \u201cpoor quality\u201d. Voters have complained of a lack of new political ideas or vision, and few solutions to their problems, after two years of the Covid pandemic, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and a cost-of-living crisis. Emmanuel Macron is campaigning to become the first French president in 20 years to win re-election, promising to continue to lower taxes, raise the pension age to 65, and get France to full employment after decades of mass joblessness. But he entered the race late, focusing instead on diplomacy with Vladimir Putin, and has seen his poll lead slip slightly in recent days while the far-right\u2019s Marine Le Pen closes the gap in second place. Le Pen has focused on the cost of living crisis, while her anti-immigration programme would ban the Muslim head-scarf from all public places. The hard-left Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon is also rising in the polls, promising to freeze prices and overhaul the presidential system. Despite French voters\u2019 main concerns \u2013 the cost-of-living crisis, the war in Ukraine and the environment \u2013 there has been less interest in this campaign than in the last presidential election five years ago. There have been fewer rallies, and voters have complained there was no direct TV debate between all candidates. As the first-round campaign entered its final week, 54% of people said they felt it hadn\u2019t really started yet. An unprecedented number of French voters say they are unsure who to vote for and abstention could hit a record high of up to 30% on Sunday. Macron has tried to mobilise his voters by likening the political mood to that in the UK before the 2016 Brexit vote. There\u2019s \u201cno certainty,\u201d he warned at his only rally, in Nanterre outside Paris, brushing aside his lead in the polls. \u201cDon\u2019t believe in polls or commentators who sound definitive and tell you that \u2026 the election is already done, that everything is going to be alright. From Brexit to so many elections, what seems unlikely can happen!\u201d Macron later told a radio interviewer he felt society was \u201cfatigued by two years of Covid\u201d and \u201cstunned\u201d by the war in Ukraine. He argued that \u201creal topics\u201d had indeed been discussed in the campaign, saying \u201cwar is a real topic!\u201d but he conceded there was \u201ca collective questioning on whether voting still makes sense.\u201d He argued voting was crucial. Pollsters say the fact that this election was for months seen as a foregone conclusion \u2013 that Macron would easily win \u2013 could affect turnout and choices, and create a sense of voters wanting to prove predictions wrong. A total of 66% of French people currently believe Macron will win \u2013 a figure that has dropped in recent weeks as Le Pen\u2019s support has risen. The sense of fatigue and foregone-conclusion has drawn comparisons with the 2002 election \u201cearthquake\u201d 20 years ago, when Le Pen\u2019s father, the far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen, knocked out the left to reach the final against Jacques Chirac. \u201cJust like today, in 2002 there was a constant feeling of a campaign that didn\u2019t work, which in turn created a temptation towards a protest vote,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Miquet-Marty, head of Viavoice pollsters. \u201cOur polling shows 75% of French people think there aren\u2019t really any new ideas in this campaign. And at the same time, 76% of people are worried about their children\u2019s futures. There is a sense that the solutions on offer in this campaign aren\u2019t enough.\u201d French media and analysts have described the campaign as putting voters to sleep in a country already worn out by crises. The Communist candidate Fabien Roussel this week described the campaign \u201cas on morphine\u201d. Jean Lassalle, a south-western lawmaker running on rural issues, told a TV interviewer in February: \u201cThis campaign is shit\u201d and the clip has circulated widely ever since. Early campaigning began last autumn amid the Omicron wave of Covid infections. Then the surprise rise of the far-right TV pundit \u00c9ric Zemmour initially pushed the issue of national identity to the top of the agenda. But the war in Ukraine ultimately dominated headlines. Macron postponed his own start to campaigning, initially benefiting from a kind of \u201crally round the flag\u201d boost in the polls. Currently, Macron has dipped, although he holds a lead, while Le Pen and M\u00e9lenchon are rising and Zemmour has sunk back in the polls."

Macron scored better than most analysts and polls had predicted, winning 28% of the vote, but Le Pen\u2019s score of more than 23% will give her supporters plenty of hope for the coming fortnight. The far-left firebrand Jean-Luch M\u00e9lenchon came third on about 21% of the vote, confirming his status as the leader of what is left of France\u2019s left. The far-right polemicist Eric Zemmour was fourth with about 7%. The vote confirmed the radical realignment of French politics that began with the centrist Macron\u2019s victory in 2017, with the candidates of both France\u2019s traditional parties of government, the right wing Les R\u00e9publicains of Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy and the Socialist party of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, scoring 5% and 2% respectively. All the defeated candidates called on their voters to cast their ballots for Macron in the second round, with the exception of M\u00e9lenchon, who asked his voters \u201cnot to give a single vote to Mme Le Pen\u201d but stopped short of endorsing the outgoing president, and Zemmour, who called on his supporters to back the far-right candidate. An early poll of second round voting intentions put support for Macron at 54% and Le Pen at 46%. My colleague Angelique Chrisafis\u2019s full report is here And here is Angeliques\u2019s detailed analysis of where Le Pen\u2019s electoral strategy might go from here: A snap Ipsos poll of second round voting intentions carried out after polls stations closed on Sunday suggested Emmanuel Macron would win 54% of the popular vote on 24 April and Marine Le Pen 46%. About 12% of respondents said they were still undecided. The poll suggested Macron would win the support of a majority of Green and centre-right voters, while Le Pen would win the backing of 85% of Eric Zemmour\u2019s electorate. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s voters were divided more or less evenly between supporting Macron (34%), Le Pen (30%), and abstaining. Emmanuel Macron is speaking now. He thanks his cheering supporters. You can count on me to deliver this project of progress, of openness and of independence - French and European - that I have defended. He names and salutes all the candidates, and asks his supporters to applaud them, saying mutual respect is essential. He thanks particularly those who have endorsed his candidacy. He says some - referencing Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon - have called on their voters to vote for him to block the far right, and acknowledges that that is not the same as supporting his programme. He says he wants to build a common platform, uniting all parts of the political spectrum. The debate we will have over the next 15 days is decisive for our country and for Europe ... The only credible project against the high cost of living is ours. The only project for workers, for all those who are on the verge of unemployment, is ours. The only project of France and Europe, is ours. I believe in us, in all of us, whatever our origins, whatever our opinions and our beliefs. So during the next fortnight, let\u2019s spare no effort because we have not won yet. Let\u2019s be humble, let\u2019s be determined. Let\u2019s convince everyone. Here is my colleague Angelique Chrisafis\u2019s news story on the first round results: The centrist Emmanuel Macron will face the far-right Marine Le Pen in the final round of the French presidential election, after topping Sunday\u2019s first round with 28% to her 23%, according to initial projected results. France now faces a brutal two-week battle over the country\u2019s future, as Macron once again styles himself as a pro-European \u201cprogressive\u201d trying to face down what he calls Le Pen\u2019s \u201cracist\u201d, anti-Muslim, nationalist programme and her \u201ccomplacency\u201d with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, amid the war in Ukraine. Macron scored higher than his result in the first round five years ago, and clearly gained support in the final hours of the campaign after his warnings to voters to hold back the far-right and protect France\u2019s place on the international diplomatic stage as fighting continues in Ukraine. But Le Pen\u2019s score was also higher than five years ago. She had steadily gained support after campaigning hard on the cost of living crisis and the inflation that is hitting households and has become voters\u2019 biggest concern. The hard-left Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon came in third place with a higher than forecast 20% of the vote, cementing his leading position on the left after campaigning on the cost of living and transforming the presidential system. The far-right TV pundit Eric Zemmour, who had convictions for incitement to racial hatred, and had run as an outsider on anti-immigration platform came fourth with 7% of the vote \u2013 lower than he had hoped. But the biggest shock of the night was the very low score of Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, the candidate for Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s traditional right Les R\u00e9publicains. She took only 5% of the vote \u2013 a poor showing which is likely to lead to the implosion of her party in favour of its hardliners. This could leave France in a unique position in Europe without a traditional mainstream right. The decline of the traditional parties of government was confirmed by the Socialist party\u2019s candidate and mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, scoring only 2%. The Greens\u2019 Yannick Jadot scored 4.4% despite the environment being among French voters\u2019 top concerns. You can read the rest of Angelique\u2019s story here: The second round campaign starts tomorrow, and much will depend on how the 47% or so of voters who did not cast their ballots for either Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen in the first round decide to vote on 24 April. At present only Eric Zemmour, who scored 7%, has called on his supporters to back Le Pen. All other candidates but one, from centre-right to Socialist to Green, have clearly called on their voters to vote for Emmanuel Macron \u2013 but they all scored less than 7%. The one who did not was far-left France Unbowed leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, who stopped short of endorsing Macron but at least demanded that no votes be cast for Le Pen. M\u00e9lenchon scored more than 20%. How many of his voters decide to abstain rather than vote for Macron will be crucial. Eric Zemmour, the extreme right anti-immigration TV pundit who finished fourth on 7%, is speaking now. He says he is not a politician, he may have made mistakes, but still: I take each of your votes as the cry of a people that doesn\u2019t want to die. The fact that two million of you voted for me shows my message matters. Your voice can no longer be ignored. Everyone can see our ideas are worth far more than my score today. Keep the faith. Your vote is a vote for the future, because the truths we have spoken in this campaign will become obvious to all. He says he has many disagreements with Marine Le Pen, but she is opposed in the second round by a man \u201cwho has never mentioned questions of identity or fatherland\u201d. He asks his supporters to back Le Pen: I call on my voters to cast their ballots for Marine Le Pen. I know some of you will not want to. But there is something greater than all of us, and that is France.\u201d Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the far-left candidate, is speaking now. He tells his supporters: A new page of the fight is turned ... we should be proud of the work we have done. We have assembled a popular front. He asks his supporters not to vote for Marine Le Pen: We know who we will never vote for. Don\u2019t give your votes for Madame Le Pen. We must not give a single vote for Madame Le Pen. I think this message is now heard. That\u2019s not quite the same, of course, as calling on his voters to cast their ballots for Emmanuel Macron. But Macron will take it. Marine Le Pen is addressing her cheering supporters. She says the battle for the second round will be \u201ccivilisational\u201d. The people of France have expressed themselves and done me the honour of qualifying me for the second round against the outgoing president ... I wish to express my profound gratitude. She says the country faces a choice between \u201ctwo opposing visions of the future\u201d, and that she represents: the incarnation of social justice around the centuries-old idea of the nation and of the people. Everyone who didn\u2019t vote for Emmanuel Macron has a calling to join this movement. Both Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, the rightwing candidate, and Yannick Jadot, the Green party candidates, have clearly asked their supporters to vote for Emmanule Macron in the second round, saying it is essential to block the progress of the far right. Anne Hidalgo, the Socialist party candidate, has also called on her voters to back Macron. Far-left firebrand Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s decision to endorse Macron or not is likely to be very important - polls suggest many of his supporters could be tempted to vote for Le Pen. Some different takes on these first round results: Veteran France correpsondent John Lichfield: A warning from the political scientist and leading populism expert Cas Mudde: That\u2019s a significantly bigger margin of victory for the outgoing president than most analysts had predicted, but remains a very strong performance by Le Pen that will give her supporters plenty of hope for what promises to be a bruising second round. M\u00e9lenchon, head of the hard-left La France Insoumise, emerges as the uncontested leader of what remains of France\u2019s left with 20% of the vote. Eric Zemmour came fourth on about 7.2% - and many of his supporters are likely to lend their votes to Le Pen in the second round. A disastrous night, though, for the mainstream right: the rightwing Les R\u00e9publicains\u2019 candidate, Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, scored around 5% to finish fifth. And an even worse on for the Socialist party, whose candidate, Paris mayor Anne Hidaldo, scored around 2%, according to the projections. Emmanuel Macron will face Marine Le Pen in the second round of France\u2019s presidential elections, projections show. According to usually accurate estimates based on votes cast in a representative sample of polling stations nationwide, it looks like the outgoing president defeated the leader of the far-right Rassemblement National, scoring around 28.6%-28.1% of the vote against her 24.4-23.3%. The far-left leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon finished third on 20%, according to the projections. Exit polls are illegal in France, but that doesn\u2019t stop Belgian and Swiss media from doing their own and sharing them on social media. There is no certaity about which agencies carried them out, however, and even less about their methodology - and they have often proved inaccurate in the past. We\u2019ll be sticking with the official estimates based on actual votes cast in a representative sample of polling stating nationwide, due at 8pm local time. Plenty of Macron merch on offer for those at the outgoing president\u2019s post-vote pep talk: The abstention rate, likely to prove crucial in this election, is likely to be between 25% and 26.5 %, according to French pollsters \u2013 higher than in the previous 2017 first round (22.2%), but not at 2002\u2019s record level of 28.4 %. Ifop put the abstention rate at 25 %, Harris Interactive at 25.6%, and Ipsos, Elabe and OpinionWay at 26.5%. Turnout in the southwest, where voters are more likely to favour Emmanuel Macron, is reportedly higher than in the northeast, one of the regions most likely to support Marine Le Pen \u2013 but the abstenton rate in largely pro-Macron Paris is also quite high, according to French media. The two favourites to reach the second round are already preparing their election night parties. Here\u2019s the scene at Marine Le Pen\u2019s campaign HQ: And here are some of the more than 700 journalists from 37 countries who are accredited for Emmanuel Macron\u2019s post-vote bash: My colleague Kim Willsher spent the last couple of days on the trail with Marine Le Pen during the closing moments of her first round campaign, speaking to voters and reflecting on how the far-right leader has changed the image the public has of both her and her party: Marine Le Pen took over what was then the Front National in 2011 and set about laundering its image, tarnished by xenophobic neo-Nazi thugs with shaven heads and jackboots. Members were expelled for racist and antisemitic remarks or for defending Philippe P\u00e9tain, head of France\u2019s Nazi-collaborating Vichy government in the 1940s. She even threw out her own father in 2015. After her 2017 defeat against Emmanuel Macron, Kim says: She renamed the party the National Rally. It has stopped calling for the death penalty and for France to leave the EU. She continues to champion nationalistic \u201cFrench first\u201d discrimination, but there is also a commitment to more left-leaning economics, including increases in pensions, opposition to the privatisation of public services, and protectionism as an alternative to globalisation. She does not propose zero immigration, and has abandoned the party\u2019s opposition to marriage equality and abortion. Her critics say she has changed her style and not the party\u2019s toxic substance - but as the left-leaning Jean-Jaur\u00e8s Foundation noted, her personal detoxification process appears to have been successful: The arguments around her incompetence or lack of knowledge no longer seem to hold water at a time when parts of France consider her to be completely presidential and close to the people, and no more worrying than other candidates. As Kim concluded: For many French people, the Le Pen name is no longer viewed with disdain. If, as expected, Le Pen does enough to reach the second round on 24 April, Macron will face the biggest political fight of his career to keep her out of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. The veteran France correspondent John Lichfield summed up the tension around this election campaign in a recent opinion piece for the Guardian. Could the country really be on the point of electing a far-right president, he asked? Le Pen\u2019s economic programme is an incoherent mess. Her European policy is Frexit by stealth \u2013 unilaterally reducing payments to the EU budget and breaking EU laws she does not like. She also wants to ban all Muslim women from wearing veils in public. Nonetheless, as Lichfield notes: The opinion polls suggest that if enough leftwing voters stay at home in the second round, refusing to choose between Macron (\u201cthe president of the rich\u201d) and a seemingly \u201ckinder, gentler\u201d Le Pen, then she could win. Just. Macron may have reduced French unemployment to 7.4%, the lowest for 13 years, piloted France through Covid better than many other comparable countries, and revived the EU with his ideas and energy, Lichfield said. On the other hand: France is an angry country. It is always an angry country. It is especially angry at present because the Ukraine war has inflated already high petrol, diesel and food prices. But there is no real appetite in France for confrontational policies that would destroy an 80-year postwar political consensus of outward-looking tolerance and European unity ... It is, he concludes, going to be \u201ca scary two weeks for anyone who cares about the wellbeing of France or Europe\u201d. You can read John\u2019s full piece here: Turnout at 5pm local time - three hours before polling stations close - was 65%, more than four percentage points down on the last presidential elections but substantially higher than 2002\u2019s record low of 58%. France\u2019s two-round election process, designed by Charles de Gaulle to keep extremists at bay (the French say you vote first with your heart, then with your head) can be complicated to those not familiar with it. Here\u2019s a brief guide to how the system works, how France\u2019s moderate left has been plunged into disarray, how the mainstream right isn\u2019t much better, what the leading candidates stand for, and what happens next: The polling gap between the two favoutites has narrowed dramatically over the past few weeks. Exactly a month ago, on 10 March, Emmanuel Macron - buoyed by a rally-round-the-flag effect following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine - stood at about 30% and Marine Le Pen at about 18%, according to the Guardian\u2019s election tracker. On average, the latest polls put the two on 26% and 23% respectively, a difference that is equivalent to many polling organisations\u2019 margin of error. The far-left firebrand Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, leader of La France Insoumise (Unbowed France) has also surged over the same period, from 12% to 17%. Meanwhile Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse of the right-wing Les R\u00e9publicains party has seen her support fall from 12% to 8%, and Eric Zemmour, the TV polemicist whose extreme positions on Islam and immigration have done much to make Le Pen look reasonable, has fallen from 12% to 9%. The final pre-election poll from Ipsos France, which has the largest sample size (10,425 respondents) so should in principle be more accurate, showed Macron on 26.5%, Le Pen on 22.5% and M\u00e9lenchon on 17.5%. Analysts are unanious in saying that turnout among a disillusioned French electorate will be absolutely critical to these elections, and at midday it stood at 25.48% - down on the three previous presidential elections (28.5 % in 2017, 28.3 % in 2012 and 31.2 % in 2007), but up on 2002 (21.4%) which, for those of you with long mempories, was the year that Marine Le Pen\u2019s father Jean-Marie made it into the second round. It\u2019s hard to say at this stage who this might benefit. A low turnout is widely believed to be bad news for the far-right leader, because it could be a sign that her supporters, who often fail to show up on voting day in the kind of numbers that the polls predicted, may again be staying away. On the other hand, some of the detail in those midday turnout figures could be ringing a few alarm bells in the president\u2019s camp: abstention looks to be higher in the Paris region, which was heavily pro-Macron in the last elections in 2017, whereas turnout in some areas that voted predminantly for Le Pen five years ago seems to be significantly higher. The next turnout figures are expected at 5pm local time, so we may get a clearer idea then. But there will be no certainty about what it all means until the first projections when polls close at 8pm - these are not, by the way, exit polls, but estimations based on actual votes cast in a representative selection of polling stations nationwide. They are usually very accurate. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the first round of the 2022 French presidential election. It looks like being a nail-bitingly close-run thing, with opinion polls showing the gap between Marine Le Pen of the far-right Rassemblement National (National Rally) and the outgoing president, centrist Emmanuel Macron, steadily narrowing over the past few weeks. Those two candidates remain favourites to advance to the 24 April run-off that will determine who occupies the Elys\u00e9e palace for the next five years, although support for the radical left-winger Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon has also been climbing and the level of abstention could play havoc with all pre-election forecasts. It\u2019s been a strange, muted campaign that in many ways never really got off the ground, hijacked first by the pandemic and then by the war in Ukraine. But its consequences could well prove far-reaching, not just for the future direction of France but for Europe as a whole. We\u2019ll be bringing you news, comment and analysis from me, the Guardian\u2019s Paris bureau chief Angelique Chrisafis and correspondent Kim Willsher, with usually accurate projections of the first round results expected when polling stations close at 8pm local time."

Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Paris in spontaneous protest last night. In a result that plunged the country\u2019s political class into turmoil, usually reliable exit polls put Mr Le Pen\u2019s score at between 17% and 17.9% against Jacques Chirac\u2019s 19.8% to 20%.

In a result that filled many French people with shame, sent tremors through Europe and brought to a cruel end the career of the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, the interior ministry confirmed Sunday\u2019s first round exit polls and named the racist ex-paratrooper as Mr Chirac\u2019s challenger in the 5 May showdown.

One \u2013 that of the well-disciplined troops of the far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen \u2013 they could cope with. The other they couldn\u2019t.

Editorial: Chirac fights off Le Pen \u2013 for now 6 May 2002 France\u2019s 2002 presidential election was by turns shocking, shaming and shambolic. It will not quickly be forgotten, nor will the wounds quickly heal. In the end, Jean-Marie Le Pen obtained nothing like the 30% or more of the poll that his supporters claimed was possible. Yet his second-round vote remained rock solid, undented by two weeks of fierce attack from across the political spectrum. With between 5 and 6 million votes all told, he was up about 1 million votes on his 1995 presidential showing. If all of yesterday\u2019s National Front voters maintain their allegiance in next month\u2019s general election, Mr Le Pen will massively extend his parliamentary influence. Continue reading.

Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen topped that earlier poll. The runoff is decided by simple majority of valid votes: if either candidate gets one more vote than the other, he or she is elected. There is no electoral college and no role for parliament. For most of the campaign, it seemed that Macron, the incumbent president, would win comfortably in the second round. But a surge in Le Pen\u2019s polling in the final weeks made this more doubtful. A key factor will be how much support Macron can garner from those who voted for leftwinger Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon in the first round.

Polls close at 1900CEST in most districts, but at 2000CEST in Paris and other large cities. French departments in the Pacific, Atlantic and Caribbean voted on Saturday. French citizens living overseas can also vote, and 1.4m of them are on the electoral register this time. The interior ministry said it was expecting some results from rural areas as soon as polls closed in Paris, with a majority of communes reporting by about midnight."

            "content": "The polls have opened in mainland France for the second round of the presidential election in which voters will choose to give Emmanuel Macron another five years in office or elect Marine Le Pen. Macron is favourite to win but any second term will be determined by whether he finishes with a convincing victory. Both he and Le Pen need to have convinced the almost 50% of voters who did not choose either of them in the first round ballot two weeks ago. The level of abstention and the number of people protest voting by casting a blank ballot, as many supporters of \u201cthird man\u201d the radical left\u2019s Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon have promised, could affect the result. The former prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe, the mayor of Le Havre, was one of the first to vote at his local polling station. Macron voted in Le Touquet, a seaside town in northern France, where he and his wife Brigitte have a home. The president shook hands, kissed children \u2013 and quite a few female supporters \u2013 signed autographs and posed for photographs for more than 20 minutes before entering the polling station. Le Pen voted at H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, at the heart of her stronghold in northern France shortly after 11am. She was greeted outside the polling station by a crowd of supporters chanting \u201cMarine\u201d and jostling to take selfies with her. Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris and the Socialist party presidential candidate who trailed in the first round, voted in Paris 45 minutes after the polling stations opened. Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, candidate for the conservative Les R\u00e9publicains, voted shortly afterwards. They were followed by M\u00e9lenchon, who voted in Marseille and the prime minister, Jean Castex, voted at his home town of Prades in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales in southern France. Eric Zemmour voted in Paris at around midday. Turnout at 5pm was 63.23%, according to the interior ministry. This is lower than the 65.3% turnout in 2017 and 71.96% in 2012. At midday, the highest turnout on Sunday was reported to be in the Gers in south-west France and the Jura in the east. The lowest was in Seine-Saint-Denis north of Paris and the capital itself. The polling stations close at 7pm in most of mainland France and 8pm in major towns and cities. An estimation of the result based on the count from a number of specific polling stations chosen as representative of France will be announced at 8pm. While it is only an estimation it is usually a reliable indication of who has won unless it is too close to call and within a margin of error. Because of the time difference, France\u2019s overseas territories began voting on Saturday. Campaigning officially ended at midnight on Friday when all opinion polls ceased and since when the candidates have been obliged to keep a low profile. Whatever the result, Macron will hold his election night event near the foot of the Eiffel Tower at the Champ-de-Mars; Le Pen\u2019s event will be held at a former hunting lodge, now an upmarket Belle Epoque-style events venue, in the Bois de Boulogne. Macron\u2019s manifesto includes a cap on fuel prices, index-linked pensions and a progressive rise in the retirement age to 65 years. He also campaigned for a stronger Europe. Le Pen has promised to lower the retirement age from 62 to 60 for those who began work before the age of 20, dropping VAT on fuel from 20% to 5.5%, and a new law to allow French nationals priority for housing, jobs and benefits as well as the deportation of illegal immigrants. Macron and Le Pen won places in the second round two weeks ago when he polled just under 9.8m votes \u2013 27.85% of those cast \u2013 and she obtained 8.13m votes \u2013 23.15% of those cast. M\u00e9lenchon came a close third with 7.7m votes, 420,000 short of Le Pen. The candidates for the mainstream right and left both trailed with P\u00e9cresse in fifth place and Hidalgo in 10th place; both polled under 5%, meaning they will not have their campaign expenses reimbursed."

In his first public appearance since Sunday\u2019s vote, Macron strolled around a food market in the town of Cergy, north-west of Paris, shaking hands and posing for selfies. Most people were friendly, some shouted congratulations and others asked for help in finding a job, dealing with health problems or making ends meet. But at one point there were briefly boos, and a bag of tomatoes was thrown towards Macron\u2019s back but missed. A bodyguard opened an umbrella to shield the president, who quickly sidestepped the projectile and continued to greet people and shake hands. The \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said the trip was Macron\u2019s way of \u201clistening to people\u2019s concerns, expectations and needs\u201d. He told local young people that he wanted to get out on the ground \u201cfrom the start\u201d. One young woman replied: \u201cDon\u2019t just come here for the photos.\u201d Another onlooker said: \u201cIt\u2019s good that he\u2019s getting out of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e.\u201d Macron won a second term at the weekend, beating the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen by 58.5% to her 41.5%, but on the campaign trail he faced accusations of being haughty and aloof and of not understanding people\u2019s concerns about the cost of living, housing, jobs and poverty. He had struggled to shake off the tag of \u201cpresident of the rich\u201d. Macron said in Cergy: \u201cI want to give a message of respect and consideration to these areas that are among the poorest in the country, right from the start of my mandate.\u201d He acknowledged that deprived, high-rise neighbourhoods surrounding Paris had some of the highest abstention rates in the presidential vote. Macron said \u201clife was hard\u201d there and some people felt angry or cut off from politics, and not enough progress had been made in recent years to improve their lives. He said there were problems of discrimination, and a need for training schemes, more doctors and better health care in these areas, as well as job creation. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought down unemployment here, but it\u2019s still above the national average because of discrimination and not enough training,\u201d he said after meeting young local entrepreneurs. Macron, the first French leader to be re-elected for a second term in 20 years, is now focused on parliamentary elections in June. He will need a centrist majority in the 577-seat house in order to put in place his manifesto plans, including overhauling the benefits system and raising the pension age. Pollsters believe he has a good chance of winning a majority. Cergy is a leftwing area where the radical-left leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon topped the presidential vote\u2019s first round. M\u00e9lenchon is attempting to strike alliances with other parties on the left to challenge Macron\u2019s centrists in the parliamentary elections. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s party, La France Insoumise, which has 17 seats in parliament\u2019s lower house, wants to expand by hundreds more to win a majority for the left. The Socialist party and the Greens (EELV) on Wednesday began talks on possible parliamentary alliances with M\u00e9lenchon to increase the number of seats on the left. Hurdles remain. The Socialists are traditional rivals to La France Insoumise, and some older Socialists warn against \u201csurrendering\u201d the party\u2019s principles. The Greens favour an alliance, but some Green figures have said they will not compromise on their pro-Europe and anti-nuclear stance."

            "date": "2022-04-10T21:47:03Z",
            "content": "France faces a brutal two-week campaign over the country\u2019s future, as the centrist incumbent, Emmanuel Macron, faces the far-right Marine Le Pen for the presidency, positioning himself as a pro-European \u201cprogressive\u201d against what he calls her anti-Muslim, nationalist programme and \u201ccomplacency\u201d about Vladimir Putin. Macron topped Sunday\u2019s first round of the French presidential election with 27.6% of the vote, ahead of Le Pen\u2019s 23.4%, according to initial projected results by Ipsos for France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions. He scored higher than his result in the first round five years ago, and clearly gained support in the final hours of the campaign after his harsh warnings to voters to hold back the far right and protect France\u2019s place on the international diplomatic stage amid the war in Ukraine. But Le Pen\u2019s score was also higher than five years ago. She had steadily gained support after campaigning hard on the cost of living crisis and inflation, which had become voters\u2019 biggest concern. All major candidates, except for the far-right TV pundit \u00c9ric Zemmour, immediately called for French people to vote tactically to keep out Le Pen in the second round. Macron told reporters: \u201cWhen the far-right, in all its forms, represents that much in France, you can\u2019t consider things are going well, so you must go out and convince people with a lot of humility, and respect for those who weren\u2019t on our side in this first round.\u201d He told supporters: \u201cDon\u2019t be mistaken, nothing is decided, and the debate we\u2019ll have in the next two weeks will be decisive for our country and for Europe\u201d. In her own triumphant speech, Le Pen sought to capitalise on anti-Macron feeling after the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) anti-government protests and styled him as divisive and polarising. She said the final round would be \u201ca fundamental choice between two opposing visions of society\u201d, which she saw as Macron\u2019s \u201cdivision and disorder\u201d or her promise for \u201csocial justice\u201d to protect \u201csociety and civilisation\u201d. She called on \u201call those who did not vote for Macron\u201d to join her. The hard-left M\u00e9lenchon came in third, with a higher-than-forecast 22% of the vote, cementing his leading position on the left after campaigning on the cost of living and transforming the presidential system. As the contest began on Sunday night for both Macron and Le Pen to vacuum up support from the smaller candidates, the choice of M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s voters is now key. M\u00e9lenchon immediately gave a speech in Paris shouting three times: \u201cDo not give a single vote to Marine Le Pen!\u201d to huge cheers. The majority of his leftwing supporters five years ago opted to vote for Macron in the second round simply to keep out Le Pen. But polls this time have suggested that a number of them may be tempted to vote Le Pen in protest against Macron. Zemmour \u2013 who holds convictions for incitement to racial hatred and ran as an outsider on an inflammatory, anti-immigration platform \u2013 came fourth with 7.1% of the vote \u2013 lower than he had hoped. He immediately called for his voters to back Le Pen. The biggest shock of the night was the very low score of Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, the candidate for Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s traditional rightwing party Les R\u00e9publicains. She was projected to take less than 5% \u2013 a poor showing that is likely to lead to the implosion of her party in favour of its hardliners. This could leave France in a unique position in Europe of not having a traditional mainstream right. In a speech to supporters, P\u00e9cresse said: \u201c[Le Pen\u2019s] historical proximity with Vladimir Putin discredits her from defending the interests of our country in these tragic times. Her election would mean that France would become irrelevant on the European and international scenes. Therefore, and despite my strong disagreement with Macron \u2026 I will vote for him in order to stop Marine Le Pen.\u201d The decline of the traditional parties of government was confirmed by the Socialist party\u2019s candidate and mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, who took only 2% of the vote. The Greens\u2019 Yannick Jadot scored 4.4% despite the environment being among French voters\u2019 top concerns. The second round on 24 April will now be a replay of Macron and Le Pen\u2019s last bruising election encounter in 2017. But the stakes are much higher than when Macron easily beat Le Pen with 66% of the vote, which was seen as a victory against populist politics after Donald Trump\u2019s election to the US White House and Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. Macron conceded on the campaign trail he had not managed to calm voters\u2019 concerns about immigration or hold back the \u201cfears\u201d that led people to vote for extremes. Polls over the last week have shown Le Pen as high as 49% for the potential runoff. For the first time, the figures are in the margin of error and give Le Pen the mathematical chance of winning. For the first time, Le Pen is able to benefit from a reservoir of transferable votes in the second round. About 80% of the votes for Zemmour are now expected to transfer to Le Pen. Turnout was lower than five years ago, but higher than the record low in 2002 \u2013 with abstention forecast at about 26%. Macron is now seeking to be the first French president to win a second term in 20 years despite a mood of pessimism and disillusionment with politics in France. He entered the race late and said repeatedly he did not have the ability to campaign fully because he was occupied on diplomacy over the war in Ukraine and phonecalls to Putin and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Macron\u2019s election platform includes gradually raising the retirement age to 65, which is unpopular and controversial, as well as centralising the benefits system and making unemployed people on certain forms of benefits undertake 15 to 20 hours of activity a week. He has defended his in office record saying unemployment was at its lowest in 15 years, and promising he could bring full employment. He argued he was the European leader who had done the most to lessen the impact of inflation on households, but on campaign walkabouts he was greeted with angry shouts from people complaining they could not make ends meet. Le Pen\u2019s radical, far-right anti-immigration platform would involve banning the Muslim headscarf from all public places, including the street. But by focusing on families\u2019 difficulties in making ends meet she managed to neutralise historical fears about her party. This month she became France\u2019s second favourite political personality, behind the former prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe. Le Pen\u2019s campaign material, which was printed before the war in Ukraine, still featured a picture of her smiling with Putin who she met in 2017. But her swift condemnation of the invasion succeeded in drawing voters\u2019 attention away from her previous pro-Russia stances."

            "content": "The polls have opened in mainland France for the second round of the presidential election in which voters will choose to give Emmanuel Macron another five years in office or elect Marine Le Pen. Macron is favourite to win but any second term will be determined by whether he finishes with a convincing victory. Both he and Le Pen need to have convinced the almost 50% of voters who did not choose either of them in the first round ballot two weeks ago. The level of abstention and the number of people protest voting by casting a blank ballot, as many supporters of \u201cthird man\u201d the radical left\u2019s Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon have promised, could affect the result. The former prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe, the mayor of Le Havre, was one of the first to vote at his local polling station. Macron voted in Le Touquet, a seaside town in northern France, where he and his wife Brigitte have a home. The president shook hands, kissed children \u2013 and quite a few female supporters \u2013 signed autographs and posed for photographs for more than 20 minutes before entering the polling station. Le Pen voted at H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, at the heart of her stronghold in northern France shortly after 11am. She was greeted outside the polling station by a crowd of supporters chanting \u201cMarine\u201d and jostling to take selfies with her. Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris and the Socialist party presidential candidate who trailed in the first round, voted in Paris 45 minutes after the polling stations opened. Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, candidate for the conservative Les R\u00e9publicains, voted shortly afterwards. They were followed by M\u00e9lenchon, who voted in Marseille and the prime minister, Jean Castex, voted at his home town of Prades in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales in southern France. Eric Zemmour voted in Paris at around midday. Turnout at 5pm was 63.23%, according to the interior ministry. This is lower than the 65.3% turnout in 2017 and 71.96% in 2012. At midday, the highest turnout on Sunday was reported to be in the Gers in south-west France and the Jura in the east. The lowest was in Seine-Saint-Denis north of Paris and the capital itself. The polling stations close at 7pm in most of mainland France and 8pm in major towns and cities. An estimation of the result based on the count from a number of specific polling stations chosen as representative of France will be announced at 8pm. While it is only an estimation it is usually a reliable indication of who has won unless it is too close to call and within a margin of error. Because of the time difference, France\u2019s overseas territories began voting on Saturday. Campaigning officially ended at midnight on Friday when all opinion polls ceased and since when the candidates have been obliged to keep a low profile. Whatever the result, Macron will hold his election night event near the foot of the Eiffel Tower at the Champ-de-Mars; Le Pen\u2019s event will be held at a former hunting lodge, now an upmarket Belle Epoque-style events venue, in the Bois de Boulogne. Macron\u2019s manifesto includes a cap on fuel prices, index-linked pensions and a progressive rise in the retirement age to 65 years. He also campaigned for a stronger Europe. Le Pen has promised to lower the retirement age from 62 to 60 for those who began work before the age of 20, dropping VAT on fuel from 20% to 5.5%, and a new law to allow French nationals priority for housing, jobs and benefits as well as the deportation of illegal immigrants. Macron and Le Pen won places in the second round two weeks ago when he polled just under 9.8m votes \u2013 27.85% of those cast \u2013 and she obtained 8.13m votes \u2013 23.15% of those cast. M\u00e9lenchon came a close third with 7.7m votes, 420,000 short of Le Pen. The candidates for the mainstream right and left both trailed with P\u00e9cresse in fifth place and Hidalgo in 10th place; both polled under 5%, meaning they will not have their campaign expenses reimbursed."

            "date": "2022-04-01T12:28:08Z",
            "content": "With its statues and plaques venerating Hungarians who resisted Moscow\u2019s military might, Corvin Alley may seem a natural setting to sympathise with Ukraine. The circular passageway in central Budapest \u2013 nowadays a busy conduit to a nearby shopping mall \u2013 experienced some of the worst fighting of the 1956 uprising, when local teenagers since immortalised as the \u201cLads of Pest\u201d (Pesti Sr\u00e1cok in Hungarian) and lionised by the current government fought the Red Army with primitive weapons in a doomed effort to overthrow Soviet-imposed communism. Yet Ata, 39, a hotel worker and keen supporter of Hungary\u2019s governing Fidesz party, felt no connection with Ukraine\u2019s plight as he walked past a statue depicting a youthful insurgent. \u201cThere\u2019s no correlation between the two. The Ukrainians are insolent and Putin gave them what they deserved,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Ukrainians are kissing our arses and waiting for help from us, but we shouldn\u2019t get involved.\u201d That view, albeit crudely expressed, evokes a central theme as Hungarians prepare to vote on Sunday in a general election in which Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the country\u2019s self-proclaimed illiberal prime minister, is seeking a fourth successive term. Pitted against him is a unified six-party opposition bloc that he has relentlessly \u2013 and inaccurately \u2013 painted as warmongers who advocate sending Hungarian troops to fight in Ukraine. Support for Ukraine, while present among many, is qualified \u2013 and in some cases entirely absent. \u201cI would say 30-40% of Fidesz supporters are very strongly pro-Russian,\u201d said Daniel Hegedus, an analyst on central Europe at the German Marshall Fund. The attitudes stem from years of conditioning, with Orb\u00e1n casting the EU and the Hungarian-born philanthropist George Soros as enemies while fostering warm ties with President Vladimir Putin, whom he has met 12 times. The results are visible on the streets of Budapest, where walls and lamp-posts are festooned with election advertising and the Ukrainian national flag is almost nowhere to be seen, in marked contrast to some other central European capitals. In Prague, for instance \u2013 which endured its own Moscow-led invasion by Warsaw Pact forces in 1968 to crush the Czechoslovakian Prague Spring \u2013 the yellow-and-blue emblem has been widely displayed on public buildings, trams and many private homes in solidarity with Ukraine. Wariness in Hungary has been fuelled by prewar antagonisms resulting from a law enacted in Ukraine under its former president, Petro Poroshenko, designating Ukrainian as the sole official language, which nationalists have complained discriminates against an estimated 150,000 ethnic Hungarians living in the country\u2019s Transcarpathia region. The anti-Ukrainian sentiment voiced by Ata mirrored that in an article recently on pestisracok.hu, a pro-Fidesz website named after the heroes of 1956, which accused Ukraine\u2019s leaders of abusing teenagers by urging them take up arms against Russia\u2019s invasion. It raised eyebrows even in a government-friendly media landscape where pro-Russia \u2013 and anti-Ukrainian \u2013 war narratives have been widespread. \u201cThe absurdity is that Fidesz spent years creating an official narrative of the Lads of Pest as the real heroes of \u201856 for fighting a hopeless, tragic war against the overwhelmingly powerful Soviet army,\u201d said Andr\u00e1s Mink, a historian at the Blinken Open Society archives in Budapest. \u201cNow we had a news website named after those same heroes condemning Ukrainian leaders as irresponsible nationalist fascists for similarly urging their young people into a hopeless war against Russian invaders.\u201d Against this backdrop, Orb\u00e1n \u2013 while not thus far obstructing EU sanctions and Nato measures in response to Russia\u2019s invasion \u2013 has waged an election campaign on a self-styled \u201cpeace\u201d platform, vowing to keep Hungary out of a conflict in which he insists it has no stake. This has meant refusing to allow military aid \u2013 even non-lethal \u2013 to pass through Hungarian territory en route to Ukraine, a stance at odds with other former communist states in the region. Orb\u00e1n has also pledged to veto steps that would cut Russian energy supplies, something he insists would wreck Hungary\u2019s economy. His posture has angered Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who last week called out Orb\u00e1n in person as unsupportive while addressing the EU council, before criticising Hungary again by telling Danish MPs that \u201cEurope must stop listening to any excuses from Budapest\u201d. The patience of allies, too, has worn thin. A scheduled meeting in Budapest of the so-called Visegr\u00e1d group of central European countries\u2019 defence ministers was called off on Wednesday after the Polish and Czech delegations declined to attend. But in domestic political terms, the strategy appears to be working. Opinion surveys show Fidesz consistently ahead by between three and seven points. If accurate, that would put it on course to win a comfortable majority in the 199-seat parliament, although short of its current two-thirds super majority, which has enabled it to enact constitutional and voting-rule changes at will. Analysts estimate that the six-party grouping seeking to put P\u00e9ter M\u00e1rki-Zay, the winner of the 2021 opposition primary, in power needs a 3-5% popular vote advantage to ensure a parliamentary majority due to deliberately gerrymandered constituencies produced by boundary changes carried out during Fidesz\u2019 rule. Further complicating the opposition\u2019s task is the fact that the election is being held alongside a government-inspired referendum on a so-called child protection law that critics see as an attempt to prevent the teaching of LGBT rights in schools. The law makes it an offence to \u201cpromote or portray\u201d homosexuality or gender-change procedures to children. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is sending an unusually large monitoring team, has criticised the simultaneous staging of the polls. More immediately concerning for M\u00e1rki-Zay are fears that his message of more enthusiastic Nato and EU participation is not cutting through with voters in a media setting in which every regional newspaper is owned by a pro-Fidesz foundation and the opposition is limited to five minutes campaigning airtime on public television. \u201cThe election isn\u2019t taking place in a totally democratic context, but in a hybrid regime where the government enjoys a huge media advantage, with very high spending in communication and an ownership structure leaning towards Fidesz,\u201d said P\u00e9ter Krek\u00f3, the director of Political Capital, a Budapest-based thinktank. \u201cAdded to this, the opposition has failed to keep the momentum it had after last year\u2019s primaries, which was a great moment of mobilisation for them.\u201d Orb\u00e1n\u2019s non-intervention stance on Ukraine was underpinned by a narrow view of the national interest in which moral considerations played no role, said Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, his government\u2019s international spokesperson. \u201cCutting energy ties with Russia would ruin this country immediately. In that context, it doesn\u2019t matter what is right or good,\u201d he said. He dismissed parallels between the war in Ukraine and Hungary\u2019s trauma of 1956 as \u201cmisleading\u201d, adding: \u201cThe historical lesson we have is very simple. When in the neighbourhood there is a war and that war has nothing to do with Hungary, as in this case, then we would like to avoid involvement \u2026 Because if it helps one [side], it would be against the other.\u201d That view dismays several Hungarian historians, including J\u00e1nos Rainer, a founding member and former director of the 1956 Institute, dedicated to commemorating the uprising but later disbanded by Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government. \u201cThere are differences but also similarities and the most significant one is the moral meaning of the two cases,\u201d he said. \u201cAs in 1956, it is obvious today who is the aggressor and which side is the victim. Shamefully the present Hungarian government is trying to avoid taking sides in this conflict, and hides behind a \u2018neutral\u2019 rhetoric.\u201d Kriszti\u00e1n Ungv\u00e1ry, another chronicler of the 1956 rebellion, added: \u201cOrban says that for us Hungarians, Hungarian interests are the most important thing and all else is secondary. Many people are all right with this concept.\u201d Additional reporting by Flora Garamvolgyi"

            "title": "Scottish Labour sees chance of revival as polls show voters turn from Tories",
            "date": "2022-04-09T14:00:04Z",
            "content": "With a brisk and bracingly cold sea breeze buffeting the red, green and yellow trade union flags in bright sunshine, the protest at P&amp;O\u2019s Scottish ferry port had the air of a labour movement revivalist rally. Union leaders railed against P&amp;O\u2019s bosses and the Conservative government in Westminster, demanding legal action and boycotts, applauded by Labour\u2019s leader in Scotland, Anas Sarwar, who then led the march to the shuttered P&amp;O terminal at Cairnryan on the Irish Sea. That revivalist air suits Sarwar. His party\u2019s fortunes appear to be improving, on the eve of his second electoral test as Scottish Labour leader, the local elections in May. For the first time since 2017, opinion polls this year have consistently shown Labour coming second in Scotland, replacing the Tories as the main challengers to Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s Scottish National party. Party leaders are habitually cautious about snapshot polls; they capture mood, not voters\u2019 behaviour or turnout. However, one poll has particularly excited Sarwar. Last week, Survation put Labour on 27% for a Westminster election (excluding undecideds) \u2013 the highest it has polled for five years. During the worst months under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, Scottish Labour\u2019s support slumped to 13%. With those kind of numbers, Sarwar believes, Labour could regain a host of Scottish seats at the next general election. Every extra point north of 27% means several more Commons gains, he believes, and that boosts Keir Starmer\u2019s chances of becoming prime minister. Sarwar has argued vociferously that Scotland was Labour\u2019s original \u201cred wall\u201d: it was where the party\u2019s support collapsed first, at the 2015 general election, holding only one Westminster seat in a humiliating rout at the hands of the SNP. Survation\u2019s recent poll, commissioned by Ballot Box Scotland, a political blog, also found that for May\u2019s council elections, Labour attracted 23% of the vote, against 18% for the Tories, and 44% for the SNP. \u201cWhat I\u2019m confident about is that Scottish Labour is back on the pitch, that Scottish Labour is changing, and that that is starting to resonate with people again,\u201d Sarwar told the Observer, as the P&amp;O protests continued behind him. \u201cThere\u2019s still a very long way to travel. The latest trends are positive, but I\u2019m not in this to come second. I\u2019m in this to come first.\u201d But, say Labour insiders and the elections expert Sir John Curtice, this modest Labour renaissance is coming from anti-independence swing voters disillusioned with the Tories under Boris Johnson following the partygate scandals at Downing Street. There is no sign the prime minister is enjoying a boost in support because of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Labour strategists are cautious about their chances on 5 May, when the party hopes to improve on the 262 seats won in the 2017 Scottish local elections. Scotland uses the single transferrable vote system of proportional representation in council elections, which asks voters to rank candidates in order of preference. SNP supporters have the lowest propensity to vote, but unless nationalist voters stay at home in very large numbers, Labour can only cannibalise votes from other pro-UK parties to succeed. It needs to see floating unionist voters switch to Labour, or for Tory and Liberal Democrat supporters to vote tactically to keep pro-independence SNP and Green candidates at bay. It is very rare for SNP voters to lend Labour their second or third votes; those are most likely to go to the Scottish Green party, which is in coalition with the SNP at Holyrood. Sturgeon is facing significant and challenging questions about her government\u2019s economic competence: there have been disclosures about costly delays to two vitally important new Hebridean ferries, anger over councils being short-changed in the recent Scottish budget and local services being cut. But even that is unlikely to dent the SNP\u2019s vote next month, Curtice believes. Repeated attitudinal polling shows that in Scotland a voter\u2019s preferences are almost entirely defined by where they stand on the constitution. The normal policy and service delivery disputes are \u201cirrelevant\u201d to most voters, he said. Curtice argues that Scotland\u2019s political landscape has strong parallels with the constitutional divisions underlying Northern Irish politics, where no Irish nationalist could ever vote for the Democratic Unionist party. \u201cIt\u2019s all now a quasi-referendum,\u201d Curtice said. \u201cThat division is even sharper now than the one over Brexit south of the border in 2019.\u201d Standing alongside Sarwar in the sunshine at Cairnryan was Elaine Murray, the outgoing Labour leader of Dumfries and Galloway council, where 10 Labour councillors shared power with 10 SNP councillors to keep the Tories, which were the largest party with 16 seats, out of office. She is retiring in May but sees, she says, consistent evidence of unionist voters switching back to Labour. Despite heavy pressure from Labour\u2019s left, including whispering from some of Starmer\u2019s advisers, to be more accommodating over the case for an independence referendum, Sarwar has taken a hardline stance against independence. Combined with Sarwar\u2019s much greater visibility and name-recognition, as the son of the UK\u2019s first Muslim MP, Mohammed Sarwar, Murray thinks voters are shifting markedly away from the Tories. \u201cOn the doorstep, things are improving,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing people who left us in 2016 and 2017 coming back. It is because of Boris.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 April 2022 because an earlier version referred to the local elections in May as Sarwar\u2019s first electoral test as Scottish Labour leader. In fact it is his second."

            "date": "2022-04-04T13:04:58Z",
            "content": "Emmanuel Macron has urged voters to turn out on Sunday for the first round of the French presidential election, stressing the importance of giving him a clear mandate. Interviewed on morning radio, the president said he was surprised by the increasing tendency of people to ask what point there was in voting. \u201cIs it useful? Yes. If I hadn\u2019t had a real mandate five years ago I couldn\u2019t have done what I have done. Only the vote gives that legitimacy,\u201d he told France Inter. \u201cMany people sign up to causes, petitions, movements \u2026 but don\u2019t necessarily vote. Causes are important \u2026 but the profound changes we can make to society come when we vote.\u201d Six days from the first round, which will select a final two candidates, polls are still suggesting Macron is favourite to win the first round and face Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally in the runoff on 24 April, a repeat of 2017. However, with Le Pen closing the first-round gap, at 22% against Macron\u2019s 28.5% and the far-left Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon seven points behind her, political analysts and pollsters have said that the result is far from a foregone conclusion. Support for all far-right candidates is now running at about 35%. Macron admitted that during his five years in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e, marked by the Covid pandemic and more recently the war in Ukraine, he had failed to persuade people to shun the political extremes. \u201cI didn\u2019t succeed in convincing people that the extreme right is not the answer,\u201d he said. During the interview, Macron also reiterated his determination to reform the country\u2019s pension system, a proposal that sparked more than a month of strikes in France in 2019-2020, the worst industrial action to hit the country since the previous attempt to reform pensions in 2010. If re-elected he said he would raise the retirement age from 62 to 65 apart from a few special exceptions and introduce a minimum pension of \u20ac1,100 (about \u00a3925) a month that would be index linked. \u201cI want to defend the system \u2026 in which those in work pay the pensions of the retired. I want to defend this system, but we cannot carry on as things are. The system is in the red. Those on low pensions are struggling,\u201d he said. \u201cAll those who tell you we can keep pensions as they are today are lying. Today on average, people don\u2019t stop working at 62, they carry on until 63.5 years. And several million of our citizens \u2013 many of them women doing tough jobs \u2013 work until 67. There\u2019s a kind of hypocrisy about this.\u201d He has promised reforms of the health and education systems that have also raised hackles among workers. However, he said he was not planning to force 12-year-olds into apprenticeships as M\u00e9lenchon has claimed. \u201cThis is fake news,\u201d he said. Macron said he was shocked by images of alleged massacres in Ukraine and called for more severe sanctions and \u201cclear measures\u201d against Moscow, saying there was clear evidence the Russian army had committed war crimes. Under election rules, campaigning will stop on Friday at midnight so candidates have until then to persuade French voters. The far-right presidential candidate \u00c9ric Zemmour, who is fourth or fifth in the polls has ramped up his anti-immigration rhetoric, pledging to expel 1 million foreigners if elected. The centre-right Les R\u00e9publicains candidate Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, currently polling at the same level, says voters need to revolt to avoid a Le Pen v Macron runoff, while the Socialist party\u2019s Anne Hidalgo, currently languishing far down the polls, has urged those in the \u201cleftwing family\u201d to support her."

Of the 10 other candidates in the field, only far-left firebrand Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon exceeded 10%, scoring 22%. The second round run-off is a repeat of the 2017 election, when Macron defeated Le Pen with 66.1% of the vote against her 33.9%, but looks set to be a great deal closer. Le Pen, who has focused her campaign on the cost of living crisis, will gain the backing of many voters who supported the far-right TV pundit \u00c9ric Zemmour. Macron, who is fighting more active second round promoting his solid economic record and crisis management, will collect votes from the more mainstream right and left and the Greens, but will also need the backing of some who voted for M\u00e9lenchon - many of whom would rather abstain or vote Le Pen \u2022 This article was amended on 30 March 2022.

            "content": "Even Vladimir Soloviev, a state TV host, was having trouble swallowing the loss of Russia\u2019s flagship cruiser Moskva last week as he took aim at a rare target: the Russian military. \u201cYou just tell me how you were able to lose it,\u201d he said in an extended temper tantrum on his talkshow, one of Russia\u2019s most popular. \u201cTell me, what the hell were you doing in that particular area of the Black Sea at that moment?\u201d Soloviev remains pro-Putin and pro-war. But the rare outburst has pointed to how the stress of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has grown as the invasion enters its third month, with both sides announcing a \u201cnew stage\u201d in the conflict in the \u201cbattle for Donbas\u201d. Kremlin officials have shown no signs of contrition. Vladimir Putin decorated the 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade for its \u201cmass heroism and courage\u201d after the same unit had been accused by Ukraine of committing war crimes in Bucha. But as the cost of the invasion has grown, some unlikely critics of the war have also grown more outspoken. \u201cI don\u2019t see a SINGLE beneficiary of this mad war!\u201d wrote the outspoken businessman Oleg Tinkov in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cInnocent people and soldiers are being killed. Generals have woken up from their hangover to understand they have a shit army. And why would the army be good, if everything else in the country is shit and rife with nepotism, lackyism, and servility? \u201cDear \u2018collective west\u2019, please give Mr Putin a clear exit to save his face and stop this massacre.\u201d Russian MPs have suggested charging him with discrediting the Russian armed forces. On both sides of a polarised Russian society, the failures of the first stage of the war have raised the stakes of the conflict, turning what the Kremlin calls a \u201cspecial operation\u201d into an existential one. \u201cWe are seeing that the fate of Putin, Russia and society as a whole is being merged into one,\u201d said Greg Yudin, a sociologist. \u201cI hear more often that while people think the war might have been a mistake, they say there is no way back; they say \u2018we\u2019ve got to finish the job.\u2019\u201d Marina Litvinovich, an opposition activist and politician who has remained in Russia, said she saw the war as a stress test for the government that threatened to bring down the \u201ccolossus with clay feet\u201d that Putin had built over 20 years in power. But among ordinary Russians, she also sees clear signs of war fatigue brought on by a flood of information from the early days of the invasion. Apathy is on the rise. \u201cI see people becoming used to the war,\u201d said Litvinovich. \u201cFrom some kind of nightmare or horror, the war has become ordinary for many.\u201d People were \u201cemotionally burnt out\u201d, she said, and were increasingly turning away from the news even as the failures onboard the Moskva cruiser were exposed. Meanwhile, the early economic shocks of the war had passed for many, and few were looking to the economic recession to come. \u201cRight now there\u2019s this kind of false sense that life has normalised,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople think that the economic difficulties have passed.\u201d The government has taken extraordinary steps, including the introduction of capital controls, to prevent an economic collapse. Maxim Reshetnikov, the head of Russia\u2019s Ministry of Economic Development, claimed on Tuesday that the country had \u201cwithstood the first blow of sanctions\u201d. But within the business community, there are clear signs of distress, as international companies continue to exit Russia on a daily basis. The Moscow mayor has predicted the loss of 200,000 jobs, proposing that out-of-work professionals can be retrained or temporarily employed, including doing \u201csocially important\u201d work in parks. Several big names have voted with their feet. The Russian business daily Vedomosti reported on Monday that Lev Khasis, a former senior executive at the state-owned Sberbank, had left the country for the US. But government officials have mostly remained in their posts. Temporary work stoppages at some large factories have not led to the kind of economic protests that the Kremlin is truly concerned about. \u201cPutting aside personal positions about the war (some are for, some are against), people are mobilising and working as hard and creatively as possible,\u201d a senior director for a major metals company said. \u201cThey understand that they need to give it their all for the company and themselves to survive.\u201d New polling from the independent Levada Centre has indicated that Russian views on the west in particular grew more negative in March, likely due to sanctions and vocal western support for Ukraine. Those thoughts have largely been encouraged by Russian state media, where remarks that would have been considered fringe and genocidal, including calls for the erasure of Ukrainian culture, have increasingly been made on print and in primetime. \u201cThere are a lot of people who actually believe in this stuff,\u201d said a senior manager in a state news agency. \u201cAnd even if not, any Russian person at our level is apoliticised. It\u2019s not for us to analyse the decisions \u2026 made by the bosses.\u201d The Kremlin may want to finish the war as soon as possible, aiming for 9 May Victory Day, which marks the defeat of Nazi Germany. \u201cBut judging by the way the operation is going, he may prolong the hostilities, and 9 May will be just a day to achieve intermediate goals,\u201d said Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Centre."

            "date": "2022-04-27T14:00:32Z",
            "content": "Few people in the west doubt that Ukraine is fighting a just war. Russia\u2019s invasion was entirely unprovoked. Whatever complaints it may have had about Nato expansion or Ukraine\u2019s mistreatment of Russians in Donbas, nobody had attacked Russia, and nobody was planning to. Vladimir Putin launched a straightforward war of aggression and territorial conquest. It follows that supporting Ukraine is the right thing to do. But it is not at all clear that the kind of support we are giving (and not giving) is the right way to go about preserving the Ukrainian nation. The longer this war rages on, the more Ukrainians will flee their homeland, and the more devastation will be wrought upon their homes, cities, industry and economy. Yet the west\u2019s current approach of supporting Ukraine\u2019s war aim of defeating the aggressor, and providing arms for that purpose while pointedly avoiding direct military intervention, is guaranteed to prolong the war. Russia\u2019s progress may be slowed, but it\u2019s highly unlikely to be stopped, far less pushed out of Ukraine, and in the meantime the grinding destruction and hideous war crimes will continue. No day goes past without some senior western politician proclaiming that Ukraine will be \u201csuccessful\u201d and that Russia is \u201cfailing\u201d. This is certainly morale-boosting. But it is clearly nonsense. The fact is, as time goes on, more towns and cities are destroyed and then fall to the Russians. In two months, the area under Russian control \u2013 originally just the breakaway parts of Donbas \u2013 has grown to perhaps five times the size. If Russia continues to suffer \u201cdefeats\u201d at this pace, then in another two months the entire south of Ukraine will be in ruins, cities such as Odesa will resemble Mariupol, and thousands upon thousands more Ukrainians will have died. Worse, as the war goes on, and more towns are destroyed, it becomes less likely that Ukrainians who have fled to other countries will ever return, because they will have no homes or workplaces to come back to. How many citizens of Mariupol will ever return? If Russia\u2019s aim was to exterminate the Ukrainian nation, then the west\u2019s approach is helping to do just that. Surely, if the lives of Ukrainian people are our concern then the west has to do something to stop the war \u2013 now. Encouraging the Ukrainians to continue, however just their cause, is merely making their country uninhabitable. The trouble is, there are only two ways to stop the war quickly, and neither is palatable to most western leaders. One would be for Nato to enter the war and make a quick, massive and decisive strike to cripple Russia\u2019s invasion forces. Unlike with Russia\u2019s actions, it would have every right under international law to do so. When Putin intervened in Syria, he very carefully framed this as a response to a request from Syria\u2019s legitimate and internationally recognised government. The west could do the same in Ukraine. Putin himself has no such justification for his invasion. The risk involved in this \u2013 of a third world war \u2013 is obvious, and it\u2019s why the west refuses to intervene directly. The other option is to persuade Putin to implement an immediate ceasefire, by inviting Russia to comprehensive peace talks. Western leaders are disinclined to parley with a butcher such as Putin. But they did it with Serbia\u2019s Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, only months after the massacre at Srebrenica, and the result was the Dayton agreement that put an end to the war in Bosnia in 1995. To get Putin to the negotiating table at all, everything would have to be up for discussion \u2013 including Ukraine\u2019s borders, Russia\u2019s age-old security concerns, perhaps even the very logic of basing today\u2019s international frontiers in that part of Europe on what were internal borders in the USSR, drawn up by communist leaders precisely to prevent Soviet republics and regions from being viable independent states. The outcome of the talks does not need to be predetermined. The important thing is to talk rather than fight. Western leaders cannot bring themselves to broach these matters, which would seem to reward Putin for attempting to redraw the map by force. They would rather fight \u2013 or more accurately, let Ukraine fight, in the hope of defeating Russia. But if one thing is certain it is that Putin will never accept defeat. He is already too deeply invested in this war to back off with nothing to show for it. If western leaders think that their arms-length encouragement of Ukraine will bring about a Ukrainian military victory, then they are fatally misreading Putin\u2019s intentions and resolve. For Ukraine\u2019s sake, we need to stop him now, one way or the other, before nothing is left of the country we want to protect.

            "content": "This blog is now closed. You can find our continuing rolling coverage here. Ukraine\u2019s armed forces has released its latest update on operations over the last day. \u201cThe main efforts of the enemy are focused on the regrouping and strengthening of troops, continuing the partial blockade of the city of Kharkiv and its shelling with artillery,\u201d it said. The Ukrainian armed forces said it repelled 10 enemy attacks in the Donetsk and Luhansk territories in the last 24 hours, destroying three tanks, an armoured personnel carrier, two cars and three artillery systems. It said one Russian armoured personnel carrier was also captured. It warned of an increased threat of missile strikes on Ukrainian defence and logistical infrastructure from Russian warships in the Black Sea armed with missiles. \u201cIn the waters of the Sea of Azov, the enemy\u2019s naval group continues to carry out tasks to block the port of Mariupol and provide fire support in the coastal direction,\u201d it said. The Armed Forces briefing reported \u201cno significant changes\u201d in the situation at Severodonetsk, where yesterday the head of its Civil Military Administration Oleksandr Striuk had reported heavy fire and the destruction of about 70% of the city. Only around 20,000 residents of the total 135,000 remain in the city, he said. According to the Armed Forces statement on Saturday, shared on official Telegram channels, Russian activity has been most concentrated in the direction of Slobozhansky and Donetsk. The briefing reported continued fighting in Slobozhansky, including Russian ground troops, airborne troops, and coastal troops of the Baltic and Northern fleets. In Donetsk Russian forces were attempting to take control of the Luhansk settlements of Popasna - where the report said Ukrainian forces had been under constant fire, and Rubizhne, as well as to establish full control over Mariupol, it said. There was continued shelling \u201cin most directions\u201d. Up to 22 battalions were at Izyum city, it said, noting the deployment of additional units. Izyum, a city on the Donetsk river and gateway to the Donbas, was the site of heavy fighting during the invasion, and the briefing flagged the possibility of intensified fighting there and in Barvinkove as Russia pushed towards Slovyansk. IT also warned of intensified hostilities in Avdiivka, about 130km north of Mariupol. \u201cThe enemy is expected to continue fighting to reach the administrative borders of Kherson region and will try to resume the offensive,\u201d it said. AFP: Thousands of faithful attended the \u201cWay of the Cross\u201d prayer service, presided over by Pope Francis at Rome\u2019s Colosseum on Friday, a ceremony overtaken by the war in Ukraine. It was the first time the traditional event on Good Friday, which marks the day Jesus Christ died on the cross in the Christian calendar, was held at the Roman monument since 2019, due to the Covid pandemic. The pope, who has repeatedly condemned the conflict in Ukraine, and has called for an Easter ceasefire, prayed that the \u201cadversaries shake hands\u201d and \u201ctaste mutual forgiveness\u201d. \u201cDisarm the raised hand of brother against brother,\u201d he said. Among the families who were entrusted with carrying the crucifix at each of the 14 stations of the cross were two women, one Russian and one Ukrainian, who are life-long friends. The women carried the cross during one portion of the Way of the Cross, the traditional procession that commemorates the 14 stations of Jesus\u2019 suffering and death, from his condemnation to his burial. But the Vatican\u2019s initiative, intended as a gesture of reconciliation in the face of the war that began February 24, was not well received by Ukrainian officials. On Tuesday, the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Bishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, denounced an \u201cinappropriate, premature and ambiguous idea, which does not take into account the context of Russia\u2019s military aggression\u201d. For his part, the Ukrainian ambassador to the Holy See said he \u201cshared the general concern\u201d. In a sign of the sensitivity of the issue, the Ukrainian media boycotted the broadcast of the ceremony, while the Vatican had added commentary in Ukrainian and Russian for the broadcast. In the crowd at the event, Anastasia Goncharova, an 18-year-old tourist from Kyiv, said \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a really good idea because we are no longer brother nations. They are killing our children, they are raping our children, stealing our house. It\u2019s disgusting\u201d In the end the two Russian and Ukrainian friends did carry the crucifix together. A contemplative silence replaced an original text for the occasion, which was intended to deal more specifically with the war in Ukraine. Most of those attending welcomed the Vatican\u2019s Russia-Ukraine initiative. \u201cIt is the cross, and therefore the pain of these two peoples, but also hope, because we believe that after the war there will be peace. It is very beautiful,\u201d said Bethouart. More air raid sirens across Ukraine reported in the last hour, in the capital Kyiv, as well as in the central and western regions of the country including Rivne, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Volyn, Khmelnytsky, Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr. The Associated Press fact-checking unit has assessed some videos flying around purporting to be the destruction of the Moskva. Upshot: they\u2019re not. The clips, which some have claimed shows missiles striking the Russian warship, is actually 2013 footage of a Norwegian Navy test missile strike. Following the destruction of the Moskva - which Ukraine claims they hit with anti-ship missiles but Russia says was a victim of bad weather and an on-board fire - social media users shared images and videos out of context to claim they showed the aftermath of an attack. One such widely-shared video showed a large warship exploding, sending a plume of thick, dark smoke into the air. A Twitter user shared it on Thursday, calling it \u201ca video of the explosion of a Russian cruiser after being hit by a Ukrainian missile,\u201d another post claimed the footage was from \u201cyesterday in Ukraine.\u201d However, the footage was actually taken about nine years ago off the coast of Norway, and shows a Naval Strike Missile being tested on a decommissioned Norwegian ship during a military exercise, according to reports at the time from military.com, the British news agency South West News Service and others, which all used the same footage. CNN also aired a June 2013 report about the exercise, using the footage and crediting it to the Norwegian navy. A reverse image search using frames from the clip shows that the same video has been circulating online for years, predating the current war between Russia and Ukraine. In the last hour, air raid sirens have gone off across multiple cities in central, eastern, and southern Ukraine, including: Dnipropetrovsk, Kryvyi Rih, Zaporizhzhia, Cherkasy, Donetsk, Odesa, Kharkiv, Poltava and Mykolaiv, according to official Ukrainian Telegram channels. US media is reporting senior US defence officials confirming the Russian warship, Moskva, was destroyed by Ukrainian missile strikes. The Moskva was destroyed in the black Sea earlier this week. Ukraine says it hit the ship with two Neptune anti-ship missiles, and is bracing for revenge attacks. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said a fire onboard and \u201cstormy sea conditions\u201d were to blame (although Russian state TV presenters are not unanimously toeing that line). On Friday senior US defence officials confirmed Ukraine\u2019s version of events, according to the Washington Post and New York Times. In the CNN interview Zelenskiy was also asked about the Moskva, but was circumspect in his response. \u201cWe know that it does not exist anymore. For us it is a strong weapon against our country so its sinking is not a tragedy for us,\u201d Zelenskiy said. He said \u201chistory will tell\u201d what happened to it. There is very little information about the fate of the 510 personnel on board the Moskva, a significant and well known flagship of Russia\u2019s fleet. Moscow has given not details or released photos. The Guardian\u2019s Luke Harding in Kyiv and Andrew Roth reported yesterday: An article published by the Tass state-run news agency initially claimed the \u201centire crew\u201d had been evacuated. It was later edited to remove the word \u201centire\u201d. One unconfirmed Ukrainian report said 14 sailors including the chief of Moskva\u2019s medical service were taken to the Crimean port of Sevastopol. The fate of the other 494 was unknown, it said. If they are confirmed to have drowned it would amount to the largest number of deaths of Russian servicemen in a single incident since the second world war. Anton Gerashchenko, a Ukrainian interior ministry adviser who has a popular Telegram channel, posted a photo of the Moskva\u2019s captain, Anton Kuprin. Kuprin was killed during the explosion and fire on the ship, Gerashchenko claimed. It was Kuprin who gave the order for the Moskva to shell Snake Island in the Black Sea during the first hours of Moscow\u2019s invasion. Its Ukrainian defenders refused to surrender and said: \u201cRussian warship \u2018go fuck yourself\u2019\u201d \u2013 a slogan that has become a national meme. Zelenskiy has spoken to CNN, saying the world should be prepared for the possibility that Russia decides to use nuclear or chemical weapons against Ukraine. He said the Russians could do it because Putin did not value the lives of the people. \u201cWe should think not be afraid, not be afraid but be ready. But that is not a question for Ukraine, not only for Ukraine but for all the world, I think,\u201d he said. US officials have warned of the potential for Putin to use nuclear weapons in the conflict. \u201cGiven the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they\u2019ve faced so far militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low yield nuclear weapons,\u201d CIA Director Bill Burn said on Thursday. Zelenskiy also said his information was that about 2,500-3,000 Ukrainian military personnel had been killed, and Russia\u2019s military had lost about 19,000-20,000. He said about 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers were injured, some seriously. Ukraine\u2019s prime minister Denys Shmyhal and top finance officials will visit Washington next week, according to a Reuters report, citing unnamed sources familiar with the situation. The delegation, also including finance minister Serhiy Marchenko, and central bank governor Kyrylo Shevchenko, will be there at the same time as the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, it said. Shmyhal, Marchenko and Shevchenko are expected to have bilateral meetings with finance officials from Group of Seven countries and others, the report said, and would take part in a World Bank-hosted roundtable on the Ukraine conflict on Thursday. The event will be the first chance for key Ukrainian officials to meet in person with a host of financial officials from advanced economies since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Thursday\u2019s meeting will be more of a roundtable than a donors conference, although both the IMF and World Bank have set up separate accounts to be able to process and relay donations, and additional pledges are expected to be announced next week. It will give officials a chance to discuss the physical devastation and economic consequences of the war, as well as the continued functioning of Ukraine\u2019s banking and financial sector. \u201cWithout support now, there will be no reconstruction in the future,\u201d one of the sources said. The World Bank had no immediate comment on the event. Hello, this is Helen Davidson to take you through the next few hours of developments. The German government says it plans to release more than a billion euros in military aid for Ukraine. On Friday the country\u2019s finance minister, Christian Lindner, confirmed the government had decided to increase its international aid in the defence sector to \u20ac2bn, with the largest portion going to Ukraine as military aid. The funds must mainly be used by Ukraine for military equipment purchases, the Associated Press reported. It follows pressure from Ukraine - where president Zelenskiy again today pushed for more weapons from supportive states - and criticism from other EU governments for Germany\u2019s apparent lack of weapons support to Kyiv. Diplomatic feathers were ruffled earlier in the week after Kyiv rejected a proposed visit by Germany\u2019s president Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a former foreign minister who recently acknowledged \u201cerrors\u201d in a too conciliatory stance toward Moscow in the past, the AP reported. The Ukrainian presidency instead said it wanted to welcome Chancellor Olaf Scholz to Kyiv, but the chancellor indicated he had no plans to visit anytime soon, despite coming under pressure from Ukrainian and opposition figures to follow in the footsteps of several other world leaders, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen. The captain of the Russian warship Moskva was killed during the attack that sank it, Ukraine claimed. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Kyiv\u2019s ministry of internal affairs, said Anton Kuprin died during an explosion and fire onboard the ship. Ukraine is now bracing for revenge attacks for its hand in sinking the Moskva. Western intelligence corroborates Ukraine\u2019s account that two of its missiles sunk the warship, though Russia has provided an alternative explanation. Russian strikes targeted the factory near Kyiv where the Ukrainian missiles used to sink the flagship are made. More than 900 civilian bodies have been discovered in the region surrounding Kyiv after the withdrawal of Russian forces, local police said. Almost all of them were shot dead, indicating execution during the Russian occupation, it was claimed. Their number was far greater than previously thought. In Kharkiv, officials also said that 10 people, including baby were killed and 35 wounded following Russian air strikes. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, recently made a direct appeal to his US counterpart, Joe Biden, for Washington to designate Russia a \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism. The Washington Post first reported the news. It would be a rare and radical sanction. But Zelenskiy has been firm in putting pressure on the west to assist in Ukraine\u2019s resistance to Russia\u2019s invasion. In his latest address, Zelenskiy once again pushed for more weapons, and more sanctions - so the war could end sooner. Zelenskiy also spoke about a return to \u201cnormal life\u201d in some parts of the country - or efforts to regain normality amid the tragedy. In parts of Ukraine, Zelenskiy noted that four-fifths of Ukranian enterprises have returned to work in safe areas. Sweden and Finland said they were deliberating Nato membership. Tytti Tuppurainen, Finland\u2019s minister for European affairs, said: \u201cThe people of Finland seem to have already made up their mind\u201d. She added the decision was \u201chighly likely\u201d but \u201cnot made yet\u201d pending discussions in parliament. Outgunned, outnumbered and surrounded by Russian forces, one of Europe\u2019s biggest metallurgical plants has become Mariupol\u2019s redoubt. The factory is \u201can enormous space\u201d in which the Russians \u201csimply can\u2019t find\u201d Ukrainian forces, Oleh Zhdanov \u2013 a military analyst based in Kyiv \u2013 told Reuters. Russia threatened to intensify its attacks on Kyiv if Ukrainian forces carry out any operations on Russian territory. A spokesperson for Moscow\u2019s defence ministry said: \u201cThe number and scale of missile strikes against targets in Kyiv will increase in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any attacks of a terrorist nature or sabotage on Russian territory.\u201d Russia designated journalist and Youtuber Yury Dud and political analyst Ekaterina Schulmann as \u201cforeign agents\u201d today, a continuation of Russia\u2019s crackdown on those critical of the Russian government within the country. Dud and Schulmann have both been publicly critical of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u2013 Maanvi Singh, Gloria Oladipo, Kevin Rawlinson In his latest address, Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskiy once again pushed for more weapons, and more sanctions \u2013 so the war could end sooner. He said: If someone says: year or years, I answer: you can make the war much shorter. The more and the sooner we get all the weapons we have requested, the stronger our position will be and the sooner peace will come. The more and the sooner we get the financial support we have requested, the sooner there will be peace. The sooner the democratic world recognizes that the oil embargo against Russia and the complete blockade of its banking sector are necessary steps towards peace, the sooner the war will end. So the number one task is to speed up the restoration of peace. Zelenskiy also spoke about a return to \u201cnormal life\u201d in some parts of the country \u2013 or efforts to regain normality amid the tragedy. The restoration of normal life in those areas and districts where the occupiers were expelled continues. The amount of work is really huge. 918 settlements of different scales, but equally important for us, for Ukraine, have already been de-occupied. We carry out demining. We restore the supply of electricity, water and gas. We restore the work of the police, post office, state and local authorities. Humanitarian headquarters have started working on the territory of 338 liberated settlements. We are resuming the provision of regular and emergency medical care, the work of educational institutions - where it is really possible. In total, on this day, Russian troops have destroyed or damaged 1,018 educational institutions across our country. Restoration of roads and railways has begun. In particular, from tomorrow the railway connection with Chernihiv and Nizhyn will be restored. Trains are already running between the cities of the Sumy region. The teams of Ukravtodor and Ukrzaliznytsia work quite efficiently, and I am grateful to them for this speed. For giving people back a sense of normal life, which the occupiers tried to destroy forever. In parts of Ukraine, Zelenskiy noted that four-fifths of Ukranian enterprises have returned to work in safe areas. Transport networks are being rebuilt. Good performance is shown in trade and services. And all this is also the fulfillment of the national task of accelerating the restoration of peace. That is why I am grateful to everyone who keeps jobs, who employs our people, who helps businesses adapt to these difficult conditions and gives Ukraine the necessary economic strength to live. No matter what, in all cities and communities where there are no occupiers and hostilities, it is necessary to restore the economy to the maximum. And finally. The important words that hope always wins even under seemingly insurmountable circumstances. This Saturday, the Jewish community celebrates Passover. Holiday of liberation. Holiday of life. I sincerely wish all those who celebrate in Ukraine and in the world peace, good and the inevitable defeat of any evil that threatens freedom and life on earth. The death toll in Kharkiv is up to 10, according to Nexta: According to Kharkiv region governor Oleh Synehubov, there has not been a single day without air strikes since the Russian invasion began. A mass grave in Bucha, the aftermath of the Russian attack on the station in Kramatorsk, young Ukrainian refugees in Tijuana and the shelling of Kharkiv: here photographs from the seventh week of the Russian invasion of Ukraine Please take care: readers may find some of these images distressing. If the US designates Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, as Volodymyr Zelenskiy has reportedly requested, it would be a rare and radical sanction. But Zelenskiy has been firm in putting pressure on the west to assist in Ukraine\u2019s resistance to Russia\u2019s invasion, and this is no exception as his country endures atrocities from its northern neighbor. He asked the US president in a recent phone call, but the question has not previously been reported, the Post adds, citing unnamed sources, who apparently indicated that \u201cBiden did not commit to specific actions during the call.\u201d The Washington Post reports that \u201ceven during the cold war, Washington refrained from designating the Soviet Union in this manner despite Moscow\u2019s support for groups considered terrorist actors throughout the 1970s and 1980s.\u201d Justification for the designation would have to be arrived at by secretary of state Antony Blinken. The designation is normally applied to nations that \u201crepeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism\u201d, according to a State Department fact sheet cited by the Post, which adds that there are four countries on the department\u2019s list right now: North Korea, Cuba, Iran and Syria. While Russia has not provided many details on what exactly happened to the Moskva, a crowd in Crimea gathered to mourn the ship\u2019s demise. From Reuters: Dozens of people gathered in the Crimean city of Sevastopol on Friday to mourn the sinking of the flagship of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet, a symbol, the crowd heard, of hope, revival and power until its demise. Some embraced and others laid flowers in memory of the Moskva missile cruiser at a monument to the 1696 foundation of the Russian navy in the centre of Sevastopol, headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet. Moscow, which annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, said the ship sank while being towed in stormy seas after a fire caused by an ammunition explosion. Ukraine said one of its missiles had caused it to sink. \u201cEven for those who have not been on it, the Moskva was a symbol for everyone, a symbol of our power, of our hope, of the revival of the fleet in the 1990s\u201d following the collapse of the Soviet Union, said Reserve Captain Sergei Gorbachev, who spoke to the crowd in his naval uniform. \u201cThere will be victories, there will be tragedies, but the memory remains,\u201d Gorbachev said. The crowd, which included a number of people who served on the ship, stood in respectful silence. Some wore the ribbon of St. George, a symbol of the Russian military. \u201cThe loss of every ship, especially a flagship, is a tragedy for all those tens of thousands of people who served there for over 20 years,\u201d said priest Georgiy Ployakov. Russia sent tens of thousands of soldiers into Ukraine on Feb 24 on what it calls a \u201cspecial operation\u201d. Air strike sirens are reportedly sounding off in Kyiv, according to online reports. From the Guardian\u2019s Luke Harding: Ambassadors from several countries are coming back to Kyiv after evacuating amid Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Italy\u2019s ambassador to Ukraine will return to Ukraine\u2019s capital city Kyiv, with plans to resume working on 18 April. France also announced today that their embassy will reopen shortly, with plans to move the embassy back to Kyiv, after the embassy was temporarily relocated to Lviv. From the Kyiv Independent: Russia blocked the websites of Radio France Internationale and the Russian-language service of The Moscow Times in an ongoing crackdown against independent media, reported Reuters. The English-language website for the Moscow Times has not been affected, confirmed Moscow Times in a statement. The news organization said the move to block its website by Russian officials was because of a story it published on the conflict in Ukraine. Radio France Internationale said it had not been provided with an explanation on why the website was blocked in Russia. A stamp featuring the Russian warship Moskva that sank is now a collector\u2019s item, reports AFP. A stamp depicting a Ukrainian soldier making an obscene hand gesture at the Russian Black Sea flagship Moskva has become a collector\u2019s item for Ukrainians who see it as a sign of \u201cvictory\u201d. At the central post office in the capital Kyiv, hundreds of Ukrainians of every age could be seen queueing for hours on Friday to get their hands on one of the one million copies printed so far. \u201cThat ship was the biggest one they had.... They gambled a lot on it and we destroyed it!\u201d said Yury Kolesan, 22, who waited for two-and-a-half hours to get a set of 30 stamps. \u201cIt\u2019s a new phase of the war, one of victory!\u201d The warship sank on Thursday after an explosion and fire that Ukraine claimed was caused by a missile strike - while Russia said the damage was caused by an explosion of munitions on board. The missile cruiser gained notoriety in the early stages of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine when its crew called on a unit of Ukrainian border guards to surrender, only for them to defiantly refuse. The incident quickly became a symbol of Ukraine\u2019s resistance against Russia\u2019s assault. Ukraine\u2019s postal service last month launched a competition to illustrate the episode. Out of more than 500 submissions, Lviv designer Boris Groh\u2019s winning entry shows a Ukrainian soldier from behind swearing at the warship. It has proved a hit, selling out in many post offices and quickly appearing for resale online. \u201cWe wanted to print more but the bombing last night in Kyiv affected the work of the factory and we did not manage to print the necessary quantity,\u201d Ukrainian postal service Igor Smelyansky told AFP. Russian officials have provided few details about the Moskva ship that was sunk by Ukraine missiles, but created a memorial for the ship\u2019s sinking. From the Guardian\u2019s Andrew Roth: Russia designated journalist and Youtuber Yury Dud and political analyst Ekaterina Schulmann as \u201cforeign agents\u201d today, a continuation of Russia\u2019s crackdown on those critical of the Russian government within the country. Dud and Schulmann have both been publicly critical of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Here is on possible retaliation Ukraine might face after the Moskva ship sinking from the Guardian\u2019s Luke Harding and Andrew Roth: Ukraine has said it is bracing itself for revenge attacks from Russia after the \u201csignificant and symbolic\u201d sinking of Russia\u2019s flagship cruiser, the Moskva. The government in Kyiv said it had destroyed the giant missile cruiser during a combat operation against Russian vessels in the Black Sea on Wednesday. The boat\u2019s ammunition deck exploded after it was hit by two Neptune anti-ship missiles, it added. According to Lithuania\u2019s foreign minister, Arvydas Anu\u0161auskas, the cruiser sent out a distress call. By 1.14am local time (2314 BST) on Thursday the Moskva was lying on its side and about half an hour later \u201call the electricity went out,\u201d he posted on Facebook. From 2am a Turkish ship managed to rescue 54 sailors. An hour later Turkey and Romania confirmed the ship had \u201ccompletely sunk\u201d. Ukrainian officials said stormy weather stopped Russian boats from carrying out an evacuation, adding: \u201cNature was on our side.\u201d The Kremlin has not given any details on possible casualties among the 510 crew of the Moskva, and has not released any photographs of the stricken ship. Read the full article here. Seven people were killed today after Russian shelling hit a residential area, reports Reuters. The regional governor of Kharkiv said today that seven people, including a small child, were killed and 34 wounded following Russian air strikes. From Nexta: Russia describes its invasion of Ukraine as a \u201cspecial operation\u201d and has denied targeting civilian areas. Russian missile strikes have hit a military factory near Kyiv that makes the missiles Ukraine claims it used to sink the Moskva naval flagship, reported AFP. A workshop and an administrative building at the Vizar plant, which is near Kyiv\u2019s international Zhuliany airport, were seriously damaged because of Russia\u2019s strikes, an AFP journalist saw. Earlier, Russia had announced it used Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles to hit the factory, which Ukraine\u2019s state weapons manufacturer Ukroboronprom says produced Neptune missiles. \u201cThere were five hits. My employee was in the office and got thrown off his feet by the blast,\u201d said Andrei Sizov, a 47-year-old owner of a nearby wood workshop \u201cThey are making us pay for destroying the Moskva,\u201d he said. It was the first major Russian strike around the Ukrainian capital in over two weeks. The Kyiv regional governor said there were at least two other Russian strikes today, but did not provide details on the damage sustained or any casualties. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events so far: The captain of the Russian warship Moskva was killed during the attack that sank it, Ukraine claimed. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Kyiv\u2019s ministry of internal affairs, said Anton Kuprin died during an explosion and fire onboard the ship. More than 900 civilian bodies have been discovered in the region surrounding Kyiv after the withdrawal of Russian forces, local police said.

A spokesperson for Moscow\u2019s defence ministry said: \u201cThe number and scale of missile strikes against targets in Kyiv will increase in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any attacks of a terrorist nature or sabotage on Russian territory.\u201d I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague Gloria Oladipo. France will make housing and family benefits available to Ukrainian refugees, reports Reuters. France will make housing and family benefits available for Ukrainian refugees once the emergency lodging phase is over, the country\u2019s interior ministry said on Friday. France will give displaced Ukrainians the right to access aid for personal housing with family supplements, as well as benefits for family maintenance, it said in a statement. According to the ministry, more than 57,000 Ukrainians have entered France since Russia invaded their country on 24 February, largely women and children, and more than 41,000 have been granted \u201ctemporary protection\u201d. It said that over 11,000 Ukrainian children have so far enrolled in French schools, and that families could place younger children in day-care centres free of charge. Over 4.7 million people have fled Ukraine overall since the start of the war, according to the United Nations refugee agency, with more than half crossing into Poland. Five people have been killed by shelling in the Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, with cluster munitions used, the local governor Vitaliy Kim has said. The Reuters news agency has said it could not independently verify the statement. Despite many civilians deaths in Ukraine, Russia has denied deliberately targeting non-combatants. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, recently made a direct appeal to his US counterpart, Joe Biden, for Washington to designate Russia a \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism\u201d, it is reported. Citing people familiar with the two leaders\u2019 conversation, the Washington Post says Biden did not commit to specific actions during the call. The label can be applied to any country that has \u201crepeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism,\u201d the newspaper says, citing a US Department of State factsheet. The list currently includes four countries: North Korea, Cuba, Iran and Syria. More than 900 civilian bodies have been discovered in the region surrounding Kyiv following the withdrawal of Russian forces \u2014 almost all of them shot dead, the Associated Press quotes local police as saying. The number is double that announced by Ukrainian authorities almost two weeks ago and the presence of the gunshot wounds indicates many were \u201csimply executed\u201d, officers said. Andriy Nebytov, the head of Kyiv\u2019s regional police force, said the bodies were abandoned in the streets or given temporary burials. He cited police data indicating that 95% died from gunshot wounds, AP reports. Consequently, we understand that under the [Russian] occupation, people were simply executed in the streets. More bodies are being found every day, under rubble and in mass graves, he added. The largest number of victims were found in Bucha; where there were more than 350. According to Nebytov, utilities workers in Bucha gathered and buried bodies in the Kyiv suburb while it remained under Russian control. Russian troops, he added, were \u201ctracking down\u201d people who expressed strong pro-Ukraine views. France will make housing and family benefits available for Ukrainian refugees once the emergency lodging phase is over, Reuters quotes the country\u2019s interior ministry as saying. Paris will give displaced Ukrainians the right to access aid for personal housing with family supplements, as well as benefits for family maintenance. According to the ministry, more than 57,000 Ukrainians have entered France since Russia invaded their country on 24 February, largely women and children, and more than 41,000 have been granted \u201ctemporary protection\u201d. It said that more than 11,000 Ukrainian children have so far enrolled in French schools, and that families could place younger children in daycare centres free of charge. More than 4.7 million people have fled Ukraine overall since the start of the war, according to the United Nations refugee agency, with more than half crossing into Poland. The United States believes the sunken Russian missile cruiser Moskva was hit by two Ukrainian missiles, Reuters reports, citing a senior US official. The official, who Reuters says spoke on condition of anonymity, said these were Neptune anti-ship missiles. The US believes there were Russian casualties, though numbers are unclear, the official told the news agency. Citing Moscow\u2019s defence ministry, Russian news outlets have said the missile cruiser sank in stormy seas after a fire and explosions involving ammunition stowed onboard. Ukraine has said it launched a missile strike on the Moskva from the coast, which ripped open the Soviet-era ship. Reuters says it has been unable to verify either side\u2019s assertions. Back to that news that Russia has expelled 18 EU diplomats, Moscow\u2019s foreign ministry has said it summoned the EU ambassador Markus Ederer and handed him a note of protest. It said: The Russian side declared that the EU is responsible for the consistent destruction of the architecture of bilateral dialogue and cooperation that had taken decades to form. The EU diplomats must leave Russia as soon as possible, Reuters quotes the ministry as saying. The EU mission has said it regrets what it calls an unfounded move. The decision of the Russian authorities announced on Friday has no grounds and is nothing else than a retaliatory step. Russia\u2019s chosen course of action will further increase its international isolation. The world should be prepared for the possibility Putin will use nuclear weapons, Ukraine\u2019s president has warned. Speaking to CNN, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Putin would be capable of deploying nuclear weapons because he does not value human life. Asked if he was worried, following warnings from the CIA, Zelenskiy said: Not only me, I think all of the world, all the countries have to be worried, because you know that it can be not real information but it can be the truth. They could do it \u2026 they can ... for them, lives of the people are nothing. Ukraine has evacuated 2,864 people from conflict areas on Friday, its deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said. Reuters reports that the total includes 363 people who used their own modes of transport to escape from Mariupol. She said on Telegram that the evacuees also included 370 people from Luhansk region in the east and 2,131 people from cities in Zaporizhzhia region. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry has ordered 18 European Union diplomats to leave the country, Reuters reports. The news agency says the retaliatory move comes after the EU declared 19 Russian diplomats personae non gratae for \u201cengaging in activities contrary to their diplomatic status\u201d and ordered them to leave their host nation, Belgium. We\u2019ve been reporting today that Russia\u2019s Moskva warship sunk while being towed to a port after an explosion. Now, Ukraine claims Moskva\u2019s captain was also killed in that explosion. In a statement on Telegram, Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s ministry of internal affairs, said: 1st rank captain, cruiser Moskva flagship commander of the Black sea Fleet, Anton Kuprin died during the explosion and fire on board.\u201d While Ukraine said its military successfully struck the flagship missile on Wednesday, Russia\u2019s defence ministry said a fire onboard and \u201cstormy sea conditions\u201d were to blame. Motuzyanyk has added that street battles are continuing in Mariupol, which Russian forces have still not managed to completely capture. He said active fighting is taking place around Mariupol\u2019s Illich steel and ironworks, as well as in the port area. Russia has used long-range bombers to attack the besieged port city of Mariupol for the first time since the invasion, Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk has said. Reuters quotes him as saying Russia is concentrating its efforts on seizing the cities of Rubizhne, Popasna and Mariupol. Earlier, we reported that an iron and steelworks plant in Mariupol has become the city\u2019s redoubt. Now, Reuters is reporting that Ukraine\u2019s leading steelmaker and controller of the plant, Metinvest, has said it will never operate its enterprises under Russian occupation. The group told the news agency it has already halved its iron ore production due to the Russian invasion. Ukraine is one of Europe\u2019s largest suppliers of iron ore, and has already lost access to up to 40% of its metallurgy production capacity in Mariupol. It\u2019s approaching 4pm in Ukraine. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: Outgunned, outnumbered and surrounded by Russian forces, one of Europe\u2019s biggest metallurgical plants has become Mariupol\u2019s redoubt. The factory is \u201can enormous space\u201d in which the Russians \u201csimply can\u2019t find\u201d Ukrainian forces, Oleh Zhdanov \u2013 a military analyst based in Kyiv \u2013 told Reuters. The family of a British man allegedly captured by Russian forces while fighting in Ukraine have described footage of him in captivity as \u201cpropaganda\u201d. Images on Russian television appeared to show Aiden Aslin, 28, originally from Nottinghamshire, being led around in handcuffs with a cut on his forehead. Sweden and Finland are deliberating Nato membership. Tytti Tuppurainen, Finland\u2019s minister for European affairs, said: \u201cThe people of Finland seem to have already made up their mind\u201d. She added the decision is \u201chighly likely\u201d but \u201cnot made yet\u201d pending discussions in parliament. The Moskva, a Russian flagship cruiser, has sunk after a Ukrainian missile strike. The ship had been leading a substantial Russian naval presence in the Black Sea, and is a significant naval loss that experts say is emblematic of the \u201cshambolic Russian military campaign\u201d. Nine humanitarian corridors have been agreed for Friday. Those wanting to evacuate the cities of Mariupol, Berdyansk, Tokmak and Energodar to Zaporozhye are able to do by car, Ukraine\u2019s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, announced this morning on the Telegram messaging app. Russia has warned missile strikes on Kyiv \u2018will increase\u2019, reports state-owned RIA news. It\u2019s the latest line coming out of the Russian defence ministry, after powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv overnight. The Russians claim they have hit 13 military facilities in different areas and system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter near Chernigov. In besieged Mariupol \u2013 where Ukrainian forces are outgunned, outnumbered and surrounded by Russian forces \u2013 one of Europe\u2019s biggest metallurgical plants has become the eastern city\u2019s redoubt. The Azovstal iron and steelworks lies in an industrial area covering more than 11 sq km (4.25 sq miles). It is held by the country\u2019s leading metallurgical group, Metinvest, and controlled by Ukraine\u2019s richest man; the billionaire Rinat Akhmetov. The factory is \u201can enormous space\u201d in which the Russians \u201csimply can\u2019t find\u201d Ukrainian forces, Oleh Zhdanov \u2013 a military analyst based in Kyiv \u2013 told Reuters. That\u2019s why they [the Russians] started talking about trying a chemical attack, that\u2019s the only way to smoke them out. Ukraine has said it is checking unverified information that Russia may have used chemical weapons in Mariupol. Russia-backed separatists have denied using them. Here\u2019s the full story: British diplomats have been scrambling to work out what has happened to Aiden Aslin after it was claimed the UK national was captured by pro-Russian forces. Images purporting to show him in captivity emerged, which his family is calling \u201cpropaganda\u201d. PA Media reports that Aslin, who is from Newark in Nottinghamshire, has been fighting in the besieged city of Mariupol. Earlier this week, he and his unit were forced to surrender after they ran out of food and ammunition. His grandmother Pamela Hall has told PA Media: It\u2019s propaganda. He was due to get married this month, and they were talking about setting up a new home together, children \u2014 great-grandchildren in my case. Here\u2019s some more details from my colleague Josh Halliday: Kyiv was hit on Friday by some of the most powerful explosions heard since Russian forces withdrew from the area two weeks ago. Amid a warning that missile attacks would increase due to allegations of attacks and sabotage by Ukrainian forces within Russia\u2019s borders, Moscow said it had struck a plant in the capital that made and repaired Ukrainian missiles, including anti-ship missiles. The move follows the sinking of the Russian Black Sea flagship Moskva. Kirill Kyrylo, 38, a worker at a car repair shop in Kyiv, told Reuters he had seen three blasts hit an industrial building across the street, causing a blaze that was later put out by firefighters. \u201cThe building was on fire and I had to hide behind my car,\u201d he said, pointing out shattered glass and bits of metal that had been flung from the burning building across the street. Ukraine said it had repelled Russian offensives in the town of Popasna and Rubizhne, north of Mariupol. The reports could not be independently confirmed. Here is a selection of some of the latest images that have been sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine and beyond. Gaby Hinsliff writes for us today on the sexual exploitation of women in war zones, saying it will continue until commanders actually end up in the dock for overseeing such atrocities: They read like messages from one of the creepier dating apps, or else the sort of unwanted lechery with which many young women on social media are grimly familiar. One man suggests sharing \u201ca large bed, we could sleep together\u201d and then letting \u201cwhat we both want happen\u201d. Another is keen to let the recipient know she is \u201cso beautiful\u201d, while a third immediately asks, \u201cAre you single?\u201d But these aren\u2019t just any old clumsy sexual overtures. These are messages left for women fleeing war-torn Ukraine, on a Facebook group seeking to match refugees with Britons offering sanctuary. The grotesque parody of shelter some men see fit to offer is a chance to flee the threat of rape by Russian soldiers, but only for somewhere you might want to barricade yourself into the spare bedroom at night. An undercover reporter posing as a refugee found more than half the messages sent to her came from men living alone, some explicit about the strings attached to their offers. What kind of man, you may wonder, sees in a tragedy a sexual opportunity? Read more here: Gaby Hinsliff \u2013 Rape is being used as a weapon in Ukraine. It should be treated as a war crime Tytti Tuppurainen is Finland\u2019s minister for European affairs, and she has been interviewed on Sky News in the UK about Finland\u2019s prospect for joining Nato. Speaking from Helsinki, she said there was now a profound change in the relations between Russia and Finland, which saddens her. She told viewers: The people of Finland seem to have already made up their mind and there is a huge majority for Nato membership of Finland. Of course, that\u2019s not all. We are a parliamentary democracy so we need to discuss this issue in our parliament. At this point I would say it is highly likely, but a decision is not yet made. She described Russia\u2019s actions as a \u201cbrutal\u201d war in Ukraine and \u201ca wake-up call to us all\u201d. With regard to the hostile rhetoric coming out of Russia at the prospect of Finland and possibly Sweden joining Nato, she said: Every country has the right to do its own security arrangements. So we have to be very, very careful in order not to limit our own room of manoeuvre because of outside factors. So, whatever Russia is saying, we of course are hearing that, but we are doing our own decisions based on our interests, and on our conditions, our consideration of the overall situation. Questioned on how quickly Finland could achieve Nato membership, she said \u201cthe interim period between the membership application and becoming an actual member can become really nasty. So I think it\u2019s in the best interest of us all that the application process is as quick as possible.\u201d On the prospect of future Russian expansion westwards, she said: We\u2019ve seen what Russia is able to do, what Vladimir Putin is able to do. He\u2019s a ruthless dictator, and he wants to peal back the years of the former Soviet Russia, and we cannot allow that to happen. So we have to do what we need to do, as western countries, as defenders of liberal values and liberal democracy, and we have to act united, and we have to isolate Russia. Our Emma Graham-Harrison points out that the Ukrainian defence minister is trolling Russia over the sinking of its flagship Moskva \u2014 boasting of his plans for a scuba diving trip to its wreckage. Oleksii Reznikov tweeted: A \u201cflagship\u201d Russian warship is a worthy diving site. We have one more diving spot in the Black Sea now. Will definitely visit the wreck after our victory in the war. BTW, I already have 300 scuba dives. There have been some new lines coming out of the Russian defence ministry which are being reported by the state-owned RIA news agency, after powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv overnight. The ministry has said it will respond to the actions of Ukrainian forces within Russian territory with an increase in attacks on Kyiv. A spokesperson said: The number and scale of missile strikes against targets in Kyiv will increase in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any attacks of a terrorist nature or sabotage on Russian territory. The Russians claim they have hit 13 military facilities in different areas overnight, and that Russia\u2019s S-400 air defence system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter near Chernigov. According to Russia\u2019s military, it was a helicopter which carried out an attack yesterday on the village of Klimovo, in Russia\u2019s Bryansk region. The ministry of defence spokesperson Igor Konashenkov also said that \u201ca group of Russian troops and units of the People\u2019s Militia of the Donetsk Republic completely liberated the Illich Iron and Steel Works from Ukrainian nationalists\u201d. RIA reports that most of Mariupol has already been brought under control, but clashes continue mainly in the area of the Azovstal plant, where a significant part of the Azov nationalist regiment is continuing to show resistance. The news agency is also reporting that at least two anti-missiles were fired at air targets over the city of Belgorod on Friday morning. The Russian city is to the north-east of Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region. There has been no official confirmation of the action, which RIA says was witnessed by its correspondent in the region. The Guardian has not independently verified any of the claims from the Russian defence ministry or the RIA news agency. Spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Lucile Marbeau has been interviewed on Sky News in the UK. Speaking from Dnipro, she said: The concerns right now is for ICRC to be the close to the people next to the frontline. Currently we have teams in the east working 24 hours to be able to support those who remain in places where there\u2019s ongoing hostilities. So if you take the city of Donetsk, colleagues are going there on a daily basis in order to evacuate civilians there. Usually those who stay are the most vulnerable. We see it\u2019s elderly people, it\u2019s people who don\u2019t have any money, who don\u2019t know if they leave where to go. Of those who have fled, she said the ICRC is supporting them with basics like food, but also financial assistance. On the prospect of a further offensive by Russia in the east of Ukraine, she told viewers: This is a huge concern for us, because many civilians have already fled these areas. Those who remain behind are the most vulnerable. They need protection. And they, of course, are protected by international humanitarian law. But we need to be able also to assist them. There\u2019s war-wounded who need specific treatment, but when you\u2019re frontline the basics come to lack. There\u2019s going to be a lack of things as simple as aspirin, antibiotics, in order really to be able to treat not very serious infections. But when already people are weak because they\u2019ve been staying weeks in a shelter, they\u2019re elderly, they\u2019re not getting proper food, of course, these infections can become really serious. With regard to security issues faced by the ICRC itself, she said: Our duty is to stay and operate and be as close as possible to the civilians who need our support. Of course we need security guarantees for our staff, and the security guarantee for our staff is actually the security guarantee for the civilians we are assisting, whether we\u2019re bringing to them directly humanitarian aid, or whether we are facilitating safe passage. So this is our duty, this is our task, and of course we\u2019re going to stay as long as possible in order to be able to just basically save lives and help people. This is Martin Belam on the live blog in London now for the next few hours. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Here is where the situation currently stands: Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has praised his people\u2019s bravery and resolve on the 50th day of war, calling Russia\u2019s invasion \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201csuicidal\u201d in his latest national address. \u201cWe have withstood 50 days already. Fifty days of Russian invasion, although the occupiers gave us a maximum of five,\u201d he said. The Russian flagship cruiser Moskva has sunk in the Black Sea off southern Ukraine, according to Russia\u2019s defence ministry. Ukraine claims it was was hit by Ukrainian weaponry \u2013 the Neptune cruise missile, which Ukraine builds itself. Russia maintains that a fire onboard and then \u201cstormy sea conditions\u201d while it was being towed to port were to blame. Russia only has three of this flagship-class of warship, which have crews of almost 500 sailors, and the loss of the Moskva is a big blow. The former CIA director David Petraeus described Russia\u2019s admission as a \u201crare moment of truth \u2026 I\u2019m surprised that they admitted it,\u201d he told the BBC. Moskva served a \u201ckey role as command vessel and air defence node\u201d, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence said. Vladimir Putin may resort to using a tactical or low-yield nuclear weapon in light of military setbacks in the invasion of Ukraine, the CIA director, William Burns, has said. During a speech in Atlanta, Burns said: \u201cGiven the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership \u2026 none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons.\u201d The Kremlin placed Russian nuclear forces on high alert shortly after the invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February. A total of 6,673 alleged war crimes committed by Russian troops in Ukraine are under investigation, Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office has said. 198 children have been confirmed to have been killed, the office added. Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister Alexander Grushko said Moscow would take \u201csecurity and defence measures that we will deem necessary\u201d if Sweden and Finland join Nato. In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency Tass, the minister said the membership in the military alliance would \u201cseriously worsen the military situation\u201d and lead to \u201cthe most undesirable consequences\u201d. Finland and Sweden had earlier taken a major step towards joining Nato. Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry has appealed to the United Nations to facilitate the return of Ukrainian children who have been \u201cillegally deported\u201d to Russia. In a statement, the ministry said Russia had \u201cengaged in state-organised kidnapping of children and destruction of the future of the Ukrainian nation\u201d. France is planning to return its embassy to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. It had moved to the western city of Lviv in March as Russia invaded. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged allies to resume their normal diplomatic presence in Ukraine. Zelenskiy further urged European countries to give up Russian oil that provides \u201cblood\u201d money to Moscow, and appealed for more weapons to help Ukraine repel Russia\u2019s invasion. Nine humanitarian corridors have been agreed for Friday, Ukraine\u2019s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has announced. A total of 2,557 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Thursday, Vereshchuk confirmed, with 289 of those from Mariupol. The head of the UN World Food Programme, meanwhile, said people were being \u201cstarved to death\u201d in the besieged city. Armenia has begun making payments for Russian gas in roubles, minister of economy Vagan Kerobyan told RBC. \u201cWe need to move towards national currencies \u2026 As far as I know, the last few payments were in roubles, but at the appropriate rate,\u201d RIA cited Kerobyan as saying. A Russian legislator and two aides pushed a covert propaganda campaign aimed at winning US government support for Russia\u2019s foreign policy agenda, including moves against Ukraine, according to a Justice Department indictment seen by the Associated Press. French president Emmanuel Macron has pledged to deliver 24 fire trucks and ambulances as well as 50 tons of emergency equipment to Ukraine. For a more detailed summary, please see our previous update. Nine humanitarian corridors have been agreed for Friday, Ukraine\u2019s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has announced. Those wanting to evacuate the cities of Mariupol, Berdyansk, Tokmak and Energodar to Zaporozhye are able to do by car, she said in a post this morning on the Telegram messaging app. Humanitarian corridors in the Luhansk region will operate subject to the end of shelling by Russian forces, she added. The UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has responded to reports of the apparent attack on and sinking of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet\u2019s flagship. The report, released shortly after 6am GMT, reads: Russia has admitted that the Slava-class cruiser Moskva has sunk. As flagship of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, the Moskva served a key role as both a command vessel and air defence node. The Soviet-era vessel was one of only three Slava-class cruisers in the Russian navy. Originally commissioned in 1979, the Moskva had completed an extensive refit designed to improve its capability and only returned to operational status in 2021. This incident means Russia has now suffered damage to two key naval assets since invading Ukraine, the first being Russia\u2019s Alligator-class landing ship Saratov on 24 March. Both events will likely lead Russia to review its maritime posture in the Black Sea.\u201d Armenia has begun making payments for Russian gas in roubles, minister of economy Vagan Kerobyan told RBC. \u201cWe need to move towards national currencies \u2026 As far as I know, the last few payments were in roubles, but at the appropriate rate,\u201d RIA cited Kerobyan as saying. The minister clarified that the pricing would be in dollars, but payment would be made in roubles. In case you missed this assessment from CIA director William Burns, here is a quick re-cap. During a speech at Georgia Tech university in Atlanta on Thursday, Burns said Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin may resort to using a tactical or low-yield nuclear weapon in light of military setbacks in the invasion of Ukraine. Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they\u2019ve faced so far, militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons.\u201d The Kremlin said it placed Russian nuclear forces on high alert shortly after the assault began on 24 February, but the United States has not seen \u201ca lot of practical evidence\u201d of actual deployments that would cause more worry, Burns added. We\u2019re obviously very concerned. I know President Biden is deeply concerned about avoiding a third world war, about avoiding a threshold in which, you know, nuclear conflict becomes possible.\u201d Meanwhile, former CIA Director David Petraeus has described Russia\u2019s admission that its flagship has sunk as a \u201crare moment of truth\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m surprised that they admitted it,\u201d he told the BBC, adding that the facts would have \u201ccome out\u201d eventually. French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to deliver 24 fire trucks and ambulances as well as 50 tons of emergency equipment to Ukraine. \u201cTo support Ukraine, our firefighters and rescue workers are sending 24 fire trucks and ambulances as well as 50 tons of emergency equipment. This is the second convoy in a month,\u201d he said. More than 6,500 alleged war crimes committed by Russian troops in Ukraine are under investigation, Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office has said. A total of 6,673 cases have been reported and 198 children have been confirmed to have been killed, the office added. Here are just some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires today. Ukraine\u2019s President Zelenskiy has marked the 50th day of war, calling Russia\u2019s invasion \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201csuicidal\u201d in his latest national address. \u201cWe have withstood 50 days already. 50 days of Russian invasion, although the occupiers gave us a maximum of five,\u201d he began. I remember the first day of the invasion of the Russian Federation. I remember what I was told on February 24 ... To put it mildly, no one was sure that we would withstand it. Everyone sympathised. Many of them advised me to flee the country. Advised to actually surrender to tyranny. But they didn\u2019t know us either. And they did not know how brave Ukrainians are, how much we value freedom. Our opportunity to live the way we want. Not the people who rule in such a way that their army sees toilets for the first time in their lives in the occupied territories and steals even ordinary household appliances. Zelenskiy said Russian troops \u201care already repeating on our land what Europe saw only during World War II\u201d while criticising the west\u2019s severity of sanctions. \u201c50 days of our defence is an achievement. Achievement of millions of Ukrainians,\u201d he added. During the 50 days of this war, Ukraine became a hero for the whole free world. For those who have the courage to call a spade a spade. For those who are not poisoned by propaganda. You have all become heroes. All Ukrainian men and women who withstood and do not give up. And who will win. Who will return peace to Ukraine. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d The apparent attack on and sinking of the Black Sea fleet\u2019s flagship \u2013 50 days after Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine \u2013 represents a symbolic blow to the Kremlin. The Moskva was the pride of its fleet and the most prestigious vessel involved in the war against Ukraine. \u201cThe sinking of the Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, is not just a significant loss, it is emblematic of the shambolic Russian military campaign,\u201d said Michael Kofman, research programme director and Russia expert at the US government-funded Center for Naval Analyses. It has also dealt a blow to one of Russia\u2019s main campaign objectives. The Moskva had been leading a substantial Russian naval presence in the Black Sea, threatening Ukraine\u2019s southern coast and its key ports. This has been one of the main focuses of the Kremlin\u2019s military efforts, and is aimed at cutting off Ukraine\u2019s access to sea and creating a land bridge from the Crimean peninsula to the Russian border. Commissioned in 1983, it was armed with 16 anti-ship Vulkan cruise missiles with a range of at least 440 miles (700km). According to reports, it was also carrying S-300 anti-air missiles, which are crucial to Russia\u2019s air power over Crimea and Ukraine\u2019s Kherson province, now occupied by Russian troops. It is the most significant naval vessel to be sunk since the Argentinian cruiser General Belgrano was torpedoed by a British submarine, HMS Conqueror, in 1982. It is the first time Moscow has lost a cruiser since German planes sank the Chervona Ukraina (Red Ukraine) in 1941 at Sevastopol \u2013 the same Crimean naval base to which the Moskva was supposedly being towed when it sank. The Moskva gained notoriety early in the war when the crew demanded the surrender of Ukrainian forces on Snake Island, prompting a riposte by radio from one of the border guards on the island: \u201cRussian warship, go fuck yourself.\u201d The phrase instantly became synonymous with Ukrainian defiance, and is now a universal meme. The day before the Moskva was sunk, Zelenskiy unveiled a new postage stamp portraying the ship and the Ukrainian border guard with his middle finger raised. Russia\u2019s Black Sea flagship missile cruiser, the Moskva, sunk while being towed to a port after an explosion, the Russian defence ministry has claimed. It comes after Ukraine on Wednesday said its military struck the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles, while distracting its crew with an aerial drone, causing it to start sinking and forcing the crew of 500 to abandon ship. Russia\u2019s defence ministry initially denied reports that it had sunk and claimed the fires had been extinguished. It said four Russian ships that had gone to the Moskva\u2019s rescue were hampered by bad weather and by ammunition blowing up on board. Late on Thursday the ministry said in a statement: \u201cThe cruiser ship Moskva lost its stability when it was towed to the port because of the damage to the ship\u2019s hull that it received during the fire from the detonation of ammunition. In stormy sea conditions, the ship sank.\u201d The claim of bad weather being a factor in the sinking was questioned by observers. Mark Hertling, the former commanding general of the United States Army Europe, told CNN: \u201cAs they were towing that ship in, that very wounded ship, into Sevastopol, they claim a storm sank it. Looking at the weather report outside of Sevastopol today the winds were about four miles an hour with 40 degree [4C] temperatures and a little bit of rain.\u201d Hello and welcome back to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I\u2019m Samantha Lock and I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest developments before my colleague Martin Belam takes the reins a little later on. It is approaching 8am in Ukraine. Russia\u2019s prized warship the Moskva has sunk. Ukraine claims it was thanks to the success of a missile strike. Moscow claims a fire on board and \u201cstormy sea conditions\u201d were to blame. An interesting military briefing with Vladimir Putin is sure to ensue. Here is where the situation currently stands: Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has praised his people\u2019s bravery and resolve on the 50th day of war, calling Russia\u2019s invasion \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201csuicidal\u201d in his latest national address. \u201cWe have withstood 50 days already.

During a speech in Atlanta, Burns said: \u201cGiven the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership \u2026 none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons.\u201d The Kremlin placed Russian nuclear forces on high alert shortly after the invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February. Rainy weather in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas region could favour the Ukrainian military ahead of a planned Russian offensive, a senior Pentagon official has said. \u201cThe fact that the ground is softer will make it harder for them to do anything off of paved highways,\u201d the official, who spoke under condition of anonymity, told AFP. Russia has asked Brazil for support in the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the G20 group of top economies to help it counter crippling sanctions, according to a letter seen by Reuters. On 30 March the Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov wrote asking for Brazil\u2019s \u201csupport to prevent political accusations and discrimination attempts in international financial institutions and multilateral fora\u201d. A Brazilian economy minister spokesperson indicated that Brazil would like Russia to remain part of discussions at multilateral organisations. At least 503 civilians, including 24 children, have been killed in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Kharkiv region since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, the region\u2019s local governor has said. Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second city with a prewar population of about 1.5 million, is 40km (25 miles) from the Russian border. Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister Alexander Grushko said Moscow would take \u201csecurity and defence measures that we will deem necessary\u201d if Sweden and Finland join Nato. In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency Tass, the minister said the membership in the military alliance would \u201cseriously worsen the military situation\u201d and lead to \u201cthe most undesirable consequences\u201d.

France is planning to return its embassy to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. It had moved to the western city of Lviv in March as Russia invaded. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged allies to resume their normal diplomatic presence in Ukraine. Turkey is still working on organising a meeting between Putin and Zelenskiy, said the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the condition for a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents is a document ready for the two leaders to sign. The UK government has imposed sanctions on the Chelsea football club director Eugene Tenenbaum in an attempt to freeze up to \u00a310bn of assets linked to the club\u2019s Russian oligarch owner, Roman Abramovich. The UK said it was extending sanctions to Tenenbaum and David Davidovich, another close associate of Abramovich, because the oligarch had transferred billions of pounds of assets to the pair as Russia invaded Ukraine. Zelenskiy further urged European countries to give up Russian oil that provides \u201cblood\u201d money to Moscow, and appealed for more weapons to help Ukraine repel Russia\u2019s invasion. A total of 2,557 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Thursday, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, with 289 of those from Mariupol. The head of the UN World Food Program, meanwhile, said people were being \u201cstarved to death\u201d in the besieged city. Moody\u2019s Investors Service has said that Russia \u201cmay be considered in default\u201d if it fails to pay bonds in US dollars by 4 May. Russia paid two bonds in rubles this month after sanctions cut the country off from global financial systems and the US banned Moscow from making debt payments using dollars held in American banks. The payments in rubles \u201crepresent a change in payment terms\u201d and may be considered a default, according to Moody\u2019s. S&amp;P Global Ratings has also declared Russia in default. A Russian legislator and two aides pushed a covert propaganda campaign aimed at winning US government support for Russia\u2019s foreign policy agenda, including moves against Ukraine, according to a Justice Department indictment seen by the Associated Press."

            "date": "2022-04-07T18:33:18Z",
            "content": "Britain is preparing to announce a fresh package of military aid for Ukraine and has demonstrated new missile systems and armoured vehicles that it believes can help Kyiv in the next phases of fighting. Junior defence ministers Jeremy Quin and James Heappey invited Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister Volodymyr Havrylov to Salisbury Plain on Wednesday, where they discussed what extra weapons the UK could supply. \u201cIt was an honour to show Minister Havrylov and his generals the kit the UK hopes to provide next and to discuss some new weapons that have been trialled recently with UK forces,\u201d Heappey said. The army and Royal Marines demonstrated a range of equipment and \u201coptions for further military support\u201d, which, the Ministry of Defence said, included \u201cdefensive missile systems and protected mobility vehicles\u201d. The protected mobility vehicle is thought to refer to the Mastiff, a heavily armoured patrol vehicle, first deployed in Afghanistan, which would help Ukraine\u2019s forces achieve greater manoeuvrability against Russian attacks in the eastern Donbas. It is less certain what artillery could be provided, although there has been speculation that the UK could offer the AS-90 howitzer, which has a range of nearly 15 miles and would help Ukraine\u2019s forces contend with Russian shelling. Either would be a modest step up from the 4,200-plus NLAW anti-tank bazookas and the Starstreak anti-aircraft systems the UK has already sent to Ukraine, described by the UK as \u201cdefensive weaponry\u201d designed to prevent the Russians from swiftly conquering the country. One source said that Downing Street was likely to make an announcement on the next steps for military aid before the end of the week. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, met Poland\u2019s president, Andrzej Duda, on Thursday afternoon, where the issue was discussed. \u201cBoth leaders agreed that the west needed to accelerate its support to Ukraine in the coming days and go further and faster with the equipment it was supplying,\u201d said Downing Street after the meeting. Western countries have begun pledging a fresh wave of military aid after Russia\u2019s initial attack on Kyiv was repulsed, recognising that the conflict had moved to a new phase in which Ukraine is trying to prevent Moscow\u2019s forces advancing in the east and holding on to gains made in the south of the country. A donor conference convened by the UK and attended by more than 35 countries last week hammered out what each state was willing to supply. At the time, Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, said that the best counter to Russia\u2019s artillery was \u201cother long-range artillery\u201d. Some countries have already announced their plans. The US has committed $400m (\u00a3300m) of aid in the past week, including the APKWS rockets that can be used from air and land, and 10 Switchblade 600 drones that employ the same missiles used by the Javelin anti-tank weapon. The Czech Republic has committed tens of T-72 Soviet-designed tanks \u2013 the first time a Nato country has agreed to such send heavy armour to Ukraine. But it is still only a modest contribution to Kyiv\u2019s war effort."

            "date": "2022-04-03T09:00:16Z",
            "content": "When Joe Biden released his annual budget proposal last week, one number in particular jumped out to progressives: $813bn. That is how much Biden is calling to spend on national defense in the US in the coming fiscal year. If approved, that number would represent the largest defense budget that America has ever seen. US presidents\u2019 budget proposals are generally considered to be reflections of their policy priorities rather than realistic estimates of final spending allocations. If Biden\u2019s call for a 4% increase in defense spending was meant to signal his policy priorities, progressives wasted no time in telling the president that his priorities are backwards. Progressive lawmakers have fiercely criticized the proposed defense budget, arguing that the US already spends far too much on its military and needs to invest more in domestic programs. But the war in Ukraine has complicated progressives\u2019 arguments and given Republicans an opening to demand even more money for the military. Just hours after the White House announced its budget proposal on Monday, leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus released a statement attacking Biden\u2019s plan to increase defense spending and opening up a familiar split in the party. \u201cIt is simply unacceptable that after the conclusion of our longest war and during a period of Democratic control of both chambers of Congress, the president is proposing record high military spending,\u201d said the CPC chair, Pramila Jayapal, and former chairs Mark Pocan and Barbara Lee. \u201cAppropriators and advocates are constantly called to answer for how we will afford spending on lowering costs and expanding access to healthcare, housing, childcare services, on fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, and on combating climate change \u2013 but such concerns evaporate when it comes to the Pentagon\u2019s endlessly growing, unaudited budget.\u201d Bernie Sanders, who chairs the Senate budget committee, echoed the CPC\u2019s concerns, saying on Monday, \u201cAt a time when we are already spending more on the military than the next 11 countries combined, no we do not need a massive increase in the defense budget.\u201d So far, the White House has stood by its request, insisting the increased funding will allow the US to better defend its international interests and assist Ukraine\u2019s battle against Russia\u2019s military assault. \u201cAs I have said many times, we need resources matched to strategy, strategy matched to policy and policy matched to the will of the American people,\u201d the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said. \u201cThis budget gives us the resources we need to deliver on that promise.\u201d And even as progressives urge Biden to curb funding for the military, the president is simultaneously facing criticism from the right for not proposing an even higher defense spending hike in response to the war in Ukraine. \u201cThe world is a dangerous place and growing more dangerous by the day,\u201d the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, said on Monday. \u201cAmid all this, the White House has proposed no meaningful increase in resources for protecting innocent Americans, promoting our interests, supporting our partners, assisting Ukraine, or replenishing our stockpiles.\u201d Progressives have pushed for years to lower US defense spending, but the devastation in Ukraine has added a new challenge to their efforts. Polling indicates that a majority of Americans believe Biden has not been tough enough in his response to Russia\u2019s aggression, which has added fuel to Republicans\u2019 demands for more military funding. But progressives are not abandoning their campaign, instead arguing that the Russian invasion of Ukraine demonstrates how US military dollars would be better spent elsewhere. \u201cI think it\u2019s a political challenge, but it\u2019s not an actual budgetary challenge. This increase in money is not about Ukraine. This is about spending more on the US military-industrial complex,\u201d said Robert Weissman, president of the progressive group Public Citizen. \u201cThe United States already spends more than 10 times what Russia does on its military. And that expenditure, obviously, didn\u2019t deter Russia from invading Ukraine.\u201d Even as Republicans point to the war in Ukraine to advocate for more defense spending, it is worth remembering that most of Biden\u2019s budget proposal was crafted before the Russian invasion. Dr Travis Sharp, budget studies director at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said the requested funding increase is more a reflection of how record-high US inflation has affected government agencies\u2019 finances rather than the impact of the crisis in Ukraine. \u201cProviding a higher level of defense spending does help to correct for some of the decreasing buying power as a result of inflation,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t provide a higher level of defense spending, then you would be trying to support the same-sized military with less money, so that would force you to make some hard trade-offs.\u201d However, progressives reject inflation-based arguments for increasing the Pentagon\u2019s budget, saying the Pentagon has consistently failed to account for how it spends its funds and should not be trusted with even more money. \u201cAn agency that can\u2019t pass an audit needs to do a little bit more homework before we can be honest about what the impacts of inflation are,\u201d said Stephen Miles, president of the progressive group Win Without War. He added, \u201cRepublicans don\u2019t seem particularly concerned about the impacts of inflation on any other part of the budget, besides the military.\u201d As the number of US coronavirus deaths nears 1 million and the world faces the grim realities of climate change, it was \u201cunconscionable\u201d to demand more funding for the military, Miles said. \u201cThe threats we face in the 21st century are primarily not going to be solved by spending more money at the Pentagon,\u201d he told the Guardian. For Sharp, the Pentagon\u2019s significant budget is a reflection of America\u2019s military commitments around the world and its strategy to maintain strong alliances with key foreign partners. He suggested that, in order for progressives to be successful in their push to lower defense spending, they need to make a pitch for a new kind of American foreign policy. \u201cIf you really want to reduce the size of US defense spending, then you need to go after the strategy,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cIf you pare back the strategy, reduce the operational tempo, then the dollars will decline proportionately.\u201d"

            "title": "Seed banks: the last line of defense against a threatening global food crisis ",
            "date": "2022-04-15T10:00:29Z",
            "content": "As the risks from the climate crisis and global conflict increase, seed banks are increasingly considered a priceless resource that could one day prevent a worldwide food crisis. Two in five of the world\u2019s plant species are at risk of extinction, and though researchers estimate there are at least 200,000 edible plant species on our planet, we depend on just three \u2013 maize, rice and wheat\u2013 for more than half of humanity\u2019s caloric intake. There are roughly 1,700 seed banks, or gene banks, around the world housing collections of plant species that are invaluable for scientific research, education, species preservation and safeguarding Indigenous cultures. \u201cAt a first glance, seeds may not look like much, but within them lies the foundation of our future food and nutrition security, and the possibility for a world without hunger,\u201d said Stefan Schmitz, executive director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust, an organization dedicated to preserving crop diversity for food security. \u201cWell-funded, well-maintained seed banks are critical to reducing the negative impact of the climate crisis on our agriculture globally.\u201d We take a look at some of the world\u2019s most important seed banks, whose goal isto safeguard biodiversity as it rapidly diminishes. The doomsday vault Svalbard Global Seed Vault, Norway The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, dubbed the \u201cdoomsday vault\u201d or the \u201cNoah\u2019s ark of seeds\u201d, aims to contain a duplicate of every seed housed in other banks across the globe. Its location is deliberately remote, sited in the Svalbard archipelago, halfway between mainland Norway and the north pole. The hope is that the permafrost and dense rock into which the vault has been sunk will ensure that seed samples remain frozen \u2013 although it was breached in 2017 by meltwater after high temperatures in the region. Svalbard can store up to 4.5m varieties of crops and 2.5bn seeds . It houses more than 1.14m seed samples of about 6,000 different plant species. Though it serves the global community, the seed vault is owned by the Norwegian government and managed with support from the Global Crop Diversity Trust, an organization dedicated to preserving crop diversity for food security. \u201cCollections of depositing gene banks destroyed by conflict or natural disasters such as fire, earthquakes or flooding can be restored by retrieving copies of those seeds from Svalbard,\u201d Schmitz said. \u201cThere is no question that without such a facility we would be risking the security of our future food supply.\u201d The seed bank that escaped Syria\u2019s war ICARDA, Beirut, Lebanon Originally headquartered in Aleppo, the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) gene bank became a casualty of the Syrian war and was forced to close in 2012. It is the only institution to ever make a withdrawal from Svalbard which it used to rebuild its collection, now split between Lebanon and Morocco. \u201cFor us it was invaluable,\u201d said Hassan Machlab, country manager for Lebanon, Jordan &amp; Palestine at ICARDA. \u201cYou cannot put a price on this collection.\u201d Machlab describes the organization\u2019s seed bank as a \u201csea of genetic material\u201d used to help improve crops globally, producing new varieties with bigger yields and better disease resistance. The Lebanese operation is predominantly dedicated to conserving the wild relatives of cereals and legumes. \u201cWild relatives have adapted to such long periods of different climatic conditions, and they have very interesting genes that we are always trying to explore,\u201d he said. \u201c[These] genes could be useful to improve food production by increasing yield, adapting to climate change, or water scarcity.\u201d In February, ICARDA deposited 8,000 samples at Svalbard seed bank. The most biodiverse place on the planet Millennium Seed Bank, Sussex, UK Launched in 2000, and located in rural Sussex, England, the Millennium Seed Bank is considered to be the most diverse wild plant genetic resource in the world. In flood-, bomb- and radiation-proof vaults, it houses a collection of more than 2.4bn seeds belonging to about 40,000 species. The Millennium Seed Bank contains seeds from almost all of the UK\u2019s native plant species plus collections originating from 189 countries and territories, and it stores nearly 16% of the world\u2019s wild plant species. Between 2011 and 2021, it collaborated with the Norwegian government and the Crop Trust on the \u201ccrop wild relatives project\u201d, an initiative aimed at conserving and using the wild relatives of priority crops, such as bananas, beans, peas, carrots and apples, to help ensure the world\u2019s future food supplies. During the project, more than 100 scientists collected roughly 4,500 seed samples \u201cfrom the world\u2019s biodiversity \u2018hotspots\u2019 \u2013 diversity that might otherwise have been lost forever\u201d, according to the Crop Trust. The world\u2019s first seed bank Vavilov Institute, St Petersburg, Russia Located in St Petersburg, Russia, and considered one of the oldest seed banks in the world, the Vavilov Research Institute of Plant Industry was established more than 100 years ago by the Russian botanist Nikolai Vavilov, a pioneer in crop diversity conservation. The institute nearly disappeared during the siege of Leningrad in the early 1940s but was saved by a group of scientists who guarded the species they had been collecting for more than 15 years at that point. By the end of the siege, nine of them had died of starvation rather than eating \u2013 and destroying \u2013 the collection of crops they were safeguarding. Vavilov himself also died of starvation in prison in 1943. Today, the Vavilov Institute houses more than 325,000 seed samples, including seeds of crops that might otherwise have been permanently lost, such as Ethiopian wheat which was almost destroyed during civil wars in the 1970s. The world\u2019s largest seed bank National Laboratory for Genetic Resources Preservation, Fort Collins, Colorado The National Laboratory for Genetic Resources Preservation in Fort Collins is operated by the US Department of Agriculture and serves as a backup to genetic plant material within the US. With a capacity to store 1.5m samples, 50% of which can be kept in cryogenic tanks, it currently houses more than 500,000 samples of genetic material from close to 12,000 plant species. Seeds at the Fort Collins-based bank are often distributed to scientists for research and education and have also been used to prevent and treat disease resistance. In the 1980s, seeds from this bank helped overcome a Russian wheat aphid pest in Texas, when a couple of samples were found to be resistant to the aphid and were bred into affected wheat plants to control the infestation. The seed bank preserving an indigenous culture The Potato Park, Pisac, Peru The Potato Park, located in Pisac, Peru, a rural village nestled in the Sacred Valley of the Incas, is a unique seed bank. Managed by local Indigenous communities the park conservesa wide array of Andean crops including maize and quinoa but it has a special focus on potatoes, housing around 2,300 of the 4,000 varieties of potatoes known in the world, and 23 of the more than 200 wild species of potatoes currently known to humanity. Archeologists believe the potato was first domesticated around 8,000 years ago, near the bank of Lake Titicaca, which borders Bolivia and Peru. Aside from being an essential project to conserve the genetic material of valuable crops, the Potato Park is a critical territory to preserve the Indigenous heritage of the six communities and more than 6,000 people who call this park home. This article is part of a series about the diversity crisis in our food, with more coverage coming in the next few days and weeks"

            "title": "Malcolm Nance, TV pundit turned fighter in Ukraine: \u2018I believe in the defense of democracy\u2019",
            "date": "2022-04-29T10:00:38Z",
            "content": "Malcolm Nance, MSNBC\u2019S former military and counter-terrorism expert, is always fighting someone. As a personal and professional acquaintance of Nance, I wasn\u2019t the least bit surprised when the literary agent to whom I had introduced him a few months ago, interrogated me about whether I knew that Nance had joined the International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine in March. \u201cI had no idea,\u201d I replied, extremely unshocked. \u201cBut it sounds exactly like something Nance would do. It\u2019s the most Malcolm thing ever.\u201d Whether jousting with his conservative critics on social media or battling the trend toward authoritarianism that has invaded American politics, Nance has spent most of his life defending the values he endorses. He participated in US combat operations, taught Survival, Evasion, Resistance (Sere) and created advanced programs for the US military. His 20 years of experience in intelligence, counter-terrorism and cryptology as a chief petty officer in the United States navy made him one of the most sought-after intelligence experts in the media. Although his books Defeating Isis and The Plot to Hack America presaged Putin\u2019s invasion of American elections and Ukraine, Nance is not a war correspondent or a pundit. When I interviewed him about his recent decision to take up arms in Ukraine, the telephone conversation was typical of our many conversations. First, let me ask you, as a journalist, not as a friend: what the hell, Malcolm? Well, what made me decide to do this was a couple of things. But the precipitating event of course, was the invasion of Ukraine. I spent a month in Ukraine, driving around, mapping out the Russian order of battle, driving up and down the highways and analyzing where the invasion routes would come and go. So I knew the country backward and forwards by the time of the invasion. In fact, on the day of the invasion, just by happenstance, I got on the last Lufthansa flight out of the country. A couple of hours later they had leveled the airport. Plus, I\u2019m a widower, which means I understand grief, which is a powerful motivator in this instance. It was the thought of all of the grief this country was taking in that invasion. And I just thought, this is, this was completely uncalled for, this is insanity. To think that I could go to bed and wake up, and these women would just be massive piles of dead bodies and body armor, it just upset me. So how did you make this happen? Did you just show up with a gun and say: \u201cI\u2019m here to help?\u201d [Laughing] Ukraine announced that there was an international force on February 27 and I started looking into it on February 28 \u2026 I called the Ukrainian embassy in Washington and I said: \u2018Hey, I want an appointment.\u2019 They were a little slow, so I just went down there and put in my application. The guy asked if I had combat experience and I said \u2018Yep.\u2019 Then he looked at my application and said, \u2018You\u2019re on the team.\u2019 How long has it been since you were in a combat zone? When was the last thing I did, when did I go to Iraq? I moved back to the States in 2016. So 2015, so seven years. When you guys go: \u2018Oh yeah. That\u2019s what Malcolm would do,\u2019 you have to understand that Malcolm maintains his weapons proficiency all the time. I\u2019m a collector of firearms and, because I was an intelligence contractor, I just have it in my mind to maintain my proficiency. I\u2019m that kind of guy. Despite the fact that Russian television put my name, face and everything I say on television (except the part about mass murdering civilians) and called me a \u201csoldier of fortune\u201d, this ain\u2019t about money. We get paid $600 a month. But I believe in the defense of democracy. Even though my rightwing critics don\u2019t believe me or the lies they tell, I actually believe in the things that I espouse on television. One of the criticisms leveled against you is that you are willing to fight for an army that has been accused of mistreating people of African descent and serving an international training ground for white supremacists. The Ukrainian army is 250,000 people who are mostly white and mostly male. You know where I can actually show you more Nazis? Aside from the US army, that is? Russia\u2019s Wagner Group is filled with Nazis. The leader of their group of mercenaries has all sorts of Nazi tattoos all over his body. Look, this is a country of 42 million Caucasians, so, statistically, the US probably has a bigger Nazi contingent. I traveled around this country with Terrell Starr and the Afro-Ukrainian community here and I\u2019ve seen fewer Nazis than I\u2019ve seen in America. Quick aside on that, I always mention that Eugene Bullard was the first Black pilot to fly in the first world war. But he flew with the Lafayette Flying Corps for France because, as an African American, he wasn\u2019t allowed to fly in his country. In the end, 269 Americans flew in that squadron. He was the only Black pilot. From 1914 to 1917, he was a French legionnaire fighting in Verdun and was wounded three times. So there is a tradition of African Americans fighting in defense of democracy. I\u2019m sure we could find some in the Spanish civil war, but Hemingway didn\u2019t write about that. African Americans have always fought for the freedom of others, even when they didn\u2019t have it themselves. But I know there is a lot of criticism. And to be honest, what upsets them the most is that I\u2019m Black. It\u2019s not about how we view the rest of the world. It\u2019s about how we view ourselves in that world \u2013 as free people. And that\u2019s what upsets them the most. People have a problem with believing African Americans have ideals and that we stand for what we believe. When you compare the percentage of African Americans in the country to the percentage in the armed forces, we fight disproportionately for the country. So when you wake up in the morning, what happens? Well, it depends on where I am and what I\u2019m doing. I get up at 4am because I like to be up early. There\u2019s a routine depending on where you are. I get up at four and what I do is I read, I read the news. I try to feel the battlefront based on Ukrainian news and reporting. And then I look at expert analysis from the previous night in the west. If we have PT, we do PT [physical training]. No matter where I am, no matter what I\u2019m doing, I constantly check my gear. If I\u2019m in a safe house on a press junket, like I am now, I go over all of my gear. I reorganize my pack. I assume that I will have to take everything, get up and run with it or move to a forward location. Right now, part of my duty is to the press. They were well aware that I was a high-level asset. So, instead of putting me out on the line, I\u2019m in a safe house talking to people like you. For people who are totally ignorant of how the military works, is this legion part of the Ukrainian army of people who are not Ukrainian citizens? Or is it a legion organized outside of the Ukrainian military? What happened here early on is when Zelenskiy made this call, they started forming TDUs \u2013 territorial defense units. TDUs were really just men in your neighborhood who, under the state of emergency, had to enlist and register as part of a territory. It\u2019s like every neighborhood in Chicago organizing a military unit in expectation of an invasion. The difference is, the International Legion for the Territorial Defense of Ukraine is a branch of the Ukrainian army. We are an organized combat element with contracts signed by the Ukrainian army. We are paid by the Ukrainian army and get a Geneva convention ID card. So if a brigade has five battalions and they are on the line and they need more enforcement, they will get a legion unit to give them more manpower. But the legion operates almost exclusively in English, although there\u2019s a French squad that generally operates in French, and some Japanese and Koreans also. What do you think your ultimate value is here? My ultimate value is that I have experience at this. Now, look, I\u2019m not an infantry guy. But despite what critics on Twitter who watch Rambo may think, combat isn\u2019t about being a murdering, Seal Team Six assassin; it\u2019s mainly about precision, accurate fire, selective fire, keeping people calm, getting on the line and moving forward. For almost 15 of my 20 years, my middle name was, \u2018I need a Black guy who speaks Arabic\u2019. When I was at NSA, I was being loaned out everywhere, so I\u2019ve seen a lot and conducted missions behind or near enemy lines. If I was a white guy, I would be a hero. But with some people, it\u2019s just as simple as: \u2018You are Black; you can\u2019t have done anything exceptional in your life, nothing.\u2019 They can\u2019t imagine that I\u2019m here for altruistic reasons. And this might explain why Eugene Bullard was in the French Foreign Legion and not the US army. There are a lot of African Americans and young Americans who have been in the military who are gonna see this and are gonna be inspired: this is essentially the French Foreign Legion, and it will be part of the pantheon of the defense of democracy in the defense of Ukraine \u2026 My dad was one of the first Black master chiefs in the navy. This is just who I am. I\u2019m African American, but by God, I\u2019m American. Michael Harriot is a writer and author of the upcoming book Black AF History: The Unwhitewashed Story of America"

            "date": "2022-04-27T20:11:21Z",
            "content": "We\u2019re closing the US politics blog now after a busy day of news, mostly out of Washington DC. Thanks for joining us. It appears Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, retains the support of congressional Republicans, who applauded his defense of leaked conversations with party leaders following the 6 January Capitol riot in a caucus meeting this morning. Despite an audio recording published by the New York Times catching him in a lie over whether he would ask then-president Donald Trump to resign, the House GOP caucus gave him a standing ovation, and McCarthy emerged smiling. Here\u2019s what else we were following today: There were mixed messages in the White House over Covid-19. The government\u2019s chief medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci said the US was out of the pandemic stage of the virus, while press secretary Jen Psaki said at her afternoon briefing: \u201cCovid isn\u2019t over and the pandemic isn\u2019t over\u201d. Homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas defended the Biden administration\u2019s immigration policies in House and Senate hearings, telling lawmakers: \u201cWe\u2019ve effectively managed migrants at the border\u201d. The Minneapolis police department engaged in a pattern of race discrimination for at least a decade, including stopping and arresting Black people at a higher rate than white people, an inquiry following the killing of George Floyd found. Joe Biden paid tribute to the former secretary of state Madeleine Albright at her funeral in Washington DC also attended by former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Donald Trump appealed a ruling by a New York judge that held him in civil contempt and fined him $10,000 a day for failing to comply with an investigation into the former president\u2019s business affairs. Russia and the US enacted a prisoner swap that saw former US marine Trevor Reed gain his freedom. A reminder that you can follow developments in the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our live 24-hour blog here. New York\u2019s highest court has rejected the state\u2019s new congressional district maps, which had been widely seen as favoring Democrats, the Associated Press reports. The legal fight over New York\u2019s redistricting process could be a factor in the battle between Democrats and Republicans for control of the US House in November\u2019s midterm elections. New York is set to lose one seat in Congress in 2021. New York\u2019s new maps would give Democrats a strong majority of registered voters in 22 of the state\u2019s 26 congressional districts. Right now, Republicans currently hold eight of the state\u2019s 27 seats. Democrats had been hoping that a redistricting map favorable to their party in New York might help offset expected losses in other states where Republicans control state government. The state\u2019s court of appeals agreed in a ruling on Wednesday with a group of Republican voters who sued, saying that the district boundaries had been unconstitutionally gerrymandered and that the Legislature hadn\u2019t followed proper procedure in passing the maps. The court said it will \u201clikely be necessary\u201d to move the congressional and state senate primary elections from June to August. Read more: The White House press secretary Jen Psaki is countering the assertion of the government\u2019s chief medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci that the US is out of the Covid-19 pandemic stage. Fauci made the claim in an interview with PBS NewsHour on Tuesday, citing falling rates of hospitalizations and deaths. But Psaki, at her afternoon press briefing at the White House, framed the situation somewhat differently: There\u2019s no question that we\u2019re in a different moment in our fight against Covid. But we also know Covid isn\u2019t over, and the pandemic isn\u2019t over. We\u2019ve seen an uptick in some places, driven by the extremely transmissible BA.2 variants. We know the risk of potential surges even as a potential new variant or subvariant remains, so a different phase because we\u2019re at a much lower level of hospitalizations and deaths, and even nationwide of cases. But we are still seeing people get very sick from Covid. Appearing to play down any split in messaging, Psaki said: What Dr Fauci was saying is that we are in a different phase of this pandemic. And that\u2019s absolutely true. Nationwide cases are relatively low, far below the 900,000 cases a day we saw during the Omicron surge... hospitalizations are about at about the lowest level since the pandemic and deaths are declining. Homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has been telling lawmakers that the Biden administration has \u201ceffectively managed\u201d the flow of migrants at the US-Mexico border with the resources at its disposal, CNN is reporting. Mayorkas is being questioned by Senate and House committees today, largely about the ending of the Trump-era Title 42 immigration policy next month. The decision that terminates the policy of blocking refugees at the southern border because of the Covid-19 pandemic is set to end on 23 May, but has drawn an outcry from Republicans and concern among Democrats about an expected surge of migrants. Mayorkas wasted little time in pinning the blame on the Trump administration, when he testified to the Senate appropriations committee: We inherited a broken and dismantled system that is already under strain. It is not built to manage the current levels and types of migratory flows. Only Congress can fix this. Yet, we have effectively managed an unprecedented number of noncitizens seeking to enter the United States and interdicted more drugs and disrupted more smuggling operations than ever before. A state investigation launched after George Floyd\u2019s killing has found that the Minneapolis police department engaged in a pattern of race discrimination for at least a decade, including stopping and arresting Black people at a higher rate than white people. The Associated Press reports that the department also used force more often on people of color and maintained a culture where racist language is tolerated. The report released Wednesday by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights following a nearly two-year investigation said the agency and the city would negotiate a court-enforceable agreement to address the long list of problems identified in the report, with input from residents, officers, city staff and others. The report said police department data \u201cdemonstrates significant racial disparities with respect to officers\u2019 use of force, traffic stops, searches, citations, and arrests.\u201d And it said officers \u201cused covert social media to surveil Black individuals and Black organizations, unrelated to criminal activity, and maintain an organizational culture where some officers and supervisors use racist, misogynistic, and disrespectful language with impunity.\u201d Human rights commissioner Rebecca Lucero said during a news conference that it doesn\u2019t single out any officers or city leaders. \u201cThis investigation is not about one individual or one incident,\u201d Lucero said. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump and his partners, who won a $27m settlement from the city for the Floyd family, called the report \u201chistoric\u201d and \u201cmonumental in its importance.\u201d They said they were \u201cgrateful and deeply hopeful\u201d that change is imminent. A Florida judge has ordered a man who defaced an LGBTQ+ Pride mural to write a 25-page essay about the 2016 Pulse gay nightclub shooting. Last June, the city of Delray Beach in south Florida unveiled a rainbow mural at an intersection on the fifth anniversary of the attack, in which a gunman killed 49 people at the club in Orlando. A few days later, police noticed \u201ctire skid marks\u201d that were \u201capproximately 15 feet across the painting\u201d, according to an affidavit. Cellphone footage sent to authorities showed then 19-year-old Alexander Jerich driving towards the intersection in a white pickup truck with a Donald Trump flag draped over it. According to the police, he had attended a 30-car rally for the former president\u2019s birthday on 14 June. \u201cThe video clearly shows a white Chevy truck stopped at the intersection, and then intentionally accelerated the vehicle in an unreasonable unsafe manner in a short amount of time \u2026 The Chevy truck continues to recklessly skid sideways,\u201d the affidavit said. \u201cThe video shows that the driver willfully drove the vehicle with disregard for the safety of any other persons or property.\u201d Using the license plate captured in the video, police located Jerich, who agreed to turn himself in. He pleaded guilty to charges of criminal mischief and reckless driving, and agreed to pay $2,003 to repair the mural. During a hearing last Thursday, Jerich hung his head, cried and apologized for his actions but did not offer any real explanation for them, according to the Palm Beach Post. Justice Stephen Breyer has heard his last supreme court arguments, Reuters is reporting, ending an almost three decades-long career on the nation\u2019s highest judicial bench. Chief Justice John Roberts, his voice trembling, delivered a tribute at the end of the hearing: The oral argument we have just concluded is the last the court will hear with Justice Breyer on the bench. For 28 years this has been his arena for remarks profound and moving, questions challenging and insightful, and hypotheticals downright silly. Roberts, Reuters says, was referring to liberal justice Breyer\u2019s penchant for peppering attorneys arguing cases before him with queries involving outlandish hypothetical scenarios as he sorted through complex legal matters: This sitting alone has brought us \u2018radioactive muskrats\u2019 and \u2018John the Tiger man\u2019. The justices heard about two hours of arguments in a case involving a Native American tribal authority in Oklahoma that was the last one on the court\u2019s calendar for its nine-month term. Breyer, at 83 the oldest of the nine justices, announced in January he would retire when the court begins its summer recess, typically at the end of June after all the pending rulings are issued. On 7 April, the US Senate approved Joe Biden\u2019s chosen replacement for Breyer, Ketanji Brown Jackson, whose historic confirmation will make her the first Black woman to sit on the supreme court. There are developments in Florida, where the Trumpist Republican governor Ron DeSantis has been fundraising off his fight with Disney over his controversial \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d law that bans classroom discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity. DeSantis, who is favored to make a run at his party\u2019s nomination for president in 2024, has reaped a record windfall from that spat, and other right-wing culture war laws he has enacted, including redrawing Florida\u2019s congressional map to eliminate Black voting power, and a 15-week abortion ban with no exception for rape, incest or human trafficking. Campaign finance records show that DeSantis had amassed a $105m treasure chest by the end of March for his bid to seek reelection later this year, a record amount for any previous Florida politician, the Miami Herald reports. It includes about $50,000 from two separate days in which the governor\u2019s campaign sent out fundraising emails chastising Disney for its opposition to the \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d bill. Last week, DeSantis signed into law a bill hastily approved at his behest by Florida\u2019s Republican-dominated legislature dissolving Disney\u2019s 55-year right to self-governance. Opponents called the law an act of petty political revenge by DeSantis after the theme park giant, Florida\u2019s largest private employer with almost 80,000 cast members, halted political donations and pledged to help overturn the \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d law. Meanwhile, Disney is telling its investors that the state cannot abolish the company\u2019s special tax district without first paying off an estimated $1bn in bond debt, per a contract agreed in 1967 when the agreement was enacted. The move suggests the fight over Disney\u2019s special status is about to turn from political to legal. A statement from the governor\u2019s office has promised more legislation to deal with the issue, but no details have yet been forthcoming, the Herald says. Here\u2019s where we\u2019re at halfway through a busy Wednesday: Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, received a standing ovation at a Republican caucus meeting during which he defended himself over audio recordings that threatened to derail his chance of becoming House speaker in November. Joe Biden paid tribute to the former secretary of state Madeleine Albright at her funeral in Washington DC also attended by former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Donald Trump is appealing a ruling by a New York judge that held him in civil contempt and fined him $10,000 a day for failing to comply with an investigation into the former president\u2019s business affairs. Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top medical adviser, has announced the pandemic phase of Covid-19 in the US is over, despite rising numbers of cases. Russia and the US enacted a prisoner swap that saw former US marine Trevor Reed gain his freedom. Please stick with us, there\u2019s more to come this afternoon. Kevin McCarthy received a standing ovation from Republican congress members this morning as he defended recorded conversations with party leaders following the 6 January insurrection that have threatened to derail his chances of becoming House speaker. The Associated Press reports that McCarthy, the minority leader, told the House Republican caucus that he never asked then-president Donald Trump to resign over the deadly insurrection by Trump\u2019s supporters. The AP cited two Republicans at the private morning meeting at GOP headquarters, who were granted anonymity to discuss it. McCarthy, who is in line to become House speaker if Republicans, as predicted, win control in the November\u2019s midterm elections, received a standing ovation, the lawmakers said, according to the news agency. It\u2019s worth noting here that the allegation against McCarthy, per the damaging tapes released by the New York Times, was not that he lied about directly asking Trump to resign, but rather that he had discussed with other party officials that he would do so, then denied that. One of the Times\u2019 audio clips captured him in conversation with the the-third most senior House Republican Liz Cheney, whom he later ousted from her leadership role, saying he would tell Trump he should stand down. Today, one Republican in the room said the meeting was \u201ccathartic\u201d for lawmakers, the AP said. Another voiced confidence that McCarthy would be the next speaker. McCarthy, however, was challenged by two of the party\u2019s extremist members, Matt Gaetz of Florida and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who said they felt \u201csingled out\u201d by the Republican leadership team. One Republican congressman, Wisconsin\u2019s Glenn Grothman, berated the media as he left the meeting. \u201cYou guys obsess over January 6. Nobody cares,\u201d he said. An ABC poll this January found that 72% of Americans think the deadly attack on the Capitol, amid Trump\u2019s frantic efforts to overturn the 2020 election he lost to Joe Biden by more than seven million votes, \u201cthreatened democracy\u201d. Read more: Joe Biden has delivered a moving eulogy to Madeleine Albright, telling mourners at her funeral in Washington DC that the former secretary of state \u201cturned the tide of history\u201d. The president was among about 1,400 masked attendees at Washington National Cathedral service honouring the top diplomat from the Bill Clinton administration who died last month at the age of 84. Albright, Biden said, was \u201ca truly proud American who made all of us prouder to be Americans\u201d: With her humanity and her intellect, she turned the tide of history. Her story was America\u2019s story. She loved to speak about America as the indispensable nation. To her, the phrase was never a statement of arrogance, it was about gratitude. For all this country made possible for her was a testament to her belief in the endless possibilities that only America could help unlock around the world, and to her understanding what American power could achieve when it is united with and motivated by enduring American values. Biden acknowledged that Albright, who was appointed the first female secretary of state by Clinton in 1997, arrived in the US as a child refugee from the former Czechoslovakia with her family: That\u2019s why there was nothing she loved more than swearing in new citizens to this great nation of ours. She\u2019d light up reminding them that she once stood where they stood. Having gained the blessings of liberty she wanted nothing more than the share them around the globe. To Madeleine, from my perspective, there was no higher mission, no greater honor, than to serve this great experiment of freedom known as the United States of America. In the 20th and 21st century, freedom had no greater champion than Madeleine Korbel Albright. Donald Trump is appealing the contempt of court ruling and daily $10,000 fine imposed on him by a New York judge this week for his refusal to hand over documents the state attorney investigating his business affairs. CNN is reporting that the appeal was filed yesterday, the same day that the fines were supposed to come into effect, meaning the former president may not have to pay until the legal challenge is resolved. New York state supreme court judge Arthur Engoron ruled Trump in contempt on Monday over his resistance to a subpoena from New York state attorney Letitia James demanding documents and information. \u201cMr Trump, I know you take your business seriously, and I take mine seriously. I hereby hold you in civil contempt and fine you $10,000 a day,\u201d Engoron said at the hearing Trump did not attend. Read more: One of the most intriguing trials stemming from the 6 January Capitol riot has begun in Washington DC, with a retired member of New York city\u2019s police department charged with beating a fellow lawman, a Washington DC police officer, with a flagpole. The New York Times has this in-depth look at the case surrounding Thomas Webster, the former NYPD officer and one-time member of the security detail for New York\u2019s ex-mayor Michael Bloomberg. Webster, the Times says, beat his on-duty compatriot with the flagpole several times, according to prosecutors, then pushed through barricades and tackled him to the ground. Webster, who denies the charges, insists the Washington DC officer provoked his aggression and that he was simply trying to protect himself. The trial began in federal district court in Washington DC on Tuesday, the sixth case connected to the Capitol attack to go on trial. Former New Mexico county commissioner Couy Griffin, who founded a group called Cowboys for Trump, was found guilty by a judge last month, the second consecutive conviction of a 6 January rioter. Read more: The funeral of Madeleine Albright, America\u2019s first female secretary of state, is getting under way in Washington DC with a number of world leaders and senior US political figures, including Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Joe Biden and Antony Blinken, paying their respects. Albright, 84, died of cancer last month, after a storied political career that saw her rise from child refugee to a pinnacle of service during the Clinton administration. About 1,400 mourners are gathered at Washington National Cathedral, every one masked at the Albright family\u2019s request. Blinken, who is Biden\u2019s secretary of state, is one of three of Albright\u2019s successors in attendance. Another, Hillary Clinton, is scheduled to deliver a tribute, as well as her husband and Biden. We\u2019ll have more coverage coming up. Read Albright\u2019s obituary here: Sarah Palin announced her candidacy for Alaska\u2019s only congressional seat this month, entering a race with dozens of candidates. She certainly brings name recognition to the contest \u2013 but another contender may have her beat in that department. His name is Santa Claus. He lives, of course, in North Pole \u2013 a town of about 2,000 in Alaska. He has a big white beard and a kindly manner, and Santa Claus is indeed his legal name, though, as a Bernie Sanders supporter, he does not exploit elf labor. He won a city council seat in 2015, to the delight of observers around the world. Now he\u2019s ready to take his political career to the next stage. He\u2019s running to complete the term of the long-serving Republican congressman Don Young, who died last month at age 88. A special primary will be held on 11 June. As for Claus\u2019s politics: he\u2019s been called \u201ca bastion of blue on a city council as red as Rudolph\u2019s nose\u201d. He says voters who look at Sanders\u2019 policy platform can get a pretty good idea of his own, including support for Medicare for All, racial justice, corporate accountability, and free and fair elections. That includes ranked-choice voting, which will feature in the second round of the coming election. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s given me the opportunity here,\u201d he said. Ranked-choice voting \u201cgives people with name recognition such as yours truly, and even Sarah, for that matter, a slight advantage\u201d. But Claus hasn\u2019t always had that name. \u201cSeventy-four years ago, I didn\u2019t pop out with a beard,\u201d he says. In fact, Claus changed his name from Tom O\u2019Connor in 2005. Read more: Anthony Fauci has declared the pandemic stage of the Covid-19 virus over in the US, in an eyebrow-raising interview the government\u2019s leading infectious diseases expert gave to PBS NewsHour. Yet despite his pronouncement, which he says he\u2019s basing on the nation\u2019s low numbers of new daily infections, Fauci has pulled out of attending this weekend\u2019s White House correspondents\u2019 dinner in Washington DC for fear of catching an infection himself. His declaration is more surprising, and contradictory perhaps, because of his assertion in the same interview with NewsHour host Judy Woodruff that the US was undercounting cases of Covid-19. Recorded new infections, fueled by the BA.2 Omicron subvariant, have risen 61% in the last 14 days, figures show. Fauci told PBS: I am virtually certain that we are undercounting the number of infections. There are many people, people who I know myself, friends and others, who get infected, who do an antigen test, don\u2019t get many symptoms, but don\u2019t report it to anyone. So, the fact is, there are infections that are not getting centrally reported. Fauci said he does not envisage the virus will ever be eradicated, but that vaccines and treatments will keep infections at a low, and less dangerous level: We are certainly in this country out of the pandemic phase. Namely, we don\u2019t have 900,000 new infections a day, and tens and tens and tens of thousands of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths. We are at a low level right now. Pandemic means a widespread, throughout the world, infection that spreads rapidly among people. So if you look at the global situation, there\u2019s no doubt this pandemic is still ongoing. CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources reported that Fauci, 81, decided to withdraw from Saturday\u2019s White House correspondents\u2019 dinner \u201cbecause of an individual assessment of his own personal risk.\u201d Joe Biden still intends to attend, the White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday, despite a new wave of infections among Washington DC politicians, including vice-president Kamala Harris and Democratic senators Chris Murphy and Ron Wyden. Joe Biden has spoken with the family of Trevor Reed, the former US marine freed today by Russian in prisoner swap deal. The swap was \u201cmonths in the making\u201d, White House sources told CNN, with senior administration officials including the president working on the details. Video aired by CNN, reportedly from Russian authorities, appeared to show Reed at an airport about to board a plane to the US. In a statement, the president said: I heard in the voices of Trevor\u2019s parents how much they\u2019ve worried about his health and missed his presence. And I was delighted to be able to share with them the good news about Trevor\u2019s freedom. His safe return is a testament to the priority my administration places on bringing home Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained abroad. We won\u2019t stop until Paul Whelan and others join Trevor in the loving arms of family and friends. Whelan is another former US marine and corporate security officer sentenced to 16 years by a Russian court in 2020 for spying. John Sullivan, the US ambassador to Moscow, called Whelan\u2019s conviction \u201ca mockery of justice\u201d. Russia and the US have carried out a dramatic prisoner exchange, trading a marine veteran jailed in Moscow for a convicted Russian drug trafficker serving a long prison sentence in America, a senior US official and the Russian foreign ministry said. The surprise deal would have been a notable diplomatic manoeuvre even in times of peace, but it was all the more extraordinary because it was completed as Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine has driven relations with the US to their lowest point in decades, the Associated Press says. As part of the exchange, Russia released Trevor Reed, a former marine from Texas who was arrested in the summer of 2019 after Russian authorities said he assaulted an officer while being driven by police to a police station following a night of heavy drinking. Reed was later sentenced to nine years in prison, though his family has maintained his innocence and the US government has described him as unjustly detained. The US agreed to return Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot serving a 20-year federal prison sentence in Connecticut for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the US after he was arrested in Liberia in 2010 and extradited to the US. Read more: Kevin McCarthy is likely to face new pressure this week to appear before the bipartisan panel investigating the 6 January insurrection, its chairman has said, as the House minority leader faces angry Republican colleagues this morning. The embattled GOP chief was caught in a lie over the 6 January insurrection by the New York Times, which released audio clips capturing the purported Donald Trump ally saying he would call for Trump\u2019s resignation, which he denied. Possibly more damaging for McCarthy\u2019s hopes of one day becoming House speaker is the Times\u2019 latest release, in which he suggests far-right Republican lawmakers could incite violence against colleagues. In a recording made on 10 January last year, four days after Trump supporters rioted at the Capitol building and amid the then-president\u2019s efforts to overturn his election defeat by Joe Biden, McCarthy tells fellow Republican leaders that extremist politicians are \u201cputting people in jeopardy\u201d with incendiary statements and tweets. Vocal Trump acolytes Matt Gaetz of Florida and Mo Brooks of Alabama are identified by McCarthy as particularly likely to endanger other lawmakers\u2019 security. Gaetz, predictably, reacted with fury, exposing Republican fissures in a tweet attacking both McCarthy and minority whip Steve Scalise: McCarthy faces the House GOP caucus later this morning, with the knowledge that the 6 January panel is pressing again to get him to testify. According to the Associated Press, the panel expects to decide this week about issuing a second request to McCarthy, who has declined to voluntarily appear, and is also looking at summoning a widening group of House Republicans for interviews. The committee is looking into the riot and Trump\u2019s attempts to cling on to power. Its chair, the Mississippi Democrat Bennie Thompson, says the panel will hold public meetings in June, and expects to release a report in the early fall. Read more: Good morning, and welcome to the midweek edition of our US politics blog. It\u2019s going to be an uncomfortable morning for the House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, who faces his Republican caucus for the first time since he was caught in a lie by the New York Times over the 6 January insurrection. Audio clips released by the newspaper captured the purported Donald Trump ally saying he would call for Trump\u2019s resignation, which he denied. But possibly more damaging for McCarthy\u2019s hopes of one day becoming House speaker is the Times\u2019 latest release, in which he suggests far-right Republican lawmakers could incite violence against colleagues. McCarthy faces the House GOP caucus at 10am. Here\u2019s what else were watching today: Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious diseases expert, has declared the Covid-19 pandemic effectively over in the US, according to the Washington Post. Curiously, however, he\u2019s skipping the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner this weekend for fear of catching it. Homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will appear before both House and Senate committees today trying to explain how the Biden administration intends to fix the pickle it has got itself into over ending the Trump-era Title 42 immigration policy. Joe Biden, and Bill and Hillary Clinton, will attend the funeral in Washington DC for Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state who died last month. The House panel investigating the 6 January insurrection will hold public meetings in June, and expects to release a report in the early fall, its chair Bennie Thompson has said."

            "content": "Cooking for kids can be the biggest meal battleground: one day, they\u2019ll eat something you have lovingly made with gusto, only to push it away the next (or throw it on the floor \u2013 we\u2019ve all been there). Then there is the question of vegetables: there seems to be no rhyme or reason as to which ones are in favour at any given moment. The key thing I have learned is that if you involve them in the process, the likelihood of them eating a dish \u2013 or at least trying it \u2013 is much greater. Today\u2019s coconut rice is a great example of an inexpensive meal they can help with, while the quiche is the baking equivalent of messy play: rolling, dusting, grating \u2026 Mushrooms aren\u2019t the easiest sell to my little ones, at least, so making them cheesy and playful works wonders. Red pepper, kidney bean and coconut rice This is one of my daughters\u2019 favourite meals; there are so many parts to this Caribbean-inspired rice that they can help with, it makes them enjoy it all the more. It\u2019s nutritious, too. Prep 10 min Cook 50 min Serves 4-6 3 tbsp groundnut oil 1 bunch spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced or snipped 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated or chopped 2 red peppers, halved, pith and seeds removed and discarded, flesh torn or chopped into small pieces 1 medium tomato 6 fresh thyme sprigs 6 allspice berries 3cm piece fresh ginger, peeled 1 x 400ml tin coconut milk 1 x 400g tin kidney beans, undrained 200g long-grain rice Sea salt and black pepper (optional) 4 large eggs (optional) 2 limes, cut into wedges, to serve Chilli sauce, to serve (optional) Put a large pan or casserole on a medium-low heat, add the oil, spring onions, garlic and peppers, and cook, stirring often, for 12-15 minutes, until softened. Chop the tomato, then add it to the pan with the thyme and allspice. Finely grate in the ginger, cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes, then add the coconut milk and kidney beans, including the liquid from the bean tin. Add 250ml water, bring to a boil, then stir in the rice. Season to taste, then cover the pan and leave to simmer on a low heat for 30 minutes. If you\u2019re using the eggs, when the rice is almost ready, bring a medium pan of water to a boil, add the eggs andcook for seven minutes. Drain, then cool in cold water. After 30 minutes, take the rice off the heat, remove the lid, replace it with a tea towel and leave to steam for a few minutes. Serve the rested rice topped with a peeled boiled egg, if using, the lime wedges for squeezing over, and a bottle of chilli sauce on the side for anyone who likes a bit of heat. Chestnut mushroom, mustard and cheddar quiche I have consistently struggled to get my girls to eat mushrooms, but when I enrobe them in a cheesy, creamy quiche filling, they love them. The addition of subtle flavours such as mustard powder and chives are a great way gently to move their palates away from more simple foods, and are both ingredients children can help with in preparing. Prep 15 min Chill 20 min Cook 1 hr Serves 6-8 Plain flour, for dusting 500g shortcrust pastry 500g chestnut mushrooms 1 large knob butter 2 tbsp olive oil Sea salt and black pepper (optional) 3 large eggs 200ml double cream 100 whole milk 1 tsp mustard powder 10g bunch chives 100g mature cheddar cheese, or vegetarian alternative Dust a worktop with a little flour, then roll out the pastry into a large, roughly \u00bdcm-thick circlethat\u2019s big enough to line a 25cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Gently roll the pastry over the rolling pin, then drape it into the tin. Tear off a bit of the overhang and use it to push the pastry right into the fluted edges (keep that piece aside, in case you need it to patch up any holes later). Leave the rest of the overhang, prick the pastry base all over with a fork and pop the tin in the freezer for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Wipe the mushrooms, then tear them into roughly 2\u00bdcm pieces. Put a large frying pan on a medium heat, add the butter, oil and mushrooms, season and fry, stirring often, for 15-20 minutes, until the mushrooms lose their moisture and start to turn golden. Put the chilled tart tin on an oven tray, line the pastry with baking paper and fill with baking beans or similar. Blind bake for 10 minutes, then carefully lift out the paper and beans, and bake for 12-15 minutes more, until golden. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, cream, milk and mustard powder, then snip in the chives. Coarsely grate the cheddar and whisk most of it into the egg mix. When the quiche case is ready, trim off any excess pastry, then spoon in the mushrooms evenly. Pour the cream mixture over the top, scatter over the remaining cheddar and bake for 30 minutes, until the filling is just set but still has a slight wobble in the centre. Leave the quiche to cool for at least 15 minutes before releasing it from the tin, slicing and serving.

            "title": "UK military vaults upgraded to store new US nuclear weapons",
            "date": "2022-04-12T19:25:16Z",
            "content": "Military bunkers in the UK are being upgraded so they can be used to store US nuclear weapons again after 14 years of standing empty, according to US defence budget documents. In the Biden administration\u2019s 2023 defence budget request, the UK was added to the list of countries where infrastructure investment is under way at \u201cspecial weapons\u201d storage sites, alongside Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey \u2013 all countries where the US stores an estimated 100 B61 nuclear bombs. Hans Kristensen, the director of the nuclear information project at the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), who first reported on the budget item, said he believed the British site being upgraded is the US airbase at RAF Lakenheath, 100 km north-east of London. The US withdrew its B61 munitions from Lakenheath in 2008, marking the end of more than half a century of maintaining a US nuclear stockpile in the UK. At the time of the withdrawal, the gravity bombs were widely seen as militarily obsolete and hopes were higher for further disarmament by the nuclear weapons powers. That optimism has since been dashed, against the backdrop of Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, his regime\u2019s nuclear threats against Nato, and extensive nuclear weapon modernisation programmes pursued by both the US and Russia. As part of the US plan, the B61 has been given a new lease of life with a guidance system, the B61-12 variant, due to go into full production in May. The 2023 budget request says that Nato \u201cis wrapping up a 13-year, $384m infrastructure investment program at storage sites in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK, and Turkey to upgrade security measures, communication systems, and facilities\u201d. In the 1990s, RAF Lakenheath had 33 underground storage vaults, where 110 B61 bombs were stored, according to the FAS. Since their withdrawal the vaults have been mothballed. Kristensen said he believes the vaults are now being upgraded so the new B61-12 bombs can be stored there, if needed. The Biden administration has been careful not to make any moves that might be seen as escalatory in the nuclear arena in response to Putin\u2019s announcement he would put Russia\u2019s nuclear forces on higher alert a few days after his invasion of Ukraine. The US has cancelled scheduled tests of its intercontinental ballistic missiles, for example. For the same reason, Kristensen said he doubted the Biden administration is planning to increase the US nuclear stockpile in Europe. When the new B61-12 bombs are delivered, expected next year, they will replace older models already there. Instead, he thought the Lakenheath upgrade is intended to provided more flexibility to move the nuclear weapons around Europe. \u201cOne of the things they have talked about is protecting the deterrent against Russia\u2019s improved cruise missiles capabilities,\u201d Kristensen said. \u201cSo they could be trying to beef up the readiness of more sites without them necessarily receiving nukes, so that they have the options to move things around in a contingency if they need to.\u201d Britain has become keen to take a more assertive role when it comes to its own nuclear deterrent, and last year announced it would increase its own stockpile of Trident nuclear warheads by 40% to 260, the first such increase since the end of the cold war. Whitehall sources say the UK has \u201ca clearer appreciation\u201d of its role as a nuclear weapons state in a renewed era of state competition with Russia and China. The UK Ministry of Defence did not comment on the upgrade mentioned in the US budget. One British official said: \u201cWe won\u2019t provide anything on this as it relates to the storage of nuclear weapons.\u201d But the news comes just four months after the arrival in Lakenheath of the first of a new generation of nuclear-capable US combat aircraft, the F-35A Lightning II, the first such deployment in Europe. Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said the upgrade of the UK storage facilities is \u201can early sign that the US and Nato are preparing to engage in a protracted and maybe heightened standoff with Putin\u2019s Russia\u201d. \u201cThe administration should provide some clarity about the military necessity and goals of possibly bringing nuclear weapons back to the UK,\u201d Kimball added. The developments in Europe are part of a broader retreat from arms control. The Biden administration\u2019s nuclear posture review, which has been sent to Congress but not yet declassified, is reported not to contain the changes the president pledged during his campaign. In 2020, he said he would formally declare the sole purpose of nuclear weapons to be deterrence of a nuclear attack against the United States or its allies. But the review leaves open the option of using nuclear arms to respond to non-nuclear threats as well. The nuclear disarmament group CND said the \u201cquiet announcement\u201d by the US amounted to more militarisation at a time of growing risk and would add to the risks faced by the British public. Kate Hudson, the general secretary of CND, said she feared it could lead to US warheads being redeployed in the UK. \u201cNuclear weapons don\u2019t make us safe \u2013 they make us a target,\u201d she added."

            "date": "2022-04-06T16:55:14Z",
            "content": "The US has disrupted a global \u201cbotnet\u201d controlled by Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced on Wednesday. A botnet is a network of hijacked computers used to carry out cyberattacks. \u201cThe Russian government has recently used similar infrastructure to attack Ukrainian targets,\u201d Garland told reporters at the justice department. \u201cFortunately, we were able to disrupt this botnet before it could be used. Thanks to our close work with international partners, we were able to detect the infection of thousands of network hardware devices. \u201cWe were then able to disable the GRU\u2019s [the military intelligence agency] control over those devices before the botnet could be weaponised.\u201d The attorney general also announced charges against Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev for sanctions violations. He said the billionaire had been previously identified as a source of financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea and providing support for the so-called Donetsk People\u2019s Republic in eastern Ukraine. \u201cAfter being sanctioned by the United States, Malofeyev attempted to evade the sanctions by using co-conspirators to surreptitiously acquire and run media outlets across Europe,\u201d Garland said. The indictment is the first of a Russian oligarch in the US since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In a related move, a federal court in the southern district of New York unsealed a criminal indictment against TV producer John Hanick, 71, a US citizen charged with violations of sanctions and false statements because of his work for Malofeyev over several years. Matthew Olsen, assistant attorney general of the justice department\u2019s national security division, said: \u201cThe defendant Hanick knowingly chose to help Malofeyev spread his destabilizing messages by establishing, or attempting to establish, TV networks in Russia, Bulgaria and Greece, in violation of those sanctions.\u201d Last month Garland, who is America\u2019s top law enforcement official, announced the launch of Task Force KleptoCapture, an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. He vowed on Wednesday: \u201cOur message to those who continue to enable the Russian regime through their criminal conduct is this: it does not matter how far you sail your yacht, it does not matter how well you conceal your assets, it does not matter how cleverly you write your malware or hide your online activity. \u201cThe justice department will use every available tool to find you, disrupt your plots and hold you accountable.\u201d Garland, whose grandparents fled antisemitism at the border of western Russia and eastern Europe more than a century ago, acknowledged horrific images that emerged from Bucha in Ukraine his week. \u201cWe have seen the dead bodies of civilians, some with bound hands, scattered in the streets. We have seen the mass graves. We have seen the bombed hospital, theatre and residential apartment buildings. \u201cThe world sees what is happening in Ukraine. The justice department sees what is happening in Ukraine. This department has a long history of helping to hold accountable those who perpetrate war crimes.\u201d He noted that one of his predecessors, Attorney General Robert Jackson, later served as a chief American prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials after the second world war. \u201cToday, we are assisting international efforts to identify and hold accountable those responsible for atrocities in Ukraine and we will continue to do so.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-04-23T04:51:51Z",
            "content": "The US government has warned Solomon Islands it will \u201crespond accordingly\u201d if its security agreement with China leads to a Chinese military presence in the Pacific island nation. A visiting US delegation including Indo-Pacific security adviser Kurt Campbell delivered the message to the Solomon Islands prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, directly, the White House said, as fallout over the agreement continued to dominate the Australian federal election campaign. Details of the agreement have not been made public. But according to a draft version of the deal, it would allow armed Chinese police to be deployed at Solomon Islands\u2019 request to maintain \u201csocial order\u201d. It would also allow China to \u201cmake ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands\u201d, and Chinese forces could also be used \u201cto protect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in Solomon Islands\u201d. In a statement, the Biden administration said Sogavare assured the US there would be no long-term Chinese presence on the islands. But the US would nevertheless \u201cfollow developments closely in consultation with regional partners\u201d. \u201cSolomon Islands representatives indicated that the agreement had solely domestic applications but the US delegation noted there are potential regional security implications of the accord, including for the United States and its allies and partners,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u201cThe US delegation outlined clear areas of concern with respect to the purpose, scope and transparency of the agreement. \u201cIf steps are taken to establish a de facto permanent military presence, power-projection capabilities, or a military installation, the delegation noted that the United States would then have significant concerns and respond accordingly.\u201d The White House also committed to expedite the reopening of its embassy in Honiara. On Saturday morning the Australian treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, refused to be drawn on when the government became aware of the agreement. It had been reported by the Nine newspapers earlier this week that Australian intelligence agencies first became aware in March, and played a role in leaking the draft of the agreement online. But the failure of the Morrison government to prevent the deal has been described by the opposition Labor party as the most significant foreign policy failure in the Pacific since the second world war. Frydenberg would not say when Australia first knew of the pact between the Solomon Islands and China, saying instead that \u201cwe\u2019ve known that this was always a risk\u201d, adding that \u201cwe\u2019ve known that there were discussions under way\u201d. He also told Weekend Sunrise that the government could do little more to assist Solomon Islands, describing its existing aid as a \u201cfull court press\u201d. The Coalition government continued to try and use the issue to paint Labor as soft on China, with Frydenberg describing a speech by Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Richard Marles, in 2019 as the \u201cbiggest story\u201d of the day. Marles \u2013 who was campaigning alongside Jim Chalmers in Brisbane due to Labor leader Anthony Albanese\u2019s infection with Covid \u2013 confirmed reports he had shown Chinese government officials a copy of a speech he gave at a Beijing university in 2019. \u201cI made a speech in China where I criticised China and I wanted to make sure that the Chinese government were not at all surprised with what I was going to say,\u201d Marles said. \u201cThe assertion made by the government is another desperate attempt to divert from their failings in the Pacific.\u201d Senior Labor MP Tanya Plibersek said on Saturday morning that Solomon Islands\u2019 security pact followed \u201cyears of neglect\u201d by the Australian government. Asked what Labor would have done differently from the Coalition, she said: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have trashed the relationship with our Pacific neighbours in the first place. \u201cIt is inexplicable that, having been warned about this, [prime minister] Scott Morrison didn\u2019t say to his foreign minister, Marise Payne, I want you on the first plane to the Solomon Islands to talk this through.\u201d The reaction to the deal in the Solomons has been mixed. Peter Kenilorea, the chair of the Solomon Islands\u2019 parliament\u2019s foreign relations committee and an opposition MP, described the agreement as only benefiting China. During a forum hosted this week, Kenilorea also questioned Sogavare\u2019s contention that his government was entitled to reach the agreement as it was a sovereign decision. \u201cI don\u2019t think is a path we should take or that it is a path would benefit Solomon Islands,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the biggest winner here will be the People\u2019s Republic of China, in terms of a foothold in the Pacific region.\u201d He went on to say that \u201cwhen it comes to security, especially in this heightened geopolitical environment, it is more than a national issue \u2026 the region is impacted, there are implications\u201d. Another participant in the forum, leading Solomon Islands academic Dr Transform Aqorau, said it was concerning that no one outside the government had seen a copy of the signed agreement or been provided with any detail of its content, but said he did not see anything wrong with an agreement that bolstered the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF). But former Solomon Islands prime minister and current MP Danny Philip told the same forum that the agreement would help ensure Chinese assets were protected in the country, after Australian security forces that were deployed there failed to do so. His claims were rejected by Australian authorities. \u2022 Associated Press and Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"

            "date": "2022-04-13T09:30:34Z",
            "content": "A senior US military general has warned during a visit to Australia that China\u2019s offer to deepen security ties with Solomon Islands will come with strings attached, suggesting the Pacific island country may come to regret the planned deal. \u201cMy parents told me if a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d the commandant of the United States Marine Corps, general David Berger, said on Wednesday. Berger was cautious when asked about longstanding US concerns relating to a Chinese company\u2019s lease over the port of Darwin, stressing it was a sovereign decision for Australia as part of its yet-to-be-completed national security review. Ahead of a trip to Darwin, the site of increasing rotations of US Marines, Berger said: \u201cIf it\u2019s not of concern to Australia, then it\u2019s not of concern to me.\u201d Berger\u2019s visit comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activity by the US and Australia attempting to head off a proposed security agreement between China and Solomon Islands, which could allow regular visits by the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy. A leaked draft from last month raised the possibility China could \u201cmake ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands\u201d, while Chinese forces could also be used \u201cto protect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in Solomon Islands\u201d. The prime minister of Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, has sought to allay concerns, saying his country has no intention of allowing a Chinese naval base. But Sogavare has also said it is \u201cvery insulting to be branded as unfit to manage our sovereign affairs\u201d. Speaking in Canberra on Wednesday, Berger said the US needed to show humility in its outreach to Pacific nations, but also needed to be open about the potential long-term consequences. Berger reflected on the fight for control of Guadalcanal in Solomon Islands during the second world war, when the US and allies sought to prevent Japanese forces from gaining a foothold in the strategically important location. \u201cA lot of things change in warfare. Not geography. Where \u2026 Solomon Islands are matters. It did then and it does now,\u201d Berger said at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. He said the proposed agreement was \u201cjust another example\u201d of China seeking to broaden and expand its influence. He raised concerns about \u201cthe way that [it] happens and the consequences for the nations\u201d involved. Sogavare has argued Solomon Islands pursues a \u201cfriends to all and enemies to none\u201d foreign policy, but Berger implied countries making agreements with Beijing might regret it down the track. \u201cWe should illuminate, we should draw out into the open what this means long term,\u201d Berger said. \u201cThis is, in other words, an extension of \u2018hey we\u2019re here with a cheque, we\u2019re here with money, we\u2019d like to improve your port or your airfield or your bus station\u2019. And that just sounds so great, until a year later or six months later.\u201d Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The US plans to reopen its embassy in Solomon Islands, a move the nominee for US ambassador to Australia, Caroline Kennedy, has said \u201ccan\u2019t come soon enough\u201d. Berger acknowledged there were limits to US insights in Pacific island countries, so the US needed to rely on allies such as Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have always the best view, the clearest picture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to understand the neighbourhood and we\u2019re never going to understand it as well as Australia.\u201d Earlier, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, denied that the US had conveyed any concerns that Australia had dropped the ball in the region. Morrison said the Australian government was continuing to raise concerns with Solomon Islands without acting in a \u201cheavy-handed\u201d way. Australia\u2019s minister for the Pacific, Zed Seselja, met with Sogavare in Honiara on Wednesday and \u201casked Solomon Islands respectfully to consider not signing the agreement\u201d with China. Seselja suggested Solomon Islands \u201cconsult the Pacific family in the spirit of regional openness and transparency\u201d. Australia would work with Solomon Islands \u201cswiftly, transparently and with full respect for its sovereignty\u201d. \u201cWe welcome recent statements from prime minister Sogavare that Australia remains Solomon Islands\u2019 security partner of choice, and his commitment that Solomon Islands will never be used for military bases or other military institutions of foreign powers,\u201d Seselja said. Sogavare has previously said Solomon Islands welcomed \u201cany country that is willing to support us in our security space\u201d. But Matthew Wale, the leader of the opposition, has argued the deal \u201cwould make the Solomons a geopolitical playing field\u201d and \u201cfurther threaten the nation\u2019s fragile unity\u201d."

            "date": "2022-04-19T04:17:41Z",
            "content": "Thank you for following today\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine. We will be closing this liveblog but you can catch all the latest developments on our new blog launched below. Russia is alleging Ukrainian forces struck a village in the province of Belgorod near Russia\u2019s border with Ukraine, wounding one resident. Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov made the claim in posts on the messaging app Telegram, Russian state media Tass reported on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear whether the strike was carried out by artillery, mortars, missiles or was an aerial attack. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify these claims. Here is a look at some front pages from British newspapers covering the war in Ukraine: A plane sent from Moscow to collect expelled Russian diplomats from Spain and then onto Greece was forced to make a 15,000km detour because of an EU flight ban, according to data obtained by FlightRadar. \u201cWhile Spain and Greece made a one-time exception for the aircraft to enter their airspace, the flights navigated around other countries that maintain bans on Russian flights,\u201d the flight tracking website said. \u201cThe total length of the flights was 15,163 km, just shy of the current world\u2019s longest flight between Singapore and New York.\u201d Russia has launched a major offensive into eastern Ukraine, authorities in Kyiv said, opening a new phase of its invasion after being thwarted in efforts to capture the capital. Here is a visual guide as to where Russia\u2019s forces stand. UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths added that he would travel to Turkey this week to discuss with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other officials the prospects of hosting humanitarian talks between Ukraine and Russia. \u201cTurkey has been able to present itself to both sides as a genuinely valuable and useful host for those talks,\u201d he said. UN aid officials are planning to dispatch a humanitarian convoy in the next couple of days into the eastern Donetsk region, where Russia-backed separatists declared a republic, and from there aid supplies would go to Luhansk, another separatist region, he said. Griffiths did not say when he would meet Erdogan, but initially said he planned to arrive in Turkey on Wednesday and leave Thursday. However, he tested positive for Covid-19 shortly after his announcement, forcing him to postpone his trip to an unspecified date, his team told AFP. Humanitarian ceasefires between Ukrainian and Russian forces in Ukraine are not on the horizon right now, but may be possible in a couple of weeks, the UN aid chief has said. Martin Griffiths made the comments in a briefing to reporters at UN headquarters in New York on Monday. Griffiths met senior officials in Moscow and Kyiv this month to discuss UN \u201caspirations\u201d for humanitarian ceasefires and ways to improve a system to notify the sides of evacuation and humanitarian supply movements. Obviously, we have not yet got a humanitarian ceasefire in place on the Russian side,\u201d he said. \u201cI went into a lot of details on this and they continued to promise to get back to me on the details of those proposals. Right now, if I could speak for the Russian authorities, they are not putting local ceasefires at the top of their agenda. Ceasefires are not on the horizon right now. They may be in a couple of weeks. They may be a bit longer than that.\u201d Here are some of the latest images to emerge from Bucha, a town 27km (17 miles) north-west from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, which is swiftly becoming synonymous with the worst atrocities of Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine. A sprawling cemetery now holds Ukrainian civilians and soldiers who lost their lives due to the Russian attacks. French President Emmanuel Macron has said his dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin has stalled after mass killings were discovered in Ukraine. \u201cSince the massacres we have discovered in Bucha and in other towns, the war has taken a different turn, so I did not speak to him again directly since, but I don\u2019t rule out doing so in the future\u201d, Macron told France 5 television on Monday. Russia has called the accusations its forces executed civilians in Bucha while occupying the town a \u201cmonstrous forgery\u201d aimed at denigrating the Russian army. Asked why he had not followed the example of other European leaders and travelled to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, Macron said that a show of support by itself was not needed after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cI will go back to Kyiv, but I will go there to bring something useful with me... because it\u2019s obvious that I don\u2019t need to travel there to show this support,\u201d Macron said, adding that he had spoken around 40 times since the start of the war to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. \u201cIf I go to Kyiv, it will be to make a difference,\u201d he added. Russian troops have reportedly captured the east Ukraine town of Kreminna while local authorities have urged residents in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions to evacuate. \u201cCurrently, control over the city of Kreminna is lost, street fights are taking place,\u201d Luhansk regional governor Sergiy Gaiday said in a statement on his official Telegram channel on Monday night. \u201cRussians shot dead people trying to leave Kreminna,\u201d he added, claiming four people had been killed as they tried to evacuate in their own vehicles on Monday morning. The Russians opened fire on a car with civilians. Four people died.\u201d Homes, buildings, a sports complex and other facilities were also destroyed as a result of shelling in the town as well as in the nearby towns of Rubizne and Lysychansk. In Lysychansk, the building of the regional patrol police department was destroyed, resulting in the hospitalisation of six policemen, Gaiday added. I strongly urge people to evacuate ... There are no safe places left in the region - evacuate, we can still save you.\u201d Kreminna, with a pre-war population of nearly 20,000 people, is around 50km (31 miles) northeast of Kramatorsk, the region\u2019s administrative centre, and is a strategic target for invading Russian forces. A series of images released by the Ukrainian presidential press office show President Volodymyr Zelenskiy presenting Matti Maasikas, head of the delegation of the European Union to Ukraine, with Ukraine\u2019s answers to the European Union questionnaire in Kyiv on Monday. The historic move is the first step in Ukraine\u2019s campaign to obtain accelerated EU membership. US President Joe Biden will hold a call with allies on Tuesday to discuss the Ukraine crisis, including on how to coordinate on holding Russia accountable, the White House said in a statement, as reported by Reuters. The President will convene a secure video call with allies and partners to discuss our continued support for Ukraine and efforts to hold Russia accountable as part of our close coordination.\u201d Russian forces launched a new offensive push along most of Ukraine\u2019s eastern flank on Monday signalling that the \u201cbattle of Donbas\u201d has now begun, Ukrainian president Volodymr Zelenskiy has said. Ukraine\u2019s army has been bracing for a new Russian assault on its eastern flank since Moscow withdrew its forces from near Kyiv and from Ukraine\u2019s north late last month in order to focus on an assault in the Ukrainian region of Donbas. Watch Zelenskiy\u2019s address in the video below. The Russian offensive to seize eastern Ukraine and the \u201cbattle for Donbas\u201d has begun, Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymr Zelenskiy said. \u201cNow we can already state that the Russian troops have begun the battle for the Donbas, for which they have been preparing for a long time,\u201d he said in a video address, adding that a \u201csignificant part of the entire Russian army is now concentrated on this offensive\u201d. Presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said: \u201cThe second phase of the war has begun.\u201d Russia has 76 battalion tactical groups in the Donbas region of Ukraine and in the country\u2019s southeast with 11 of those added over the last several days, a senior US defence department official said in a statement on Monday night. The southern port city of Mariupol has not fallen to Russian forces, US officials added. \u201cOur assessment is Mariupol is still contested,\u201d the Pentagon official said. If Russian forces succeed in taking full control of Mariupol, that could free up nearly a dozen battalion tactical groups for use elsewhere in the Donbas. No fewer than 1,000 civilians are reportedly hiding in underground shelters beneath the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, according to the city council. Most of the civilians are believed to be women with children and elderly people. The first shipments of a new US military aid package have arrived at Ukraine\u2019s borders, a senior Pentagon official confirmed. \u201cThere have been four flights from the United States arriving into the theatre just yesterday,\u201d the official said on Monday, with a fifth flight due shortly. Last week, the United States unveiled a $800-million tranche of equipment for Ukraine, including helicopters, howitzers and armoured personnel carriers. Earlier on Monday Russia unleashed a barrage of long-range missiles across Ukraine, in what analysts described as a \u201csoftening up\u201d exercise before its military push. Shelling in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region killed four people, regional governor, Pavlo Kirilenko, said. Four Russian rockets smashed into the western city of Lviv, killing seven people and injuring at least 11 early on Monday morning. Three hit military infrastructure. But the fourth appeared to have missed its target and landed in a car repair workshop. New photos and a video of the damaged Russian cruiser Moskva appear to show that it was probably struck by anti-ship missiles and then abandoned before the ship sank in the Black Sea. Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded: \u201cWe did see the footage, but we can\u2019t say how authentic and true it is.\u201d Family members of sailors who served onboard the warship are demanding answers as the ministry has sought to suppress information about what happened to the ship or its estimated 510-strong crew. The total number of dead, wounded and missing remains a state secret. A number of families have gone public saying they cannot find their sons who were serving onboard. There are no plans for US President Joe Biden to visit the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a briefing on Monday. \u201cThere\u2019s no plans for the president to go. Let me just reiterate that,\u201d she told reporters. The White House has said it wants to send a high-ranking official instead, perhaps secretary of state Antony Blinken or defence secretary Lloyd Austin. There have been 136 attacks on healthcare facilities in Ukraine since the start of the invasion, according to the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who cited numbers from World Health Organization in a news conference held Monday. Ukraine is hoping to receive candidate country status to join the European Union within weeks, Zelenskiy said. The European Union\u2019s ambassador in Ukraine, Matti Maasikas, said he received a completed questionnaire from Zelenskiy just 10 days after the document was provided to Kyiv. \u201cExtraordinary times take extraordinary steps and extraordinary speed,\u201d he tweeted. Russia\u2019s invasion has damaged up to 30% of Ukraine\u2019s infrastructure, costing the country up to $100bn, reports Reuters. As usual, please feel free to reach out to me by email or Twitter for any tips or feedback. New photos and a video of the damaged Russian cruiser Moskva appear to show that it was probably struck by anti-ship missiles and then abandoned before the ship sank in the Black Sea. In the images, which analysts have said appear to be genuine, a plume of black smoke is seen rising from a heavily damaged Moskva, which was reported to have been hit by a Ukrainian missile strike last week. Watch the footage of the alleged attack below. There are now 76 Russian battalion tactical groups in the Donbas region of Ukraine and in the country\u2019s southeast with 11 of those added over the last several days, a senior US defence department official has said. So-called BTGs are typically composed of combined-arms elements, such as air defence, armour, tactical vehicles, artillery, helicopters, engineering and logistical support. Besides the 76 BTGs, there are about 22 BTGs north of Ukraine that are likely being resupplied and refitted, the official said in a statement released on Monday night. About a dozen of those inside Ukraine are trying to take Mariupol, an important port on the Sea of Azov, the official added. \u201cOur assessment is Mariupol is still contested,\u201d the official said. The city remains under threat from heavy Russian air strikes and artillery. There are a substantial number of Russian ground forces in and around Mariupol, the official said. Should Mariupol fall to the Russians, that would free the dozen or so BTGs to be used elsewhere in the east or south of Ukraine, the official said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big if because the Ukrainians are still fighting very, very hard for Mariupol.\u201d The Ukrainians have reported that they believe Russia is preparing to land Russian marines in the vicinity of Mariupol. \u201cWe can\u2019t confirm that independently, but we\u2019re certainly not in a position to dispute it,\u201d the official said. Further to the west of Mariupol is another important port city: Mykolayiv. Over the last several days, it has been subject to Russian bombardment from airstrikes and artillery, the official said. Just to the west of Mykolayiv is the port city of Odesa, which is also important. \u201cWe still assess that the Russian navy is maintaining a standoff distance from Odesa, not getting very close in the wake of the Moskva sinking,\u201d the official said. We have a little more detail on the 1,000 civilians reportedly hiding in underground shelters beneath a steel plant in Mariupol. According to Mariupol\u2019s city council, no fewer than 1,000 civilians are hiding in shelters underneath the Azovstal steel plant. Mostly the (civilians) are women with children and old people,\u201d the city council wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Mariupol officials added that Russian forces have continued shelling the steel plant, despite civilians taking cover underneath. Street battles have been taking place in Mariupol over the past week as Russian forces seek to take full control of the city from Ukraine. The first shipments of a new US military aid package have arrived at Ukraine\u2019s borders, a senior Pentagon official confirmed on Monday. Last week, the United States unveiled a $800-million tranche of equipment for Ukraine, including helicopters, howitzers and armoured personnel carriers. \u201cThere have been four flights from the United States arriving into the theatre just yesterday,\u201d a senior Pentagon official said Monday, Agence France-Press reports. A fifth flight is due shortly. The package includes 18 155mm howitzers for the first time, as well as 40,000 artillery rounds, 200 M113 armoured personnel carriers, 11 Mi-17 helicopters and 100 armoured multi-purpose vehicles. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the first shipment had arrived 48 hours after President Joe Biden authorised the aid delivery, an \u201cunprecedented speed.\u201d Kirby also said that soldiers deployed on the eastern flank of Nato territory since the start of Moscow\u2019s invasion will begin \u201cin the next several days\u201d to train Ukrainian soldiers to handle the howitzers, which are the latest generation of that weapon. The training will be done outside Ukraine, Kirby stressed. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a small number of Ukrainians that will be trained on the howitzers, and then they\u2019ll be reintroduced back into their country to train their colleagues.\u201d Although the way the US howitzers are handled is not fundamentally different from the ones with which the Ukrainian army is familiar, the ones Washington has sent use 155-millimetre shells - common in Nato countries - while Ukraine still uses Russian-made 152-millimetre shells. Many modern armaments use electronic chips whose main producers are Taiwan and South Korea, two US allies that have stopped exporting products to Russia in line with American sanctions. \u201cThere has been an effect on Putin\u2019s ability to restock and resupply, particularly in the realm of components to some of his systems and his precision-guided munitions,\u201d the anonymous US official said. Russia has formally complained to the United States over its military aid to Ukraine, warning of \u201cunpredictable consequences\u201d if shipments of advanced weaponry go forward. That\u2019s all from me today but our coverage will now continue with Samantha Lock. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened over the last few hours: The \u201csecond phase of the war has started\u201d, according to Andriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s chief of staff, who echoed comments from other officials that Russia had launched a long-prepared-for offensive in eastern Ukraine. Vowing to continue to fight, President Zelenskiy confirmed in a video address that Russian forces had concentrated their efforts and the battle had begun for Donbas. US defense officials also told reporters that it appeared Russia had learned from its failures in the early days of the invasion. Despite urging from Zelenskiy, Joe Biden has made no plans to visit Ukraine, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, adding that details would not be provided if that decision changed, for security reasons. As fighting in besieged Mariupol intensified and Russia bombed the Azovstal plant where hundreds of civilians \u2013 including children \u2013 are hiding, Pentagon spokesperson Admi John Kirby said it was not a given that the city would fall. Capture of the city is considered key for the Russians to complete a land bridge and as a tactical center in the fight for the Donbas region. A Kharkiv restaurant affiliated with World Central Kitchen, a charity tied to the celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, has been hit by a Russian missile, according to the organization\u2019s CEO, Nate Mook, who shared video footage of the devastation on Twitter last Saturday. The day before, he said, workers were serving meals to families as they fled. Four workers were wounded in the attack and have been hospitalized. Another person not affiliated with the restaurant was also killed in the strike, he said, adding: \u201cJust a tremendous amount of carnage left behind for no reason.\u201d This is the first war zone WCK has operated from and, the Washington Post reports, it was the first time in the organization\u2019s 12-year history that one of its relief kitchens had been attacked. Mook told the Washington Post that one worker, a woman named Yulia, suffered what he believed were third-degree burns. She remains hospitalized along with three others who are expected to be released in the coming days. All, he said, were in good spirits. Three other women are expected to be released in the coming days. Mook called the scene \u201cabsolutely horrific brutality\u201d but later shared that workers were already relocating usable supplies and equipment in the hopes to begin serving again by Tuesday. \u201cThis is the reality for so many right now in Kharkiv,\u201d he said in a tweet showing the damaged restaurant and city street. \u201cComing to work, cooking for people that are hungry is an immense act of bravery.\u201d During an interview on CNN, the Pentagon spokesperson Adm John Kirby said it was difficult to know how long Ukraine could hold off Russian forces in besieged Mariupol. \u201cThe Ukrainians continue to fight for Mariupol. It is an important city for them economically, culturally, and they are still in the city fighting for it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut of course the Russians have done a lot to devastate that city.\u201d Kirby added, though, that he did not think it was a given that the city would fall, even though Russia has military superiority from the air and from the ground. \u201cThe Ukrainians have held on to Mariupol now for a long time \u2013 longer than a lot of people thought,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we have learned nothing out of the last 55 days of warfare in Ukraine, it is that nothing is inevitable.\u201d For weeks, Ukrainian soldiers have been defending the city from the tunnels under the Azovstal plant, where hundreds of civilians \u2013 including children \u2013 are also hiding. The Guardian\u2019s Luke Harding, who is on the ground in Kyiv, reports that the city is important to the Russian military strategy. The capture of Mariupol, where Ukraine estimates 21,000 people have been killed, is seen as key, and not just because it would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and complete a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, seized by Moscow eight years ago. The US defence official said that if Russian forces succeed in taking full control of Mariupol, that could free up nearly a dozen battalion tactical groups for use elsewhere in the Donbas. Kirby also said that control of Mariupol would give Russia an \u201canchor on the southern part of the Donbas region\u201d. That would enable them to apply more pressure on Ukrainian forces. Russia has adjusted its tactics in its new offensive in eastern Ukraine and, according to a US senior defense official who joined reporters on a call on Monday, they have learned from their previous failures in the early days of the invasion. \u201cWhat we have seen over the last few days is them continue to try to set the conditions,\u201d the senior defense official told reporters. \u201cWe call it shaping operations.\u201d Russia has moved 11 new battalion tactical groups into the east and south of Ukraine in recent days, preparing heavy artillery, aviation, and other military assets, and directed more troops into the region. Moscow withdrew forces from the north and brought forces in from areas near the Kyiv and in Belarus to focus on the eastern front. The Russian military is now concentrated on taking control of Donbas, Reuters reported: Russia\u2019s reinforcements have set the stage for a protracted battle that military analysts say is certain to inflict heavy losses on both sides as the Russians try to encircle Ukraine\u2019s fighters dug in to defend the Donbas region. Despite urging from Zelenskiy, Joe Biden has made no plans to visit Ukraine, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. \u201cWhat our focus continues to be on is providing Ukraine, the Ukrainian government, Ukrainian leaders \u2013 a historic amount of security assistance,\u201d Psaki told CNN. Psaki added that if these plans changed, the public would not be made aware, for security reasons. \u201cWe would not outline from here or anywhere from the government, who, if, and when,\u201d she said, \u201cso we wouldn\u2019t have any details to preview regardless.\u201d Biden has said previously that he wanted to go and that discussions are ongoing. It\u2019s also possible that another US official will be sent instead. Biden also announced last week that the US would expand aid by $800m in military assistance and provide heavy artillery. There have been 136 attacks on healthcare facilities in Ukraine since the start of the invasion, according to the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who cited numbers from World Health Organization in a news conference held Monday. At least 73 people have lost their lives during these attacks with an additional 52 people reported injured, CNN reported. International health organizations have pushed Russia to end its attacks on hospitals and raised alarm about the destruction of essential health infrastructure that\u2019s forced civilians to go without needed services. Last month, the WHO, Unicef and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) released a joint statement calling the attacks \u201chorrific\u201d both for killing and injuring patients and healthcare workers and depriving others of essential care. \u201cTo attack the most vulnerable \u2013 babies, children, pregnant women, and those already suffering from illness and disease, and health workers risking their own lives to save lives \u2013 is an act of unconscionable cruelty,\u201d they said, calling for a ceasefire that would allow humanitarian assistance. Since the release of that statement, there have been more than 100 more attacks on hospitals. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said a \u201csignificant part\u201d of the Russian army was now focused on taking control of eastern Ukraine. In a video address where he vowed to continue the fight despite the escalation, he said Russian troops had begun the battle for Donbas, \u201cfor which they have been preparing for a long time\u201d. \u201cNow we can already state that the Russian troops have begun the battle for the Donbas, for which they have been preparing for a long time,\u201d he said in a video address. Zelenskiy said a \u201csignificant part of the entire Russian army is now concentrated on this offensive\u201d. He added: \u201cNo matter how many soldiers are driven there, we will defend ourselves. We will fight. We will not give up anything Ukrainian.\u201d Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of the press service of the national security and defense council of Ukraine, reported earlier that \u201can active phase of the Russian offensive began almost along the entire frontline\u201d referring to the Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kharkiv regions, adding: \u201cThe occupiers tried to break through our defenses.\u201d The Ukraine military\u2019s general staff also announced today that Russia has launched its attack in eastern Ukraine. From the Kyiv Independent: General Staff reports beginning of Russia\u2019s offensive in the east. Russian forces stepped up offensive and assault operations in several directions in the east of Ukraine. Russia continues to form additional military units in occupied Crimea and in the bordering Rostov Oblast. Ukraine\u2019s presidential chief of staff said today that \u201cthe second phase of the war has started,\u201d in reference to Russia\u2019s new assault launched in eastern Ukraine, reports Reuters. Chief of staff Andriy Yermak\u2019s comments are in line with remarks from Ukraine\u2019s top security official, who said earlier today that Russia had launched its new offensive in eastern Ukraine. \u201cBelieve in our army, it is very strong,\u201d wrote Yermak on the Telegram messaging app to assure Ukrainians that Ukraine\u2019s forces could hold off the offensive. Russian shelling in Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region killed four people, reported Reuters. Russian shelling in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region killed four people on Monday, regional governor Pavlo Kirilenko said on his Telegram channel. Russia has intensified attacks on several Ukrainian cities, but says it is concentrating its efforts on securing full control over eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region - made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. An air raid has been declared in almost every region in Ukraine, reports Nexta. From Nexta via Twitter: A Ukrainian man was able to track the movement of Russian troops via a pair of Apple AirPods that were stolen from his home, reports the Times. A Ukrainian man has been able to track the redeployment of Russian troops to the east of the country via a pair of wireless earbuds looted from his home near Kyiv. Vitaliy Semenets used the \u201cFind my\u201d feature available on Apple products to follow the progress of the stolen Airpod via Bluetooth technology. The Airpods were taken from Hostomel, 17 miles from Kyiv, towards the beginning of the invasion when Russian forces were attempting to capture the capital. As Russian troops beat a hasty retreat from Kyiv this month, Semenets traced the devices as they crossed the border into Belarus, eventually ending up near the city of Gomel. Last week the AirPods had reached Belgorod, a city in Russia where President Putin is massing his troops for an assault on the Donbas. Read the full article here . Ukraine is hoping to receive candidate country status to join the European Union within weeks, said Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy today, reports AFP. During a meeting in Kyiv with the EU\u2019s envoy to Ukraine, Matti Maasikas, Zelenskiy said: We believe that we will receive support for this work, become a candidate for admission, and then the next, final stage will begin... We really believe that this procedure will take place in the coming weeks,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cour people \u2026 mentally have been in Europe for a long time. Zelenskiy also handed in two volumes in response to a membership questionnaire brought by European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen during her visit to Ukraine this month. Ukrainian authorities said on Monday that Russian missile attacks had killed seven people in Lviv \u2013 the first civilian victims in the western city, just 40 miles from the Polish border \u2013 and that at least two people had died in shelling in the eastern city of Kharkiv. Russia\u2019s defence ministry has said it had hit hundreds of military targets across Ukraine overnight. Analysts have said the shelling was designed to undermine the will of the Ukrainian people and weaken defences before a significant military push by Russia to conquer the eastern Donbas region. Watch a video report from the Guardian here. New developments have emerged on the sinking of the Russian ship Moskva. According to Foreign Policy\u2019s Jack Detsch, a senior US defence official provided updates on the situation, confirming that some Russian sailors did survive the ship\u2019s sinking. The senior US official also said that Russia has made no efforts to recover the sunken ship. No nuclear weapons were on the Moskva when it sank, added the senior US official. Russia\u2019s invasion has damaged up to 30% of Ukraine\u2019s infrastructure, costing the country up to $100bn, reports Reuters. While officials have not outlined the financial impact that Russia\u2019s war has had, costs have been estimated to about $500bn so far, including damage to roads, homes, and other buildings. Officials also estimate that 300 bridges on national roads have been destroyed or damaged due to the invasion. \u201cPractically all components of our transport infrastructure have suffered in one form or another,\u201d said Ukraine\u2019s infrastructure minister, Oleksander Kubrakov, to Reuters today. Kubrakov added that the invasion has affected \u201c20% to 30% of all infrastructure with varying degrees of damage, with different levels of destruction\u201d. At least 1,000 civilians are hiding in underground shelters beneath a steel plant in the besieged city of Mariupol, reports Reuters. According to Mariupol\u2019s city council, no fewer than 1,000 civilians are hiding in shelters underneath the Azovstal steel plant. Mariupol officials added that Russian forces have continued shelling the steel plant, despite civilians taking cover underneath. French president Emmanuel Macron said today that he has not spoken to Russian president Vladimir Putin since the discovery of mass killings carried out by Russian forces, reported Reuters. Macron was previously in ongoing talks with Putin about Russia withdrawing their forces from Ukraine, and was viewed as a mediator between Russia and the wants of western countries. The Ukrainian armed forces general staff have said in an update on Facebook that Russia\u2019s offensive in eastern Ukraine appears to have started. Military analysts say Russia is increasing its strikes on weapons factories, railways and other infrastructure targets across Ukraine to wear down the country\u2019s ability to resist a major offensive in the Donbas, whose capture has become the Kremlin\u2019s main goal since its attempt to storm Kyiv failed. The Russian military has said its missiles struck more than 20 military targets in eastern and central Ukraine in the past day, including ammunition depots, command headquarters and groups of troops and vehicles. The mayor of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol said that about 40,000 civilians had been forcibly moved to Russia or Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine. \u201cUnfortunately, I have to declare that as of today they are forcibly deporting\u201d residents, Vadym Boichenko told Ukrainian television. \u201cWe have verified through the municipal register that they have already deported over 40,000 people.\u201d In Britain, a \u201cwar cabinet\u201d could be established \u2013 in place of a leadership contest to avoid detracting attention from the conflict in Ukraine \u2013 if Boris Johnson steps down or is deposed as prime minister, a senior Tory and critic of the British leader has suggested. Sir Roger Gale said the \u201cinterim administration\u201d could be led by the deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, who briefly took the reins in 2020 when Johnson was hospitalised with Covid-19. The veteran Conservative MP previously submitted a letter of no confidence in Johnson, which remains \u201con the table\u201d, but has since said it is not the right time for a leadership election, given the situation in Ukraine. Johnson has been facing renewed questions about his leadership after he was fined this month following a police investigation which found that he and others had breached Covid-19 regulations during a gathering at Downing Street. Ukrainian forces have used cluster munitions \u2013 a type of internationally banned weapon which has been repeatedly used by the Russian military since it invaded Ukraine in February \u2013 an investigation by the New York Times has suggested. It reported that there were not deaths as a result of the strike in Husarivka, an agricultural hamlet in eastern Ukraine where the munitions were believed to have been used, though at least two people were killed as Ukrainian forces shelled it in a bid to dislodge Russian forces. An adviser to the Ukrainian armed forces and its ministry of defence declined to comment. Ukrainian investigators have examined 269 dead bodies in Irpin, near Kyiv, since the town was taken back from Russian forces in late March, a police official told reporters, as workers dug fresh graves on its outskirts. The town, which had a pre-war population of about 62,000, was one of the main hotspots of fighting with Russian troops before they pulled back from Ukraine\u2019s northern regions to intensify their offensive in the east. At a cemetery on the outskirts of Irpin, dozens of new graves have been dug and heaped with wreaths. \u201cAs of now, we have inspected 269 dead bodies,\u201d said Serhiy Panteleyev, first deputy head of the police\u2019s main investigation department, at an online briefing which was covered by Reuters. He said forensic work was ongoing to determine the cause of death for many of the victims, sharing photos of severely charred human remains. He said seven sites in Irpin where civilians were allegedly shot have been inspected, without giving further details. Russia denies targeting civilians and has dismissed allegations its troops committed war crimes in occupied areas of Ukraine. Marina Ovsyannikova, the Russian TV editor who interrupted a news broadcast to protest against the Ukraine war, has written a piece for the German newspaper Die Welt in which she says how footage from the Ukrainian town of Bucha changed her mind on the use of sanctions against Russia. Writing that she would do everything that she could to destroy the propaganda \u201cmachine\u201d that she had been part of, she added: Before the footage emerged of Russian war crimes against Ukrainian citizens in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, I said sanctions should only be imposed on Putin and his family, and that ordinary Russian citizens should not be made to suffer under them. Since Bucha, I see it differently. I believe there have to be tough sanctions. That all Russians bear the collective guilt. Every one of us. Like the Germans after their crimes in World War II, we are going to have to spend decades begging for forgiveness for what we have done. Ovsyannikova, who describes herself as \u201ca patriot\u201d, was fined 30,000 roubles (\u00a3280) by a court in Moscow in March for the \u201cspontaneous\u201d act of rebellion in which she appeared during the live newscast with a sign saying \u201cNo War\u201d. Russia has unleashed a barrage of long-range missiles against Ukraine, in what analysts described as a \u201csoftening up\u201d exercise before a major military push by Moscow to conquer the eastern Donbas region. Four Russian rockets smashed into the western city of Lviv on Monday, killing seven people and injuring at least 11. Three hit military infrastructure. But the fourth appeared to have missed its target and landed in a car repair workshop. The mayor of Lviv accused the Kremlin of genocide after the attack and said there were no longer any \u201csafe\u201d or \u201cunsafe\u201d areas left in Ukraine. Family members of sailors who served onboard the Russian warship Moskva are demanding answers as the ministry has sought to suppress information about what happened to the ship or its estimated 510-strong crew. The total number of dead, wounded and missing remains a state secret. A number of families have gone public saying they cannot find their sons who were serving onboard. Two British fighters captured in Ukraine by Russian forces have been paraded on Russian state TV asking Boris Johnson to help free them, in a dramatic escalation of the propaganda war. Footage showed Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin calling on the British prime minister to help free them in exchange for Ukraine releasing the pro-Kremlin politician Viktor Medvedchuk. Ukraine has vowed that its forces will \u201cfight to the end\u201d in the besieged port city of Mariupol, after a Russian ultimatum for the remaining Ukrainian troops there to surrender expired. As many as 100,000 people remain in the city, its mayor said on Monday. Residents of the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine have been urged to evacuate immediately. The head of the region\u2019s military administration, Sergei Gaidai, maintained that the \u201cdecision is yours\u201d but warned the cemetery was \u201cgetting bigger by the day\u201d in a statement late on Sunday. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for more weapons, describing \u201cevery delay\u201d as \u201cpermission for Russia to take the lives of Ukrainians\u201d. In his latest address, he appealed to countries to send arms, saying Ukraine\u2019s fate \u201cdepends upon them\u201d. Russia\u2019s expected major offensive in the east of Ukraine may be beginning, according to Ukrainian authorities. Reuters reports that Ukraine\u2019s armed forces command says Russia is intensifying action in parts of the areas of Kharkov and Donetsk. In a pointed action on the part of the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin has promoted a brigade of Russian troops who were among those reported to have been operating in Bucha, the Ukrainian town where hundreds of civilians were killed and buried in mass graves or left in the streets. The Guardian\u2019s Moscow correspondent tweets: Bucha has become one of the initial focal points for investigations into war crimes committed by Russian forces. French forensic science experts arrived in the town, near Kyiv, last week to help Ukrainian authorities establish what happened, while the International Criminal Court\u2019s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, deemed Ukraine \u201ca crime scene\u201d when he visited Bucha. A monument to Lenin appears to have been restored in the port city of Henichesk, near Kherson, which is occupied by Russian troops. The statue was cut off just above the knees a few years ago. It is not clear who restored the statue, though a Belarusian opposition activist suggests it was the work of occupying Russian troops. The Guardian\u2019s Luke Harding observes that it is a curious move given that, in an essay last summer, Vladimir Putin blamed Lenin for creating Ukraine. Family members of the crew of the Moskva, the Russian warship which went down off the coast of Ukraine, have been demanding answers about the fate of their sons, many of whom were conscripts. One mother, Yulia Tsyvova, only found out this morning that her son died, reports the Guardian\u2019s Pjotr Sauer. She had been desperately searching for information about her son Andrei and, like hundreds of other Russian families of the crew members, she had not been told whether he had survived the reported Ukrainian missile attack that had sunk the Russian flagship of the Black Sea fleet. On Monday morning, she received a call from the Russian defence ministry who told her that her son was dead \u201cHe was only 19, he was a conscript,\u201d said Tsyvova, who wept as she spoke by phone. They didn\u2019t tell me anything else, no information on when the funeral would be.\u201d More countries are expected to announce contributions to help war-torn Ukraine maintain its government through the World Bank\u2019s multi-donor trust fund and parallel funds this week, according to the World Bank president, David Malpass. Malpass said the World Bank was working during spring meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to put together a $3bn package of aid to help Ukraine maintain essential government services. The situation was \u201crapidly evolving\u201d, he said, and predicted more bilateral announcements on humanitarian assistance and other aid this week. Malpass said the bank had quickly disbursed about $600m of an initial $1bn in aid promised for Ukraine, and was working to raise a further $1.5bn in bank funds that still needed to be approved by its board. \u201cThere will be other components making up the $3bn that we originally announced six weeks ago or so,\u201d Malpass said. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said that he expects \u201csecurity support\u201d for Ukraine to increase from the European Union. The \u201cprice of aggression\u201d for Russia needed to be raised, he said in a tweet following his latest talks with the president of Lithuania, one of Ukraine\u2019s strongest supporters in the EU. Russian authorities have flagged a likely further cut in interest rates and more budget spending to help the economy adapt to biting western sanctions as it heads for its deepest contraction since 1994. Russia faces soaring inflation and capital flight while grappling with a possible debt default after the west imposed unprecedented sanctions to punish President Vladimir Putin for sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on 24 February. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, said earlier in the day that Russia should use its state budget to support the economy and liquidity when lending activity has waned. The World Bank expects the economy to shrink by more than 11% this year. Reuters reported that the central bank more than doubled its key interest rate to 20% on 28 February as the first wave of sanctions hit, before trimming it to 17% on 8 April. It is expected to lower it further at the next board meeting on 29 April. \u201cWe must have the possibility to lower the key rate faster,\u201d central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said. Britain\u2019s Prince Harry has said it is \u201cextraordinary\u201d to have a team from Ukraine at the Invictus Games, the sporting event he was involved in founding. The prince said it is \u201cemotional\u201d to think about their journey to The Hague in the Netherlands for the event, taking place this week, in which wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women compete. The duke was speaking during an interview that will be broadcast on the BBC on Monday evening. In the clip posted online by the broadcaster, Harry told presenter Alex Jones: \u201cThe whole world is definitely behind them. But again, is that enough, you know? \u201cBecause when you get to see them and speak to them, and see in their eyes, the experiences and the things that they\u2019ve seen just in the last few weeks, it\u2019s really hard.\u201d Team Ukraine is made up of 19 competitors and they have been cheered and applauded by other nations since people started arriving at the Zuiderpark last Friday. Speaking about their journey to the games, Harry said: \u201cIt\u2019s emotional to think that they all jumped in the bus, firstly they have to make the decision to come, which was hard enough anyway, then they jumped on the coach, probably slept all the way.\u201d \u201cAnd I think what people need to remember, or perhaps don\u2019t even know yet, is a vast majority of the Ukraine team were serving in some shape or form. The governor of the Lviv region, Maksym Kozytskyy, said the Russian missile strikes today hit three military infrastructure facilities and an auto mechanic shop. He said the wounded included a child, and emergency teams battled fires caused by the attack. At least seven people were reported killed. A hotel sheltering Ukrainians who had fled fighting in other parts of the country was among the buildings badly damaged, Lviv mayor Andriy Sadovyi said. Associated Press reporters spoke to Lyudmila Turchak, 47, who had fled to Lvivi with two children from the eastern city of Kharkiv. \u201cThe nightmare of war has caught up with us even in Lviv. There is no longer anywhere in Ukraine where we can feel safe.\u201d A powerful explosion was also reported to have rocked Vasylkiv, a town south of the capital of Kyiv that is home to a military airbase, according to residents. It was not immediately clear what was hit. Ukraine\u2019s government has halted civilian evacuations for a second day, saying that Russian forces were shelling and blocking the humanitarian corridors. Associated Press quotes deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk saying Ukraine had been negotiating passage from cities and towns in eastern and southeastern Ukraine, including Mariupol and other areas in the Donbas. The government of the Luhansk region in the Donbas said four civilians trying to flee were shot and killed by Russian forces. Vereshchuk said Russia could be prosecuted for war crimes over its refusal to allow civilians to leave Mariupol. \u201cYour refusal to open these humanitarian corridors will in the future be a reason to prosecute all involved for war crimes,\u201d she wrote on social media. The Russians, in turn, accused \u201cneo-Nazi nationalists\u201d in Mariupol of hampering the evacuation. Here are some of the latest images we have been sent over the newswires from Lviv and Kharkiv, both of which have been the target of missile attacks today. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, which is under Russian control, has given an interview in Rome a month after his release. He told Reuters and the Italian newspaper Il Messaggero that he had faced \u201cpsychological\u201d but not physical torture when he was captured by Russian forces. He said he had appealed for help to stop the war when he met Pope Francis and Vatican secretary of state Cardinal Pietro Parolin on Saturday before attending an Easter eve service. Of his capture and release, he said: \u201cIt was a dangerous six days because I understood that for Russians my life and the lives of civilians were worth zero. They wanted to make an example of me about what would happen if we did not agree to what the Russians wanted. \u201cRussian soldiers assumed that they would be welcomed but they were not \u2026 and that is why the Russians were very, very angry.\u201d He said he was still in touch with people in Melitopol, where the situation was dire. \u201cThere is no food in my city. There is no pharmacy. Half of my city is wrecked. More than 200 people have been kidnapped. It is not safe to walk the streets,\u201d he said. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians. Fedorov said he had invited Pope Francis to visit Ukraine, and to intercede with Russian president Vladimir Putin to guarantee humanitarian corridors for Mariupol. The pope has been a vocal critic of the war in Ukraine, voicing implicit criticism of Russia. Addressing Fedorov and other Ukrainians in the Easter eve service at the weekend, the pope said: \u201cHave courage, we accompany you\u201d. A resurgent interest in stamp collecting is one of the unlikelier effects of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, but our Luke Harding has been in Kyiv today seeing for himself the huge queues of people trying to purchase a special commemorative stamp. It honours the Ukrainian soldier who told an officer on a Russian warship to \u201cgo fuck yourself\u201d at the start of the invasion. Roman Hrybov, the Ukrainian border guard who sent the message, has since been released as part of a prisoner exchange and awarded a medal for his services. A Russian orthodox priest was fined under Russia\u2019s new military censorship laws after he was denounced to the police by at least one member of his congregation in a central Russian village, the FT\u2019s Polina Ivanova reports. The case of Father Ioann Burdin \u2013 who began his first sermon since the outbreak of war with a promise to pray for the people of Ukraine \u2013 is nevertheless at odds with that of the Russian Orthodox Church\u2019s hierarchy, which has thrown its ideological weight behind the Kremlin\u2019s war. Fr Burdin told the FT that he was treated fairly by his superior, Metropolitan Ferapont, though the two disagreed about whom an Orthodox priest should serve. \u201cA priest cannot share and preach his personal views, because people expect from him the words of the Church,\u201d the archbishop is reported to have said. When it comes to speaking out against war, Fr Burdin disagreed. \u201cI serve God, after all,\u201d he said. The head of the Russian Orthodox church, Patriarch Kirill, a trusted ally of Vladimir Putin, has declined to condemn the Kremlin\u2019s decision to invade its neighbour, referring to Russia\u2019s opponents in Ukraine as \u201cevil forces\u201d. In a Sunday sermon in March, he also said gay pride parades organised in the west were part of the reason for the war in Ukraine. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, has said that western countries had scored an own goal by imposing sanctions against Russia over Ukraine that he said had led to a \u201cdeterioration of the economy in the west\u201d. Speaking on the state of Russia\u2019s domestic economy, Putin was reported by Reuters to have said that inflation was stabilising and that retail demand in the country had normalised. Russia\u2019s services sector has suffered the worst slump in activity since the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020 as consumers and businesses cancelled orders amid increasingly severe western sanctions after the invasion of Ukraine. A closely watched business survey showed earlier this month that new orders during March dived as restrictions on imports and exports began to bite and inflation raised the price of services at the fastest rate on record. Sergei Markov, a Moscow-based political commentator and former close adviser to the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has claimed on the BBC that the Russian warship, Moskva, sank after it was hit by a Nato missile that was moved to Ukraine in January. He admitted during an interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One programme that the loss of the ship was a failure on the part of the Russian military but that this was because Russia was fighting not only Ukraine but \u201ca coalition\u201d of big states including the US. The Russian defence ministry has released little information about how the ship sank, claiming the damage to the boat was sustained in an accident onboard. The Ukrainian government, along with western intelligence officials, say the ship was hit by several Ukrainian anti-ship missiles. The mayor of Lviv has accused the Kremlin of genocide after four Russian missiles smashed into the western Ukrainian city on Monday, killing seven people and injuring at least 11. Andriy Sadovyi said there were no longer any safe areas left in Ukraine. \u201cWhat we see today is genocide. It\u2019s a deliberate action by the aggressor to kill peaceful civilians,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cAll our cities and villages are in the same situation.\u201d Russia carried out a number of lethal long-range airstrikes early on Monday against what it claimed were military targets. The attacks came amid expectations of a major offensive by Moscow over the coming days in the east and the industrial Donbas region. Sadovyi said one of the rockets struck a Lviv garage and tyre repair workshop, killing four people. Others were injured including a child, with two adults critically hurt. Nearby windows were blown out including in a school, he said. Read more here. Military analysts consulted by the Guardian say images purporting to show the Russian cruiser Moskva shortly before the ship sank in the Black Sea looked consistent with the vessel but that the photographs would require independent confirmation. The source of photos and the video is unknown and it was first brought to public attention by open source intelligence researchers following the Russian war in Ukraine. In the images, a plume of black smoke is seen rising from the heavily damaged Moskva, which was reported to have been hit by a Ukrainian missile strike last week. The images show that the ship\u2019s lifeboats have been deployed and there are no sailors visible on deck, suggesting the ship may have been abandoned. In the images, the Moskva is listing to port as two fire-hoses shoot streams of water into the air. A three-second video filmed from a nearby ship appears to show a rescue tug approaching the burning Moskva. The short recording ends abruptly as a man nearby yells: \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d \u201cI believe the video is real. What we see shape, size. It is the Moskva,\u201d Y\u00f6r\u00fck I\u015f\u0131k, a journalist and expert ship spotter who photographs Russian warships travelling through the Bosphorus , told the Guardian. Read more here. An independent Russian news site, Mediazona, will not comply with censorship requirements, its editor Sergey Smirnov has said in a clip posted on Twitter by the outlet. Like many Russian-language news outlets, the outlet was blocked by the Russian internet watchdog in the early days of the war for not adhering to wartime censorship rules that ban any information that could \u201cdiscredit\u201d Russia\u2019s army. However, they would face fines and possibly prison if they were to take the courser of action announced, according to the FT\u2019s Moscow bureau chief, Max Seddon. Mediazona was founded by the activists and members of Pussy Riot, Nadya Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina, after their release from prison. The family of a former British Army soldier captured by Russian forces in the besieged city of Mariupol have called on his captors to treat him as a prisoner of war in accordance with international rules. In a statement released by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO), the family of Shaun Pinner explained how he became involved in the defence of Ukraine, which they said he considers \u201chis adopted country\u201d. The statement read: \u201cShaun was a well-respected soldier within the British Army serving in the Royal Anglian Regiment for many years. He served in many tours including Northern Ireland and with the United Nations in Bosnia.\u201d Pinner, 48, was paraded on Russian television at the weekend and said he had been fighting alongside Ukrainian marines when Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces invaded nearly eight weeks ago. Pinner, who appeared tired in the video, said he had been fighting in the besieged city for five to six weeks but was now in the breakaway region of Donetsk. The statement released by his family added: \u201cIn 2018 Shaun decided to relocate to Ukraine to use his previous experience and training within the Ukraine military.\u201d \u201cShaun enjoyed the Ukrainian way of life and considered Ukraine as his adopted country over the last four years. During this time, he met his Ukrainian wife, who is very focused on the humanitarian needs of the country. \u201cHe progressed into the Ukrainian Marines as a proud member of his unit.\u201d The statement continued: \u201cWe would like to make it clear he is not a volunteer nor a mercenary, but officially serving with the Ukrainian Army in accordance with Ukrainian legislation. It added that the family was working with the British government along with the family of Aiden Aslin \u2013 another Briton who was fighting with the Ukrainian army and who was paraded on Russian media after surrendering to the Russian military last week \u2013 to ensure their rights as prisoners of war are upheld according to the Geneva conventions. They described Pinner as \u201cfunny, much-loved, well-intentioned\u201d and said they hoped for a quick resolution to allow the captured men to return to their families. \u201cOur hearts go out to all those caught up in this horrific conflict,\u201d the statement concluded. Two British fighters captured in Ukraine by Russian forces have appeared on Russian state TV and asked to be exchanged for a pro-Russian politician who is being held by the Ukrainian authorities. It was unclear how freely the two men \u2013 Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin \u2013 were able to talk. Both spoke after being prompted by an unidentified man, Reuters reports. Both asked the UK\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, to help bring them home in exchange for Ukraine releasing Viktor Medvedchuk, the oligarch and opposition politician who was arrested last week. The Kremlin last week turned down Ukraine\u2019s offer of a prisoner exchange for Medvedchuk, Vladimir Putin\u2019s closest ally in Ukraine, who was arrested on in what was described as a \u201clightning-fast and dangerous\u201d operation. Separately, Ukraine\u2019s security services is reported to have released a video of Medvedchuk asking for Putin to exchange him for Ukrainian forces in the besieged city of Mariupol. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last week suggested exchanging him for Ukrainian prisoners of war held by Russia. \u201cIf Medvedchuk himself chose a military uniform, he is subject to the laws of war. I\u2019m offering Russia to swap this guy of yours for our guys in Russian captivity. Therefore, it\u2019s important that our law enforcement agencies and the military also consider such a possibility,\u201d he said, after posting an image on Telegram of Medvedchuk. It\u2019s Ben Quinn here on the blog. You can flag up any breaking news developments that we should be aware of on email or by twitter at @BenQuinn75 Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has criticised Ukraine\u2019s approach to peace talks. In his regular briefing to the media, Reuters reports that he said: Contacts continue at an expert level within the framework of the negotiation process. Unfortunately the Ukrainian side is not consistent in terms of the points that have been agreed. It is often changing its position and the trend of the negotiating process leaves much to be desired. Peskov also said during the call that there was still time for so-called \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries to switch to payments for gas in roubles. He decline to specify how many countries had agreed to do so. At the end of March, Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a decree demanding foreign buyers pay for gas in the Russian currency or else have their supplies cut. At least seven people were killed and 11 wounded in missile strikes in different areas of the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, according to the regional governor. Images show smoke billowing across the city and firefighters tackling blazes. Overnight Russian forces claim to have attacked 315 Ukrainian targets across the country, destroying four arms and military equipment depots with Iskander missiles, and shooting down three planes and 11 drones. None of the claims have been independently verified. Ukraine and Russia have failed to agree about humanitarian convoys for the evacuation of civilians from war-affected areas for the second day. Ukraine has vowed that its forces will \u201cfight to the end\u201d in the besieged port city of Mariupol, after a Russian ultimatum for the remaining Ukrainian troops there to surrender expired. Russian troops said they will close the city for entry and exit on Monday and issue \u201cmovement passes\u201d to those who remain, according to an adviser to the mayor. Russian central bank governor Elvira Nabiullinasaid Russia plans to take legal action over the blocking of gold, forex and assets belonging to Russian residents. Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said 200,000 people risk losing their jobs in the Russian capital because foreign companies have suspended operations or decided to leave the Russian market. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for more weapons, describing \u201cevery delay\u201d as \u201cpermission for Russia to take the lives of Ukrainians\u201d. In his latest address, he appealed to countries to send arms, saying Ukraine\u2019s fate \u201cdepends upon them\u201d. Zelenskiy also claimed in the address that the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine\u2019s south were being transferred to \u201cthe rouble zone\u201d and subordinated to Russian administration. Zelenskiy maintained Ukraine is not willing to give up territory in the east in order to end the war with Russia and acknowledged that the battle could influence the entire course of the war. Zelenskiy said he has invited Emmanuel Macron to visit Ukraine to see for himself evidence that Russian forces have committed \u201cgenocide\u201d, a term the French president has avoided using. Ukraine has completed a questionnaire that will form a starting point for the European Union to decide on its membership. Unverified photos and a video clip claiming to show the Russian warship Moskva moments after it was reportedly hit by a Ukrainian Neptune missile have surfaced online. That is it from me, Martin Belam for now. I will be back later. In the meantime I am handing over to my colleague Ben Quinn. Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us of the scenes in Lviv this morning. City mayor Andriy Sadovy said five missiles struck the city in western Ukraine. At least six people were killed and eight wounded in missile strikes in different areas of the city, according to the governor. Russian forces claim to have attacked 315 Ukrainian targets across the country overnight, destroying four arms and military equipment depots with Iskander missiles, and shooting down three planes and 11 drones. None of the claims have been independently verified. Two brief pieces of financial news emerging from Russia at the moment, both related to the impact of sanctions applied to the country. Central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said Russia plans to take legal action over the blocking of gold, forex and assets belonging to Russian residents, adding that such a step would need to be painstakingly thought through and legally justified. Reuters reports foreign sanctions have frozen about $300bn of around $640bn that Russia had in its gold and foreign exchange reserves when it launched its latest invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. On the domestic front, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said about 200,000 people risk losing their jobs in the Russian capital because foreign companies have suspended operations or decided to leave the Russian market. Sobyanin wrote on his blog that Moscow authorities are ready to support people who lose their jobs by providing training and temporary and socially important work. Ukraine and Russia have failed to agree about humanitarian convoys for the evacuation of civilians from war-affected areas for the second day, Ukraine\u2019s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. Reuters reports Vereshchuk posted on the Telegram app that \u201cfor security reasons, it was decided not to open humanitarian corridors today\u201d. Earlier we had some unverified still images that purported to be of the Russian flagship Moskva, moments after a fire had started onboard [see 7.22am]. Alec Luhn, who has covered Russia in the past for us, has just shared a three-second video clip that appears to show that same ship in distress \u2013 listing to one side and with flames appearing visible inside and out. The footage has not been independently verified. Here are a couple of images of the smoke rising in Lviv from Russian missile strikes that have been sent over the newswires. Lviv is in the far west of Ukraine, near the border with Poland. The mayor of Lviv Andriy Sadovyi has given more details of this morning\u2019s Russian missile attack. He says one of the rockets hit a car repair workshop in the western city. Six people were killed in the latest strikes, with 11 injured, including a child, he tweeted. About 40 cars were damaged and destroyed, he added, posting a photo of the charred remains of one vehicle. The mayor said the shockwave shattered the windows of a nearby hotel. It was being used by Ukrainians evacuated from other areas. Six people were killed and eight wounded in missile strikes on the western Ukrainian city of Lviv this morning, regional governor Maksym Kozystkiy said. Reuters reports he said that three missiles hit military infrastructure facilities, while one struck a car tire replacement facility. The RIA News agency is carrying a series of claims from the Russian military. They say: Artillery hit 18 command posts in Ukraine overnight. Russian troops destroyed 16 Ukrainian military facilities. Russian air forces destroyed eight Ukrainian armoured vehicles and up to a company of manpower. Russian air defences shot down three Ukrainian planes and 11 drones. The Russian state news agency Tass is carrying a statement from the Russian defence ministry saying that Russian forces hit 315 Ukrainian targets in total overnight. They say it destroyed four arms and military equipment depots in Ukraine with Iskander missiles. None of the claims have been independently verified. Lesia Vasylenko, a lawyer and Ukrainian MP, has tweeted this unverified image of damage in Lviv. She says this was caused by Russian missiles that were targeting the railway station and storage units. This is Martin Belam taking over the blog for the next few hours. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Unconfirmed reports are filtering in that five missiles struck Lviv early this morning. \u201cFive aimed missile strikes on Lviv,\u201d the Lviv mayor, Andriy Sadovy, said in an update over his official Telegram account this morning, adding that authorities are seeking more detailed information. Ukraine has vowed that its forces will \u201cfight to the end\u201d in the besieged port city of Mariupol, after a Russian ultimatum for the remaining Ukrainian troops there to surrender expired. Russian troops said they will close the city for entry and exit on Monday and issue \u201cmovement passes\u201d to those who remain, according to an adviser to the mayor. Residents of the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine have been urged to evacuate immediately. The head of the regions military administration, Sergei Gaidai, maintained that the \u201cdecision is yours\u201d but warned the cemetery was \u201cgetting bigger by the day\u201d in a statement late on Sunday. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for more weapons, describing \u201cevery delay\u201d as \u201cpermission for Russia to take the lives of Ukrainians\u201d. In his latest address, he appealed to countries to send arms, saying Ukraine\u2019s fate \u201cdepends upon them\u201d. Zelenskiy also claimed in the address that the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine\u2019s south were being transferred to \u201cthe rouble zone\u201d and subordinated to Russian administration. The Ukrainian president said Russia\u2019s actions in the territories were following the example of the self-proclaimed republics of the DPR and LPR. Ukraine has completed a questionnaire that will form a starting point for the European Union to decide on its membership. \u201cToday, I can say that the document has been completed by the Ukrainian side,\u201d Ihor Zhovkva, deputy head of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s office, told the Ukrainian public broadcaster on Sunday evening. \u201cWe expect the recommendation \u2026 to be positive, and then the ball will be on the side of the EU member states.\u201d A second British soldier fighting with the Ukrainian army was paraded on Russian television after being captured in Mariupol. Shaun Pinner, 48, said he had been fighting alongside Ukrainian marines when Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces invaded nearly eight weeks ago. A fresh series of Russian airstrikes came as a reminder this weekend that the war in the Ukrainian capital is far from over, despite signs of more normal life returning to the streets in recent days. An unverified photo claiming to show the Russian warship Moskva moments after it was reportedly hit by a Ukrainian Neptune missile has surfaced online. The source of the image is unclear and the Guardian has not been able to immediately verify its authenticity. Zelenskiy said he has invited French president Emmanuel Macron to visit Ukraine to see for himself evidence that Russian forces have committed \u201cgenocide\u201d, a term Macron has avoided using. Earlier on Sunday, Zelenskiy urged US president Joe Biden to visit Ukraine and reiterated that he is not willing to cede territory in the country\u2019s east to end war with Russia. Zelenskiy said he was \u201chopeful\u201d Biden would make the trip. The president of the European Commission has urged member states to supply Ukraine with weapons systems \u201cquickly\u201d and suggested that a next round of EU sanctions could target Russia\u2019s powerful Sberbank. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said she had a \u201cvery good call\u201d with Ukraine\u2019s president. She added: \u201cContinued economic support by Ukraine\u2019s partners is essential to lay the foundations for rebuilding a modern competitive Ukraine.\u201d The United Nations refugee agency said 4,869,019 Ukrainians had left the country since Russia invaded in February \u2013 up 32,574 from Saturday\u2019s total, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees\u2019 chief, Filippo Grandi, said on Sunday. Oleg Synegubov, the head of the Kharkiv regional administration, said Ukrainian forces were successfully pushing the Russians back to the east of the city and that several villages were liberated. At least two people were killed and four injured on Sunday in the shelling of the eastern Ukrainian town of Zolote, the local governor said. Zelenskiy maintained Ukraine is not willing to give up territory in the east in order to end the war with Russia and acknowledged that the battle could influence the entire course of the war. That\u2019s all from me, Samantha Lock, for today. I will now pass you over to my colleague, Martin Belam. More details are emerging from Lviv this morning. CNN correspondent Jim Sciutto shared a photo purporting to show smoke rising on the city skyline. \u201cFive missile strikes on Lviv this morning. Smoke visible rising above the city,\u201d he tweeted. Fox reporter James Levinson added: \u201cBlack smoke seen from train station 4 reported missile strikes at Lviv train station no reports of casualties or damage yet. Can hear air raid sirens and ambulance in background.\u201d Lviv\u2019s head of regional military administration, Maksym Kozytsky, has urged residents to seek shelter amid reports of missile strikes in the region. \u201cThe air alarm continues. Stay in the shelters,\u201d Kozytsky said in a Telegram post around 8.30am this morning. An unverified photo claiming to show the Russian warship Moskva moments after it was reportedly hit by a Ukrainian Neptune missile has surfaced online. The source of the image is unclear, and the Guardian has not been able to immediately verify its authenticity. The Guardian\u2019s Moscow correspondent, Andrew Roth, said he believes the unverified photo may be the first of the Moskva cruiser to emerge after it was reportedly struck by a missile. Rob Lee, a PhD student at the Department of War Studies at King\u2019s College London, tweeted: \u201cLooks like a legit photo of the Moskva after it was struck by Ukrainian Neptun[e] anti-ship missiles.\u201d OSINTtechnical, an account that shares open-source intelligence information, wrote: \u201cI can\u2019t verify the authenticity, but this is a Slava class cruiser and I don\u2019t think any of them have been destroyed in this manner.\u201d Five missiles have reportedly struck Lviv, according to the city\u2019s mayor. \u201c5 aimed missile strikes on Lviv,\u201d Andriy Sadovy said in an update over his official Telegram account this morning, adding that authorities are seeking more detailed information. Presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, added: \u201cFive powerful missile strikes on the civilian infrastructure of ancient European Lviv. The Russians continue to barbarically attack Ukrainian cities from the air, cynically declaring to the whole world their \u2018right\u2019 ... to kill Ukrainians.\u201d Russian forces are \u201ccompleting the creation of an offensive group\u201d in the east and have regained combat capability and replenished their reserves in the Donetsk and Tavriya regions, Ukraine\u2019s military has said. According to a recently released operational report from the general staff of the armed forces, on the Donetsk and Tavriya regions, Russian forces have regained combat capability and replenished their reserves while concentrating their main efforts in the areas of the settlements of Lyman, Kreminna, Popasna and Rubizhne, trying to establish full control over the city of Mariupol. It is also expected that Russian forces \u201cwill continue to fight to reach the administrative borders of the Kherson region,\u201d officials said. In the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Ukraine repulsed 12 Russian attacks, destroyed ten tanks, fifteen armoured units and five vehicles, as well as five enemy artillery systems, according to the report. The Ukrainian air force hit five air targets: one plane, three helicopters and one UAV, it added. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged US president Joe Biden to visit Ukraine. \u201cI think he will,\u201d Zelenskiy said when asked if he was aware of any plans for a US presidential visit during an extended interview with CNN broadcast on Sunday. \u201cBut it\u2019s his decision, of course, and [it] depends on the safety situation, of course. But I think he\u2019s the leader of the United States and that\u2019s why he should come here to see.\u201d Biden told reporters on Thursday that the US would decide soon whether to send a senior official to Ukraine as a show of support, but sources suggested to Reuters the administration was considering defence secretary Lloyd Austin or Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The Zelenskiy comments came after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a surprise visit to Kyiv last weekend. On Friday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki, said in an interview that Biden had no visit scheduled. In his nightly national address, Ukraine\u2019s President Zelenskiy called for more weapons, describing \u201cevery delay\u201d as \u201cpermission for Russia to take the lives of Ukrainians\u201d. We are doing everything to ensure defence. We are in constant contact with partners. We are grateful to those who really help with everything they can. But those who have the weapons and ammunition we need and delay their provision must know that the fate of this battle also depends on them. The fate of people who can be saved. The 53rd day of the war is over, and we have been waiting for answers to some points in our weapons inquiries for 53 days. And some answers are formulated so that delivery can begin only in May. I speak directly in such cases: every delay in weapons, every political delay is a permission for Russia to take the lives of Ukrainians. This is how Russia interprets it. That should not be the case in reality.\u201d In the wake of Russia\u2019s censorship of independent news media and the banning of social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, the messaging app Telegram has become the largest remaining outlet for unrestricted information, the New York Times reports. Since the war started, it has been the most downloaded app in Russia, with about 4.4m downloads, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower, the publication cited. \u201cThis is one of the few channels that are left where you can receive information,\u201d Russian journalist Farida Rustamova told the outlet. Ilya Shepelin, who used to cover the media for the now-shuttered independent TV channel Rain and has established a blog critical of the war, added: \u201cTelegram is the only place in Russia where people can exchange opinions and information freely, although the Kremlin has worked hard to infiltrate Telegram channels.\u201d Charred houses, cratered lawns and an epic clean-up. This is the scene described by Guardian correspondent, Luke Harding, reporting to us from Chernihiv, about 150km north-east of Kyiv. Russian forces advancing from Belarus bombarded the city during a traumatic 25-day siege. Several hundred people died. A couple of shells landed in front of Chernihiv\u2019s gold-domed St Catherine\u2019s church, one of an ensemble of ancient buildings dating back to Kyivan Rus, Ukraine\u2019s original medieval dynasty. Across swathes of territory vacated by Russia\u2019s armed forces a great clean-up is under way. Homeowners are now tidying up and counting the cost of a devastating month-long occupation. Ukrainian army sappers collected left-behind munitions and defused mines \u2013 a vast ongoing job. Read the full story below. Ukraine has completed a questionnaire which will form a starting point for the European Union to decide on its membership. \u201cToday, I can say that the document has been completed by the Ukrainian side,\u201d Ihor Zhovkva, deputy head of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s office, told the Ukrainian public broadcaster on Sunday evening. The European Commission will need to issue a recommendation on Ukraine\u2019s compliance with the necessary membership criteria, he added. \u201cWe expect the recommendation ... to be positive, and then the ball will be on the side of the EU member states.\u201d Zhovkva added that Ukraine expects to acquire the status of a candidate country for EU accession in June during a scheduled meeting of the European Council meeting. The European Council is to meet June 23-24th, according to the Council\u2019s schedule on its website. \u201cNext, we will need to start accession talks. And once we hold those talks, we can already talk about Ukraine\u2019s full membership in the EU,\u201d Zhovkva said. Ukraine has vowed that its forces will \u201cfight to the end\u201d in the besieged port city of Mariupol, after a Russian ultimatum for the remaining Ukrainian troops there to surrender expired. Moscow is edging closer to full control of the city in what would be its biggest prize since it invaded Ukraine in February. Relentless bombardment and street fighting have left much of the city pulverised, killing at least 21,000 people by Ukrainian estimates. \u201cThe city still has not fallen,\u201d the prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said hours after Moscow\u2019s deadline for fighters holed up and surrounded in a sprawling, fortress-like steelworks to surrender passed. \u201cThere\u2019s still our military forces, our soldiers. So they will fight to the end,\u201d he told ABC. The fall of Mariupol, the largest trading port in the Sea of Azov \u2013 from which Ukraine exports grain, iron, steel and heavy machinery \u2013 would be an economic blow to Kyiv and a symbolic and strategic victory for Russia, connecting territory it holds in Donbas with the Crimea region it annexed in 2014. The situation is \u201cvery difficult\u201d in Mariupol, Zelenskiy told the Ukrayinska Pravda news portal. \u201cOur soldiers are blocked; the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis \u2026 Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.\u201d Russia gave remaining Ukrainian soldiers a 6am Moscow time (3am GMT) deadline to lay down their arms and a 1pm (10am GMT) deadline to evacuate, which passed without any sign of compliance by Ukrainian fighters holed up in the smouldering Azovstal steelworks. Following the refusal of Ukrainian fighters to surrender the city of Mariupol, Russian troops will reportedly close the city for entry and exit on Monday and issue \u201cmovement passes\u201d to those who remain, an adviser to the mayor has said. Petro Andriushchenko made the claim in an update over the Telegram messaging app on Sunday, sharing a photo that appeared to show a line of people waiting for passes. \u201cHundreds of citizens have to stand in line to get a pass, without which next week it will be impossible not only to move between districts of the city, but also to be on the streets,\u201d he said. Andriushchenko suggested that occupying forces were probably gathering information on, or filtering through, those who remain in the city. In a separate update written on Saturday, Andriushchenko said Russian forces announced the city would be \u201cclosed for entry/exit for everyone from Monday, but there will also be a ban on moving around the districts for a week.\u201d The Guardian has not been able to independently verify these claims. Residents of the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine have been urged to evacuate immediately. The head of head of the regions military administration, Sergei Gaidai, maintained that the \u201cdecision is yours\u201d but warned the cemetery was \u201cgetting bigger by the day\u201d. \u201cNext week may be difficult. [This] may be the last time we still have a chance to save you,\u201d the head of the Luhansk regional military administration Sergei Gaidai said in a statement late on Sunday. The decision is yours. Those who take risks every day are already on the verge. An empty evacuation bus is a disrespect to the lives of a police officer, rescuer, volunteer and many more. Have you seen the new Severodonetsk cemetery?! Getting bigger by the day... We don\u2019t want to dig graves, we want to live and develop! Make that decision. This week can solve a lot.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s armed forces have been preparing themselves for a brutal Russian offensive in the region predicted for the coming weeks. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I\u2019m Samantha Lock and I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest developments until my colleague, Martin Belam, takes the reins a little later in the day. It is just past 7am in Ukraine. Here\u2019s what we know so far: Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for more weapons, describing \u201cevery delay\u201d as \u201cpermission for Russia to take the lives of Ukrainians\u201d. In his latest address, he appealed to countries to send arms, saying Ukraine\u2019s fate \u201cdepends upon them\u201d. Zelenskiy also claimed in the address that the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine\u2019s south were being transferred to \u201cthe ruble zone\u201d and subordinated to Russian administration. The Ukrainian president said Russia\u2019s actions in the territories were following the example of the so-called separatist republics of the DPR and LPR. Ukraine has completed a questionnaire which will form a starting point for the European Union to decide on its membership. \u201cToday, I can say that the document has been completed by the Ukrainian side,\u201d Ihor Zhovkva, deputy head of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s office, told the Ukrainian public broadcaster on Sunday evening. \u201cWe expect the recommendation ... to be positive, and then the ball will be on the side of the EU member states.\u201d Ukraine has vowed that its forces will \u201cfight to the end\u201d in the besieged port city of Mariupol, after a Russian ultimatum for the remaining Ukrainian troops there to surrender expired. A second British soldier fighting with the Ukrainian army was paraded on Russian television after being captured in Mariupol. Shaun Pinner, 48, said he had been fighting alongside Ukrainian marines when Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces invaded nearly eight weeks ago. A fresh series of Russian airstrikes came as a reminder this weekend that the war in the Ukrainian capital is far from over, despite signs of more normal life returning to the streets in recent days. An unverified photo claiming to show the Russian warship Moskva moments after it was reportedly hit by a Ukrainian Neptune missile has surfaced online. The source of the image is unclear and the Guardian has not been able to immediately verify its authenticity. Zelenskiy said he has invited French President Emmanuel Macron to visit Ukraine to see for himself evidence that Russian forces have committed \u201cgenocide\u201d, a term Macron has avoided using. Earlier on Sunday Zelenskiy urged US president Joe Biden to visit Ukraine and reiterated that he is not willing to cede territory in the country\u2019s east to end war with Russia. Zelenskiy said he was \u201chopeful\u201d Biden would make the trip. The president of the European Commission has urged member states to supply Ukraine with weapons systems \u201cquickly\u201d and suggested that a next round of EU sanctions could target Russia\u2019s powerful Sberbank. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said she had a \u201cvery good call\u201d with Ukraine\u2019s president. She added: \u201cContinued economic support by Ukraine\u2019s partners is essential to lay the foundations for rebuilding a modern competitive Ukraine.\u201d The United Nations refugee agency said 4,869,019 Ukrainians had left the country since Russia invaded in February \u2013 up 32,574 from Saturday\u2019s total, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees chief, Filippo Grandi\u2019s, said on Sunday. Oleg Synegubov, head of the Kharkiv regional administration, said Ukrainian forces were successfully pushing the Russians back to the east of the city and that several villages were liberated. At least two people were killed and four injured on Sunday in the shelling of the eastern Ukrainian town of Zolote, the local governor said. Zelenskiy maintained Ukraine is not willing to give up territory in the east in order to end the war with Russia and acknowledged that the battle could influence the entire course of the war.

            "date": "2022-04-29T17:29:45Z",
            "content": "As the war in Ukraine and its consequences weaken Russia\u2019s conventional military, Vladimir Putin\u2019s government has resorted to nuclear threats designed to project strength. Mr Putin wants to intimidate his opponents. But his strategy is failing. Instead of Ukraine\u2019s allies backing down, they are stepping up their support. The US Congress this week approved $11bn of arms to Ukraine, three times the total military aid Washington has so far given. The US president, Joe Biden, was right to call out Mr Putin for making \u201cidle comments\u201d about nuclear weapons. It is unthinkable that blunders and miscalculations would take the world to the edge of the nuclear abyss. Yet that is where the world is heading. Whereas the Cuban missile crisis lasted 13 days, Russia\u2019s war is already into its third month. With no clear end in sight, more deadly battles look inevitable \u2013 increasing the chances of mistakes. Mr Putin could be using nuclear rhetoric to give the appearance of being unstable. His war is illegal and immoral. His justification for starting the invasion was macabre and ludicrous. However, this may be an act. Russia\u2019s president could be trying to back coercive diplomacy with the \u201cmadman theory\u201d of threatening excessive force, which includes the spectre of nuclear weapons. However disagreeable this might seem, a rational Mr Putin, with 2,000 tactical nuclear warheads, is preferable to an irrational one. The concentration of such power in one man\u2019s hands ought to make the world sit up. Russia has few mechanisms to prevent Mr Putin resorting to nuclear weapons if he decided he had nothing to lose. In the Guardian last month, Christopher S Chivvis at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace wrote that in war game scenarios he had taken part in, which considered what would happen if Russia hit Ukraine with nuclear weapons, the only way of de-escalation was when \u201cclear political off-ramps and lines of communication between Moscow and Washington have remained open. In all the other games, the world is basically destroyed.\u201d That is why the US president has been careful not to provide Russia with a reason to go nuclear. Mr Biden made it clear that the US would not place boots on the ground, establish a no-fly zone or conduct intercontinental ballistic missile tests. What Mr Biden has shown is that conventional anti-tank and anti-aircraft technologies have reached a new level of capability, one which has rendered conventional invading ground forces \u2013 unless overwhelmingly massed \u2013 almost obsolete. Mr Biden has been shrewder than more gung-ho Democrats or their ideological soulmates found in Boris Johnson\u2019s government. Faced with costly military setbacks, Mr Putin has refocused Russia on tightening its hold in Ukraine\u2019s east and south. The fighting might get worse before it gets better. Pursuing Kyiv\u2019s objectives through relatively limited means has worked, though Russia has been able to target civilians indiscriminately. Ukrainians have every right to define their war aims. So do their Nato allies. One of their goals is not to increase the chances that the war becomes a potentially nuclear conflict. Western leaders should therefore reject provocative and escalatory requests out of hand. Nothing else could be more dangerous."

            "date": "2022-04-10T17:24:15Z",
            "content": "Your article (PM to put nuclear power at heart of UK\u2019s energy strategy, 6 April) refers to Sizewell C as one of the major projects that has \u201calready been through some form of planning\u201d. The planning process is still going on, and thousands of interested parties have objected. Six months of Planning Inspectorate meetings exposed the mistakes of trying to build two gigantic reactors in the middle of an area of outstanding natural beauty and site of special scientific interest, pushed against the Minsmere nature reserve, on an eroding coastline, and with no available water for construction or operation, among other problems. This hasn\u2019t stopped Kwasi Kwarteng promising millions in taxpayer funding for Sizewell C when the planning process has not been completed and while he refuses to meet the community to hear alternative views. Josie Bassinette Walberswick, Suffolk \u2022 In your major article on the government\u2019s new energy strategy there is no mention of a major reason for opposing more nuclear power: there is still no method of disposing of highly toxic nuclear waste safely. This is hugely irresponsible with regard to future generations, unlike some indigenous Americans like the Iroquois, who have a principle that every plan of action must be considered with regard to its effect on the next seven generations. Morag Carmichael London \u2022 In light of Boris\u2019s new enthusiasm for lots of Rolls-Royce\u2019s so-called \u201cmini-nukes\u201d to generate electricity, it should be better known that the Ministry of Defence has not scrapped any of its 21 similarly Rolls-Royce-powered old nuclear submarines, berthed for up to 40 years. It has made a start dismantling the hull of one, but there are still no plans for dealing with the reactors beyond burying them. Indeed, no country in the world has properly made safe a worn out mini-nuke-powered ship or submarine. Bob Cannell Bradford \u2022 I would argue that we do not need new nuclear power at all. It is costly, dangerous, slow and unsuitable as an adjunct to renewables. We certainly don\u2019t need it in Wales. In 2021, planning inspectors advised that the Wylfa Newydd development (What might the UK energy strategy contain and how feasible are options?, 6 April) should be rejected due to its impact on the local economy, housing stock, local ecology, nature conservation and the Welsh language. Yet still politicians say it\u2019s the best place for a new nuclear power station. No wonder Boris Johnson wants to cut the \u201cred tape\u201d of the planning process. He cannot be allowed to. Linda Rogers Llangoed, Anglesey \u2022 If the government is considering investment in long-term non-fossil energy projects like nuclear, why does its strategy make no mention of tidal power? Proven technology at a variety of suitable sites around the UK could provide baseload renewable electricity. True, the old Severn Barrage scheme raised fears for wildlife, but better design and the realisation that climate change will do far worse damage to wildlife should still such fears. Jon Reeds Alston, Cumbria \u2022 A quick win for additional energy supplies should be expansion of anaerobic digestion plants running on waste organic materials. This is a known and improving technology that can be scaled up and built quickly on farms. Organic waste materials can be sourced from farms, food factories, kerbside collections, verge and hedge cutting, etc. This process would be a better use of forestry waste than inefficient burning for electricity as it produces gas for the grid, from where it would be used much more efficiently, and fertiliser that is currently made from fossil fuel gas. CO2 can also be captured to replace that currently made from fossil fuel gas. Malcolm Scott Wirral \u2022 There are several glaring omissions from the energy strategy, including our ability to produce energy from waste (EfW) and our ability to sell UK EfW products to UK customers. As a nation, we are embarrassingly behind Europe on this matter, and to our shame we are sending waste either to landfill or to other countries to produce energy from. This, coupled with a ridiculous red tape system in the UK means that we (and companies like ours) are also more likely to sell our EfW pellets to Europe while UK power plants import pellets made from wood from other countries.

            "date": "2022-04-26T15:53:35Z",
            "content": "Leading former diplomats including seven ex-UK foreign and defence ministers have warned the Iran nuclear talks are heading to \u201ccorrosive stalemate devolving into a cycle of increased nuclear tension\u201d and urged Tehran and Washington to show more flexibility. Year-long talks in Vienna on reviving the deal and for the US, which was pulled out of the agreement by Donald Trump, to lift sanctions on Iran have in effect ground to a halt in a dispute over whether the west will lift the foreign terrorist organisation designation, and sanctions, against the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). The former diplomats said in an open letter that a final draft text of a renewed agreement was ready to be signed and warned that \u201cfor US and European leaders to let slip the opportunity to defuse a nuclear crisis in the Middle East would be a grave mistake\u201d. Washington says the sanctions on the IRGC do not relate to the nuclear deal, but to its long-term terrorist behaviour in the region, including in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. The signatories to the open letter, coordinated the European Leadership Network, include former senior diplomats in 14 countries including the former foreign secretary Jack Straw, former defence secretaries Lord King and Des Browne, as well as the former Conservative Middle East minister Alistair Burt. They say the legacy of Trump\u2019s strategic error in leaving the agreement \u201ccan today be measured in the tons of enriched uranium Iran has since accumulated, including uranium enriched to near-weapons grade; in the thousands of advanced centrifuges it is spinning; and, in the rapidly dwindling timeframe for Iran to reach a breakout capability\u201d. The US left the nuclear deal in 2018. Joe Biden on his election as president said he wanted to rejoin so long as Iran came back into compliance with the agreement on nuclear non-proliferation. One proposal that Israel fears the US administration will adopt is to retain sanctions on the elite foreign arm of the IRGC, the al-Quds force, but lift the designation on the IRGC domestically. The letter\u2019s authors acknowledge the politics of the foreign terrorist organisation designation are difficult but insist \u201cthere are ways to provide the counter-terrorism benefits of the current designation while still accommodating Iran\u2019s specific request, and consider it imperative that these be fully explored\u201d. \u201cFor its part, Iran should not expect a nuclear deal to address broader areas of disagreement between Tehran and Washington. Both sides must approach this final phase of negotiation with an understanding that the strategic implications of failure would be grave and profound.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-04-02T06:00:43Z",
            "content": "Boris Johnson wants his promised energy security strategy to \u201cbet big\u201d on nuclear despite Rishi Sunak\u2019s reservations \u2013 but he has cooled on more onshore wind turbines in England amid a Conservative backlash. The prime minister is determined to press ahead with plans to build up to eight new nuclear power stations even though the chancellor has concerns about the cost, projected to reach more than \u00a313bn. It is understood the energy strategy, expected to be announced next week, is likely to contain targets for nuclear but will not put a figure on the cost. Johnson will also commit to a \u201cstretching\u201d target on offshore wind, according to a Whitehall source. But he is now said to be less enthusiastic about the possibilities of onshore wind in England, believing Scotland offers a better landscape for new turbines. One ally of the prime minister said he would \u201cnot really [be] pushing for onshore wind in England\u201d although it would \u201cbe in the strategy as an option where people want it, which realistically means in Scotland\u201d. Johnson and Sunak are understood to have discussed the new strategy this week, which was commissioned to ensure security of supply amid soaring gas prices fuelled by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The document was delayed owing to a row over the scale of its ambitions on nuclear, but is now likely to be published at the end of next week. Sunak will be in London for the launch of the strategy. However, he is reported to be going on holiday in California, where he has a second home, at some point over parliamentary recess, despite rising pressure over the lack of measures to help with the cost of living and energy bills in the spring statement. The Treasury is understood to have concerns about expanding nuclear power in the UK, with the cost of new plants due to be loaded on to people\u2019s energy bills under the fresh funding system. The government would also be likely to take minority stakes in new projects, and has set aside an estimated \u00a31.7bn on getting one plant, Sizewell C, in a position to go ahead. But with a renewed focus on weaning the UK off gas, Johnson is insistent on the need to press ahead with new plants, with a draft target of around 16GW of nuclear power in the medium term and closer to 30GW in the longer term. According to the government\u2019s own impact assessment, it takes on average 13 to 17 years from initial investment to electricity being generated by a new nuclear plant. On onshore wind, allies of No 10 had described Johnson as \u201copen-minded\u201d, but \u201cpassionate about offshore\u201d. He appears to have cooled on the prospect of more onshore wind, as well as the potential for fracking in England, because Tory MPs are resisting developments in their constituencies. The idea of giving communities discounts on their energy bills if they accept onshore developments in their areas has been mooted, meaning the prospect of new developments is \u201cnot impossible\u201d, but still difficult, sources said. However, Johnson has been giving out mixed messages on onshore wind after telling a group of industry leaders this week that he was \u201chorrified\u201d how long the planning process takes. He was told that a wind turbine can be put up in a day, but planning permission can take a decade. Officials expect No 10 will approve an energy bill to set targets and strategy for energy security, to be announced in the Queen\u2019s speech in May. The UK has struggled to build new nuclear power stations in recent decades, with the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi in 2020 pulling out of plans to build a new reactor at Wylfa, north Wales, and a move against allowing Chinese investment in Sizewell C on the Suffolk coast."

            "date": "2022-04-25T17:30:44Z",
            "content": "An inquest into the death in custody of an Aboriginal woman held in remand over theft-related offences will probe the state\u2019s bail laws and healthcare in prisons when it begins on Tuesday. Veronica Nelson, a Gunditjmara, Dja Dja Wurrung, Wiradjuri and Yorta Yorta woman, was on remand when she was found dead in her cell at the maximum security Dame Phyllis Frost Centre in Melbourne\u2019s west on 2 January 2020. She was 37. Nerita Waight, chief executive of the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, said Nelson\u2019s death was a tragedy for her family and friends. Waight said the state\u2019s Indigenous communities have \u201cseen far too much senseless loss of life in the Victorian justice system\u201d. \u201cVeronica should still be alive today and we hope to get some answers that help us understand why she is not and ensure it never happens again,\u201d she said. An autopsy found Nelson suffered complications from Wilkie\u2019s syndrome, a rare condition that is characterised by abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. She had been arrested three days earlier in the Melbourne CBD and denied bail after police discovered she was wanted for questioning over shoplifting. At a 2020 directions hearing, the Victorian coroner\u2019s court heard Nelson had cried for help multiple times in the three hours before her death. During that time, prison and nursing staff did not check on Nelson physically, but communicated with her through an intercom system and a door flap, the court was told. A prison nurse gave Nelson Panadol after she reported leg camps and the anti-nausea drug Maxolon. The court also heard Nelson had been experiencing heroin withdrawals. The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service will represent Nelson\u2019s partner of 22 years, Percy Lovett, at the inquest. Lovett has previously described Nelson as a \u201cstrong woman\u201d and someone who would always help others on the street, and said he wanted the inquest to ensure it was \u201ceasier for the next woman who get locked up\u201d. Nelson\u2019s mother, Donna Nelson, has remembered her daughter as a \u201cwarrior\u201d with a \u201cfighting spirit\u201d who was deeply connected to her Aboriginal culture, and was like a \u201csecond mother\u201d to her two brothers, Duane and Russell. Nelson had been arrested on Spencer Street in Melbourne on 30 December 2019, on theft charges and an outstanding warrant. She appeared in court later that day without legal representation and was refused bail, with a court hearing scheduled to take place two weeks later. She spent a night at the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre\u2019s medical unit before being moved to a transition area for new arrivals. After the Bourke Street killings in 2017, the Andrews government tightened Victoria\u2019s bail laws. Under the reform \u2013 which has resulted in a significant increase in the state\u2019s remand population and delays for court hearings \u2013 the person charged with an offence must prove they meet \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d or have \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d to be released on bail. Thalia Anthony, a senior law lecturer at the University of Technology Sydney, said the legislative changes had shifted the focus towards \u201can assumption against bail\u201d. \u201cSystemically, the bail legislation and decision making has always worked against Aboriginal people. But when you tighten those laws and make it harder to get bail, then it\u2019s going to impact on Aboriginal people and Aboriginal women more harshly and that bears out in the statistics,\u201d Anthony told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe bail system, even at its best, is discriminatory because it doesn\u2019t account for factors that would systemically discriminate against Aboriginal people. For example, there\u2019s a higher chance of getting bail if you\u2019re employed and have secure housing, and don\u2019t move around.\u201d Last month, a wide-ranging inquiry into Victoria\u2019s criminal justice system recommended the state review its bail laws, with the changes leading to a rise in the number of people on remand. Women are disproportionately affected. It found almost half of all women in prison were on remand \u2013 an increase from 22% in 2010. A larger proportion of women had been held on remand in recent years than men, with this figure even higher for Aboriginal women. The Sentencing Advisory Council found the imprisonment rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people almost doubled between 2010 and 2020, from 971.8 to 1,848 per 100,000 adults. The inquest will run until 27 May and will examine the circumstances and cause of Nelson\u2019s death, including how she came to be in custody, the medical treatment she was provided and systemic issues in the state\u2019s remand system."

            "date": "2022-04-30T20:00:06Z",
            "content": "Vulnerable Australians are missing out on adequate healthcare because the Medicare rebate is failing to keep up with the costs of providing services, leading to a critical GP shortage, community health organisations say. Not-for-profit community health organisation Cohealth has not been able to operate its street doctor service in Melbourne\u2019s CBD \u2013 which provides a GP to people sleeping rough \u2013 for more than nine months, because it cannot find a doctor to work there. Cohealth nurse Vaan Phongsavan has been left to carry out the program. She now sees people in the CBD homelessness clinic instead of out on the road with the organisation\u2019s bus. \u201cIt was working well but the funding was basically grant money \u2026 [so] I have been working alone and the bus no longer runs, I see patients in the clinics,\u201d Phongsavan said. Last month, a patient came in with a very painful infected abscess in his mouth. Phongsavan spent hours trying to find a bulk-billing GP that would see him. Cohealth had no free spaces and the closest bulk-billing clinic with a spare appointment charged $35 for an initial consult \u2013 money the man did not have. Phongsavan eventually found the patient an appointment with a dental hospital but does not know if he received treatment. She said most of the people she sees could benefit from also seeing a GP \u2013 to write scripts, perform cervical screenings or do a full checkup. \u201cOur clients are complex. In a 15-minute appointment you are not going to get very far,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of mainstream services can\u2019t afford to do this because it is time-consuming and it\u2019s expensive.\u201d The waitlist to see a Cohealth GP is long, and the struggle to recruit more doctors is driven by the massive pay disparity between public and private health models in Australia. \u2018There are just no doctors\u2019 Cohealth says the pay on offer to work in community health is about one-third of what a GP in private practice or hospitals would receive. The current Medicare fee-for-service funding model is geared to high volume, short, transactional appointments, and is unsuitable for community health primary care, Cohealth\u2019s chief executive, Nicole Bartholomeusz, said. It does not stretch far enough to meet the complex needs of vulnerable patients. \u201cWithout good doctors working in community health, vulnerable clients are at risk of missing out on the kind of integrated care that they need,\u201d Bartholomeusz said. To deliver its service, Cohealth runs its GP programs at a \u201csignificant\u201d loss \u2013 with the organisation covering the cost, she said. \u201cWhile Medicare remains a fundamental part of Australia\u2019s universal health care system, it needs to be enhanced to support those most in need.\u201d Cohealth is not the only organisation struggling to employ doctors. Total Care Medical clinic is a bulk-billing practice in Frankston. Director, Lucina Wilk, said after losing four doctors across the pandemic, she had so far not been able to fill the positions. \u201cI\u2019m down to one doctor and I have 6,000 active patients. I have a database of 30,000,\u201d Wilk said. \u201cFor clinics like mine, this is devastating.\u201d For a standard consultation, bulk-billing doctors receive about $38 from Medicare \u2013 but a doctor in a private practice will make about $85 for the same session, she said. \u201cThere are no doctors \u2013 just no doctors. I am constantly advertising to get doctors. I\u2019ve gone to about six recruitment agencies.\u201d To be able to afford to run the clinic, Wilk has started to charge private fees for some services \u2013 but wishes she didn\u2019t have to. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very tricky situation.\u201d From 2020 to 2021, just 67.6% of all GP patients had their consultation bulk-billed, according to the Productivity Commission\u2019s Report on Government Services 2022. \u2018Not a hope in hell\u2019 For many, access to community healthcare is life-saving. Indi Shanmugam, 57, was stabbed after a No Room For Racism rally in Melbourne in 2015. The wound caused a bacterial infection that spread to his spine. \u201cIn the C7 [vertebra] near my neck they had to sever the nerve and put a metal plate in,\u201d Shanmugam said. \u201cI lost everything below my chest. I couldn\u2019t feel my legs.\u201d He was in hospital for a year before being discharged into an aged care facility. He started seeing Cohealth GP Dr Paul MacCartney regularly, who put him on a program to deal with his drug dependency and helped him get on to the NDIS and into independent housing. Shanmugam said if it wasn\u2019t for the Medicare rebate he would have to fork out thousands each year for his bills \u2013 which he just would not be able to afford. \u201cI can afford to live a comfortable life with just the pension that I am on now.\u201d Australian Medical Association vice president, Chris Moy, said there was \u201cno bloody way \u2026 not a hope in hell\u201d that community health services could continue under the current financial model. The organisation has launched its Modernise Medicare campaign this election to demand extra funding for longer consultations, including after hours, and to provide more holistic care with pharmacists, dietitians and other allied health workers. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Neither Labor nor the Coalition has announced plans to increase GP Medicare rebates \u2013 and much of the election focus so far has been on whether Senator Anne Ruston, who would be health minister if the Coalition is re-elected, wants to privatise Medicare \u2013 a policy she publicly supported in 2015 before it was scrapped by the Coalition. \u201cThe current rebate for a standard consultation \u2013 it\u2019s $38,\u201d Moy said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the same as a men\u2019s haircut, for a 20-minute consultation. \u201cThe AMA\u2019s position is we need to shift the funding model to favour practices that give high-quality care and are willing to go [the] extra mile and support their patients.\u201d He said both parties were letting down the public. \u201cYou have the LNP government which has totally betrayed the sector by saying [the AMA\u2019s plan] is the right thing to do, but are sending it to another committee \u2013 and Labor, who claim to be the friend of Medicare, but we haven\u2019t seen anything substantial from.\u201d This story was corrected on 1 May 2022 to make clear that Cohealth\u2019s street doctor service operates in Melbourne\u2019s CBD."

            "content": "With that, we will wrap up the blog for the evening. Here\u2019s what happened today: Scott Morrison confirmed he would appoint Anne Ruston as health and aged care minister if the Coalition government is re-elected on 21 May. Marise Payne said she does not share the views expressed by Katherine Deves about transgender and gender diverse people. Payne also said Australia will continue to offer Solomon Islands security assistance, even if the country signs its proposed agreement with China. The minister for superannuation and financial services, Jane Hume, said it is \u201cadmirable\u201d that the controversial Liberal candidate for Warringah, Katherine Deves, remains committed to \u201cthe cause\u201d. NSW Ambulance confirmed that an incident has taken place near Batemans Bay, with one man in critical condition, having been found in cardiac arrest. NSW reported 9,725 new cases and six deaths, Victoria recorded 8,153 new cases and two deaths, Queensland reported 4,850 new cases, the NT reported 340 new cases, Tasmania reported 1,212 new cases and one death, Western Australia recorded 5,112 new cases and eight deaths, seven of which were historical, and South Australia has reported 2,675 new cases. Thanks for reading. AAP is reporting that former NSW and Australia five-eighth Tony Brown has died, aged 86. A star at Newtown in the 1950s and 1960s while spending six years as the club\u2019s captain, Brown played nine matches for NSW and 10 for the Kangaroos. But it is at Penrith where he is most fondly remembered, named as the club\u2019s first captain when they entered first grade in 1967. Released by the Bluebags in 1964, he joined the Panthers\u2019 second-division team and rose with the club to the top flight. The No.6 then had a hand in the club\u2019s first ever try, before being injured in his third first-grade team for the club. He later became captain-coach of the club\u2019s reserve grade side. The Panthers confirmed on Sunday he had died after a battle with illness on Friday. On the earlier incident near Batemans Bay, NSW police have confirmed that there were reports of swimmers in distress, with 10 people brought to shore by surf lifesavers and members of the public. They said the reports of distress came from Surf Beach, close to Batemans Bay, and confirmed one person is still in critical condition, while three others have been taken to hospital. It is still unclear what happened, but we will bring you further details as they come. The Country Fire Authority (CFA) is urging people to avoid private burn-offs today, due to the windy weather conditions across Victoria. The CFA says firefighters have already responded to more than 50 grass and scrub fires today, with at least a dozen of those being escaped private burn-offs. CFA state duty officer Peter Baker said people should not be burning off in these conditions: Burn-offs can escape quickly and become difficult to control in the current strong winds Victoria is experiencing. Several parts of the state are still very dry with high fuel loads. When a grass fire starts, it can travel faster than you can run. People are unnecessarily putting their own lives at risk and their loved ones at risk. We are also asking community members to check any private burns from the past couple of days to ensure they are fully extinguished. It appears Labor is going to be using the appointment of Anne Ruston as future-potential health minister as a point of attack: NSW Ambulance has just confirmed to the Guardian that an incident has taken place near Batemans Bay, with one man in critical condition, having been found in cardiac arrest. Three others have also been taken to Batemans Bay Hospital, although their condition is still unknown. A call was made to authorities at around 2pm, with suggestions a number of people were struggling in the water. Ambulance crews and a rescue helicopter were dispatched to treat the four patients. The man who suffered a cardiac arrest is believed to be in his 40s, with details on the rest of the patients still unknown. So at the press conference earlier today, future-potential health minister Anne Ruston was asked about transgender kids in sport, a question that has caused division in the Liberal party recently. Here is what she had to say: Of course we want to see all Australian children be able to participate in sports. We want to make sure all Australians have healthy lifestyles because we know that is not just good for their physical health but their mental health. I think, going forward, I would be very keen to make sure \u2013 through all avenues, whether it be through the education system but, most particularly, through grassroots communities \u2013 that we are giving opportunities for all Australians to be able to participate in sport. And that is really important for younger Australians. The Northern Territory has recorded 340 new cases overnight, with 26 people in hospital with the virus, and six requiring oxygen. So earlier today, current and soon to be former health minister Greg Hunt was on the Today show, and was asked what he plans to do after leaving politics: Obviously, I believe deeply in the leadership of Scott Morrison and the team. I\u2019ll take a bit of a break, Pilates, possibly a tattoo [said with a laugh], but above all else the real purpose is to be a dad. That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking forward to. And some focus on mental health for people, in terms of working in that space on a philanthropic side. But the rest of my life, I\u2019ve got plenty of time to sort that. But to be a dad, and today\u2019s a great day to reflect on this. I haven\u2019t been a proper dad, and so that\u2019s the real purpose and that\u2019s my goal. Queensland is reporting 4,850 new cases overnight: Good afternoon, and another quick thanks to Lisa Cox for her brilliant work today, I am Mostafa Rachwani and I will be taking you through the rest of the day\u2019s news. And with that presser wrapping up, I am going to hand the blog back to Mostafa Rachwani who will take you through the rest of this Easter Sunday afternoon. Thanks for joining me this morning. Turning to the reported payment of more than half a million dollars to Alan Tudge\u2019s former adviser Rachelle Miller, Morrison says the process is confidential and has been put in place by the department of finance. I think that is the way these matters should be handled and I intend to honour the process that has been established independently by public officials about how sensitive matters of this nature should be handled and so I intend to stick to the process. I am glad you raise this because if there was any matter that was in the assessment by the Department of Finance that involved the conduct of any minister whatsoever in the granting of that payment then that matter would have to be raised with me by the Department of Finance through the secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Now, I can assure you absolutely that no such reference has been made to me, so to imply that would be false. Morrison is asked about comments he made about a push by Tasmanian senator Claire Chandler to allow sporting groups to exclude transgender people from single-sex sports. He\u2019s asked to clarify his position after he said he supported a bill from Chandler but that it was not government policy. Morrison says at no stage has he suggested there would be a government bill. I was asked a question. I think I was down in Tasmania \u2013 whether I supported Claire\u2019s bill, and I said, \u201cYes I do.\u201d And I do. Claire\u2019s bill \u2013 sensitive matters like this have been brought by members and members are able to have a conscience vote on these matters. We are in the middle of an election campaign. There is no opportunity for us to have these discussions in the party room but this has always been my instincts on these matters that there are many different views on this. There are many, many different views on this. A private members bill, I mean, we have had \u2013 particularly on medical issues in the past, private member\u2019s bill have come forward and the parliament have been able to consider those matters and vote on those matters. So, I am not seeking to find any of my members of parliament on these issues as a party position. I was asked what my position was. I told you what my position was. I was open about it, I was very plain about it, and I think that was the appropriate thing to do. Ruston is asked about historical comments she made about Medicare being unsustainable: I think the comments you were referring to were back in 2014 and as we are standing here today, having come through a pandemic with an extraordinarily strong economy, one of the strongest in the world with 4% unemployment, I think we have demonstrated that as a government during our term of government but it is a strong economy that affords the supports that Australians rely on. She adds: We have laid out a budget coming forward to show Australians what we are proposing to do going forward and part of it is making sure that we have a strong healthcare system which is able to support Australians and I think that our policies around healthcare stand. Our government has been clear that we are not cutting Medicare. Our track record in terms of increased spending across all elements of our healthcare system stand for themselves. Anne Ruston says it is a \u201cgreat honour\u201d to be named the future health minister if the Coalition wins the election. She\u2019s been speaking at a media conference in Sydney with the prime minister Scott Morrison. Morrison says he has seen a \u201cgreat empathy\u201d from Ruston in portfolios of great need. He defends his government\u2019s record on health spending, responding to Labor\u2019s attacks that Ruston would support cuts to Medicare: If people want to understand what are the consequences of a government that can\u2019t manage money, like the Labor party ... what are the consequences of that? Well the consequences are not being able to put pharmaceuticals on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. South Australia has recorded 2,675 new Covid-19 cases. There were no Covid-19 deaths in the state in the past 24 hours. There are 225 Covid-19 patients in hospital, including 12 in intensive care. Hello again. Here\u2019s some more, via AAP, from the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, on the appointment of Anne Ruston as health minister if the Coalition is re-elected. He says the appointment of Ruston to the health portfolio vacated by Greg Hunt is another sign that Australians should expect cuts to Medicare. The Labor leader noted Scott Morrison had chosen to make this major announcement on a day when it was agreed that it would not be a day of usual campaigning because of Easter. \u201cAnne Ruston has made it very clear that she wants to take the universal out of universal health care,\u201d Albanese told reporters after attending a church services in Cairns with shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers. \u201cShe has made it very clear that, if we have an election of the Morrison government, we will see more cuts to Medicare, more cuts to Medicare over the next three years.\u201d Ruston, which is currently the social services minister, would replace Hunt, who is retiring from politics, should the Coalition win the May 21 election. Liberal frontbencher Jane Hume threw her support behind the decision. \u201cI am so pleased for her. She is a highly qualified and highly experienced member of our cabinet,\u201d she told Sky News\u2019 Sunday Agenda program. \u201cShe has dealt with the portfolio in social services as very successful minister there, dealing with what\u2019s important to millions of peoples lives. So I think she will be a terrific appointment.\u201d And with that, I will hand the blog back over to Lisa Cox. The PM has made a stop at Westmead children\u2019s hospital today: Scott Morrison has confirmed he would appoint Anne Ruston as health and aged care minister if the Coalition government is re-elected on 21 May. The incumbent, Greg Hunt, is leaving politics at the election. It\u2019s important to keep in mind Ruston is not now the health minister \u2013 Hunt remains in the post for now, and it is something that would happen only if the Coalition is returned. Here is what Morrison said in a statement issued a short time ago: Anne\u2019s experience as a senior Minister managing a complex portfolio touching millions of lives makes her the right pick to help guide Australia\u2019s health system out of the pandemic. Anne has been an important part of my Expenditure Review Committee and a strong advocate for women\u2019s safety and health including working closely on recent initiatives to tackle endometriosis. I know she\u2019ll bring that ability to understand complex issues, and her compassion to the health portfolio. In the same statement, Ruston said it was an honour to be named as the Coalition\u2019s next minister for health and aged care if re-elected: Healthcare has been a part of my life ever since I was born, as my mum was a nurse in our regional town, which also gave me great insight into the vital role country hospitals play in the lives of their communities. I look forward to the opportunity to deliver our Government\u2019s commitment to a healthier Australia and will continue to prioritise medicines, mental health and medical research. Earlier, Hunt was asked on Seven\u2019s Weekend Sunrise whether it appeared to be arrogant to be naming a health minister ahead of the election. Hunt disagreed. He said it was \u201csensible because it\u2019s understandable that people would wish to know who is my successor, who would be managing health in a new government\u201d. He said Labor should also say who would be defence minister in an Albanese government. On Nine\u2019s Weekend Today, Hunt gently pointed out that his time is not up yet, and that he\u2019ll remain in position until the election. He said he expected \u201cfive weeks of intense work between now and then on health\u201d. Labor says it will match the government\u2019s announcement regarding access to flash glucose monitoring and continuous glucose monitoring devices for adults who currently miss out. Labor\u2019s health spokesperson, Mark Butler, said Australia had \u201ca proud history of bipartisan support for new diabetes technologies\u201d, and an incoming Albanese Labor government would match the commitment made by the Coalition earlier today: This means that every Australian with Type 1 diabetes will get access to a potentially life-saving continuous glucose monitoring device. ... Whatever the election result, Australians with Type 1 diabetes will get better support. This is a testament to the campaign work of the thousands of Australians who are living with Type 1 diabetes and their families. Here\u2019s how the health minister, Greg Hunt, described the announcement on Nine\u2019s Weekend Today program earlier today: Continuous glucose monitoring, which allows patients to monitor their glucose levels and therefore their ability to deal with diabetes, will be made available and subsidised by the Government for all 130,000 type one diabetics. It will save individuals up to $5,000 a year but above all else, it\u2019s about peace of mind and health treatment, available from the first of July. And it\u2019s an immensely important investment in healthcare. So we currently cover children under 21, pregnant women and what are called concession card holders, people on lower incomes or in relevant categories. Now, we\u2019ll cover everybody and that\u2019s about saving lives and protecting lives and giving people better quality of life. Good afternoon, and a quick thanks to Lisa Cox for her expert blogging this morning. I\u2019m going to take a short break. My excellent colleague Mostafa Rachwani will take you through the next little while. The Greens are pledging free NBN access for 1m households with a healthcare card, including carers, students, low-income families and the unemployed. The party says the policy would mean all healthcare card holders would be able to access high speed internet, at home, for free. Costing by the Parliamentary Budget Office has priced the policy at $800m a year. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, says Australia\u2019s digital divide is increasing \u201cat a time when more people are having to rely on the internet to work, study, socialise, shop, and pay their bills\u201d: During the last two years of lockdowns, some families had to park outside the local library to access free internet so their kids could do their school work. That\u2019s unacceptable. The pandemic has shown just how important the internet is. It\u2019s critical connective infrastructure, and everyone deserves to be able to access it. Western Australia is reporting 5,112 new Covid-19 cases to 8pm last night. The state has recorded eight deaths, one of which occurred in the past 24 hours. The other seven deaths occurred in the days dating back to 19 March but were reported to WA Health on Saturday. The deaths were two men in their 50s, a man in his 60s, a man in his 80s, a woman in her 60s, a woman in her 70s and two women in their 80s. There are 220 people with Covid-19 in hospital in the state, seven in intensive care. Tomorrow is the last day to get on the electoral roll or update your enrolment. A NSW police dog has bitten a man that was the subject of a search after he was reported missing on Friday night. The 27-year-old man suffered severe injuries to his leg after an officer attached to the dog unit located him near Bushells Ridge. Police say there was a \u201cviolent struggle\u201d during which the dog bit the man, with the attached officer also sustaining minor injuries to his face. \u201cAn officer attached to the dog unit located the man in bushland about 10pm and during a violent struggle the police dog has bitten the man, causing severe injuries to his legs.\u201d \u201cThe officer rendered first aid before further police attended to assist, locating the officer and 27-year-old man in dense bushland.\u201d \u201cThe injured man was treated by NSW ambulance paramedics and taken to John Hunter hospital under police guard. He is reported to be in a critical condition.\u201d The 27-year-old who was bitten by the dog had been seen running in the southbound lanes of the M1 on Saturday night. He was struck by the mirror of a Ford Ranger utility vehicle as the driver swerved to avoid him, with the driver stopping and calling police soon after. A critical incident team from Brisbane Water Police District investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident. That investigation will be subject to an independent review. via AAP: A new Darwin port industrial hub spruiked by the deputy prime minister could have severe impacts on human health, a Northern Territory government environmental report says. The nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, on Tuesday announced $1.5bn to transform Middle Arm Peninsula into a world-leading gas, hydrogen and minerals processing and export precinct. The proposed NT-led development also includes a petrochemicals plant for plastic, pesticide and fertiliser production. The nationally significant infrastructure project is set to create 20,000 jobs and turbocharge the regional economy, the NT government says. But an NT risk assessment released the same day says the hub could have \u201csignificant adverse impacts\u201d on community health. The report also found air quality in the area may be significantly impacted. The Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct is about 3km southwest of Palmerston and 13km southeast of Darwin, which have a combined population of about 160,000. Soil and water quality could also suffer if erosion, leaks, discharge of wastewater or spills of hazardous materials occur. Threatened species and sensitive vegetation might be adversely affected when the site, which is about the size of 750 AFL ovals, is cleared. The potential threats were identified in a risk assessment the NT government was required to submit under the environmental approvals process. More below: The opposition leader Anthony Albanese has been speaking to media in Cairns where he attended an Easter church service. He spoke about the appointment of Anne Ruston as the future health minister if the Coalition is reelected: I do know that the prime minister had said that this was not going to be a day of usual campaigning. And that he has chosen, the government has chosen, to make a very significant announcement today of the appointment of a new health minister, should the government be re-elected. Now, Anne Ruston has made it very clear that she wants to take the universal out of universal healthcare. She has made it very clear that, if we have [an] election of the Morrison government, we will see more cuts to Medicare, more cuts to Medicare over the next three years. Labor\u2019s treasury spokesman, Jim Chalmers, says it should \u201csend a shiver down the spine of every Australian who relies on affordable healthcare\u201d. Tasmania has recorded one Covid-19 death and 1,212 new cases. It takes the number of Covid-19 deaths in the state since the start of the pandemic to 43. There are 47 patients in hospital, including one person in intensive care. The ABC reports about concerns about the growing outbreak of yellow crazy ants in Townsville. Yellow crazy ants are a highly invasive species that affect people and wildlife. via AAP: Unfortunately eastern Australia\u2019s big wet has brought funnel-web spiders out in force. Apparently they don\u2019t like their burrows being flushed through, while excessive rain also tends to send them in search of the opposite sex. Worry not, though. While there were 13 fatal funnel-web bites in Australia prior to the development of an antivenom for clinical use by the medical researcher Dr Struan Sutherland in 1981, there have been none since. Moreover, the staff at Australian Reptile Park, north of Sydney, are determined to keep it that way. In fact, head keeper Jake Meney has just beaten his own record for extracting venom from funnel-webs, which is then used to make lifesaving antivenom. He was able to milk an average 0.35mg per spider, or .03mg better than his previous best. Although minuscule, the difference is enough to kill a room full of adult humans. It\u2019s also why park management likes to think of Meney as their friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man. He and his team work tirelessly to capture every drop possible, says the park\u2019s director, Tim Faulkner. \u201cWe rely heavily on the public handing in funnel-web spiders and would not be able to help save lives if it weren\u2019t for their generous donations,\u201d he said. Now to the subject of a national integrity commission, Butler says Labor will \u201cclean up the rorts\u201d: We are very clear, we want to clean up the rorts. Three-and-a-half years after the promise from the prime minister, hundreds of millions of dollars spent as if it\u2019s Liberal party funds \u2013 taxpayer money \u2013 it\u2019s clearly enough. The only way to end those rorts is by changing the government, because the government itself has walked away from this. People have said that it is not a big deal, but that\u2019s not the feedback we get. Australians are sick of the rorts, sick of their money being spent as if it\u2019s Liberal party money and we are committed to making sure there is a tough cop on the beat that will clean up the rorts, that can act independently \u2013 not on the approval of the government of the day \u2013 that can undertake retrospective investigations and have investigations when they think [they] are in the public interest. Butler says, if elected, Labor will have the 50 clinics up and running in the next financial year, commencing 1 July 2023: This policy has been fully costed, been informed by work of the Parliamentary Budget Office, but the key consultation about the cost has been with general practices who understand what additional funding they need to make this model work. A lot of GP organisations have been trying to do this, but they\u2019ve found that the existing Medicare funding arrangements, which are really modelled around standard general practice, simply don\u2019t make the model viable. I\u2019ve worked with them very closely. Labor\u2019s health spokesman Mark Butler is next up on Insiders. Host David Speers asks about concerns the Australian Medical Association has expressed that Labor\u2019s proposal for government subsidised clinics will create \u201cunfair\u201d competition with other GP practices. Butler says: We are very confident that this practice will make it easier for people to see doctors, particularly where those families are spending hours and hours lining up in hospital emergency departments and also, by extension, take real pressure off our hospitals He adds: This will be a competitive process overseen by the department. We will identify particular regions where we know there is huge pressure on hospital departments, and GP practices who want to take their practice to the next level will be able to apply for the additional funding that we know is necessary to make these services viable. Marise Payne stopped short of echoing US president Joe Biden in directly accusing Russia of genocide in Ukraine. The Australian government has, however, previously accused Russia of war crimes. The foreign minister told the ABC that Australia largely operated in line with declarations made by courts in relation to the declaration of genocide. That\u2019s the approach that we have consistently taken and why we are so strongly supporting the work of the International Criminal Court, including through the reference in early March to the International Criminal Court of these appalling events in Ukraine by Russia. That enabled investigations to begin at that time. That enables the preservation of evidence and the taking of evidence and statements in the context of the investigations of the court. We are also providing two officials to work with the court in their investigations, and I think that there is room for us to also provide support potentially through the Australian Federal Police and they their significant experience in a number of these issues, particularly related to MH17. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, says Australia will continue to offer Solomon Islands security assistance, even if the country signs its proposed agreement with China. A leaked draft from last month raised the possibility China could \u201cmake ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands\u201d, while Chinese forces could also be used \u201cto protect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in Solomon Islands\u201d. The prime minister of Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, has sought to allay concerns, saying his country has no intention of allowing a Chinese naval base. But Sogavare has also said it is \u201cvery insulting to be branded as unfit to manage our sovereign affairs\u201d. Speaking to the ABC\u2019s Insiders program this morning, Payne said she regarded those assurances as \u201cimportant\u201d. She said Australia already had a bilateral security treaty with Solomon Islands and had provided assistance together with New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea to support them in dealing with the unrest. She said Australia believed that \u201cthe Pacific family is best placed\u201d to respond to security issues in the Pacific region (framing that excludes China as being geographically further away). Asked whether that security cooperation would continue if Solomon Islands signed this agreement with China, Payne said: Yes, that is absolutely my view and it is the view of Pacific partners, but there is also a concern that there has been a lack of transparency in relation to this agreement and that it is something that should be discussed in a broader Pacific Island Forum context itself, Australia would support that discussion. Other countries have called for it as well. On the subject of a federal integrity commission, Payne says the Coalition has a \u201cdetailed piece of legislation\u201d: It has been broadly consulted, over 300 pages in detail. It provides our framework for a commonwealth integrity commission. It has been tabled in the parliament. It is there for all to see. What we have from the Opposition is a two-page summary and that\u2019s all they\u2019ve had for three years. Payne has now been asked about the reported payment of more than $500,000 to Alan Tudge\u2019s former adviser Rachelle Miller. She\u2019s asked if the government can be transparent about the reason for the half-a-million-dollar payout. Payne says: I don\u2019t know and I have no awareness of the details of these matters and it is not appropriate for me to have knowledge of these matters As I understand, through the Comcare process, it is a matter that is handled between individuals and the department itself. It is not something that involves ministers at all. Marise Payne has told the ABC\u2019s Insiders she does not share the views expressed by Katherine Deves about transgender and gender diverse people that have prompted calls for her to be dropped as the candidate for Warringah. She tells host David Speers: I don\u2019t share Ms Deves\u2019 comments that she has made, but importantly she has apologised and withdrawn those views and as the prime minister said yesterday, in public life, we do have to be very careful about the way we express our opinions. But she won\u2019t be drawn on whether Deves should be dropped as as candidate. After avoiding answering the question several times, Payne says: It is a matter for the organisation in New South Wales. I need to get on with my job, that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. I don\u2019t agree with the remarks she made, I\u2019ve made that explicitly clear. Victoria has reported on Sunday two new Covid-related deaths and 8,153 new cases. There are 401 people being treated in hospital in the state. Marise Payne will be up on the ABC\u2019s Insiders shortly. I hope you\u2019re enjoying some chocolate and a hot cross bun in the meantime. NSW has reported another six Covid-19 deaths. There are 1,527 patients with Covid-19 in hospital, 64 of those in intensive care. The state recorded 9,725 cases in the past 24 hours. In the Sky News interview, Jane Hume was also asked about Scott Morrison\u2019s looming announcement that Anne Ruston would become health minister if the Coalition was re-elected. Hume said she would leave the official announcement to the prime minister later today, but proceeded to welcome it: I am so pleased for her. She is a highly qualified, highly experienced member of our cabinet. She\u2019s dealt with a portfolio in social services as a very successful minister there dealing with what\u2019s important to millions of people\u2019s lives. So I think she\u2019ll be a terrific appointment to the health portfolio, which is so important at a time like this. Where we\u2019re still in the midst of a global pandemic, it\u2019s really important to know that there are steady hands at the wheel of such an important portfolio. The minister for superannuation and financial services, Jane Hume, has said it is \u201cadmirable\u201d that the controversial Liberal candidate for Warringah, Katherine Deves, remains committed to \u201cthe cause\u201d. Scott Morrison has been facing a mutiny over Deves\u2019 candidacy, with intensifying calls for her to be dumped because of \u201churtful and divisive\u201d comments about transgender people. A string of news stories this week have revealed inflammatory comments on various social media platforms including one where Deves equated anti-trans activism to standing up against the Holocaust during a YouTube panel. Deves cofounded the Save Women\u2019s Sport organisation, which campaigns to restrict trans women from playing in female sporting competitions. Hume, in an interview on Sky News this morning, brushed off calls for Deves to be disendorsed. Hume said Deves \u201cis going to be an excellent candidate for Warringah\u201d. Hume said Deves had \u201cvery strongly held opinions on an issue that\u2019s important to lots of Australians and that\u2019s fairness and equality in women\u2019s sports\u201d although \u201cthe language she used was inappropriate\u201d. Hume said: She has done the right thing by withdrawing those remarks, by admitting that that was inappropriate language that could be offensive to some people. She is a very passionate woman. She is very committed to ensuring that women and girls can compete in sport on an equal and fair basis. And I think that that\u2019s something that a lot of Australians would agree with. The comments that she made on social media have gone, they have been withdrawn, she agrees that they were wrong. But her commitment to the cause remains and I think that that is admirable. At this point it\u2019s worth reminding readers that Australia\u2019s Sex Discrimination Act already says it is legal \u201cto discriminate on the ground of sex, gender identity or intersex status by excluding persons from participation in any competitive sporting activity in which the strength, stamina or physique of competitors is relevant\u201d. The NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, has called for Deves to be disendorsed, saying: This is not the 1950s. This is not an intolerant society. These kinds of horrendous views are not OK, and I\u2019m sure the voters of Warringah agree. Here\u2019s a lovely story in The Advertiser, which reports the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young has taken the weekend off from campaigning to marry Ben Oquist, the executive director of Canberra think tank the Australia Institute. Congratulations to the happy couple! via AAP: The Morrison government would reintroduce parts of its scrapped industrial relations bill to parliament if re-elected. The government last year dumped its omnibus bill after failing to secure votes on parts of the legislation. Provisions to criminalise wage theft and changes to enterprise bargaining were scrapped, as were award simplification and the ability to lock work sites into eight-year pay agreements for major projects. But prime minister Scott Morrison has flagged the bill will be reintroduced to parliament if the Coalition wins the federal election on May 21. \u201c[It will ensure] that we can go forward and pursue those legislative changes that we wanted to pursue,\u201d he told reporters in Melbourne on Saturday. \u201cRemember, they were the product of getting unions together, employers together, over countless numbers of hours to ensure that we can come up with practical things that would make the industrial relations system work better. And the Labor party rejected it.\u201d It came after Labor promised to legislate a federal anti-corruption commission by the end of the year if they win government. My colleagues Josh Butler and Sarah Martin report this morning that the Australian Electoral Commission and Facebook have voiced alarm at a bubbling campaign from minor party candidates raising baseless claims about election fraud or ballots being altered, warning of \u201cdangerous\u201d voter integrity misinformation being imported from the United States. The AEC said it has successfully applied to Facebook to take action against misinformation in the lead-up to the election, with at least five posts removed and two pages being taken down entirely. Read the full story here: Good morning, Lisa Cox here to take you through the morning. We\u2019re expecting Scott Morrison will name Anne Ruston as the future health minister if the Coalition is re-elected on May 21. Ruston, whose appointment was foreshadowed last week, would replace Greg Hunt who intends to retire from politics. Sit back as we take you through Easter Sunday on the campaign trail."

            "content": "\u201cDoctor, what did they do to him? Dad just doesn\u2019t look the same. Please help him!\u201d Of all the overnight admissions to the hospital, he looks the worst and the daughter\u2019s cry pierces our heart. A year ago, a prolonged surgery and trips back to theatre to battle the complications affected his memory such that his equally elderly wife was no longer able to care for his needs and he entered a nursing home. One day, he develops a fever at the worst time, on a Friday afternoon. No doctor can visit him, and the nursing home quickly bundles him into an ambulance. The private hospital diagnoses a mild chest infection but now, it is Friday night, and the nursing home won\u2019t have him back, citing a staff shortage. Under bright lights and noise, he becomes delirious. That night, he is prescribed a \u201cgentle\u201d sedative and when he grows more confused, an antipsychotic is added on top of the sedatives he was already taking. Then, following his attempts to free himself from bed, the sedative doses are increased. By Wednesday, his situation is so dire that the private hospital transfers him out to the public hospital, citing a lack of resources. As if this chain of events isn\u2019t galling enough, this is what happens next. Shifted to another environment, his confusion worsens, and he takes a swipe at the \u201cants\u201d. Thankfully, the astute resident who assesses him recognises that the answer to his problem is not more sedation but less. She correctly diagnoses that a dangerous cocktail of sedatives has caused a distressing, and potentially fatal, problem. The dishevelled patient is lying on a mattress placed on the floor, but he is now so still that I check his pulse to ensure he is alive. His sunken face and unstained hospital gown are a reminder that he has not eaten in days. His daughter is a nurse who observes that her father\u2019s entire demeanour changed when he was prescribed sedation at the nursing home. The medication was initially charted as \u201cprn\u201d, pro re nata, Latin for when necessary, but within weeks, he was receiving nightly sedation because the staff said he slept better. Her initial relief was replaced by concern when she noticed that he had become slower, less engaged, and less confident walking. Cognisant that he could have progressive dementia, she nevertheless felt that the onset of his symptoms coincided so strongly with sedation that it warranted a drug review, only to be told that that was a \u201cmedical decision\u201d. Given her stoic attempts to connect the dots, I feel contrite telling her that the geriatrician also agrees that her concern was justified. I make no promises as we set out to make things better. He is assigned a senior nurse who gently reorientates him several times a day. A student coaxes him to eat and sit out of bed. As he regains alertness, she plays a repetitive game of cards, smiling that it\u2019s either that or putting up with the wandering. His daughter comes in after work and thumbs through old photos with her father. She feeds him dinner before going home, and tired from the days\u2019 activities, he falls asleep soundly, without sedation. His dementia persists but his days aren\u2019t as fraught. He is pleasant and calm and his daughter brands his recovery a miracle but what I see is that just like raising a child, it took a village to wean him off potent sedatives that were causing more harm than good. It is no surprise that this kind of involved care is simply unavailable in nursing homes. Antipsychotics, traditionally used for schizophrenia, are now commonly used for the behavioural symptoms of dementia. They show modest efficacy at best but often cause confusion and somnolence. Benzodiazepines are prescribed for insomnia, anxiety and agitation. While they can be effective in the short term, they are associated with the risk of confusion, falls and dependence. The aged care royal commission singled out the use of chemical restraints as an area of immediate action. It is estimated that roughly 10% of residents require some form of sedation to preserve their wellbeing but far, far more are prescribed drugs to make them more pliant. Last week, the Australian Senate approved legislation mandating the round-the-clock presence of a registered nurse in every nursing home. But given the protean vulnerabilities of residents, it is hard to imagine one nurse shouldering the whole burden of supervising sedation. Add the healthcare skills shortage to warnings that employing a registered nurse will make businesses unviable, and it\u2019s doubtful that this change will be meaningful on its own. Could there be a better model of care? Australian researchers recruited 150 nursing homes containing more than 12,000 patients and found that at baseline, 37% of residents received daily sedation. Accounting for \u201cas needed\u201d sedation, the figure jumped to a worrying 54%. Next, they designed an interactive program to educate aged care workers about best practice in sedation. The results were impressive. Forty-one per cent of participating nursing home residents either reduced or ceased sedatives compared to a 4% rate reported in routine practice. The drugs were not replaced by substitutes. Contrary to expectations, reducing sedation did not lead to worsening behaviour but in fact improved the capacity to engage. The reduction in drug use was sustained and, unsurprisingly, the workers liked the program. A key element of success was the team of a \u201cchampion\u201d nurse, pharmacist and doctor, each with a different perspective. One imagines that if the pharmacist asked, \u201cWhy is this patient on an antipsychotic?\u201d, no one replied \u201cBecause the doctor said so\u201d. And the nurse was elevated as a model of good practice. In other words, this was medical care that pushed hierarchy aside and put the patient at the centre. Education, collaboration and the headspace to devote to an alarming healthcare practice that robs many elders of vitality and life in their twilight years \u2013 surely this is what we would all want for ourselves and our loved ones. But I can\u2019t help thinking that underlying all of this is another fundamental notion \u2013 that a society marks itself by how it cares for its elderly. Here, the responsibility falls to each of us to regard our elders with respect, advocate for their rights and refuse to consign them to a forgotten existence in a nursing home, known miserably as God\u2019s waiting room. This is the standard our elders deserve. Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar. Her latest book is called A Better Death"

Pelosi received a positive test result for Covid-19 and is asymptomatic, her spokesperson, Drew Hammill, said on Thursday in a tweet. He said she had tested negative earlier in the week. \u201cThe speaker is fully vaccinated and boosted, and is thankful for the robust protection the vaccine has provided,\u201d Hammill said. Pelosi will \u201cquarantine consistent with CDC guidance, and encourages everyone to get vaccinated, boosted and test regularly\u201d, he said. The 82-year-old Democratic leader\u2019s announcement came ahead of her weekly press appearance on Capitol Hill. The House is set to start a two-week spring recess. Pelosi also postponed a planned congressional delegation trip to Asia she was scheduled to lead. The diagnosis comes amid a string of positive Covid-19 diagnoses on Capitol Hill after numerous government officials attended Washington\u2019s Gridiron Club and Foundation dinner on Saturday evening. According to Hamill, Pelosi did not attend the dinner but a handful of officials tested positive after the gala. Those include the attorney general, Merrick Garland, commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, and Representatives Joaqu\u00edn Castro and Adam Schiff. According to the dinner invitation, guests were required to \u201cbring a picture ID and vaccine documents either on paper, in pictures on phones or through Apps like Bindle or Clear\u201d. Despite the vaccine requirement, organizers did not require attendees to take a Covid-19 test before attending the dinner. Representatives Katherine Clark and Scott Peters also announced on Wednesday that they had tested positive for Covid-19, although neither of them attended the dinner. Other Capitol Hill officials who tested positive this week include Jamal Simmons, Vice-President Kamala Harris\u2019s communication director. The vice-president\u2019s office announced that he \u201cwas in close contact to the vice-president as defined by CDC guidance\u201d and that Harris \u201cplans to continue with her public schedule\u201d. On Wednesday, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said great precautions were taken to protect Biden from Covid-19 and that anyone who meets or travels with him is required to get tested beforehand. When asked about other public events at the White House in which Biden is often seen without a mask, Psaki replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not at public events \u2013 I\u2019m talking about at meetings, but again, I can check on the protocols for public events.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-04-29T06:00:32Z",
            "content": "Scores of severely ill Covid-19 sufferers survived because they were given the NHS\u2019s highest form of intensive care in which an artificial lung breathes for them, a study has found. Patients in the UK who underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were more likely to survive than those who did not have the treatment, according to the research. People whose breathing capacity had collapsed were more likely to stay alive if they had ECMO rather than only a spell on a mechanical ventilator. That is the key finding of an analysis of 1,363 people treated for severe Covid using a ventilator in the UK in between March 2020 and February 2021. They included 243 who were taken by ambulance to either Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 or the Royal Brompton and Harefield hospital trust in London to try to save their lives using ECMO. The other 1,120 were known as what doctors called \u201cperceived futility\u201d cases \u2013 those it was deemed inappropriate to put on ECMO because they were considered too old and sick to survive Covid, and ECMO was thought unlikely to change their outcome. Doctors also had to consider who would benefit most from the limited availability of artificial life support, which is costly and labour-intensive, at the two specialist centres. The 243 were matched by computer analysis for their similarity of personal profile and symptoms with 206 of the 1,120 patients who did not receive ECMO to compare their outcomes. The study, which has been published in the journal Intensive Care Medicine, found that 44% of the non-ECMO group died, while mortality was much lower among those who had the treatment at 26%. During ECMO, blood is taken out of the unconscious patient\u2019s body, put into an oxygenator, has oxygen added and carbon dioxide removed, and is then reinserted into the patient. The hope is that the extra oxygen will improve patients breathing enough to help them pull through. \u201cECMO had a substantial effect at saving lives in the UK. Lives were saved due to the significant effort on the part of NHS staff to ramp up ECMO provision to provide service for as many [patients] as possible,\u201d said Dr Luigi Camporota, a consultant in intensive care medicine at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 who was one of the co-authors. \u201cOur findings suggest that ECMO delivery at specialist SRF [severe respiratory failure] centres confers significant survival benefit, compared to matched patients who received conventional therapy in referring centres,\u201d he said. NHS bosses believe ECMO saved several hundred lives during the pandemic. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England\u2019s national medical director, said: \u201cThis study is a testament to the incredible hard work of NHS staff over the last two years who have treated more than 700,000 Covid-19 patients in hospital including on ECMO machines, which have helped save hundreds of lives.\u201d The survival from Covid thanks to ECMO seen in the study is higher than in other studies of its use conducted in other countries. However, the results are not directly comparable because of differences between them such as in the selection criteria for deciding which patients received ECMO and whether people were treated in a general hospital or specialist centre, such as the two hospital trusts in the capital. In this study, 22.9% of the ECMO and 52.9% of the non-ECMO patients died during the first wave of Covid. Mortality rose in both during the second wave, which occurred during winter 2020-21, to 26.1% and 62.4% respectively. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 April 2022. Carbon dioxide is removed from the blood during ECMO, not added as an earlier version said."

            "content": "Growing numbers of prominent members of Congress and senior staffers in Washington DC are contracting Covid-19, sparking concerns about the risk to Joe Biden as unmasked events increase at the White House. Celebrations were being held on Friday at the White House for the Senate confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson for the supreme court and the event was happening out of doors, said the press secretary, Jen Psaki, who missed the US president\u2019s trip to Europe last month after testing positive for coronavirus. The Georgia Democratic senator Raphael Warnock tested positive on Thursday shortly after voting in the Senate chamber to confirm Jackson. Vice-President Kamala Harris, in her dual role as president of the Senate, officially announced the confirmation vote result for Jackson on Thursday afternoon, sitting mask-less on the dais, beaming as she marked the historic moment, and attended Jackson\u2019s celebration at the White House on Friday, although her communications director has been infected. And the House of Representatives speaker, Nancy Pelosi, tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday as well, after appearing unmasked at crowded indoor events with Biden on Tuesday and Wednesday. Pelosi is the highest-ranking politician to contract Covid-19 since President Donald Trump was hospitalized with coronavirus in October 2020. While Biden tested negative after his interactions with Pelosi, the White House acknowledged that Biden could test positive in the coming days. \u201cIt is possible he will test positive for Covid at some point,\u201d said the White House communications director, Kate Bedingfield, on CNN, noting that with antiviral treatments and vaccines \u201cpeople are out living their lives and certainly the president of the United States is doing that\u201d. The Republican senator Susan Collins of Maine tested positive for Covid-19 and at least eight House representatives have also tested positive for Covid-19, along with the commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, who announced that she tested positive on Wednesday. Capitol Hill\u2019s latest string of diagnoses came after several government officials attended a dinner held by Washington\u2019s Gridiron Club and Foundation, the journalistic organization, on Saturday, which many are calling a \u201csuper-spreader\u201d event. Though Pelosi did not attend Saturday\u2019s dinner, a growing number of officials who attended the gala have tested positive including the attorney general, Merrick Garland, who tested positive on Wednesday, Raimondo, Harris\u2019s communication director, Jamal Simmons, and other prominent figures. Harris had been in close contact with Simmons, who tested positive on Wednesday after the Gridiron dinner, said Harris\u2019s press secretary, Kirsten Allen. Simmons also attended events with Biden after Saturday\u2019s event, and was pictured at an event in the White House East Room celebrating the Affordable Care Act, along with former president Barack Obama and Harris on Tuesday. At least 37 positive Covid-19 cases have come out of Saturday\u2019s event, according to a letter sent by the Gridiron Club to its members. In a statement made on Wednesday, the Gridiron Club president, Tom DeFrank, said \u201cthere is no way of being certain about when they first contracted Covid. \u201cBut they did interact with other guests during the night and we have to be realistic and expect some more cases,\u201d said DeFrank. \u201cExcept in cases of public officials who have on their own disclosed their status, we will protect the privacy of guests who test positive.\u201d While guests at Saturday\u2019s dinner were required to show proof of vaccination, a negative Covid test before the event was not mandated. Amid an uptick of Covid-19 cases in Washington DC and among several politicians, lawmakers excluded $15bn in pandemic aid from a spending bill, cutting off access to vaccinations, Covid-19 tests and care for those without insurance. Many cities, including Washington DC, have also dropped indoor mask mandates and vaccine requirements. The US will also probably have a rise in cases in the next several weeks, said Dr Anthony Fauci, with a surge expected in the fall. The last time there was a supreme court confirmation celebration at the White House it was for now-associate justice Amy Coney Barrett and several Republicans contracted Covid. The main event was held outside but there was a crowded reception indoors, shortly before the November 2020 presidential election \u2013 and before there was an approved vaccination for Covid."

            "content": "India has been accused of attempting to delay an effort by the World Health Organization to revise the global death toll from Covid-19 after its calculations suggested that the country had undercounted its dead by an estimated 3.5 million. India\u2019s official number of deaths from Covid is 520,000. But according to in-depth analysis and investigations into the data by WHO, the total is more than 4 million, which would be by far the highest country death toll in the world. The figure tallies with previous estimates made by scientists, data analysts and medical journals that the true number of deaths from Covid in India was up to 10 times higher than that recorded in official statistics. After the country was engulfed in a devastating second wave in April 2021, central and state governments were accused of covering up the real numbers of those died from the virus in order to deflect accusations that not enough was done to prevent its spread or provide adequate healthcare, medicine and oxygen. According to reports, the WHO had wanted to release the data in January but have received considerable pushback from the Indian government, which have refused to accept the figure and methodology as correct. The WHO has stated it now intend to publish this month the revised data, which estimates 15 million people have died from Covid, more than double the 6 million known deaths. The updated figure, which is drawn from excess death data among other figures, also includes those who died from other illnesses but could not be treated because of Covid. Addressing a New York Times report in which the accusation was made, the Indian government said it was in discussion with the WHO. \u201cIndia\u2019s basic objection has not been with the result (whatever they might have been) but rather the methodology adopted for the same,\u201d it said in an statement, which alleged the mathematical modelling was \u201cquestionable\u201d and \u201cstatistically unproven\u201d. However, Jon Wakefield, a professor of statistics and biostatistics at the University of Washington who was one of those involved in the modelling for the WHO, released a statement that explained the methodology in detail and rebutted the claims made by the Indian government about the veracity of the modelling. There are fears India may be facing another imminent wave of coronavirus after daily cases jumped by 90% this week and the rate of positive test results rose from 0.3% to 0.8% overnight, with much of the surge in Delhi."

His comments came as the company flagged up declining sales of its Covid vaccine, developed with the University of Oxford. Strong performances by other medicines for cancer, diabetes and other conditions catapulted overall sales 60% higher to $11.4bn (\u00a39bn) in the first three months of the year, despite the pandemic affecting cancer diagnosis rates. Last month, the firm received UK regulatory approval for its long-acting Covid-19 antibody treatment Evusheld, in a boost to its coronavirus portfolio. Aimed at preventing Covid infections in immunocompromised people who cannot be vaccinated, Evusheld had already been approved in the US, France and other countries. The US government has ordered 1.7m doses. It is a combination of two long-acting antibodies that works by binding to the spike protein on the virus\u2019s membrane that causes Covid-19, preventing it from attaching to and entering human cells. \u201cThe UK is probably one of the rare developed countries in the world that has not ordered Evusheld. It\u2019s a sad situation, quite frankly, because people who are immune-compromised are really suffering from the Covid crisis,\u201d Soriot said, adding they were at greater risk now that Covid restrictions have been lifted. \u201cThey also represent a pretty large proportion of the people who are hospitalised for Covid, so they do need access to this medicine.\u201d The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker made sales of $1.1bn from the Covid jab between January and March, and $469m from Evusheld. It has moved away from not-for-profit pricing in new Covid vaccine contracts, but insists that it still supplies it at affordable rates. It reiterated that revenues from the jab are set to decline in coming quarters. Soriot explained: \u201cWe are no longer in a period of scarcity of vaccine supply. We have oversupply everywhere in the world, so what\u2019s out there needs to be used, and then we\u2019ll be able to get a better sense for reordering.\u201d He said the vaccine had shown itself to be a \u201cvery strong booster\u201d.

EU-based staff had been sent scurrying home by Brexit, no longer keen to work in a country that gave every impression of not wanting them. The price of imported ingredients was rising, thanks to increased bureaucracy and a weakened pound. Still, restaurateurs told themselves, at least things could hardly get worse. Enter coronavirus. At times over the past two years the pandemic has looked like it may be an extinction level event for hospitality. All the things initially blamed for the spread of coronavirus \u2013 touching, breathing, close quarters with other people \u2013 were just the sorts of things that went on in restaurants. They were blamed for not shutting soon enough, despite inadequate government assurances of financial support. Then they were blamed for not reopening fast enough, before being propelled by Rishi Sunak\u2019s \u201ceat out to help out\u201d scheme. After that, they were admonished for reopening too fast, when that measure proved at best premature and at worst foolish in the face of rising case numbers. Absence makes the heart grow fonder and the stomach rumble louder. Two years on from the first lockdown, after experiencing a world without restaurants, we know what we were missing. Even if you don\u2019t go to restaurants often, you\u2019ll have experienced the tingle of appreciation at being out in the world again, in elegant sociable surroundings, eating food prepared, served and washed up by others. Like the Pompidou Centre for buildings, Covid made the inner workings of restaurants clear. Nobody can feign ignorance about the money, stress and labour that goes into eating out. This new world comes with new rules. Do right by your tenants Some of the high-profile closures will be mourned more than others. Tears will flow more freely for Hix than branches of Caf\u00e9 Rouge, or Wahlburgers, the latter the actor Mark Wahlberg\u2019s attempt at creating a Covent Garden tourist trap, which barely got going before travel to London stopped and it did, too. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t coming back to central London five days a week, and I don\u2019t know when tourists will be back,\u201d says Nick Garston, an agent who specialises in restaurant properties. \u201cBut the market returned to normal remarkably fast. The big new factor is outdoor space. It\u2019s key to what people are looking for. Before, operators might have turned their nose up at a bit of pavement with a few tables, but now they\u2019ll try to make it work.\u201d While there were deals to be had during the depths of the pandemic, so far landlords have been reluctant to kick out tenants, even those who have fallen behind on the rent. Bigger agents are reluctant to write down their whole portfolio, while independents mostly recognise the strains restaurants have been under. \u201cIf you evict someone, you have a period where you\u2019re not collecting rent and then you have to market the property. You need to do the analysis.\u201d Offer as many meals as you can The recent wave of high-profile new cafes in the capital \u2013 Deco, Lighthaus, Cecilia, Norman\u2019s \u2013 is partly born from a desire to offer a more casual and flexible experience than the traditional three courses. It also lends itself naturally to all-day dining and all-day revenues. Even Gunpowder, contemporary Indian restaurants in London better known for fiery lamb cutlets, is experimenting with breakfast. Dishoom was prescient. Offer something special \u201cI think, post-pandemic, people are excited about a heightened dining experience,\u201d says Jeremy Chan, the head chef of St James\u2019s two-Michelin-starred Ikoyi. \u201cPeople are happy to spend on quality. We do 50 covers at \u00a3250 a head. The high earners have saved so much over the past few years they\u2019re ready to splash out.\u201d Whether business or pleasure, lunch is a time for celebration \u201cWe have seen the return of the business lunch in a big way,\u201d says Russell Norman of Brutto in Clerkenwell. \u201cIf you can afford the time and the expense of dining with a colleague or a client \u2013 particularly if you have a work expense account \u2013 then it seems people are doing that again after a fall, even pre-Covid. It\u2019s very heartening to see a bottle of wine and a few negronis on most of our lunch tables.\u201d The sommeliers agree. \u201cThursday is the new Friday,\u201d says Joshua Castle, head sommelier at London\u2019s Noble Rot. \u201cThere has been a huge uptick of interest in champagne. We thought people would have recalibrated their understanding of markups after so long at home, but it hasn\u2019t happened. Drinkers are trading up and spending more.\u201d Embrace technology \u201cTechnology has become part of the customer experience now,\u201d says Mital Morar, the founder of the Manchester-based retail and hospitality operation the Store Group. \u201cCovid forced us to move things along so quickly and it\u2019s now embedded in what people expect.\u201d The Sunday app, launched by the founders of the Big Mamma group, has experienced rapid take-up. QR codes are here to stay, at least in casual chains, because they save the staff time \u2013 five minutes per table adds up in a busy restaurant \u2013 and thereby save the owners money. Appreciate the small things The return to dining out has made diners more appreciative of the flourishes restaurants offer beyond the food and drink. \u201cPeople are loving service,\u201d says Molly Steemson, head of wine at Sessions Arts Club in east London. \u201cAll the thoughtful things you don\u2019t get at home \u2013 glassware and oyster forks and cutlery.\u201d Menus to fit the clientele \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed that people weren\u2019t travelling so far to dine out,\u201d says Mary-Ellen McTague, of Campagna at the Creameries. \u201cPre-pandemic, people were coming from the wider Greater Manchester/Cheshire area, but that just stopped. We had to completely change our business from a tasting menu setup, to being a neighbourhood restaurant serving accessible dishes,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have the same ingredients and quality, but totally different delivery.\u201d At the other end of the scale, some have gone the other way, following Marco Pierre White\u2019s rule of putting up prices in tough times. Book or don\u2019t book. No-shows are not on Before the pandemic, asking customers to book with a credit card could lead to much clutching of pearls. Now it\u2019s the norm, at least at popular inner-city restaurants. \u201cPeople are much more committed to their bookings,\u201d says Fran\u00e7ois O\u2019Neill of Maison Fran\u00e7ois in St James\u2019s. \u201cI think they have a greater understanding of how tough things have been for restaurants and the impact of last-minute cancellations or no-shows.\u201d Out of London, the opposite can apply. \u201cSpontaneous dining seems to be back,\u201d says Cecilia Gillies, of Number Eight in Sevenoaks. \u201cFollowing lockdowns, and having to book months in advance, people are enjoying their freedom and supporting local businesses. We have seen our walk-ins increase dramatically.\u201d Be mindful \u201cI\u2019ve noticed most people being very considerate and giving people space and room to pass,\u201d says Jeremy Lee, chef-proprietor at Soho\u2019s Quo Vadis. \u201cThere is consideration for those who still choose to wear masks. Cleaning is still a priority.\u201d With restrictions lifted, some customers are sticking to masks while others couldn\u2019t fling them off fast enough. Some are happy to be rammed in again cheek by jowl while others crave space. Sharing plates have become a more radical suggestion, especially among people who are not in a couple. Some customers are assiduously hand-sanitising, others are back to soap and water (we hope). \u201cPost-pandemic dining seems to be about contradictions,\u201d says Jacob Kenedy of Bocca di Lupo in central London. \u201cSome customers want staff to wear masks, others are offended by them. Some want to be close and noisy, others want distance and quiet. All seem to want one more drink than before.\u201d Prepare to pay \u201cAfter the VAT and business rates increase in April, prices will be more expensive,\u201d says Hussein Ahmad of Viewpoint Accountants, which specialises in hospitality businesses. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the restaurant taking the piss but the reality of increased food and drink costs, staff and overheads. If you want to keep going to your favourite restaurant, be prepared to pay more.\u201d Appreciate your staff \u201cStaffing remains a huge problem,\u201d says Nick Garston. \u201cNot just because of the pandemic, but Brexit, too.\u201d The situation might not be as acute as it was during the reopening phase, when Omicron stalked hospitality, but the structural problems remain. For restaurateurs, this means they will have to pay their staff more; costs that will be passed on to consumers. \u201cWe found it hard to get chefs of the right calibre,\u201d says Victor Garvey of Sola in Soho. \u201cBut we are getting there, and we are busier than ever.\u201d Eat now; you never know when you might not be able to again. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 April 2022 to remove part of a comment that had been misquoted and to correct the spelling of Hussein Ahmad\u2019s name."

            "content": "Yet another hidden cost of Covid-19 was revealed on Thursday as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention presented new data showing how the pandemic has dramatically impeded the US effort to vaccinate kids for other diseases. According to the CDC\u2019s report, national vaccine coverage among American children in kindergarten dropped from 95% to below 94% in the past year \u2013 which may seem like a small amount but meant 350,000 fewer children were vaccinated against common diseases. \u201cOverall, today\u2019s findings support previous data showing a concerning decline in childhood immunizations that began in March 2020,\u201d Shannon Stokley, the CDC\u2019s immunization services deputy division director, said in a press conference on Thursday. Another 400,000 kids were absent from kindergarten altogether during the 2020-2021 school year, the data showed. \u201cThese children too, might not be up to date on their routine vaccinations, further evidence of how pandemic-related disruptions to healthcare and education could have lingering consequences for school-age children,\u201d the CDC report said. Some of the reasons for the lower vaccination rates included reluctance to schedule appointments, reduced access to them, so-called \u201cprovisional\u201d school enrollment, the easing of vaccination requirements for remote learners, fewer parents submitting documents and less time for school nurses to follow up with unvaccinated students. States and schools also told the CDC that there were fewer staff members to assess kindergarten vaccination coverage, and a lower response rate from schools, both due to Covid-19. \u201cThe CDC provides vaccines for nearly half of America\u2019s children through the Vaccines for Children program,\u201d Stokley said. \u201cAnd over the last two years, orders for distribution of routine vaccines are down more than 10% compared to before the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWe are concerned that missed routine vaccinations could leave children vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough which are extremely dangerous and can be very serious, especially for babies and young children.\u201d In a study published last October in JAMA Pediatrics, Black families were found to be less likely to have their children caught up with vaccines, compared with Hispanic or Asian families. \u201cThink about where a lot of the underserved, underprivileged individuals will access care, or try to access care \u2013 those institutions that actually went into lockdown,\u201d Terrence Shirley, CEO of the Community Health Center Association of Mississippi, told the Guardian last December. Despite the drop in national vaccine rates among children, the CDC said that routine vaccination coverage still remains high, and that \u201cwe can recover ground lost during the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d The agency called for extra effort to catch students up on missed shots and to maintain high rates of routine childhood vaccinations."

            "date": "2022-04-14T23:01:15Z",
            "content": "The prospect of makeshift beds, campfire cuisine and long-drop loos used to be a turn-off for holidaymakers but new research underlines the scale of the domestic camping boom during Covid, as millions have swapped foreign sun loungers for s\u2019mores and sleeping bags. One in five British adults have been on a camping or caravan holiday since the pandemic began, according to market researchers Mintel. Of these about 4.5 million were sleeping in a tent or caravan for the first time, it estimated. With overseas trips often out of reach, spending on these kinds of trips surged to \u00a32.7bn in 2021. That was nearly 80% more than in 2020 when lockdowns decimated travel plans. The affordability of these types of holidays is traditionally the main attraction but the pandemic saw an influx of more affluent families on campsites, Mintel said. Almost four in 10 \u201cCovid campers\u201d had a household income above \u00a350,000, compared with about a fifth of those who camped or caravanned pre-crisis. \u201cMany of these customers are likely to have substituted planned holidays abroad for staycations,\u201d said John Worthington, Mintel\u2019s senior travel analyst \u2013 and it remains to be seen if they will go again as overseas travel opens up, albeit against the backdrop of a cost of living crisis. The \u201crising cost of living crisis has the potential to dampen consumer spending on all holiday types\u201d, he said. \u201cCamping and caravanning, however, hold the advantage of being seen as an affordable holiday. Our research shows that \u2018low cost\u2019 is seen as the leading attraction for consumers.\u201d He added that this part of the holiday market had prospered before when people were encountering financial hardship, such as during the 2009 recession, when they traded more expensive trips abroad for budget domestic holidays. \u201cIn the short-term, the cost of living crisis might bring in those with tighter household budgets who are cutting back on more expensive holidays, including a potential trip abroad,\u201d said Worthington. Organisations such as the Camping and Caravanning Club are among the groups to have reported strong bookings before the Easter getaway suggesting Britons, who have invested thousands pounds in a caravan or other holiday vehicles, including motorhomes and converted vans, are eager to use them again. Last year dealerships struggled to get their hands on enough vans as a growing number of under-40s, including new dog owners, bought homes on wheels. Britons also bought large quantities of camping supplies, almost cleaning out specialist stores ahead of the summer holidays."

            "date": "2022-04-10T14:49:22Z",
            "content": "If Melbourne is truly the sporting capital of the world, as locals like to brag, then it is only fitting that Formula One at Albert Park marked both the first and now latest phase of the pandemic. Two years ago, the grand prix\u2019s chaotic cancellation hours before the first practice session unmistakably heralded a troubling new era. It was one of the first major international sporting events called off due to the emerging virus. On Sunday, more than 400,000 spectators tried to put the pandemic behind them. It would be premature to say that the domestic resumption of Formula One on Australian shores marks the end of Covid-19 (the 9,510 cases and one death in Victoria on the day of the race made that much clear) but with thronging crowds and exhilarating racing, it was at least momentarily possible to forget the turmoil of the past two years. At first glance the pandemic, like the past, was a foreign country: masks were few and far between, occasional hand sanitising stations stood unloved and social distancing was impossible. Yet Covid-19\u2019s varied impact remained all too evident. The last time the world\u2019s best graced Melbourne, they were met by a sea of yellow \u2013 fans supporting local favourite Daniel Ricciardo of French team Renault. Three years and a pandemic later, the dominant colour palate had subtly shifted to bright orange; the Australian driver having moved to McLaren and the Renault name no longer visible on the grid, with the teamrebranding as Alpine. The Australian Grand Prix has always been popular but tickets to watch the street circuit racing around Albert Park Lake sold out so quickly that five new grandstands were built to increase capacity. That growth has been fuelled by Netflix\u2019s \u2018Drive to Survive\u2019, a viral sensation during lockdown that made the technical sport more accessible to audiences. It has also helped attract a more diverse demographic \u2013 according to the race organisers, 40% of attendees this year were women, up from only 25% in the past. At a time of climate crisis, skyrocketing fuel prices and war in Ukraine, 20 drivers and countless staff crisscrossing the globe to compete in petrol-guzzling speed machines seems incongruous. A small solar array at Albert Park was no doubt meant to highlight the sport\u2019s commitment to climate action; instead, the tokenistic gesture only underscored the problem \u2013 Formula One\u2019s annual carbon emissions are almost equivalent to a small nation (it has committed, rather optimistically, to net zero by 2030). The prominent sponsor signage for Aramco, the Saudi state oil company and the world\u2019s largest corporate carbon emitter, was conspicuous. So too the sport\u2019s complicity in human rights abuses. Drivers flew to Melbourne from Saudi Arabia, having contested a grand prix in the capital, Jeddah. (The first Saudi Grand Prix, in 2021, came three years after the government had executed regime critic Jamal Khashoggi.) This year the travelling circus will not visit Sochi for the Russian Grand Prix. Yet they have raced in Sochi every year since 2014, the same year Russia first invaded eastern Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Formula One\u2019s shameless sportswashing efforts will instead take the sport back to Baku, Azerbaijan (ranked \u201cnot free\u201d by Freedom House in their annual assessment of human rights and civil liberties). The season began in Bahrain, also deemed not free. But trackside at Albert Park, these concerns, along with the pandemic, were kept firmly out of mind. The top end of town convened in hospitality booths; dedicated fans with dollars to spend enjoyed sweeping grandstand views, and the rest staked out their own spot on a grassy hill or by the barricades. The guttural roar from the grandstand, as the drivers took part in their traditional pre-race exhibition lap, evoked simpler times, before \u201cCovid-safe\u201d had entered the lexicon. The race itself, won by Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc, was thrilling. The high-octane spills, daring over-takeing and chess-like tactical nous from the leading teams kept fans on the edge of their seats. For all its well-publicised flaws, for all the questions that linger around the viability of this male-dominated, carbon-intensive sport in the current era, few can deny the enthralling simplicity of Formula One. For the fans that packed into the South Melbourne venue to watch people drive really, really fast, the spectacle offered that sweet relief of escapism from a complicated reality. The pandemic is not over. Australia, and the world, are beset by challenges. But at least, after two long years, Formula One is back at Albert Park. That alone earned plenty of cheer on Sunday."

            "date": "2022-04-06T02:10:31Z",
            "content": "The understated doctor who became an unexpected star of New Zealand\u2019s pandemic has resigned after two years leading the country\u2019s Covid response. Dr Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealand\u2019s director-general of health announced his resignation on Wednesday, and said that it had been \u201ca huge privilege\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex and challenging role at any time, and the last two years I don\u2019t think could have been more complex and challenging,\u201d Bloomfield said. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking for a while about what\u2019s the right time for me to step down. It seems we\u2019re at a good point in terms of the pandemic, the response is shifting [and] I\u2019m also confident that the system is in good hands.\u201d Bloomfield was a softly-spoken public servant who became a household name, meme, and often-beloved, sometimes-controversial public figure as the country grappled with its first two years of Covid-19. During significant outbreaks, the doctor was a calm and regular fixture on television, providing daily live-streamed updates on case numbers, infections and transmissions. His presence was such a constant as the country reeled from its first waves of infections that it made headlines when he took his first day off. Bloomfield became synonymous with New Zealand\u2019s Covid response, and its success in the first stages of the pandemic in eliminating the virus and continuing normal life. While the country is now experiencing widespread Covid-19 outbreaks, high vaccination rates mean it has maintained some of the lowest death rates in the world. The doctor\u2019s prominence was perhaps itself a reflection of the country\u2019s focus on placing the advice of scientists at the heart of its Covid response, at a time when some other countries had focused on political leadership while sidelining public health officials. \u201cThere\u2019s not many public servants I have got to know as well as Dr Ashley Bloomfield,\u201d prime minister Jacinda Ardern said in a tribute to the director-general\u2019s tenure. \u201cHe has been central to our Covid success as a nation, and he\u2019s done it with humour and grace\u201d. Ardern has occasionally referenced Bloomfield poking fun at her as she tackled her own epidemiological learning curve, and said \u201cI\u2019ll keep the details of his sporadic mockery of me to myself\u201d. \u201cIn every sense of the word \u2013 through his tireless dedication, his focus on people, his calm and considered approach \u2013 he has been a true public servant,\u201d she said. Bloomfield provided New Zealand with moments of humour as well as epidemiological updates. Occasionally, his conferences provides fodder for a wave of memes: including for responding with a long, blinking silence when asked questions about then-US president Donald Trump\u2019s speculation that people should inject themselves with bleach to cure coronavirus infection; or about Instagram influencers\u2019 assertions that Covid was caused by 5G. He became a point of pride and fascination for some New Zealanders: shops sold mugs and tea towels emblazoned with his likeness and a petition was launched to name him New Zealander of the year. His fame grew as his public health announcements were set to dubstep at a music festival, informal fanclubs appeared online, and he became inspiration for some ill-advised fanfiction, including a romance novella. \u201cWhen we spoke about his decision to move on, he mentioned that he wanted to spend time with his family, and that\u2019s the least we owe him,\u201d Ardern said. According to local media outlet Stuff, Bloomfield \u201cworked 12-hour days, up to seven days a week, through much of the pandemic\u201d. Speaking to media on the afternoon of his resignation, Bloomfield spent his prepared remarks discussing the evidence for booster shots and other public health measures as winter approaches, and encouraging parents to ensure their children\u2019s vaccinations were up to date. Asked by reporters about his tenure and the way New Zealanders had responded to him, he said, \u201cthroughout the last two years I\u2019ve heard from New Zealanders all across the country, a huge number of messages of gratitude and support - not for me for me and my role but for the work that our team has done\u2026 through those very tough times and as I sat down and steeled myself to ring the minister at all hours of the day and night, [that\u2019s] one of the things that\u2019s carried me through and I know it\u2019s carried my staff through.\u201d Asked for his highlight of the past two years he said, \u201chigh vaccination rates\u201d. Asked if he had any thoughts of running for parliament, he said, emphatically, \u201cNot a jot.\u201d Bloomfield\u2019s tenure at the helm of the ministry of health has not been without controversy - the ministry has faced criticism for its failure to quickly implement programs using mental health funding, and for editing down mental health reports. The ministry also faced a court case over not sharing M\u0101ori Covid-19 vaccination data with health providers, and criticism for racial inequities in the Covid response. Bloomfield will step down at the end of July 2022, the public service commission confirmed in a statement. \u201cDr Bloomfield has demonstrated remarkable resilience and courage in leading the health system\u2019s overall response to Covid-19. That response has saved lives,\u201d Public Service Commissioner Peter Hughes said. \u201cI know many New Zealanders will also be thankful for the job he has done.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-04-08T15:45:09Z",
            "content": "The German government has buried its plans to introduce a coronavirus vaccine mandate after parliament rejected it, but says further restrictions may be inevitable to protect more vulnerable citizens. MPs voted against the draft bill on Thursday, which had it passed would have made it compulsory for over-60s to receive a vaccine, in what is seen as a humiliating defeat for the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who has long been calling for the legislation. Originally the government\u2019s plan had been for a widespread mandate to cover anyone over the age of 18. When that failed to attract enough support, it raised the age to over 50 and then to over 60. MPs rejected it by 378 to 296. The health minister, Karl Lauterbach, who has also been a firm backer of a mandate, arguing that Germany\u2019s vaccination rate among older people is too low, said on Friday that he could not rule out the need to reintroduce restrictions such as mask wearing, especially in the autumn when the virus is expected to surge. About 76% of Germans are fully vaccinated, below the government\u2019s target of 80%. Of particular concern are the 2 million \u2013 around 12% \u2013 of over-60s who are unvaccinated, a figure Lauterbach has repeatedly said is around three to four times higher in that age group than in other comparable countries such as the UK. A representative of German hospitals said on Friday that the daily rate of deaths from Covid-19 \u2013 which has been oscillating between around 200 and 300 for weeks \u2013 was \u201cscarily high\u201d, particularly when it was known that most of the deaths were likely to have been preventable. He said 80% of those being admitted to hospital with the virus were over 60, and the majority of deaths were of people who were unvaccinated. Lauterbach, a virologist who was a popular choice for health minister but has faced criticism for failing to project a positive message, said during a heated debate that he thought people had lost sight of the benefits brought by the vaccine. \u201cIf no one had been vaccinated, we would now have a perfect catastrophe and would be stuck in an all out lockdown. We must understand that,\u201d he said. He questioned whether Germans really thought it was acceptable for the country to be facing several hundred mainly avoidable deaths every day for the foreseeable future. Sahra Wagenknecht of the far-left Die Linke party, said that as long as it was not known \u201chow well the vaccine offers protection against future mutations\u201d it was wrong of the government to make it mandatory. \u201cStop trying to patronise people,\u201d she said, addressing Scholz. \u201cThe coronavirus vaccine must remain a personal decision.\u201d The vote was considered so crucial to the government that Scholz recalled the foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, from a Nato meeting in Brussels to participate. Scholz confirmed after the debate that he believed, in contrast to Lauterbach, that the debate was dead in the water. \u201cParliament has spoken very clearly,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no legislative majority for a vaccine mandate,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the reality that we now need to take as the basis for our actions.\u201d Lauterbach called the decision deeply regrettable. He has previously and repeatedly accused people who refuse a vaccination of \u201cholding the rest of the country hostage\u201d. At a recent election rally, Scholz urged people to get vaccinated. \u201cWhere\u2019s the solidarity, when it\u2019s of no concern to you whether you are infecting other people or not?\u201d he said. \u201cFreedom only functions when it means freedom for everyone.\u201d"

            "content": "A Covid-19 vaccine developed by the French pharmaceutical company Valneva has been given regulatory approval by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, bringing the total number of jabs approved for use in the UK to six. As the Covid pandemic swept the world, scientists began developing vaccines against it, with the Pfizer/BioNTech jab being the first in the UK to be authorised for emergency use by the MHRA in 2020. Since then the MHRA has approved the Moderna, Oxford/AstraZeneca, Janssen and Novavax vaccines, although, according to NHS England, Janssen and Novavax are not currently available. The UK\u2019s independent medicines regulator was the first in the world to approve the Valneva product, the MHRA said. Unlike the other approved Covid jabs, the Valneva vaccine is an inactivated whole-virus vaccine, which means the live virus was grown in a laboratory, rendered unable to infect cells, then administered to people to trigger an immune response. The MHRA said this approach was already being used for flu and polio vaccines and experts have previously suggested that Covid jabs based on the whole virus may result in a broader immune response than those that involve only the spike protein, and may work better against new variants. Results released by Valneva in October suggested the vaccine could be as effective as the Oxford jab. In addition, it is stable when stored in a standard refrigerator, which could make it easier to distribute than some other Covid jabs. Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, the chair of the independent Commission on Human Medicines, said the commission and its Covid-19 expert working group had carefully considered the evidence and advised that the benefit-risk balance was positive. \u201cThe vaccine is approved for use in people aged 18 to 50 years, with the first and second doses to be taken at least 28 days apart.\u201d Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and the chief investigator on the Valneva clinical development programme, said that while the jab had been approved it was unlikely to be available in the UK soon, as the government had cancelled its contract to buy the vaccine in September. However, he said the jab could prove more acceptable than others to some people. \u201cThe people who could theoretically benefit from it now are unvaccinated 18- to 50-year-olds who want immunisation but are hesitant about currently available vaccines,\u201d he said, adding that the Novavax jab could also appeal to this group. However, there was another hurdle. \u201cIn the UK, no one has yet been offered any choice as to which vaccine they receive,\u201d said Finn, a professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol. On Thursday it was also revealed that the MHRA had approved extending the use of the Moderna Covid jab to six- to 11-year-olds in Great Britain, an age group for which it is already authorised in Northern Ireland. At present, children aged five to 17 are only offered the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which is based on similar mRNA technology. Dr June Raine, the MHRA\u2019s chief executive, said the Moderna vaccine was safe and effective in six- to 11-year-olds, but that the age group was included in the ongoing safety surveillance of all Covid jabs. \u201cIt is for the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to advise in due course on whether six-to-11s should be offered vaccination with the Covid-19 vaccine made by Moderna as part of the deployment programme,\u201d she said. The number of deaths involving coronavirus registered each week in England and Wales has continued to increase, although levels remain well below those reached during previous Covid waves."

Of this figure, Guardian Australia understands that about 240 teachers \u2013 or 57% \u2013 have not met the requirement because they haven\u2019t received a booster shot. This is in addition to about 180 teachers who were stood down after failing to receive a first or second dose of a vaccine last year. Victoria, the Northern Territory and Western Australia are the only jurisdictions that require teachers to be triple-dosed. In New South Wales, unvaccinated teachers will be able to begin working in the state\u2019s schools from mid-May. The Australian Medical Association Victorian president, Dr Roderick McRae, said the state\u2019s challenges with getting people to have third dose of a Covid vaccine were partly due to \u201clanguage confusion\u201d over its necessity. In February, the national immunisation panel shifted its messaging from \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d to urging people to be \u201cup to date\u201d with a third booster shot. \u201cThere\u2019s been information overload in the community. Government insists on using the expression \u2018fully vaccinated\u2019 [for two doses] but it\u2019s a complete oxymoron,\u201d McRae said. \u201cWithin healthcare we are aware the third dose has been absolutely, fundamentally crucial in the management of the Omicron variant as the level of protection wanes over time.\u201d The latest department of health figures show almost 95% of Victorians aged over 12 are double vaccinated. But little over two-thirds \u2013 67.5% \u2013 of Victorians aged over 18 have received three doses. Since the beginning of the year, unvaccinated Victorian teachers have been unable to receive leave entitlements. In line with Department of Education leave guidelines, employees who failed to meet the March deadline to receive a third dose were placed on unauthorised leave, which will result in termination of employment. But the exact timing would vary from school to school and depend on how long a teacher had been on unauthorised leave, if they were fixed-term employees, when they had their second Covid vaccination jab and became eligible for a booster. A department of spokesperson said that as of Tuesday, 99.2% of public school teachers have had three doses of a Covid vaccine and were permitted to attend work. \u201cWe encourage any staff members who have not yet had their third dose to book in to protect themselves, their families and their school communities,\u201d the spokesperson said. This month, the Victorian government scrapped the seven-day isolation rule for household Covid contacts and loosened other restrictions after the state passed the peak of an Omicron wave. But unlike NSW, Victoria did not set a date for scrapping its wide-ranging vaccine mandates. Frontline critical workers such as healthcare employees, education staff and food transport workers require three doses to work in Victoria. The Victorian Transport Association has opposed the mandate, estimating about 10% of drivers had left the industry due to the vaccine requirement. The premier, Daniel Andrews, has also flagged the state could end its pandemic declaration in July, which would result in remaining health orders \u2013 including vaccine mandates \u2013 being scrapped. Some epidemiologists have called on the state to relax its vaccine mandates. But the Andrews government has argued the mandates have allowed the state to reach its high vaccination rate."

            "date": "2022-04-09T12:00:11Z",
            "content": "A British autism charity that received hundreds of thousands of pounds in national lottery funding has links to the anti-vaccine movement and is being jointly run by a campaigner who likened the Covid-19 jab rollout to a Nazi war crime. Thinking Autism also promoted unproven autism treatments in testimonials on its website and directed families to webinars by clinicians linked to the disgraced former doctor Andrew Wakefield, an investigation has found. The Charity Commission said it had opened a case into the charity and was assessing evidence passed to it by the Observer. It comes seven years after a campaigner claims she first raised concerns about Thinking Autism with the regulator and National Lottery Community Fund. Awarded charity status in 2006, Thinking Autism claims to \u201cchange lives\u201d by providing \u201chope, emotional support and practical information\u201d to autistic people and their families, and has received \u00a3389,750 from the lottery fund since 2015. It is jointly run by Joanne Allman, a vocal Covid sceptic who last year stood as a local election candidate in Sefton, Merseyside, for the Freedom Alliance, a \u201ccampaigning political party\u201d born out of the pandemic to \u201cresist attacks on medical freedom and body autonomy\u201d. On social media, Allman \u2013 who is described in records as a trustee, treasurer and director of Thinking Autism, and is unpaid in her role \u2013 dismissed Omicron as \u201cmoronic variant scariant BULLSHIT\u201d in a post on Facebook in November 2021 and last month re-shared a post on Twitter calling the vaccine rollout a \u201creckless, dangerous, insane experiment\u201d. In other posts she said PCR testing was a \u201cfraud underlying the greatest hoax in medical history\u201d and tweeted that people \u201cthe world over\u201d were being \u201ccoerced into having an experimental vaccine\u201d. Alongside a picture of the Nuremberg trials, held after the second world war to bring Nazi war criminals to justice, she wrote: \u201cHow long will we have to wait before those \u2026 who are complicit in tyranny are brought to justice for crimes against humanity?\u201d While those posts were from Allman\u2019s personal accounts, campaigners expressed safeguarding concerns for vulnerable families seeking help from Thinking Autism, which hosts conferences, online events and runs a private Facebook group. The charity itself has publicly been largely quiet on Covid-related issues, aside from announcing its opposition to vaccine passports. But it has a history of promoting misinformation dating back to at least 2014, when it shared a video in support of research by Andrew Wakefield, who was struck off the medical register for a discredited study claiming vaccines were linked to autism. Its website, meanwhile, carries testimonials for unproven autism \u201ctreatments\u201d including homeopathy and \u201cCEASE therapy\u201d, a pseudoscientific approach that claims to remove supposed toxic effects from outside sources, including vaccines. Campaigner Emma Dalmayne, who runs Autistic Inclusive Meets, a non-profit organisation that advocates for autistic people, said she first reported concerns about the charity\u2019s alleged promotion of unproven treatments to the Charity Commission and National Lottery Community Fund in 2015. She questioned why it was still operating seven years later. \u201cThe Charity Commission is potentially putting vulnerable children at risk by lending credibility to organisations like Thinking Autism,\u201d she said. Michael Marshall, project director at the Good Thinking Society, which campaigns against pseudoscience, said it was \u201cextremely troubling\u201d to see people linked to the charity \u201ctrying to undermine efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19\u201d. \u201cIf they cannot understand the importance of public health measures, and cannot refrain from baseless scaremongering about vaccines, they should not be in a position where their misinformed opinions may put children in harm\u2019s way,\u201d he said. Thinking Autism said members of the charity were \u201cfree to hold their own views\u201d and that it endorsed the rights of autistic people and their families to speak about their healthcare experiences. It said it heard from \u201chundreds of families\u201d each year thanking it for its support. \u201cThe charity does not endorse any specific view except that people with autism who are suffering from healthcare problems deserve appropriate investigations and treatments,\u201d it said. \u201cBecause healthcare is an individual and personal choice, and because we are not medical professionals but rather parent volunteers, we are explicitly clear on our website and social media that information we provide should not be construed as medical advice.\u201d Allman said the posts were made from her personal social media accounts and did not make references to autism. \u201cMy personal opinions on Covid-related issues have no bearing on my role as a director and trustee of Thinking Autism,\u201d she said. The Charity Commission said it had opened a compliance case relating to concerns raised about Thinking Autism, \u201cincluding the charity\u2019s use of social media\u201d, and was \u201ccurrently engaging with the trustees\u201d. It said it had \u201cno record\u201d of a 2015 complaint. The National Lottery Community Fund, which allocates money raised by the lottery to community groups and charities, said its funding relationship with Thinking Autism \u201creached its conclusion\u201d in 2020. In relation to the 2015 complaint it said: \u201cWe looked into it and were satisfied that the funding was being used in line with the agreed proposal.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 26 April 2022 to include reference to Joanne Allman being unpaid in her joint-running of the charity."

The committee said a failure to redress injustices has denied basic human rights to health and worsened discrimination and exclusion. In a strongly worded statement released on Friday, the group said it was concerned that the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate impact \u201cis in significant part attributed to consequences of the historic racial injustices of slavery and colonialism that remain largely unaccounted for today\u201d. The unequal distribution of vaccines between and within countries \u201cmanifests as a global system privileging those former colonial powers to the detriment of formerly colonised states and descendants of enslaved groups,\u201d the statement added. As of April 2022, only 15.21% of low-income country populations has received one vaccine dose. Peruth Nabirye, from EqualHealth\u2019s Campaign Against Racism, said it was important to hold countries where pharmaceutical companies are located accountable for fostering health inequities. She said: \u201cWe are still tied up in systems of injustice and we are at the mercy of the global north to save our lives.\u201d The Cerd statement singled out the UK, Germany and Switzerland for continuing to block a waiver on lifting intellectual property rules that would enable the redistribution and scaling-up of the Covid response. India and South Africa first proposed the temporary waiver on WTO rules for intellectual property in October 2020. Meena Jagannath, director of global programmes at Movement Law Lab and coordinator of the Global Network of Movement Lawyers, said: \u201cIt is unacceptable for states to privilege intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical companies over the human rights of people.\u201d She added: \u201cThe decision to side with pharma has deepened racial discrimination that is the product of unaddressed policies of colonialism and slavery.\u201d Cerd is a body of independent experts that monitors how member states implement the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, adopted in December 1965.

            "date": "2022-04-25T18:25:40Z",
            "content": "New evidence of the extent of the privatisation of mental healthcare in England is extremely concerning. Ministers and health bosses must explain why the independent sector is earning almost \u00a32bn a year for treating patients with psychiatric conditions \u2013 or 13.5% of NHS England\u2019s entire mental health budget. Overall, about 7% of spending is on private providers, although this rose during the pandemic. It is difficult to think of a good reason why the proportion of mentally unwell people treated by private providers should be so much higher than the proportion of those with other conditions. If patient safety and care quality were the only considerations, extremely vulnerable mental health patients would seem to be among the least suitable candidates for outsourcing. After all, the general rule is that while standardised treatments such as cataract operations can be delivered via the independent sector relatively straightforwardly, more complex and long-term work is kept in-house. Why inpatient psychiatric care for under-18s should defy this rule, with 55% of all NHS-funded treatment delivered privately, is a troubling question for anyone who cares about the future of healthcare. The short answer, of course, is that the NHS does not have the resources or the staff to do this work itself. This leaves doctors and managers with no choice, as one psychiatrist described at the weekend. Years of underinvestment in the health service have hit the mental health sector hard. Currently, there are 10,123 private mental health beds in England (the NHS has 17,610) and private mental health providers earn 91% of their income from the NHS. But psychiatrists, the Care Quality Commission and NHS England\u2019s national mental health director, Claire Murdoch, have all raised concerns about the quality of the care on offer. In 2019, the Priory group was fined \u00a3300,000 over failings that led to the death of a 14-year-old girl, Amy El-Keria. Last week, an inquest jury found that neglect contributed to the death of Matthew Caseby in another Priory facility. But there needs to be a longer answer too \u2013 one that addresses the underlying question of why, with average profit margins of 15%-20%, it has been made so easy to make money out of acute psychological distress. Also, whether the health and care bill that is on its way through parliament will lead to improvements or to further fragmentation, as the British Medical Association has warned that it could. Comparisons of the patient safety records of public and private providers are made difficult by a lack of data. Recent evidence has revealed grave failings in NHS hospitals too. But one doesn\u2019t have to pretend that all is well in the public sector to reject as shameful the situation whereby businesses are enabled to make huge profits from delivering substandard care with weak oversight and minimal accountability. Patients and their families deserve better."

            "date": "2022-04-25T17:59:48Z",
            "content": "The main private mental health hospital chains that treat NHS patients have been criticised by coroners and inquest juries dozens of times over the last decade for providing unsafe care. The Priory, Cygnet and Elysium have been censured at least 37 times for mistakes and lapses in care that were involved in the deaths of patients, including several children. After hearing evidence in court, coroners or inquest juries have identified serious failings in the care given to 23 patients who died while being treated at a Priory hospital since 2012, 11 who were in a Cygnet facility and three who were residents in an Elysium unit. They have found the same mistakes happening again and again at private units. Key failings have included staff not observing potentially suicidal patients properly, ignoring relatives\u2019 concerns about the danger of suicide, and wrongly assessing that risk. The Guardian disclosed on Sunday that the three firms earn more than half of the \u00a32bn a year that the NHS in England now spends outsourcing mental health care because it has too few beds. Deborah Coles, the director of the charity Inquest, which monitors the deaths of people while mental health inpatients, said: \u201cThe same basic failings are leading to preventable deaths of men, women and children. Persistent issues including with risk assessments, observations, ligature points and communication amongst staff or with families are costing lives. \u201cFor years inspections, inquests and investigations have repeatedly exposed neglect and harmful practices. Yet the NHS continues to commission these providers, at significant public expense.\u201d In some cases the coroner has been so concerned by the evidence they have heard that they have issued a prevention of future deaths (PFD) notice \u2013 a legal warning to a public or private entity to make urgent changes to reduce the risk of someone else dying in the same circumstances. On Monday Louise Hunt, the senior coroner for Birmingham, issued a PFD ordering the Priory to make a series of changes following the death in September 2020 of 23-year-old Matthew Caseby, who died after absconding over a fence at the back of its hospital in Birmingham. The Priory had taken no action despite a previous absconsion over the same fence in October 2019. Hunt also advised the Department of Health and Social Care to bring in national guidelines for the height of perimeter fences and security in the outside areas of acute mental health units. Last month an inquest jury found that 17-year-old Chelsea Blue Mooney had died in April 2021 \u201cas a result of insufficient care, crucially inadequate observations and the delays in emergency response\u201d at the Cygnet hospital in Sheffield. Last November, at the inquest into the death in 2019 of 16-year-old Nadia Shah at the Potters Bar Clinic in Hertfordshire run by Elysium, the jury found it was due to \u201cmisadventure contributed to by the inadequate care at the Potters Bar Clinic\u201d. They cited six specific flaws, including mistakes in observation and \u201ca failure to adequately report observations to properly inform assessment of risk\u201d. It is unknown how many times NHS mental health trusts have been criticised by coroners or juries over the same period. However, in 2019 the Care Quality Commission, the NHS watchdog, said there was a \u201cdisparity in performance\u201d on safety between private and NHS mental health units. The Priory said that the figures for the 23 occasions on which it has been censured by a coroner or inquest were \u201cmisleading and presented without any context\u201d. It added: \u201cPriory, as the UK\u2019s largest independent mental health provider, has safely and successfully treated tens of thousands of patients over the last 10 years, as a trusted partner to the NHS. Deaths are extremely rare.\u201d A Cygnet spokesperson said: \u201cAny incident in which a service user has died is heartbreaking for everyone involved. Care for people with mental health conditions is challenging and our staff work incredibly hard to ensure the safety and wellbeing of those in our care.\u201d Cygnet learns lessons from every death to prevent further fatalities, they added. In a statement Elysium said: \u201cOver the last six years, tragically a small number of deaths have occurred in our high acuity services and our thoughts remain with each affected family. On the occasions when inquests into these deaths have made important recommendations we have acted swiftly and decisively.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "content": "As a psychiatrist, I reserve admission to a mental health hospital bed for only the most unwell patients, whose mental health has collapsed. But despite my very best efforts to keep as many patients as I can out of hospital, bed pressures pervade every aspect of my daily work. The decision about whether or not we can admit a patient with a psychotic relapse who is not eating or drinking, for example, must first be agreed by the trust\u2019s bed-management team. The woeful and worsening scarcity of NHS mental health beds forces psychiatrists to make very difficult judgments about a patient\u2019s need for care and the risk they pose. Acting in the best interests of the patient often seems secondary to the need to manage our hospital\u2019s limited bed capacity. If, after much robust discussion with bed management, I get the green light to admit someone, I immediately become anxious that my patient will be sent to a private sector \u201coverspill\u201d bed, where I can be fairly sure that they will receive much poorer care than they would receive in the NHS. I am not for one moment suggesting that being an inpatient in one of England\u2019s underfunded NHS mental health hospitals is a pleasant experience. Most of our wards are dilapidated. Between six and eight patients share a single bathroom. Decades of underinvestment in mental health trusts is there for all to see. If the government is serious about mental health, it needs to start rebuilding our wards to provide a proper therapeutic environment and greater dignity in the care of our patients. And yet, the quality of care that we provide in the NHS for our most unwell patients is much better than they would receive in the private sector. Over the past 20 years, the NHS has come to rely more and more heavily on the private sector, as our own stock of mental health beds has fallen. This is despite the ever-increasing need and demand for inpatient mental health care. It is a hugely shortsighted policy which has left NHS mental health services at the mercy of companies whose purpose is to make a profit. Many NHS psychiatrists are very concerned about this increasing dependence on the private sector, mainly because the quality of care there is highly variable and also because some private mental health operators use some very questionable practices. The idea that private provision of mental health care is \u201cbetter\u201d than NHS care is a myth. Countless Care Quality Commission inspection reports have shown that private mental health hospitals suffer from serious staffing problems. The private mental health sector relies heavily on temporary staff, has few full-time psychiatrists of its own and relies heavily on NHS psychiatrists working there one or two days a week. The quality of inpatient therapeutic care is often poor, and the follow-up care after discharge can be nonexistent and badly coordinated with NHS community teams. Once private firms have banked the NHS fees from someone\u2019s stay as an inpatient, they often seem to then forget about the patient, whereas we in the NHS continue to support them for as long as they need. Private beds are sometimes a long way from the patient\u2019s home, family and friends, which is distressing for everyone. I have lost count of the number of families who have complained that their loved ones are in a private hospital far away and that they are therefore unable to visit them. Out-of-area care reduces the support for the patient when they are in hospital, can lead to them staying longer, compromises effective and timely discharge planning and, crucially, reduces their chances of recovery. Private mental health hospitals often seem to hold on to NHS patients for longer than necessary. They have no incentive to discharge patients and are paid to keep their beds filled, with a guaranteed income from the taxpayer. Longer than needed inpatient stays are bad for patients. When an inpatient stay lasts for many months, the person can become institutionalised and deskilled in everyday tasks. Some private hospitals also tell patients what they want to hear. They can agree too readily with the patient\u2019s self-diagnosis. A diagnosis of personality disorder in the NHS often becomes bipolar disorder in the private sector. Again, this seems to be all about filling their beds and boosting their profits. Private care of NHS mental health patients is bad for patients, bad for the NHS and bad for taxpayers. The government needs to face up to this by building more NHS inpatient mental health bed capacity. The author is a psychiatrist working at a London mental health trust"

Mental health services for children and young people were already very strained going into the pandemic and the stresses have been exacerbated during the last two years, with forecasts of up to 1.5 million youngsters needing new or additional support. The reality is stark. Despite everything NHS leaders and their teams are doing, a generation is now facing longer waits for treatment. We need to act now, as we know that 50% of adult mental health problems start in childhood. Unless the government acts to urgently bring forward a comprehensive plan to respond to the growing demand for mental healthcare in England, including a significant expansion of the mental health workforce, this situation will only get worse. A key element of this recovery plan must include a sharp focus on providing early, targeted and preventive support for children and young people who have, or are at risk of having, mental health issues, as this is an area that has seen a significant increase during the Covid pandemic.

I took early retirement partly because a psychiatric crisis service without enough beds is dangerous: it is like a surgeon being asked to operate without instruments. Many clinicians working in mental health are wasting time looking for non-existent NHS beds instead of treating patients. Once in a private sector bed, patients with common treatable mental health problems stay there, as private hospitals lack the multidisciplinary skills that get people better. Also, private hospitals have the perverse incentive that they do not get paid if they discharge patients. Private sector \u201ccare\u201d is a false economy \u2013 another example of failed Tory privatisation.

            "content": "Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis has deteriorated into a medical crisis, with the top medical union declaring a national health emergency over a life-threatening shortage of drugs. On Tuesday the country\u2019s most powerful trade union, the Government Medical Officers\u2019 Association (GMOA), called a meeting and declared a medical crisis as doctors and hospitals reported a widespread lack of medicine. The south Asian country is in the grip of the worst financial crisis in its history, with record inflation leading to shortages of fuel and food, and crippling hours-long power blackouts imposed. A state of emergency has been declared after mass protests erupted across the country calling for President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to step down. On Monday Rajapaska\u2019s entire cabinet resigned, and his ruling government has lost its parliamentary majority after a mass wave of defections. Sri Lanka\u2019s lack of foreign currency reserves has had a devastating impact on the availability of medicine. More than 85% of pharmaceutical products in the country are imported, and these are paid for in US dollars. If dollars are not available then drugs cannot be bought. The Sri Lanka Chamber of Pharmaceutical Industry warned last month that 5% of drugs were out of stock and the problem was likely to worsen. The GMOA accused the government of jeopardising Sri Lanka\u2019s renowned universal healthcare system, which gives all citizens access to free state healthcare. \u201cBoth the government and health ministry have failed to prevent a complete breakdown of the medical system,\u201d it said. Gotabhaya Ranasinghe, a cardiologist at the national hospital of Sri Lanka in Colombo, said hospitals were running out of medicines, and many lives were at stake. \u201cThere are important heart medications, medicines for blood pressure, heart attacks, all are running out. I have heard that many cancer drugs are also not available any more, so it is a very worrying situation,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople can already visibly see the impact of the food crisis and the fuel crisis but the medical crisis is only just beginning. As a doctor it feels terrible to know that I can\u2019t prescribe medicines and so a patient\u2019s life is put in danger. I don\u2019t think the politicians fully understand the impact.\u201d Ranasinghe said he could not see any silver lining to the economic situation, and he pleaded for the international community to provide vital drugs. \u201cPeople are struggling, they are out on the streets, but we are stuck in a terrible limbo and I can\u2019t see a way out of it,\u201d he said. The medicine shortage has been exacerbated by low taxes, meaning little money has been spent on healthcare, and strict price regulation on drugs introduced by the former government and continued under the Rajapaksa regime. The low price caps have meant that as the Sri Lankan rupee has been devalued and domestic and global inflation has rocketed, it has no longer been financially viable for importers to bring certain medicines into the country, leading to certain drugs being pulled. \u201cThe situation for healthcare has been getting steadily worse over the past six months, with no immediate prospect of a turnaround,\u201d said Ravindra Rannan-Eliya, the executive director of the Institute for Health Policy in Colombo. \u201cEven for those who have money in their pocket, there are no medicines to buy at the pharmacies.\u201d On Tuesday the political situation was thrown into further turmoil when the ruling coalition, led by Rajapaksa, lost its parliamentary majority after 41 legislators from the president\u2019s coalition partner, the Sri Lanka Freedom party (SLFP), declared they would be independent. \u201cOur party is on the side of the people,\u201d said Maithripala Sirisena, the SLFP leader. It came a day after the entire cabinet resigned and the opposition refused to form a unity government with Rajapaksa, instead calling for him to resign, which he has refused to do. The newly appointed finance minister resigned less than 24 hours after taking up the post, and protests across the country showed no sign of abating as police used teargas and water cannon and a curfew was imposed. \u201cWe can see from what\u2019s happening on the streets and in our public surveys that people have just lost all faith in the system,\u201d said Rannan-Eliya."

            "date": "2022-04-01T05:27:39Z",
            "content": "Nearly 50 people were injured after authorities used teargas and water cannon to drive back a crowd that stormed the home of Sri Lankan president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, amid anger over the government\u2019s handling of the nation\u2019s deepening economic crisis. The crisis, the worst in living memory, has caused massive discontent, with people unable to find gas for cooking, medicines, fuel and basic items of food such as milk powder because the country has run out of foreign currency to pay for imported goods. A crowd of hundreds of people chanted for Rajapaksa and the entire cabinet to resign over his handling of the crisis. Videos circulating on social media showed the protesters shouting \u201clunatic go home\u201d. The Rajapaksa family rule the island. The finance minister, prime minister and agriculture minister are the president\u2019s brothers. His nephew is sports minister. The security forces fired teargas and water cannon to disperse the crowd. Near the presidents\u2019 home in Mirihana, the demonstrators set fire to an army bus and police vehicle. The violence prompted an overnight curfew, which was lifted on Friday, and the arrests of 45 people. Nearly 50 people, including some journalists, were injured and taken to hospital. Official sources told AFP that Rajapaksa was not at home during the protest, which was the first to target the president after diesel shortages had sparked demonstrations elsewhere on the island. The economic meltdown has left the city\u2019s roads eerily empty as fuel pumps run dry. If residents can find petrol, the price has risen from 128 rupees a litre to 300 rupees. With no air conditioners or fans, people are sweltering during the 10-12 hour power cuts. The government does not have the money to pay for the fuel needed by the power plants. People with serious medical conditions are struggling to find medicines and hospitals have cancelled operations as they have no diesel to operate the generators that act as back-up during blackouts. To save electricity, the government has switched off street lighting. Mobile phones have been affected because the standby generators used at the phone base stations have run out of diesel. \u201cWe make sure we charge our phones during the hours we have electricity but the internet is very patchy because the towers aren\u2019t working properly. Supermarkets are shut as they have no electricity for lighting or the freezer compartments and we are paying two to three times the normal price for basic food items,\u201d tourism official Zainoor Adnan told the Guardian before the WhatsApp connection failed. The government\u2019s decision to plunge into organic farming last year turned out to be disastrous. The ban on all chemical fertilisers, without preparing farmers, led to a surge in prices and food shortages. Although the policy was partially reversed later, the damage had been done. \u201cAgriculture is seriously distressed. Now they want to import fertilisers but with the war in Ukraine, fertiliser isn\u2019t available because other countries have long-term contracts that have tied up supplies,\u201d said retired Indian diplomat Neelam Deo. This year, Sri Lanka has to repay $7bn in foreign debt even though it does not have the foreign exchange to import milk powder. Of this debt, about 10% is owed to China. India has recently extended a $912m loan along with another US$1bn line of credit for Sri Lanka to purchase food and fuel. Sri Lanka is also seeking more loans from China. The government has said it is seeking a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. Civil society groups have called for another demonstration on Sunday morning and members of the opposition parties are expected to participate."

            "content": "One person has died and several people are in a critical condition in Sri Lanka after police opened fire on a crowd who were protesting against rising fuel prices and the country\u2019s economic crisis. Police confirmed they had fired on a group who had been blocking a railway in the town of Rambukkana, about 60 miles from Colombo, for more than eight hours. They were demonstrating against the devastating fuel and oil shortages in the country and the decision to raise fuel prices further this week. The death is the first fatality caused by police since overwhelmingly peaceful protests erupted spontaneously across the country in recent weeks to call for the government to step down as Sri Lanka faces its worst economic crisis since independence. Twelve people were also reported to have been injured in Tuesday\u2019s incident, with two in a critical condition. As Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign reserves have fallen to record lows and the country faces bankruptcy, the government has been unable to afford fuel and oil imports, leading to mass shortages and widespread anger. At least three people have died in the lengthy queues outside petrol stations. Citizens have faced weeks of food and medicine shortages, unaffordable inflation and daily power blackouts of 13 hours. According to police, the protester in Rambukkana had been refusing to move from a railway line and had parked a fuel truck across the tracks. Police fired teargas in an attempt to disperse the crowds, an action that appeared to provoke the protester, and the police responded by firing live rounds. Video footage from the scene shows a senior officer instructing others dressed in full riot gear: \u201cFire, fire and chase them out.\u201d Dr Mihiri Priyangani, who worked in a government hospital in nearby Kegalle, confirmed that 13 people had been admitted with suspected gunshot wounds. One had died while two others were undergoing surgery. A curfew was imposed on Rambukka on Tuesday night. The Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission said they had formed a three-person panel and would be investigating the incident. While there had been some initial clashes between protesters and police when the protests began last month, in recent weeks they had remained largely peaceful. Thousands have continued to gather in Colombo on a daily basis to call for the government to step down, with minimal police or military interference, and this was the first time that deadly force had been deployed. In a statement, Amnesty said it was \u201cconcerned about the disturbing reports emerging of at least one death and more than 10 injured after the police opened fire at protesters in Rambukkana today. The authorities must always exercise restraint and use no more force than is strictly necessary.\u201d The US ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung, said she was \u201cdeeply saddened by the horrible news coming out of Rambukkana\u201d and called for a \u201ctransparent, independent\u201d investigation into events."

            "content": "Sri Lanka is facing the imminent threat of starvation for its population of 22 million as the economic crisis in the country continues to worsen and food becomes increasingly scarce, a senior politician has warned. Speaking in a debate in parliament, held against the backdrop of the worst financial crisis to hit the country since independence \u2013 and with anti-government protests spreading across the country \u2013 the speaker of the parliament, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana, warned that this was \u201cjust the beginning\u201d. \u201cThe food, gas and electricity shortages will get worse. There will be very acute food shortages and starvation,\u201d Abeywardana told the legislature. The economic meltdown in Sri Lanka spiralled on Wednesday as the Sri Lankan rupee plunged to become the world\u2019s worst-performing currency. Sovereign dollar bonds dropped to trade at deeply distressed levels, while the stock market fell a further 2%. Over the past few months, Sri Lanka has been facing a dire financial crisis on multiple fronts, triggered partially by the impact of Covid-19, which battered the economy, as well as mounting foreign debts, rising inflation and economic mismanagement by the government, led by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The country barely has any foreign currency reserves left, leading to dangerous shortages of food, gas and medicines as it is unable to import foreign goods, while people are enduring power blackouts of up to eight hours a day. The situation has pushed thousands out onto the streets in protest in recent days, calling for the resignation of the president. Protestors have been hit with teargas and water cannon in some instances and dozens have been arrested, but it has done nothing to prevent citizens from across all generations and walks of life turning out on the streets. Among them, in the commercial capital of Colombo, were hundreds of Catholic nuns and priests. \u201cOur corrupt leaders must be sensitive to the cry of the people,\u201d said Father Cecil Joy Perera at a rally. Swathes of doctors also joined the protests, urging the government to recognise that the country was facing a medical emergency over the lack of drugs and medical equipment. Despite the rising public anger and calls for him to resign, even by former members of his own ruling coalition who resigned en masse on Tuesday, Rajapaksa made it clear he had no intention of stepping down and has insisted the crisis is not his fault but instead due to global factors beyond his control. Speaking in parliament, the chief government whip, Johnston Fernando, said: \u201cMay I remind you that 6.9 million people voted for the president. As a government, we are clearly saying the president will not resign under any circumstances. We will face this.\u201d Many have come to see the protests as the beginnings of a people-led revolution on Sri Lanka\u2019s streets, demanding a complete regime change and economic emancipation for the country. Only a few months ago, such a challenge to the Rajapaksa regime would have been unthinkable, with the strongman president seen to hold mass support among the Singhalese Buddhist majority. Since he was elected, Rajapaksa, who hails from Sri Lanka\u2019s most powerful political dynasty, has worked to concentrate power in the hands of himself and his relatives. His brother, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, was elected prime minister, while five other family members were given senior posts, including Basil Rajapaksa who was made finance minister, Chamal Rajapaksa, made irrigation minister, and his nephew Namal Rajapaksa, appointed sports minister. However, the slogans \u201cGota must go\u201d and \u2018\u201cGota go home\u201d, calling for Rajapaksa to resign, have become a clarion call at the protests across the country and the president now finds himself with a minority in parliament after 41 members of his ruling coalition quit and said they would be independent legislators. Rajapaksa avoided a humiliating defeat in parliament on Wednesday by revoking the state of emergency, meaning no vote would be held by the legislature on the move, but his government remains in political limbo as the opposition has refused his request to join the government and he could face a vote of no confidence. The situation also prompted a statement by the UN human rights office (OHCHR) expressing concern over the deepening economic crisis in Sri Lanka and urging the government to defuse tensions peacefully."

            "content": "At first glance, the UK jobs market is in rude health. The unemployment rate is back to where it was before the Covid pandemic arrived two years ago and job vacancies are at a record high. But just as X-rays can pick up health problems not detectable to the naked eye, so a closer inspection of the labour market shows up some hidden damage. The Covid crisis has not led to the sharp increase in joblessness that was feared, but it has still left scars. The number of employees is more than half a million lower than it was in early 2020, primarily due to people over 50 no longer working. According to the Learning and Work Institute thinktank there would be 1.25 million more people in the labour market had pre-pandemic trends continued. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says there is no one reason for the rise in inactivity. Some have decided to stop working due to ill health, officials believe, while the events of the past two years have convinced others that the time is right to call it a day. Whatever the reason, demand for workers currently exceeds supply, which is why the number of vacancies is so high. Unsurprisingly, employers are responding to the dearth of workers in a variety of ways. They are offering part-time staff longer hours, they are offering sign-on bonuses to new recruits and they being forced to raise pay rates. The ONS thinks it is possible some of the inactive older workers may be tempted back into the labour market as the cost of living crisis bites harder over the coming months. For public sector workers, falling real pay is already an issue. While bonus payments mean the earnings of people in the finance and business sector have risen by an average of 9.8% over the year to February \u2013 well above the 6.2% rise in prices over the same period \u2013 public sector pay rose by just 1.9%. Inflation is expected to rise above 8% in April, intensifying the squeeze on public sector workers. Unions representing teachers, nurses, civil servants and local government workers are not going to be especially receptive to calls for wage restraint from Rishi Sunak, especially in light of the chancellor\u2019s recent political and personal difficulties. In the next few months there will be either an exodus of public sector workers to fill the job vacancies in the private sector or industrial action for higher pay. Probably both. Sri Lanka\u2019s default points to broader crisis Sri Lanka\u2019s first debt default since independence is an example of the long economic shadow cast by the war in Ukraine. Far from being a one-off, it highlights the risk of a broader debt crisis. The decision by the government in Colombo is hardly a shock. For months, Sri Lanka has been hoping something will turn up, but any boost to revenues from the resumption of tourism has been outweighed by the Omicron variant of Covid and the rising cost of fuel and food. The country could either use its dwindling stock of foreign currency reserves to pay its creditors or buy essential imports. The negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to begin soon will doubtless result in the customary package of higher interest rates and cuts in public spending. There is no immediate prospect of life for ordinary Sri Lankans getting any better, but the prospect of an IMF deal will put pressure on creditors to accept a debt restructuring. Sri Lanka is not alone in finding the going tough. Speaking in Warsaw, the World Bank president, David Malpass, said 60% of low-income countries were already in debt distress or at high risk of it. Sri Lanka is not classified by the World Bank as a low-income country. Nor is Ukraine, which is trying to meet more than $7bn of debt payments this year while simultaneously fighting a ruinously expensive war. Malpass has announced an extra $1bn (\u00a3770m) package of aid for Ukraine and without question the money will be welcomed by Kyiv. Even more welcome would be action by finance ministers at next week\u2019s spring meetings of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington on an effective global debt restructuring mechanism that would deliver meaningful relief for countries in dire need."

            "content": "The notion of \u201csustainable investing\u201d had a bumper year in 2021. Aligning investments with climate goals \u2013 no fossil fuel companies, for example \u2013 promises a good financial return, while benefiting the planet. But is it too good to be true? I asked Tariq Fancy \u2013 CEO of non-profit digital learning charity Rumie and ex-head of sustainable investing for investment company BlackRock. Last year Fancy publicly denounced sustainable investing as a \u201cdangerous placebo that harms the public interest\u201d. I read a claim recently \u2013 from research led by Aviva and Make My Money Matter \u2013 that turning your pension \u201cgreen\u201d is 21 times more powerful in cutting your carbon footprint than stopping flying, becoming vegetarian and moving to a renewable energy provider combined. That\u2019s ludicrous. Our individual actions reduce real-world emissions. Selling shares in polluting companies does not \u2013 it just means someone else buys those shares and owns those emissions. But sustainable investing must be doing something good? It is, in specific corners of the market. But those aren\u2019t corners the average person can get into, commonly with pensions. The proof is in the pudding. Green investing has increased massively, yet emissions seem to be increasing alongside it. Since the 1980s, people have been beholden to a narrative that the free market will magically self-correct. But climate change is at its core a market failure, and it requires regulation. Investing in ESG falls into that trap. ESG investing \u2013 that\u2019s a type of sustainable investing that involves buying shares in companies with a good score for \u201cenvironmental, social and governance\u201d \u2026 ExxonMobil used to have the same ESG score as Tesla! Because the scores are a mashup of different things. ExxonMobil has good governance and a diverse board, so they\u2019re good on \u201cG\u201d and \u201cS\u201d but terrible on \u201cE\u201d. So when someone is investing in ethical or sustainable funds, they may find they\u2019re investing in companies they\u2019d be horrified by. How can this be OK? There hasn\u2019t been any regulation, though increasingly there is in the EU. It\u2019s like organic fruit 30 years ago. If no one polices what it is to be organic, then someone figuring people will pay more will put the organic sticker on. Tariq, this all sounds a bit evil. The economy is structured according to what\u2019s profitable. That\u2019s not because people are bad, but the way the system is designed. Fund managers have a legal obligation to focus on maximising profit. And because they\u2019re managing someone else\u2019s money, you don\u2019t want them thinking about values, because everyone has different values. I see why you\u2019ve said this system is not going to save the planet. A lot of the theory comes from divestment \u2013 that if I no longer own something, I\u2019ll make the world better. But it makes no sense in practice. I\u2019ve met Middle Eastern ethical investors who say, \u201cWe\u2019re against drinking, we don\u2019t want to own alcohol companies.\u201d But they didn\u2019t believe that by not owning them they stop people in France drinking wine. As long as something is legal and it makes money, someone will own it. Our greatest power is not as consumers but as voters. Only the government has the power to put a price on carbon, to set vehicle emissions limits and new efficiency standards for buildings. It\u2019s wasting time, too. The eight-year-old in Bangladesh who has no carbon footprint is going to bear the brunt while Wall Street kicks the can down the road. It\u2019s morally unconscionable."

            "content": "Driving an electric car for a year costs almost \u00a3600 less than its petrol equivalent after fuel prices surged more than electricity costs, research by the comparison website Compare the Market has found. Electric vehicles were already cheaper to run, according to figures shared with the Guardian, but the gap has widened significantly amid turmoil in global energy markets caused by the war in Ukraine. The average annual cost of driving an electric vehicle is \u00a31,264, Compare the Market found, compared with \u00a31,834 for a petrol car. Running either kind of vehicle is markedly more expensive than a year ago. Petrol prices hit record highs in March and have dropped only slightly this month, while the new price cap on domestic energy bills, which came in on 1 April, has brought with it higher electricity costs. Petrol cars registered the biggest cost increase, up by more than \u00a3300 from \u00a31,530, while electric car ownership is \u00a3137 more expensive than in 2021. The change means the cost advantage of an electric car has widened from \u00a3403 to \u00a3570. The figures take into account average costs for insurance, MOT and fuel, as well as vehicle excise duty of \u00a3165 for a petrol car, a tax from which electric cars are exempt. The research was based on a driver travelling 6,700 miles a year and paying \u00a31.62 a litre for petrol or 28p a kWh for electricity. Drivers who are on special EV tariffs for their energy will pay much less for charging, so the savings will be even greater. Alex Hasty, director at Compare the Market, said: \u201cDespite surging energy bills, motorists who\u2019ve made the switch will be glad to see that electric vehicles cost substantially less to run than a petrol alternative. \u201cAs well as helping the environment, these drivers benefit from savings in fuel, insurance, and tax.\u201d Rising petrol and diesel prices are making electric cars an attractive option for many motorists, and sales have been booming. Industry figures show that in March British drivers bought more of them than in the whole of 2019. However, they are not an option for everyone. Hasty said: \u201cThere is a significant upfront cost of buying an electric car and installing a home charging point which will prevent many drivers from being able to afford this option.\u201d"

The business advisory firm BDO said UK companies reported the fastest growth in the labour market since February 2020. BDO said its index, which measures business sentiment among senior managers, rose for a fifth consecutive month to a reading of 112.74 last month \u2013 a two-point increase compared with February. Anything above 95 is considered to be growth. Managers in the manufacturing and services sectors were the keenest on hiring new staff, it said, as their optimism outweighed concerns across the economy about disrupted supply chains. Kaley Crossthwaite, a partner at BDO, said: \u201cThe labour market has shown resilience throughout the pandemic and then continued growth as restrictions have gradually lifted. While it\u2019s reassuring to see employment return to near pre-pandemic levels, this strong form could come to an end as the cost of living crisis, rising inflation and wider geopolitical matters distract businesses from growth and place pressure on the employment index.\u201d BDO\u2019s findings back up recent data from the Office for National Statistics that showed a fall in the UK\u2019s unemployment rate to 3.9% in the three months to January, dropping below pre-pandemic levels for the first time. The Resolution Foundation, an independent thinktank that monitors living standards, said wage growth had been driven up by a competitive labour market as firms increased pay to attract and retain workers. However, its economists fear wage growth will soon be offset by rising inflation and soaring energy prices, meaning workers will not feel the effects of a buoyant labour market. Nye Cominetti, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cWith inflation set to reach 8% in the coming months, most workers\u2019 earnings will fall in real terms, further squeezing living standards in the months ahead.\u201d On Friday it emerged that in the US the number of people signing on for unemployment support had dropped to 166,000 last week, its lowest level since 1968."

In terms of publicity, though, it barely made a squeak, with the crowd figure contested but reported to be around 12,000. To date it is the only Origin game taken to the US. Viva Las Vegas? The NRL\u2019s Magic Round, which features all eight games at the same venue, started in 2019 and has been played in Brisbane every year since. However it is seen by the game\u2019s administrators as a concept easily transferred abroad, with a view to replicating the festival-like atmosphere of the UK Super League\u2019s Magic Round, with Los Angeles and even Las Vegas floated as prospective venues. In 2019 the NRL\u2019s then chief executive Todd Greenberg signposted bold plans, calling Magic Round \u201ca product that lends itself to emerging markets\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019d absolutely look at taking it overseas,\u201d he told the Sydney Morning Herald. VFL\u2019s first foray Australian rules has long attempted to promote the game outside of its heartlands, as far back as the first and second world wars , during which Australian troops organised exhibition and scratch matches in Europe and Asia. Some years later, in 1960, Melbourne and Geelong tried to crack the American market by playing the first exhibition matches in major US cities in Honolulu and San Francisco respectively. The games events drew little attention and were attended by only 1,500 and 3,500 spectators. The hard Hogan sell In 1987, Perth magnate Errol Marron hatched an audacious plan to base a VFL expansion club in Los Angeles \u2013 named the Los Angeles Crocodiles to piggyback on the huge international popularity of Crocodile Dundee and Paul Hogan. The radical proposal \u2013 an attempt to save the floundering competition \u2013 involved the teams playing four blocks of three games in Australia with eight teams making the trip to LA every season, and included the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Despite sponsors and airlines having pledged support and ESPN approached as a broadcaster, VFL chairman Ross Oakley announced the league had rejected the bid. Still, the VFL scheduled more exhibition games in 1988 (Collingwood v Geelong, Miami), 1989 (Essendon v Hawthorn, Miami) and 1990 (Melbourne v West Coast, Portland). The latter, directly after the VFL was rebranded as the AFL, generated the most interest. Essendon\u2019s California dreamin\u2019 Early in 2020 reports emerged that the Bombers and Greater Western Sydney Giants were planning to play a game for premiership points on the west coast of America. But talks had not progressed past the preliminary stage when the pandemic struck and they were put on ice. Both clubs were reportedly still eager to make it happen though it is unclear when. If a match does come to fruition it will make the US the third nation beyond Australia to host a game, following Sydney Swans and St Kilda in New Zealand in 2013 and Port Adelaide Power v Gold Coast Suns in China in 2017."

            "content": "Tins of spaghetti, soap, pasta shells and raw almonds: purchases more commonly carted into New Zealand homes by shopping trolleys and car boots than jetted on international flights. But as prices hit new highs, shoppers are taking drastic measures \u2013 including ordering groceries for delivery from Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Christmas,\u201d said Belinda*, a Wellington woman who said she now regularly ordered groceries online from across the Tasman to supplement her local shopping. Browsing Australian groceries, she said, she was startled by the range of products and how much cheaper they were than those stocking New Zealand shelves. The Guardian compared two shopping carts compiled by Belinda \u2013 one from an Australia-based multinational which delivered to New Zealand, the second to have the same items delivered by one of New Zealand\u2019s largest supermarket chains. In total, even with the currency conversion, cost of GST and a small customs fee, she saved almost NZ$70 (AU$64) on a $267 shop \u2013 or about $80 including the local supermarket\u2019s delivery charge. \u201cThe only downside also is that a lot of things are currently unavailable because of stock issues. But I think that\u2019s because everybody started to do it,\u201d she said. In late March, an Otago woman gained national attention after she posted her Australian-purchased shopping cart on social media. She told TV 1 that while she had saved about 35% on her groceries by bulk-buying nuts, dry goods and toiletries, she was unlikely to repeat the experiment. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend others do it because the order is flown in so it\u2019s not good for your carbon footprint,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso I now have 10 toothbrushes and a year\u2019s worth of almonds to get through.\u201d Shoppers speaking to the Guardian said that while time consuming, the practice had saved them more than 25% on equivalent shops at home. A number of the shoppers were concerned about the climate impact of flying their goods in rather than buying locally \u2013 but said with food prices rising steeply in New Zealand, the practice illustrated the desperate measures families were taking to alleviate costs. In March, food prices in New Zealand were 7.6% higher than the year before, the largest annual increase in over a decade. Fruit and vegetables were up 18%, hitting many households that were already stretched by high petrol prices, rising rents and increasing mortgage payments. On Thursday, annual inflation hit 6.9% \u2013 the highest in three decades. Earlier in the week, finance minister Grant Robertson said he believed it would continue to rise, pushed up by international pressures. Emma Anderson, 38, from North Canterbury, said she had started ordering from Australia as groceries at home became increasingly unaffordable, and got the idea after seeing another woman\u2019s experience in an online budgeting group. \u201cThe prices have just gone screaming through the roof,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just completely overboard \u2013 it\u2019s certainly making me rethink how I grocery shop.\u201d Now, Emma will compare prices across several supermarkets and in Australia to find the best deal before purchasing. In July 2021, a commerce commission investigation into New Zealand\u2019s supermarket duopoly found the grocers were making huge profits and charging some of the highest prices in the OECD. For those turning to Australia for cheap basics, their shopping was limited to non-perishable items \u2013 pantry staples like pastas, flour, cans and sauces, dried fruit. Both Belinda and Emma said that to actually make a saving required some deft deal-hunting, and buying $60 worth of groceries \u2013 enough to hit the free delivery threshold. \u201cThe biggest cost is your time \u2013 it takes some time,\u201d Belinda said. A member of Belinda\u2019s household was severely immuno-compromised and at risk from Covid infection, so despite lifting restrictions, their home had remained in a mini-lockdown: working from home and ordering groceries online. Most New Zealand supermarkets required a higher minimum spend or regular fee for delivery, she said. Ultimately, she\u2019d prefer to buy local, and said she was concerned about the environmental impact of ordering groceries from overseas. \u201cBut you know,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ve gotta do what I\u2019ve gotta do.\u201d *Belinda\u2019s name has been changed at her request to protect the privacy of her household"

            "date": "2022-04-29T05:00:31Z",
            "content": "Prices were rising before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which has further disrupted energy markets and food exports, forcing developing countries to pay more to import staples at a time when they are already struggling with increased debts taken on to pay for pandemic responses. While panic over inflation has led news agendas all over the world, the IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook released this week estimated it would reach 8.7% in developing economies compared with 5.7% in rich countries. Experts fear millions more will be driven into poverty and that transport and food networks will be affected. Humanitarian efforts for refugees and populations already facing hunger crises could also struggle to cope with increased prices, at a time when many are already coping with reduced aid funding. \u201cThe rising cost of getting aid into areas like north-west Syria, which is hugely dependent on humanitarian aid, means that it\u2019s the people who need help most who are suffering,\u201d said Jessica Adams, head of communications at Syria Relief. \u201cOur costs in meeting the needs have gone up \u2013 petrol for trucking water into camps costs more, building homes for displaced Syrians in tents costs more as building materials have gone up. This is against a backdrop where donations to Syria are reducing \u2013 so in a conflict like Syria \u2026 living has become unaffordable.\u201d The effects of the Ukraine war on oil, and the energy sector as a whole, are being monitored by experts but prices have fluctuated wildly since Russia\u2019s invasion and there is concern about how much oil is being refined and exported as the products ordinary people need. Rising oil prices are being felt on the forecourts, with petrol up 63% in Sudan, 50% in Sierra Leone and 42% in Ghana compared with 9% in Britain. \u201cYou cannot isolate oil from the other markets \u2013 gas prices are higher, coal prices are higher, food prices are higher and you have supply-chain bottlenecks. There are a lot of headwinds that are affecting economics all over the world,\u201d said Bassam Fattouh, director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. \u201cIf you look at it from a consumer\u2019s point of view, they are being hit left and right all over the world.\u201d Oxfam has estimated that a quarter of a billion people face poverty this year because of rising food and fuel prices, calling it \u201cthe most profound collapse of humanity into extreme poverty and suffering in memory\u201d. The UN\u2019s agencies raised concerns about how rising food and fuel costs will affect their operations, predicting a $136m rise in operational costs in West Africa. In east Africa it has warned of refugee families getting into debt and selling off their belongings because they fear ration cuts. The UN warned last week of developing countries becoming \u201ccollateral damage\u201d of the Ukraine war. \u201cThe developing countries are facing a perfect storm of soaring food and fuel prices with already limited fiscal space and high debt ratios. We need urgent measures to prevent great human suffering and the world tipping into an era of social and political unrest,\u201d said Rebeca Grynspan, secretary general of the UN conference on trade and development (Unctad). The IMF said the war was derailing post-pandemic economic recovery and estimated global growth would slow from 6.1% last year to 3.6% in 2022. It also said the pandemic had increased debt because of response spending, making vulnerable countries reliant on oil and food imports. In Sri Lanka, the lack of foreign currency reserves has sparked a movement to bring down the government, which has struggled to import food, medicine and fuel, leading to blackouts and farmers struggling to transport crops. In Peru there have been anti-government protests over fuel and fertiliser prices, while Egypt has tried to avert similar anger with price controls, punishing non-compliant bakeries and retailers with closure. Living costs helped fuel the anti-government demonstrations that brought down Sudanese dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019 and similar protests have emerged against the military rulers who took control in a coup last October. Kholood Khair, of Sudanese thinktank Insight Strategy Partners, said the rise in food and fuel prices is adding to the grievances being voiced by protesters. \u201cGas prices have been rising steadily in the past few months at the same time as the government has been struggling to retain hard currency in the central bank to buy more \u2026 the government has very acute supply problems,\u201d said Khair, who added that many of the fuel subsidies have been removed since Bashir\u2019s exit. \u201cIf the Gulf doesn\u2019t come with financial support and in-kind support with fuel, then the generals in Khartoum will find themselves in an ever more precarious position.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-04-10T17:30:27Z",
            "content": "Global turmoil has trickled into Australia\u2019s supermarket aisles, hiking the prices of many staple foods. But the upward pressure isn\u2019t evenly distributed. Bread \u2013 or, in fact, any wheat product, as well as eggs, meat and coffee beans are just a few casualties of spiralling inflation fuelled by punishing petrol prices, higher feed and fertiliser costs, conflict between major food exporters Russia and Ukraine, and tight global supply. Australian shoppers are facing a price rise \u201cperfect storm\u201d at the supermarket right now, says Prof Wendy Umberger, executive director of the Centre for Global Food and Resources at the University of Adelaide. While Australia ranks among the most food secure nations in the world, the blockage of wheat exports from Russia and Ukraine by Russia means domestic wheat producers are taking advantage of higher global export prices, she says. Bad news for bread and pastry lovers \u2013 wheat prices are forecast to remain high this year, according to the Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment, while Umberger says it will take up to 12 months after the global conflict to see the market return to normal. Both beef and lamb have also become more expensive, says Woolworths CEO Brad Banducci, with a lack of stock and the east coast drought the culprits. Retail prices are up 10% a kilo compared to this time last year, according to industry research body Meat and Livestock Australia. Dairy lovers are also likely to be crying into their milk, with lower cow numbers and decline in domestic production forecast. Dairy Australia\u2019s John Droppert says droughts are a factor in lower stock numbers and labour shortages have affected milk production, while some dairy farmers are also taking advantage of high beef prices. As for fresh food prices, they\u2019re being squeezed upwards by input costs and catastrophic weather conditions, says Shaun Lindhe, for peak industry body AusVeg, while labour shortages have meant some growers didn\u2019t even plant, says Sydney Markets\u2019 retail support manager and home economist Sue Dodd. \u201cClimate change is even more concerning [for food security] than war,\u201d says Umberger. \u201cWe are going to see more natural disasters leading to higher prices.\u201d But before you consider taking a second job, it is still possible to fill your trolley without breaking the budget, says cook and author Belinda Jeffery, who favours sustainable, seasonal eating. Smart food selection and substitution, based on foods in plentiful supply, as well as being more adventurous with your menus, is the way to shop around inflation, she says. Best-value buys for autumn Apples: most varieties, from Royal Gala and Kanzi, to Pink Lady and Fuji, are now in season. Expect to pay $2 to $8 a kilo, says Dodd. Much, much cheaper than out of season berries, with varieties such as blueberries prices at around $56 a kilo at the supermarket. Avocados: prices for everyone\u2019s smashed-on-toast favourite are low because avocados are more plentiful. \u201cThere\u2019s been a very good growing season and a lot of extra supply coming out of Western Australia,\u201d says Banducci. You\u2019ll pay $1.20 up. Baby peas: bought frozen, they are excellent quality and not expensive, says Jeffery. (Around $3.80 a kilo.) \u201cTry them with pasta, olive oil and a little chilli.\u201d Broccolini: broccoli\u2019s more glamorous cousin is now in season, meaning prices are down to $3 a bunch at markets. High in fibre, nutrients and with more protein than most other vegetables, it\u2019s a good choice for greens. Carrots: a stable for salads, stews, casseroles and stir-fries, at $2 to $3 a kilo, they\u2019re also better than celery, at around $6 a bunch, for a crunchy snack. Casserole beef: at around $18 a kilo compared to rump steak\u2019s $45, it\u2019s a slow cooker dream, says Jeffery. \u201cCheaper cuts such as stewing steak, shoulder or lamb or neck cutlets make flavoursome casseroles when combined with veggies, onions, garlic and potatoes.\u201d Pork and chicken are also likely to be cheaper per kilo than prime beef, with prices holding, says Banducci. Cauliflower: around $3 to $6 each, this versatile cruciferous vegetable can be steamed, boiled, roasted, saut\u00e9ed or mashed. Fresh and canned fish: while the price of popular varieties such as snapper are as high as $58 a kilo, cooking with varieties such as mullet or leather jacket is the way to save, says Jeffery. Canned fish can also be used in fishcakes, salads and bakes. Grapes: \u201cThere\u2019s a great supply coming out of South Australia,\u201d says Dodd. Prices range from $3 to $20 per kg, depending on quality. Ideal for school lunches, desserts, or snacks. Lemons and limes: both plentiful and useful for adding zing to salads, or sauces, rather than pricey dressings. You\u2019ll pay $3 to $5 a kilo for lemons and 80c to $1.50 each for limes. Pomegranates: fabulous with lamb or fish, or with desserts, says Dodd, they can be found at farmers\u2019 markets for around $1.50 each. Pumpkin: mash it, serve it roasted, or add it to frittata or pasta. From $1 to $2 a kilo. Sweet potato: spend $2 to $4.50 a kilo and get a foodies\u2019 favourite that adds substance and satiety to meals with 20g of carbohydrate per 100g. Watercress: at $3 to $3.50 a bunch, it\u2019s top value and likely to be cheaper than fancy lettuce. Cook it or use it in salads, says Dodd. Nine tips for eating well on a budget 1. Compare your options At some farmers markets, you\u2019ll get better, fresher ingredients and pay less, says Jeffery, because they cut out the middle man. If this isn\u2019t the case in your area, it\u2019s also worth checking specialty green grocers\u2019 prices against the major supermarkets, as bigger does not always mean cheaper. 2. Buy what is in season \u201cWe get used to getting strawberries or blueberries all year, but buying what\u2019s in season is nutritionally important and price superior,\u201d Jeffery says. 3. Buy frozen veggies if fresh are too expensive Snap frozen, not stored \u2013 the nutrient content remains high. 4. Beans, beans, beans and legumes Load them up with potatoes, onions, spices and a handful of spinach for soups, suggests Jeffery. \u201cWe need to get away from the idea that meat and three veg is a meal.\u201d 5. Think simple Bake potatoes and serve with fillings such as grated cheese, tuna, or avocado mash. 6. One chicken, three meals Buying a whole chicken is cheaper per kilo and means a roast one night, a curry the next, with the carcass can be used for making stock for a risotto. 7. Store fresh foods well Don\u2019t wash greens before putting them in the fridge, just wrap them in a moist paper towel and put them in an airtight container or a compostable bag. They\u2019ll last longer. 8. Grow your own herbs If you have no other space, grow your own, inexpensive herbs. \u201cA little can really make a difference to food flavour,\u201d says Jeffery. 9. Adapt your menus and cook around what you buy Eat more diversely and broaden your taste to what our climate will allow us to eat."

            "date": "2022-04-28T09:30:53Z",
            "content": "Barclays has become the latest UK bank to warn over the impact of the cost of living crisis, saying that its customers were already facing \u201charder conditions\u201d as a result of surging inflation. It came as the bank put aside an extra \u00a3141m to cover potential defaults on its loans in the first quarter, nearly three times the amount put aside during the same period in 2021, but lower than the \u00a3299m that analysts had forecast. While Barclays said it was still facing \u201clow delinquencies\u201d so far, it acknowledged uncertainty over the long-term impacts of the war in Ukraine, which contributed to a 7% rise in UK inflation last month. \u201cThe ongoing geopolitical situation could put further pressure on already high levels of inflation, which may weigh on corporate profitability and consumer affordability levels,\u201d the bank said, adding that a fresh surge in Covid infection rates could result in further labour shortages and supply chain disruption. The bank\u2019s chief executive, CS Venkatakrishnan, said the bank was staying in touch with customers who may be struggling financially as a result of the cost of living crisis. \u201cWe remain focused on the impact higher prices are having on our customers and our small business and corporate clients, all of whom are facing far harder conditions this year as a result of inflation, supply chain issues and higher energy costs. \u201cWe will support them through this difficult period wherever we can, and support the wider economy,\u201d he added. Barclays\u2019 concerns over inflation echo those raised earlier this week by other UK banks including Lloyds and HSBC. Lloyds said some of its customers had already started pulling back on spending on services such as streaming and gyms, to help make up for higher energy and food bills. Meanwhile, HSBC said the bank was likely to have to put aside a total of $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) to protect against potential defaults throughout 2022. Barclays has downgraded its economic forecasts, with UK GDP now expected to grow 5.7% in 2022, compared with previous forecasts for a 6.2% rise. The bank said it still expected loan loss charges to stay below pre-pandemic levels, partly due to the fact that many customers had spent the Covid crisis paying off their debts. Overall, Barclays reported a 7% increase in pre-tax profits in the first three months of the year to \u00a32.3bn, easily beating average analyst estimates which had forecast a 45% slump in profits to \u00a31.3bn. It sent shares up 2.6% in morning trading on Thursday to 146p each. Profits would have been even higher had Barclays not put aside more than \u00a3500m to cover legal costs related to the over-selling of American financial products. The chief executive told journalists that the scandal was \u201centirely avoidable\u201d and that he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d, given it has raised concerns about Barclays\u2019 internal controls. Venkatakrishnan said the board had launched an external review of the matter. The blunder has also forced the bank to delay its share buyback programme, thoughBarclays said it remained committed to handing more money to shareholders \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d."

            "date": "2022-04-28T08:59:15Z",
            "content": "The consumer goods firm Unilever has said \u201cunprecedented cost inflation\u201d lies ahead as Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine has added to a surge in energy and ingredient costs, and said that shoppers will pay even more for well-known brands in the coming months. The company, which makes goods ranging from Dove soap to Magnum ice-cream and Marmite, said on Thursday it expected its costs to rise by \u20ac2.7bn (\u00a32.3bn) in the second half of 2022, after an already steep increase on the \u20ac2.1bn expected for the first half. \u201cIt is inevitable you will see pricing accelerate through the rest of the year,\u201d said Alan Jope, Unilever\u2019s chief executive. \u201cHas Unilever\u2019s pricing peaked? No, not yet.\u201d The costs of palm oil, aluminium and other commodities have doubled or tripled compared with 2020, the company said. The increased costs forecast comes as companies grapple with the inflationary pressures that built as the global economy rapidly recovered from the shock of coronavirus pandemic lockdowns and central banks cut interest rates. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has added to the mix by pushing up energy prices. Unilever has been directly affected by the invasion. The company was forced to stop all operations in Ukraine, but has since restarted some sales using supplies from Poland. It has also had to switch Ukrainian sunflower oil for rapeseed oil in some products. The company last month suspended all imports and exports of products into and out of Russia as well as all advertising spending in the country, but it continues to supply items within the country including beauty products and ice-cream. Unilever had initially remained silent on whether it planned to pull out, and has been criticised by Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, for continuing to run operations in Russia. Whitbread, the owner of the Premier Inn hotel chain and some restaurant brands, also warned on Thursday of faster cost increases of between 8% and 9% annually because of the impact of the war in Ukraine on energy and food prices. However, Whitbread also felt confident enough in its prospects to restore its dividend to investors, more than two years after it paused payouts as hotels were forced to close. It said its profits would be partly protected by its \u201cpricing power\u201d, suggesting its executives think they can pass costs on to consumers. Unilever has passed on higher costs to consumers. It reported price increases worth 8.3% in the first three months of 2022 compared with a year earlier, even as the volume of sales dropped by 1%. Unilever has raised prices in Europe by about 5%, but it has increased prices by more than 10% in some poorer countries. Jope said the disparity was caused by currency movements that have diminished poorer countries\u2019 purchasing power on top of the global commodities and energy price increases. The company\u2019s chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly, said there was not much evidence that consumers were moving to other companies\u2019 products after the price moves."

            "date": "2022-04-18T11:09:12Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy is at growing risk of falling into a summer recession amid the biggest squeeze on household incomes since the mid 1950s, as soaring inflation curtails consumer spending power, forecasters have said. Economists said the double blow from slowing post-lockdown growth and rising living costs after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine could result in a fall in gross domestic product (GDP) for two consecutive quarters, which is the definition of a recession. After a weaker-than-expected growth performance in February, and with the inflation rate reaching the highest levels since 1992 last month, City forecasters said UK GDP was now on track to grow by about 1% in the first quarter of 2022 before slipping into reverse this summer. Analysts said activity would be reduced by an extra bank holiday for the Queen\u2019s platinum jubilee in June, as public holidays usually lead to a drop in overall economic output. The return to lower rates of activity in the health sector after a winter rush to vaccinate people against Covid-19, as well as households reining in their spending amid the soaring cost of living, are also expected to weigh on growth. James Smith, an economist at the Dutch bank ING, said the economy was likely to shrink in the second quarter. The bank forecasts a 0.3% contraction in the three months to the end of June, followed by growth of just 0.2% in the third quarter. \u201cIt\u2019ll be pretty close to a technical recession. Even if one is avoided then we\u2019ll still only see fairly unexciting growth numbers,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf people are spending more money on energy you\u2019d expect some of the non-essentials to fall in sales volumes. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll be watching,\u201d he added. Figures from the Office for National Statistics due on Friday this week are expected to show a fall in retail sales in March as households tighten their belts. It comes as retail industry bosses warn of a slowdown in sales amid the rising cost of living. Neil Shearing, the group chief economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said household disposable income was set to fall by about 1.9% this year. This is bigger than the 1.8% drop in real incomes experienced in 1977, and the biggest since modern records began in the 1950s. \u201cBy comparison, real incomes fell by \u2018only\u2019 1.5% in 2011 following the global financial crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the economy already close to flatlining, it clearly would not take much to produce a month or two of falling output.\u201d The warnings come after the head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said global growth would slow this year and next as the shockwaves from Covid and the war in Ukraine keep inflation higher for longer than first expected. The strength of Britain\u2019s economy will to some extent depend on households who saved during the pandemic continuing to spend. However, while close to \u00a3250bn was accumulated during lockdown, most of this was concentrated among wealthier families able to keep working from home, meaning those at most risk from the surging cost of living will feel the biggest pinch. Thomas Pugh, an economist at the accountancy firm RSM UK, said he expected households would probably need to dip into savings or take on debt to protect themselves from rising inflation. \u201cThis is a key reason why we think the UK will avoid a recession this year. However, our forecasts suggest GDP growth will average just 0.1% in each of the remaining three quarters of this year \u2013 so it would not take much of a rise in oil prices or a disruption in supply chains to push the UK into recession,\u201d he said."

An immediate EU ban on Russian gas would cost Germany the equivalent of \u20ac165bn (\u00a3138bn) in lost output this year, according to the country\u2019s central bank. \u201cIn the severe crisis scenario, real GDP in the current year would fall by almost 2% compared to 2021,\u201d the Bundesbank said in its latest monthly report. Germany\u2019s manufacturing-heavy economy would feel the painful consequences of gas-shortages for the coming years, the bank\u2019s report said. \u201cIn addition, the inflation rate would be significantly higher for a longer period of time.\u201d Before the start of the war in Ukraine, Russian natural gas accounted for 55% of Germany\u2019s gas needs, with roughly a third used for industrial production, including steel and chemicals. \u201cNatural gas prices are likely to rise the most, as Russian deliveries are difficult to replace in the short term,\u201d the bank said. However, in a heated German debate over the economic price the country should be prepared to pay to help cut off financial support for Putin\u2019s war economy, some have taken the Bundesbank report as positive news. \u201cThe economic slump would with high probability be less severe than during the corona crisis,\u201d wrote conservative broadsheet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. \u201cIt puts even more pressure on the government to justify itself\u201d. Germany\u2019s GDP slumped by 4.6% in the first year of the pandemic, with a sharp recession ending a 10-year run of growth. The German economy recovered in 2021, growing by 2.9%. While the European Union has already banned Russian coal and is preparing an embargo on its oil, plans for a gas boycott have stalled in part due to the concerns of Germany, which has warned that a recession on its own terrain could have devastating knock-on effects across the European Union. Germany\u2019s economy minister, Robert Habeck, has predicted \u201cmass unemployment, poverty, people who can\u2019t heat their homes, people who run out of petrol\u201d if his country stopped using Russian oil and gas. Critics say the German government\u2019s fears are based on political gut instincts and doomsday warnings of industrial lobbyists rather than concrete economic models."

            "date": "2022-04-08T15:50:26Z",
            "content": "Russia is heading for its deepest recession since the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the UK government predicted on Friday, as Moscow\u2019s central bank unexpectedly cut its key interest rate to support its shrinking economy. The Foreign Office said Russia\u2019s GDP is expected to contract by between 8.5% and 15% this year, as the series of sanctions imposed following the war in Ukraine hit activity. That would be more severe than in 2009, after the financial crisis, when Russia\u2019s economy shrank around 7.8%, and would be the worst decline since GDP fell for several years in the early 1990s. Longer term, expert predictions suggest GDP growth will continue to be depressed as the country is cut off from western technology, the UK added, as it announced sanctions on Vladimir Putin\u2019s two adult daughters. Western sanctions on Russia mean that about 60%, or \u00a3275bn, of its foreign exchange reserves are currently frozen, the UK added. That prevented Moscow making dollar debt repayments this week, putting it closer to defaulting on its debts. Russian firms have already reported a marked contraction in business activity in March, with output and new orders tumbling and inflationary pressures soaring. With a steep recession looming, the Bank of Russia has announced a surprise cut to borrowing costs. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) will lower its key lending rate from 20% to 17% from Monday, six weeks after doubling interest rates in an emergency attempt to prop up the rouble. The cut shows the bank is pivoting its focus to support the economy, as the recent recovery in the rouble following the introduction of capital controls eased inflation worries. The CBR said inflationary pressures had softened, while financial stability risks had stabilised. It also cited the economic cost of sanctions, saying the external conditions remained challenging, and were \u201cconsiderably constraining economic activity\u201d. \u201cToday\u2019s decision reflects a change in the balance of risks of accelerated consumer price growth, decline in economic activity and financial stability risks,\u201d said the CBR, adding that it could lower rates again at future policy meetings. The rate cut shows the CBR is \u201cconfident that the most acute phase of the economic crisis has now passed\u201d, said Liam Peach, emerging Europe economist at Capital Economics, and that a major and destabilising bank run had been avoided. Peach predicts further gradual interest rate cuts over the course of this year, as the central bank attempts to bring inflation back to target. The rouble has recovered from the record lows in the early days of the Ukraine invasion, when it plunged to 135 roubles to the US dollar. It has now risen back to around 80 roubles to the dollar, helped by restrictions on moving money abroad and a ban on foreign currency sales. February\u2019s interest rate rise also encouraged Russians to save their roubles, supporting the currency. The surge in commodity prices since the war began has also helped Russia\u2019s finances, with Europe continuing to buy oil and gas to meet its energy needs. But the freeze on Russia\u2019s foreign exchange reserves means Moscow is moving closer to its first debt default since 1998. Earlier this week, the US blocked attempts to pay more than $600m (\u00a3461m) owed to Russian bond investors, leading Moscow to make payments in roubles instead. That could be classed as a default, once a 30-day grace period expires. Several economists have forecast Russia could suffer a double-digit contraction this year. The Institute of International Finance predicted last month that Russia\u2019s economy would shrink 15%, with the recession wiping out 15 years of economic gains by the end of 2023. Further energy boycotts would drastically impair Russia\u2019s ability to import goods and services, deepening the recession, it warned. The London Platinum and Palladium Market announced on Friday it was suspending two Russian government-owned precious metals refineries from its good delivery lists with immediate effect. The decision bars the two refiners from selling platinum and palladium into the London market, the world\u2019s largest. The palladium price jumped 8% after the move, on concerns of supply disruption to the precious metal used in catalytic converters."

            "content": "Time to wrap up... here\u2019s today\u2019s main stories: Goodnight, and best wishes for the bank holiday weekend if you\u2019re in the UK (and not working...). GW In the push to cut carbon emissions, lorry vehicle makers are experimenting with a range of greener technologies to replace diesel engines. Both gas-powered, and battery electric, lorries are being develoepd. And my colleague Jasper Jolly has a couple for a spin to see how manufacturers are making progress: Here\u2019s how it went.... \u201cJust be careful where your back end is going,\u201d says the instructor as this reporter nervously steers a 44-tonne articulated Volvo lorry on a roundabout. It is good advice at roundabouts, as in life. The trailer rolls past the safety barrier with a barely visible gap, to the relief of everyone involved. It is a manoeuvre played out across the world countless times each day as lorries lug the goods required for modern life from factory to consumer. However, this truck is slightly different: instead of a diesel engine, it is running on natural gas. It is one of the products of a series of bets by lorry manufacturers on how to reduce the carbon footprint of road transport, a key contributor to global carbon emissions. About 16% of the UK\u2019s carbon emissions in 2019 were from heavy goods vehicles, which carried 1.4bn tonnes across 17.8bn km in the year to June 2021, according to the Department for Transport. Manufacturers are backing a range of technologies from gas, to battery electric and various types of hydrogento try to decarbonise those journeys \u2013 but none has yet succeeded at scale. Everyone who drives an electric car for the first time after a lifetime of petrol or diesel has had the moment of realisation: this really is the future. A similar dynamic is happening now with lorries. At the same test drive event, held this week at the Millbrook Proving Ground by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, there was also the chance to try out the LF Electric, assembled by Dutch lorrymaker DAF Trucks at its Leyland subsidiary in Lancashire. Compared to the noise and judder of a diesel engine it is a serene experience on a sunny spring day in the rolling Bedfordshire hills. So serene, in fact, that another good-natured instructor has to intervene to prevent another roundabout mishap.... Do check out the full piece: European stock markets have ended the week higher, even as shares slide on Wall Street. In London, the FTSE 100 gained 35 points, or 0.5%, to 7544, as stocks continued to recover from their plunge on Monday. Germany\u2019s DAX gained 0.85%, while France\u2019s CAC rose 0.4%. Quite a contrast with New York, where the Dow Jones is now down 1.7% or 575 points at 33,340. David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital, says European shares pushed higher despite tensions around Russia have ticked up. President Putin has threatened to hit back at countries that are assisting Ukraine. Gas supplies into the EU are being monitored as there are some worries the energy market could become weaponised. Yesterday, Germany dropped its objection to an EU wide embargo on Russian oil. That has led to speculation about a potential ban on oil from Russia. Even though those fears are in circulation, eurozone equities rose on the day, Germany\u2019s DAX hit a one-week, Italian stocks are posting strong gains too. In the US, the bulls are in retreat as stocks have handed back some of the stellar gains that were recorded last night. US tech stocks have experienced a spike in volatility lately ahead of next week\u2019s important Federal Reserve meeting, where it is widely believed that interest rates will be hiked by 0.5%. The pound is on track for its worst month against the US dollar in six years, amid worries that a recession could be looming. With only a few hours trading to go, sterling has lost 5.7 cents against the US dollar since the start of April to around $1.256, the biggest monthly drop since October 2016. The euro has had an equally grim month, down five cents to around $1.05, its biggest fall since 2015. The dollar has benefitted from expectations of sharp rises in US interest rates this year, as the Federal Reserve tries to rein in inflation, and hit a 20-year high agains a basket of currencies this week. As Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale explains: The war in Ukraine, Chinese efforts to offset the economic impact of the \u2018Zero Covid\u2019 policy and Japan\u2019s attempts at defeating deflation are all helping the dollar, while the Fed\u2019s attempt to catch up with the post-pandemic inflation spike continues. The possibility of an end to Russian energy exports to Europe is also hitting confidence, he adds: Meanwhile, the war created massive downside tail risk for the euro. This is obviously vastly less important than the human tragedy unfolding in Ukraine, but what happens if energy supplies cease? And with that recession risk present, who cares how hawkish the ECB is or what is priced into the rates curve? So down went the euro and everything associated with it, including sterling, as deep cracks that were already present in the economic outlook started to become glaringly obvious. The eurozone is heading towards a contraction as the cost of living squeeze and the Ukraine war hit the economy, warns BNP Paribas\u2019s Markets 360 team. They say that this morning\u2019s slightly weaker than expected Q1 GDP figures showed some early signs that household consumption was already losing steam at the start of the year. This foreshadows a more significant slowdown further ahead in our view as the squeeze on real incomes intensifies and sentiment is hit from the war. We think a contraction in the coming quarters is increasingly likely. Alongside today\u2019s inflation figures, today\u2019s data highlight the growth-inflation trade-off that the ECB faces \u2013 we think inflation concerns will keep the Governing Council on a normalisation path, but see lift-off happening in September rather than July. Russia\u2019s central bank chief has said the danger of an inflationary spiral have decreased, as she explained today\u2019s rate cut. Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said inflationary pressure stabilised in the second half of March, and pointed to stabilizing inflation expectations and improving savings sentiment among households. Nabiullina said (via Interfax): \u201cIn April, households\u2019 inflation expectations have returned to the levels of mid-2021. According to the surveys of households, expected inflation is below the observed price growth, meaning that people believe that prices will no longer rise as quickly. Companies\u2019 short-term price expectations have edged down as well, though they remain higher than last year. US consumer sentiment picked up in April. As anxiety over the economic outlook eased -- even as the economy went into reverse -- according to the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index. It rose to 65.2 for April, up from 59.4 in March. but still below 88.3 in April 2021. Most of the surge was concentrated in expectations, with gains of 21.6% in the year-ahead outlook for the economy and an 18.3% jump in personal financial expectations. Richard Curtin, surveys of consumers chief economist, says confidence is still weak, though: The global economy has added even more uncertainties about prospects for the U.S. economy, including the growing involvement in the military support for Ukraine, and renewed supply line disruptions from the covid crisis in China. Who would not be apprehensive about future conditions, even if on balance they anticipated a continued expansion? Moreover, consumers have lost confidence in economic policies, with fiscal actions increasingly hampered by partisanship in the runup to the Congressional elections Wall Street has dipped in early trading, as Amazon\u2019s shares slide after it reported its first loss since 2015. Amazon have fallen almost 12% to $2,547, their lowest since June 2020, after it reported a net loss of $3.8bn in the quarter. It was dragged into the red by a fall in the value of its stake in electric vehicle maker Rivian. But revenue growth slowed to just 7%, Amazon\u2019s slowest growth rate in nearly two decades. Craig Erlam of OANDA says Amazon was the latest to catch Wall Street off guard, as it faced a multitude of challenges -- including the Ukraine war, the cost of living squeeze, and the end of lockdown restrictions. There were the usual strong points to the report, like the cloud and advertising businesses - although the latter did fall a little short of expectations - but like many others, the company is struggling to adjust to post-pandemic life having scaled up massively over the last couple of years. The tech-focused Nasdaq index is down 1.3%, as is the broader S&amp;P 500, with Amazon leading the fallers. The risk of Russia defaulting on its sovereign debt may be easing today, after Moscow made a number of already-overdue international debt payments in dollars. Moscow has said that dollar payments on two foreign bonds are progressing after sanctions held them up for weeks. It has previously used roubles to cover the payments after US restrictions prevented them being made in dollars. Missing the dollar payments breached the terms on the debt, starting a 30-day grace period that ends next week. Russia\u2019s finance ministry said it had managed to pay $564.8m on a 2022 Eurobond and $84.4m on a 2042 bond in dollars - the currency specified on the bonds. The ministry said it had channeled the required funds to the London branch of Citibank, one of the so-called paying agents of the bonds whose job is to disburse them to the investors that originally lent the money to Moscow. We now wait to see if the money reaches the bond holders before the 30-day grace period expires on 4th May..... Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis, and the ongoing problems in the global supply chain, continue to hammer AO World, the online electricals retailer. AO, which sells kitchen appliances, computers, TVs and gaming consoles over the web, warned that its profits will dive this year as it faces falling sales. AO had previously been hit by global supply chain issues and a shortage of drivers. Now, customers are cancelling warranties on its products to save money amid the cost of living crisis, as my colleague Sarah Butler explains: It said underlying profits would be only \u00a38m for the year to 31 March 2022, down from \u00a364m last year, reflecting higher costs from driver shortages, extra marketing spending in Germany as well as lower sales and warranty cancellations. Sales fell 6% to \u00a31.6bn in the year but remain 52% ahead of pre-Covid levels. The company said it had noticed \u201chigher warranty cancellations than average historical trends\u201d in March as customers \u201cresponded to the escalating cost of living\u201d. It said the latest trading figures indicated the trend was continuing, potentially forcing a writedown of the value of its insurance contract leading to a \u201cmaterial impact on full-year profits\u201d. Shares in AO have slumped 20% to 70p, a two-year low, having soared over $4 in January 2021 as the pandemic drove a boom in web shopping. The eurozone faces stagflation after growth slowed to 0.2% in the last quarter and inflation hit a record level of 7.5%. Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is driving up energy costs across the continent, just as economies emerged from Omicron disruption, while China\u2019s Covid-19 outbreaks threaten more disruption oo. Berenberg Bank explains: Putin\u2019s war means Eurozone stagflation: Russia\u2019s brutal war against Ukraine has driven up prices for energy and foodstuffs, disrupted supply chains and dealt a serious blow to consumer confidence. As the most exposed major region globally, the Eurozone has fallen into stagflation as a result. Tough luck: A series of unusual shocks is battering the Eurozone. In late 2021 and the beginning of 2022, the Delta and Omicron waves of the COVID-19 pandemic weighed on economic activity in the Eurozone much more than in the US and the UK. Moreover, just as the region was gearing up for a major rebound \u2013 as indicated by a February bounce in economic sentiment \u2013 Putin\u2019s war derailed the nascent upturn. Due to its strong reliance on global trade, the Eurozone is now more at risk from Chinese lockdowns than the US. My colleague Richard Partington says warning lights are flashing in the eurozone economy today, after France stalled and Italy shrunk in the last quarter. Raising the spectre of stagflation as living costs soar while growth in GDP falters, France\u2019s economy unexpectedly ground to a halt in the first three months of the year, recording zero growth as supply chain disruption and higher energy costs held back activity. Italy\u2019s economy shrank, Spain lost momentum, while Germany rebounded from a contraction in the fourth quarter when Omicron and supply chain problems had weighed heavily on the euro area\u2019s largest economy. Suggesting a weaker period ahead as the conflict continues to push up the price of energy, hitting net importers of gas across the continent, separate figures for April showed eurozone inflation hit a record high of 7.5%. Here\u2019s the full story: Over in the US, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of consumer inflation has just hit a 40-year high. The PCE prices index rose by 6.6% in the year to March, the highest reading since 1982, with energy prices up 33.9% and food up 9.2% In March alone, the PCE rose by 0.9% in March, up from 0.5% in February. Despite rising prices, Americans kept spending last month. Consumer spending grew 1.1%, faster than expected, meaning real spending was up 0.1% after inflation Personal income rose 0.5% in March, as wages increased (but still lagged inflation), while the savings rate dipped to 6.2% from 6.8%. Deutsche Bank has been under pressure from authorities in recent years to improve its areas such as money-laundering controls, ahead of today\u2019s searches. Back in 2018, Germany\u2019s financial watchdog, Bafin, ordered Deutsche to do more to prevent money-laundering and \u201cterrorist financing,\u201d and appointed KPMG as an independent auditor to assess progress. Three years later, Bafin ordered Deutsche to bring in tighter controls, and expanded KPMG\u2019s mandate. In 2020, Frankfurt Prosecutor\u2019s Office fined Deutsche Bank \u20ac13.5m for being slow to report suspected money laundering in more than 600 cases related to its work with Danske Bank, but dropped a money-laundering probe against Deutsche Bank managers. Seperately, in Janary 2021, Deutsche agreed to pay US authorities around $130m and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve allegations that it breached bribery and fraud laws. Last month, Deutsche admitted it had breached this DPA by failing to flag a whistleblower complaint over its environment, social and governance work - meaning the DoJ has extended its monitorship. Today\u2019s may add to a list of legal and regulatory issues looming over Deutsche Bank\u2019s CEO Christian Sewing, says Bloomberg: Recent challenges include an internal probe into staff\u2019s widespread use of private communication channels, a lawsuit alleging mis-selling of foreign-exchange derivatives, and criticism from U.S. and German regulators of the bank\u2019s deficient controls. Prosecutors, federal police and other officials are conducting a search at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, the city\u2019s prosecutors have said. Germany\u2019s largest lender said the search involved suspicious transactions it had itself reported in relation to money laundering, and that it was cooperating fully. Reuters has the details: Prosecutors said they had a search warrant but declined to elaborate. They said representatives of financial regulator BaFin were also taking part. BaFin and federal police declined to comment. Deutsche Bank, under CEO Christian Sewing, has been trying to repair its reputation after a series of embarrassing and costly regulatory failings. This week, the bank posted a better-than-expected 17% rise in first-quarter profit as investment banking revenue climbed, but it warned that the Russia-Ukraine conflict could hurt annual earnings. A Reuters witness said that there was no sign of authorities outside the bank\u2019s headquarters. Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares are down around 2%. Russia\u2019s economy is expected to contract by between 8% and 10% this year, the Bank of Russia warns. The decrease will be mainly driven by \u201csupply-side factors\u201d, it says -- namely the sanction imposed on Russia since the war began. That would be the worst drop since Russia\u2019s economy shrank for several years in the early 1990s, exceeding the 7.8% decline after the 2008 financial crisis. Anouncing today\u2019s rate cut, the Bank says the economy has already begun to decline Based on Bank of Russia estimates, economic activity began to decline in March 2022. High-frequency indicators point to a contraction in consumer and business activity. After a temporary surge, consumer demand is decreasing in real terms, accompanied by a rise in households\u2019 propensity to save. The decline in imports due to the introduction of external trade and financial restrictions is outstripping the decline in exports. Despite the gradual change in the country and commodity structure of exports and imports as new suppliers and sales markets emerge, businesses are experiencing considerable difficulties in production and logistics. It predicts that the Russian economy will begin growing gradually in 2023, amid a structural transformation: In 2023 Q4, output will be up by 4.0\u20135.5% on the same period in 2022. However, the overall GDP change in 2023 will be within the range of (-3.0)\u20140.0% due to the base effect of 2022 Q1. In 2024, GDP will increase by 2.5\u20133.5%. Russia\u2019s central bank says that inflation in Russia could be as high as 23% this year, a sign of the economic damage caused by sanctions imposed since the Ukraine war: Announcing today\u2019s interest rate cut, it says: As of 22 April, annual inflation was 17.6% (vs 16.7% in March). In the baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia expects annual inflation to continue to increase in the coming months, due to the base effect, to total 18.0\u201323.0% in 2022. Inflation is then seen at 5.0\u20137.0% in 2023, before returning to the Bank of Russia\u2019s 4% target in 2024. Russia\u2019s central bank has lowered interest rates to 14%, a bigger cut than expected. At its regular meeting, the Bank of Russia lowered its key rate by 300 basis points to 14% from 17%. Economists had expected a smaller cut to 15%, but this still leaves borrowing costs much higher than before the Ukraine war. Announcing the move, the Bank of Russia says that inflationary pressures have eased after the rouble recovered from its plunge when the Ukraine invasion began in February: The external environment for the Russian economy remains challenging and significantly constrains economic activity. With price and financial stability risks no longer on the rise, conditions have allowed for the key rate reduction. Recent weekly data indicate a slowdown in current price growth rates on the back of a strengthening of the ruble and a cooling of consumer activity. Further inflation movements will be shaped by such impactful factors as the efficiency of import substitution processes and the scale and speed at which imports of finished goods, raw materials and components will be recovering. The Bank of Russia\u2019s monetary policy will take into the account the need for a structural transformation of the economy and will ensure a return of inflation to target in 2024. In February, Russia\u2019s central bank more than doubled interest rates from 9.5% to 20% shortly after the war began, in an attempt to support the sliding rouble. Russia\u2019s currency has since recovered to levels before the invasion, at around 70 to the US dollar, having hit a record high of 135 to the rouble in March. In the City, shares in UK specialist chemicals group Johnson Matthey are up 18% after the investment arm of New York-based industrial firm Standard Industries took a 5.23% stake Matthey\u2019s stock jumped as much as 30% on the FTSE 250 index of mid-size firms, and are trading at their highest since November. That was the month when the company announced it was pulling out of the fast-growing market for electric vehicle batteries, sending shares sliding and leading to Johnson Matthey exiting the FTSE 100 index. Reuters says: A London trader, on condition of anonymity, said the stake deal could be a prelude to \u201csome kind of move\u201d, referring to possible transactions. The eurozone slowed rapidly due to a \u201chodgepodge of reasons\u201d, from Omicron to the Ukraine war, says ING senior economist Bert Colijn. Zooming out, we see a eurozone economy undergoing a turbulent quarter though managing to eke out a small positive growth number, with the Omicron impact milder than expected and the war in Ukraine having an increasing impact from early March onwards. Supply chain problems flared up again in March, causing production shutdowns across the eurozone, which has added to the slowing growth figure in 1Q. Colijn also fears that core inflation across the eurozone could continue to climb this year, hurting households. The spike in fuel, electricity and gas prices from early March at the start of the war in Ukraine was followed by cautious retreats and governments reducing taxes on energy. This has resulted in a slight moderation of energy inflation, but concerns remain for the months ahead. The recent jump in market gas prices on the back of Russia cutting off Poland and Bulgaria from gas supply illustrates that it is very possible energy prices spike once again as the war continues. The impact on core inflation remains key and poses a concern for the ECB. Second-round effects and supply chain problems add to faster price increases in goods and services as well, which has caused core prices to jump from 2.9% in March to 3.5% in April. With supply chain problems set to last longer and become more severe again due to Chinese lockdowns and the war, expect core inflation to trend higher for most of 2022 at least. This broadening of high inflation is a key concern for the ECB and adds to pressure to act quickly, despite the fact that this inflation continues to be rooted in supply-side issues beyond the control of the central bank. More here: Austria\u2019s economy bucked the trend, with strong growth in January-March as it emerged from Covid-19 lockdowns. Austrian GDP expanded by 2.5% in Q1, after a 1.5% contraction in Q4. Austria lifted its \u201clockdown of the unvaccinated\u201d in January, and relaxed restrictions on shops and hospitality venues in February, after imposing curbs to combat the omicron variant last winter. Core inflation across the eurozone, which strips out energy, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco, jumped to a record 3.5%. That shows that inflationary pressures are broadening. Here\u2019s some snap reaction to the rise in the cost of living: Inflation across the eurozone has hit a record high, as Europe\u2019s cost of living crisis intensifies. Eurozone inflation rose to 7.5% in April, statistics office Eurostat estimates, up from March\u2019s 7.4% (which was itself a record). Prices jumped by 0.6% in April alone. Energy was the biggest single factor driving annual inflation up, with prices jumping 38% year-on-year, down from March\u2019s 44.4%. But while energy costs dipped during April, other price pressures intensified. Food, alcohol &amp; tobacco annual inflation increased to 6.4% from 5.0% in March, while industrial goods prices rose 3.8% from 3.4%, and services inflation accelerated to 3.3%, from 2.7% in March. This puts more pressure on the European Central Bank to raise interest rates from current record lows this summer, to bring inflation down towards its 2% target. Just in: Growth across the eurozone slowed to a near crawl last month, as soaring energy prices and supply chain disruption intensified by the Ukraine war hit the economy. Eurozone GDP increased by 0.2% in January-March, down from 0.3% growth in October-December. France\u2019s stalling economy, and the 0.2% contraction in Italy, took the shine of Germany\u2019s return to growth. Growth across the wider EU slowed too, to +0.4% from +0.5% Despite returning to growth in Q1, Germany\u2019s economy will be weak this quarter, predicts Oliver Rakau, chief German economist at Oxford Economics: Here\u2019s his take on this morning\u2019s GDP report: Italy\u2019s economy, though, is on the brink of recession. Italian GDP shrank by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2022, the first contraction since the end of 2020. It\u2019s a sign that pandemic disruption, high commodity prices and the Ukraine war could have hit activity, as we saw with France this morning. Statistics body ISTAT reports that the Italian economy was 5.8% larger than a year ago, following the recovery during 2021, adding: The quarter on quarter change is the result of an increase of value added in agriculture, forestry and fishing, a decrease in that of services and a stationarity in industry. From the demand side, there is a positive contribution by the domestic component (gross of change in inventories) and a negative one by the net export component. Growth in Spain was weaker than expected in the last quarter. Spanish GDP increased by 0.3% in January-March, below the 0.5% expected, and a sharp slowdown on the 2.2% growth in the last quarter of 2021. Reuters has more details: Spiralling inflation, exacerbated by the Ukraine crisis and a Spanish truck drivers\u2019 strike in March, dragged down household spending by 3.7% over the quarter, the National Statistics Institute data showed. On an annual basis output expanded by 6.4%, roughly inline with a Reuters poll for 6.5% growth as the economy rebounded from the first quarter of 2021 when Spain was buffeted by a huge snowstorm that cut transport lines with the capital. Germany has returned to growth, as Europe\u2019s largest economy avoided being dragged into recession by the Ukraine war. German GDP increased by 0.2% in the January-March quarter, lifted by an increase in investment, although net trade has a negative impact. That follows a 0.3% contraction in the last quarter of 2021, when restrictions to combat the Omicron variant and supply chain problems hit its economy. It means Germany has avoided two quarters of falling growth in a row. The Federal Statistics Office warns, though, that the Ukraine conflict has been hurting Germany\u2019s economy over the last two months. Economic performance increased slightly in the first quarter of 2022, following the recovery of the German economy last summer and the decline at the end of 2021. This was mainly due to higher capital formation, whereas the balance of exports and imports had a downward effect on economic growth. The economic consequences of the war in Ukraine have had a growing impact on the short-term economic development since late February. German economists and government ministers have warned that a ban on Russian gas imports could plunge Germany into a recession this year, amid pressure to cut funds to Russia. UK house price growth has slowed from its highest level in 17 years. The average house price rose by 12.1% in the year to April, building society Nationwide reports. That\u2019s down from 14.3% in March, which was the highest since late 2004. Prices rose by 0.3% during April, down from 1.1% in March, lifting prices on Nationwide\u2019s index to a new record of \u00a3267,620. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s Chief Economist, predicted the slowdown will continue, as pressure mounts on household budgets and interest rates continue to rise. We continue to expect the housing market to slow in the quarters ahead. The squeeze in household incomes is set to intensify with inflation expected to rise further, perhaps reaching double digits in the quarters ahead if global energy prices remain high. Moreover, assuming that labour market conditions remain strong, the Bank of England is likely to raise interest rates further, which will also exert a drag on the market if this feeds through to mortgage rates.\u201d NatWest has reported a 40% jump in first quarter profits but warned of the UK\u2019s \u201cuncertain\u201d economy amid the cost of living crisis, saying it had already referred more than 2,000 customers to debt experts at Citizens Advice. The banking group \u2013 formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 beat expectations after reporting a jump in pre-tax profits to \u00a31.2bn compared with \u00a3885m a year earlier. That was compared to analyst forecasts of a 15% drop in profits to \u00a3755m. Its strong first quarter results \u2013 the first reported since the UK government stake in the group fell below 50% last month \u2013 was supported by mortgage borrowing, higher interest rates and a rebound in consumer spending as Covid restrictions were eased. NatWest\u2019s chief executive, Alison Rose, warned that \u201cThe world has changed considerably during the last three months,\u201d noting the impact the Russian invasion of Ukraine was having on the UK economy. Rose said: We are also very aware of the challenges and concerns the cost-of-living crisis is causing for many of our customers up and down the country. NatWest Group is focused on providing practical help and support for the people, families and businesses we serve\u201d. NatWest said it had identified vulnerable customers and had referred 2,100 people to Citizens Advice in the last year. Here\u2019s the full story: Britain\u2019s economy faces a \u201cwave of insolvencies\u201d after the number of UK companies at risk of collapsing jumped by nearly a fifth this year. Insolvency firm Begbies Traynor reports that the number of firms in \u2018critical financial distress\u2019 jumped by almost a fifth in the first quarter of this year, year-on-year. There were 1,891 firms facing a county court judgement of at least \u00a35,000, or a winding up petition, in the quarter, led by a 51% jump in the construction sector and a 42% rise among bars and restaurants, it says. Overall County Court Judgements \u2013 a warning sign of future insolvencies \u2013 jumped 157% to 22,552 in the quarter compared with a year ago; with March seening the highest number in a single month for five years. Begbies Traynor fears a wave of business failures is approaching, as Covid support is cut off, inflation climbs, and firms face supply chain problems and a post-Brexit hangover. Begbies Traynor partner Julie Palmer told the Today Programme that courts are now processing claims from creditors who couldn\u2019t take action earlier in the pandemic. We think they\u2019ll be accelerated by the fact that in a day\u2019s time, the landlords are able to start petitioning, to take legal action against companies. We think the landlords are a very impatient lobby that will swell those figures. Anecdotally, there is about a year\u2019s backlog of creditors looking to take action, Palmer says: As the backlog clears, we think the figures will really begin to swell. Palmer says the government needs a two-pronged approach. Firms who need more support could be given leniency in repaying pandemic funding. But there are also \u2018zombie companies\u2019 who need to be allowed to fail, she adds. In another blow, French inflation has just hit its highest level in decades. Consumer prices accelerated by 4.8% per year in April, INSEE estimates, the highest level since 1985. The surge was driven by a 26.6% increase in energy prices (despite Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government capping energy bill increases), while food prices jumped 3.8% including a 6.6% rise in fresh food There was also a pick-up in prices for services (2.9%) and manufactured goods (+2.7%). On an EU-harmomised basis, French inflation hit a record high of 5.4%, up from 5.1% in March - further away from the ECB\u2019s 2% target. France\u2019s unexpected slowdown in the first three months of the year does not bode well for the future, warns Charlotte de Montpellier of ING. De Montpellie predicts that French economic gowth will remain weak, amid weak household demand, pressures on businesses, and disruption from China\u2019s Covid-19 lockdowns. For the coming quarters, the growth outlook is not very bright. The sharp rise in inflation, which is now spreading more and more widely throughout the economy, is weighing on household incomes. This is compounded by household pessimism, illustrated by the sharp fall in consumer confidence in March and the fact that it did not recover in April. These two elements are likely to further dampen household demand. This drop in household demand will also start to be felt by companies, which will be less able to pass on the cost increases they are facing in their selling prices. There is therefore a risk of a deterioration in business confidence, which until now had held up rather well despite the shock of the war. In addition, the situation in China should weigh on production lines, complicating the supply of inputs and disrupting production in the coming months, but also on French exports. French economic growth is therefore likely to remain weak. Although none of these factors is sufficient to tip the French economy completely into recession, the combination of all of them at the same time drastically increases the risk of one or two quarters of negative growth for the rest of the year. Germany\u2019s import price inflation has accelerated sharply in March to its highest level since the oil crisis of 1974, highlighting that inflationary pressures are intense. The cost of inported goods surged by a jaw-dropping 31.2% in March, compared with a year ago, and by 5.7% in March alone. The surge in costs shows the impact of the war in Ukraine, says statistics body Destatis. Energy import prices soared 160.5% per year, with gas prices quadrupling (+304.3%) and crude oil up 81.3%. The index of export prices was 15.9%, showing that firms have lifted their own prices in response. France\u2019s statistics body INSEE says that weak domestic demand hit the economy, while trade and inventory changes had a positive impact to GDP. GDP stagnated in Q1 2022 (0.0% quarter on quarter after +0.8%) in connection with the weakness of the domestic demand: Households\u2019 consumption expenditure sharply decreased (-1.3% after +0,6%) while gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) slightly decelerated (+0.2% after +0.3%). Finally, internal demand excluding inventory changes contributed to -0.6 points to GDP growth, after +0.5 points in the previous quarter. Foreign trade, although slowing down, continued to progress. The increase was more marked on the export side (+1.5% after +3.5%) than on the import side (+1.1% after +3.2%). Thereby, the contribution of foreign trade to GDP growth was slightly positive this quarter: +0.1 points after +0.0 in the previous quarter. At last, the contribution of inventory changes to GDP growth was positive again this quarter (+0.4 points after +0.3 points in Q4 2021). France\u2019s sharp slowdown raises the spectre of stagflation in the eurozone, warns the FT: The main drag on French growth was a fall in household spending, indicating that higher food and energy prices and the fallout from the Ukraine war are taking their toll on retail spending and consumer confidence. Bloomberg says France unexpectedly stagnated as the Ukraine war took its toll: France\u2019s economy unexpectedly stagnated at the start of the year, sounding an early warning of the damage to Europe from soaring energy costs and worsening supply snarls following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Europe\u2019s near-term outlook is exceptionally uncertain. Another round of sanctions -- including a possible ban on Russian oil imports -- risks hammering industry, while record inflation and plummeting confidence are jeopardizing consumer demand. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. France\u2019s economy has unexpectedly ground to a halt as the energy crisis, inflation and supply chain problems exacerbated by the Ukraine war hit growth. French GDP was unchanged in the first quarter of this year, weaker than the 0.3% growth expected by economists, official data released this morning shows. After growing 0.8% in October-December, France\u2019s growth fizzled out in January-March, statistics body INSEE reports. It\u2019s a sign of the economic damage being caused by soaring energy and commodity prices, and supply chain disruption from the Ukraine war. Household spending contracted by 1.3%, a signal that the surge in inflation is hitting domestic budgets and confidence, despite France\u2019s \u20ac25bn package of support for energy bills. We find out at 10am how the wider eurozone fared in the first quarter, with growth figures from Germany, Spain and Italy all expected this morning too. France\u2019s slowdown will increase concerns over the health of the world economy. Yesterday we learned America\u2019s economy shrank unexpectedly in the first quarter of the year, contracting by -0.4% in the first quarter, or -1.4% on an annualized basis. That was the US\u2019s weakest quarter since the early days of the pandemic, as the widening US trade deficit pulled down GDP. Supply chain problems, and ongoing pandemic disruption, is continuing to hit the companies. Last night, Apple warned that chip shortages and factory shutdowns in China could cost it up to $8bn of revenue this quarter. It\u2019s another sign that the world economy is slowing.

            "date": "2022-04-08T16:20:29Z",
            "content": "Time to wrap up for the week. Here\u2019s a round-up of our stories: Goodnight. GW Just in: inflation in Russia accelerated last month as the plunge in the rouble drove up import costs and sanctions hit the economy. Data just released shows that Russian consumer prices jumped by 7.61% in March alone, the fastest monthly increase in inflation since 1999. The annual CPI index rose by 16.69% in March, sharply up on February\u2019s 9.15%. Reuters has more details: In March, sugar prices jumped 44% compared with February, while prices for onions and washing machines rose 50% and 46%, respectively. In the City, the UK\u2019s blue-chip stock index has closed at its highest level in two months, as European markets shrug off concerns over slowing growth and the ongoing Ukraine war. The FTSE 100 has jumped 1.5% today, or 118 points, to end at 7,670 points. Miners and oil companies were in the top risers, such as Anglo American (+4.8%), Shell (+3.9%) and BP (+3.7%). Banks and retailers also rallied. Stocks were up across Europe too, despite concerns that the cost of living crisis will slow the recovery. Germany\u2019s DAX gained around 1.4%, while France\u2019s CAC index was 1.3% higher ahead of the first-round vote in France\u2019s presidential election this weekend. David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital, wrote: Stock markets are on track to finish higher this afternoon as traders have shrugged off the negative headlines about additional sanctions on Russia, as well as the chatter about higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve. By and large, it was a negative week for equities as countries revealed plans to target Russia\u2019s energy exports. Earlier today, Japan announced that it will ban the importation of coal from Russia \u2013 the EU made a similar announcement during the week. Dealers are getting used to the idea of even higher interest rates from the Fed as US central bankers are open to hiking rates by 50 basis points in a bid to tackle rising inflation. Russia\u2019s central bank\u2019s interest rate cut at an unscheduled meeting of policy makers today is a sign that efforts to stabilize the country\u2019s financial system are having an effect, says the WSJ: In a statement announcing the reduction in the key rate to 17% from 20%, the Bank of Russia said the ruble\u2019s rebound from sharp losses in the days immediately following the Feb. 24 invasion had reduced the risk that inflation would move sharply higher. The costs of insuring merchant ships sailing to ports in the Black Sea has spiraled out of control, Bloomberg reports this afternoon. This is becoming a huge potential impediment to the movement of Russian cargoes from the region, adding to the pressures on its economy. Here are the details: Underwriters are charging as much as 10% of the value of a ship\u2019s hull -- basically the vessel\u2019s worth as an asset -- for what is called additional war-risk premium, according to four people involved in the market. Some are simply quoting to cover at prices that they know will be refused. There was almost zero cost prior to the war. It means that insurance now likely exceeds the cost of hiring the vessel itself. A $50m, five-year old tanker hauling a standard 1 million-barrel Russian cargo would need $5m just in insurance premiums -- about $1.5m above the cost of hiring the carrier. While Russia is cutting interest rates, Sri Lanka has doubled them as the economic meltdown gripping the country continued. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka\u2019s (CBSL) monetary board raised its standing lending facility to 14.50% and its standing deposit facility to 13.50%, both up 700 basis points. It acted to try to tackle inflation, with prices having soared due to crippling shortages of basic goods driven by a devastating economic crisis. Earlier this week, the Sri Lankan rupee plunged to become the world\u2019s worst-performing currency, while its sovereign dollar bonds are trade at deeply distressed levels. There have been warnings that Sri Lanka facing the imminent threat of starvation, as Hannah Ellis-Petersen, our South Asia correspondent, reported: Over the past few months, Sri Lanka has been facing a dire financial crisis on multiple fronts, triggered partially by the impact of Covid-19, which battered the economy, as well as mounting foreign debts, rising inflation and economic mismanagement by the government, led by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The country barely has any foreign currency reserves left, leading to dangerous shortages of food, gas and medicines as it is unable to import foreign goods, while people are enduring power blackouts of up to eight hours a day. The situation has pushed thousands out onto the streets in protest in recent days, calling for the resignation of the president. Protestors have been hit with teargas and water cannon in some instances and dozens have been arrested, but it has done nothing to prevent citizens from across all generations and walks of life turning out on the streets. Elsewhere in the markets, the pound has dropped below $1.30 to its lowest level against the US dollar since November 2020. Sterling is under pressure against the dollar, as America\u2019s central bank has underlined its determination this week to tighten monetary policy to tame inflation, by unwinding its stimulus package. Today\u2019s interest rate cut suggests that Russia\u2019s central bank is confident that the \u201cmost acute phase of the economic crisis has now passed\u201d and a bank run has been avoided, says Liam Peach, Emerging Europe Economist at Capital Economics. Peach predicts that further, gradual, rate cuts are likely over the course of this year as the CBR tries to bring inflation back to target, adding: The decision came as a surprise as no official meeting had been scheduled until late-April (we had expected a 300bp cut in June), but the press statement pointed to two developments. First, the central bank said that \u201cthere is a steady inflow of funds to fixed-term deposits\u201d, which suggests that the CBR has become confident that it its emergency rate hike to 20% at the end of February, alongside capital controls and other measures, prevented a major and destabilising bank run. The second is that the CBR said that \u201cweekly data point to a noticeable slowdown in current price growth rates\u201d. UK travel news: HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) says it has \u201csuccessfully made changes\u201d to its network, allowing traders and hauliers to use the goods vehicle movement service (GVMS), a post-Brexit customs system which has not been available for over a week. The portal, which is used to create a goods movement reference (GMR) number needed for exporting from and importing to the UK, had been suffering an outage since last Thursday. Even though HMRC had said hauliers could use other documentation to show that a customs declaration had been made, as part of its contingency measures, industry insiders had complained that the GVMS outage was adding to lengthy queues of HGVs trying to reach France by ferry or Eurotunnel. Thousands of lorry drivers were caught in the gridlock, which was also partly caused by reduced sailings from Dover while P&amp;O Ferries is out of service, plus extra Easter tourist traffic, and a backlog of freight traffic. HMRC said: \u201cContingencies will remain in place over the weekend to continue to ensure the movement of goods and allow continued testing.\u201d From midday on Monday, all traders will have to create a GMR - a barcode - with GVMS in order to transport their goods. Back in the UK, the cost of living crisis means households are more worried about their personal finances than they have been in at least a decade The latest analysis from YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research show that confidence about household finances is the lowest since the survey began 10 years ago. Households were more pessimistic about the outlook over the next year, and reported a sharp deterioration over the last month, as rising food and energy prices hit budgets. Emma McInnes, Global Head of Financial Services at YouGov, says: \u201cThe ongoing cost of living crisis and uncertainty caused by continued conflict in Ukraine has, once again, seriously impacted on both consumer confidence and the public\u2019s household finances. For the second month running, tumbling household finance measures - both retrospective and forward-looking \u2013 find themselves at their lowest ever level since tracking began almost ten years ago. Aside from a small uptick in job security outlook, confidence and household finance figures, combined with house price scores stagnating after four months of growth, have largely contributed to the overall consumer index continuing to fall\u201d Here\u2019s Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, on today\u2019s cut to Russia\u2019s main interest rate today: The Bank of Russia [CRB] is seemingly buoyed by recent actions from the Kremlin despite severe sanctions continuing to be imposed by the West. The capital controls that have been imposed have helped to shore up the rouble which appears to have given the CBR confidence that interest rates no longer need to be so high. It cut the Key Rate by 3% and left the door open to further cuts depending on financial and economic conditions. At 17%, the rate remains extremely high as inflation is still expected to spike and the economy severely contract. When the Ukraine war began, the rouble plunged from below 80 to the US dollar to as low as 135 roubles/$1. But it has now recovered to near February\u2019s pre-invasion levels, supported by capital controls including a ban on banks and brokers selling dollars, euros and other foreign currencies, and curbs on sending money abroad. Russia is heading for its deepest recession since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the UK government has predicted. Economists expect Russia\u2019s GDP this year to contract by between 8.5% and 15%, the UK says, as it announces sanctions on Vladimir Putin\u2019s two adult daughters. GDP growth is likely to be depressed over the longer term, as Russia is cut off from Western technology, it adds. Around \u00a3275bn, or 60% of Russian foreign currency reserves, are currently frozen, the UK estimates, which has hampered Moscow\u2019s ability to support its economy. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: Our unprecedented package of sanctions is hitting the elite and their families, while degrading the Russian economy on a scale Russia hasn\u2019t seen since the fall of the Soviet Union. But we need to do more. Through the G7, we are working with partners to end the use of Russian energy and further hit Putin\u2019s ability to fund his illegal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. Together, we are tightening the ratchet on Russia\u2019s war machine, cutting off Putin\u2019s sources of cash. Last month the Institute of International Finance forecast that Russia\u2019s economy would shrink by 15% this year, and that any further boycotts of Russian energy would drastically impair its ability to import goods and services. Those recession concerns prompted Russia\u2019s central bank to cut interest rates from 20% to 17% this morning. The foreign currency freeze stopped Russia paying holders of its sovereign debt more than $600m earlier this week. The US Treasury blocked Russia\u2019s ability to make debt payments in dollars through American banks, meaning Moscow had to set aside roubles instead. That could count as a debt default, after a 30-day grace period. The UK has added Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s daughters to its sanctions list, matching a move by the United States this week. Katerina Tikhonova and Maria Vorontsova, Putin\u2019s two adult daughters with his former wife Lyudmila Shkrebneva, and Yekaterina Sergeyevna Vinokurova, daughter of foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, will be subject to travel bans and asset freezes. The UK say the move will further target \u201cthe lavish lifestyles of the Kremlin\u2019s inner circle\u201d. By freezing the assets and limiting the travel of Putin\u2019s allies, the UK Government is sealing off reservoirs of cash funding the conflict, while also making sure those who have benefited from Putin\u2019s rule feel the consequences. My colleague Rupert Neate wrote about Tikhonova and Vorontsova earlier this week: Katerina Tikhonova, 35, the younger daughter, was born in Dresden in 1986 while Putin was working as a KGB spy. Tikhonova, who uses the surname of her maternal grandmother, studied at St Petersburg State University and Moscow State University and has a master\u2019s degree in physics and mathematics. As well as studying, Tikhonova has a passion for Japanese culture and acrobatic rock\u2019n\u2019roll dancing, an athletic form of boogie-woogie. In 2013 she and her dance partner came fifth in the world championships in Switzerland. It was footage from her dance competitions, compared with pictures from the website of Moscow State University, where she works, that helped to first establish that Tikhonova was Putin\u2019s daughter in 2015. Putin\u2019s elder daughter, Maria Vorontsova, 36, is a paediatric endocrinologist, studying the effects of hormones on the body. In 2019 Vorontsova, who lives in a penthouse apartment opposite the US embassy in Moscow, gave an interview on Russian state TV revealing plans for a \u00a3500m medical venture aimed at helping to cure cancer. Vorontsova married the Dutch businessman Jorrit Faassen, and the couple lived in the penthouse of an exclusive apartment building in Voorschoten, near the Hague. In 2014 some Dutch neighbours called for her to be expelled from the country after the downing of MH17 by pro-Russia forces over Ukraine. Just in: Russia\u2019s central bank is cutting interest rates from 20% to 17%. The move reverses some of the doubling of interest rates last month, when the Ukraine war triggered the first wave of sanctions on Russia and sent the rouble plunging. Explaining the move, which comes in on Monday, the Bank of Russsia said inflation pressures have eased as the rouble has partially recovered, and financial stability risks have stabilised, but are still present. It also warns that Russia\u2019s economic activity is still being \u201cconsiderably\u201d constrained by external conditions. Today\u2019s decision reflects a change in the balance of risks of accelerated consumer price growth, decline in economic activity and financial stability risks. Data this week showed that Russia\u2019s service sector contracted rapidly last month, with economists predicting a steep recession this year. The Bank of Russia adds that it could cut interest rates again at future meetings: In its further key rate decisions, the Bank of Russia will take into account risks posed by external and domestic conditions and the reaction of financial markets, as well as actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, and holds open the prospect of further key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. On food, Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal has predicted that this year\u2019s grain harvest is likely to be 20% less than last year because of a reduced sowing area following Russia\u2019s invasion. He said there was a shortage of fuel for farmers but Ukraine knew how to keep them supplied. He also said Ukraine had large stocks of grain, cereals and vegetable oil, and could feed its population (via Reuters). Here\u2019s a chart showing the jump in food prices: World food prices jumped to new record high in March as the war in Ukraine rattled drove up prices, adding to the inflation pressures on people around the globe. The U.N. food agency reports that food prices rose nearly 13% during last month, according to its index tracking food commodities. Vegetable oils, cereals and meat all hit record highs, while sugar and dairy products prices also rose significantly. The Food and Agriculture Organization says its food price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, made \u201ca giant leap\u201d in March, to 159.3 points from 141.4 for February. Cereal prices soared by 19.7% to a record in March, driven by the Ukraine war, the FAO explains: This month\u2019s increase reflected a surge in world prices of wheat and coarse grains, largely driven by conflict-related export disruptions from Ukraine and, to a lesser extent, the Russian Federation. The expected loss of exports from the Black Sea region exacerbated the already tight global availability of wheat. With concerns over crop conditions in the United States of America (USA) also adding support, world wheat prices rose sharply in March, soaring by 19.7 percent. Vegetable oil also hit record highs, up 23% in the month, as supplies from major exporters Russia and Ukraine fell. The sharp rise of the index was driven by higher sunflower, palm, soy and rapeseed oil prices. International sunflowerseed oil quotations increased substantially in March, fuelled by reduced export supplies amid the ongoing conflict in the Black Sea region. In the meantime, palm, soy and rapeseed oil prices also rose markedly, buoyed by rising global import demand in the wake of sunflower oil supply disruptions. The Ukraine conflict also contributed to record meat prices last month, which rose another 4.8%, the FAO adds. In March, pig meat prices registered the steepest monthly increase on record since 1995, underpinned by supply shortfalls of slaughter pigs in Western Europe and a surge in internal demand in light of the upcoming Easter holidays. International poultry meat prices firmed, fuelled by reduced supplies from leading exporting countries following avian flu outbreaks, further impacted by Ukraine\u2019s inability to export poultry meat amid the ongoing conflict. There\u2019s further misery for some air passengers today, with travel journalist Simon Calder reporting British Airways has cancelled another 68 flights, while easyJet has cancelled 42. There\u2019s a handy list here. Next weekend will also be very busy on the UK roads, as millions of people embark on an Easter getaway. The AA estimates that more than 27.6 million car journeys are planned between Good Friday and Easter Monday (between 15th and 18th April). Some 13.6 million are expected on Good Friday alone, leading to fears of tailbacks on popular tourist routes. AA spokesman Tony Rich said: \u201cThe Easter holidays look set to give British tourism a much-needed boost as people cut back on overseas travel. \u201cWith more than 27.6 million trips planned over the bank holiday weekend, we can expect significant congestion across the UK as people flock to coastal resorts and holiday homes.\u201d The boss of Manchester Airport\u2019s owner has admitted the airport does not have enough staff, and warned that the long queues at the airport could persist for months. Charlie Cornish, chief executive of Manchester Airports Group, has written an open letter to passengers, in which he apologises for the disruption, and explains that the the airport hasn\u2019t been able to hire staff fast enough. Cornish says: \u201cThe simple fact is that we don\u2019t currently have the number of staff we need to provide the level of service that our passengers deserve. \u201cDespite our efforts since last autumn, the tight labour market around the airport has meant we have just not been able to hire people quickly enough to establish a full-strength team. \u201cPractically, staff shortages mean that we cannot open all the security lanes we need and, at times, this results in longer queues than we want to see. \u201cWhile we still expect most passengers to get through in less than 30-40 minutes, there will be times over the next few months when waiting times will rise to between 60 and 90 minutes.\u201d Cornish explains that the airport has interviewed 4,000 staff in the last two months, and expects around 250 new security staff to start in the operation by early May. Staff with the right level of security clearance are also being deployed to help. Cornish advises passengers to arrive at the airport three hours before their flight leaves, to allow enough time to check-in, get through security and reach the departure gate. He says the airport doesn\u2019t want to cap capacity and force airlines to cancel flights, as this would cause \u201cenormous disruption to holidays, business trips and long-awaited visits to see friends and family.\u201d The managing director of Manchester airport quit earlier this week after rising criticism over chaos that saw thousands of passengers missed their flights because of queues up to seven hours long. Deputy CEO Ken O\u2019Toole has the BBC the chaotic scenes last weekend were an \u201cisolated incident\u201d. But O\u2019Toole insists people would prefer to queue than see their flight cancelled. We want to protect the full flying schedule. We want to make sure that after two years of people not getting away, those trips that they have booked, they can take them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat unfortunately does mean on occasion there will be queues which are not acceptable, they\u2019re not what we\u2019re aiming for. \u201cBut the compromise between having that situation or cancelling lots of flights for people - which other airports have done in recent weeks - we believe people would prefer to accept a queue and make sure they get away.\u201d Those queues have been exceptionally long, though, with some passengers enduring waits of up to eight hours in terminal buildings before they could check in. With a very busy weekend looming, passengers have been told to allow extra time to negotiate airport queues, as high rates of Covid infections worsen staff shortages at check-in and security, our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham writes. Meanwhile, tailbacks on the major roads to the Channel are expected to intensify, as Eurotunnel anticipates rising traffic in both directions and P&amp;O Ferries services remain suspended. Passengers booked with P&amp;O on the Dover-Calais route have been told they cannot travel this weekend, as the rival operator DFDS, which had been accommodating P&amp;O customers, is now fully booked. Airports are redeploying office staff with security clearance to frontline roles where possible to help mitigate the chaotic scenes of recent days, particularly at Manchester airport. EasyJet, which has had to axe hundreds of flights this week, said it would be pre-emptively cancelling a further 50 flights a day over the weekend to minimise disruption. Large numbers of crew remain sick with Covid, affecting services at Gatwick, Luton and Manchester. However, the airline said it would still be operating more flights than at any point since 2019 \u2013 about 1,600 a day, 300 more than in August 2021. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. UK airlines and airports have been warned about the levels of disruption being by passengers, as people head abroad in the run-up to Easter, some of them for the first time since the pandemic began. After days of long queues, cancellations and chaotic scenes at airports, the aviation regulator has warned travel firms to stop cancelling flights at the last minute and promptly pay compensation to disrupted passengers. Civil Aviation Authority chief executive Richard Moriarty has written to airlines and airports, saying: \u201cInstances of late notice cancellations and excessive delays at airports are not just distressing for affected consumers but have the potential to impact confidence levels across the industry, at just the point when passengers are returning to flying.\u201d The CAA\u2019sa warning comes as airlines and cross-Channel services brace for their busiest weekend since the start of the pandemic, with outbound and returning holidaymakers set to swell numbers at ports that are already struggling to cope with surging demand. Airports and airlines have blamed recruitment problems, and illness from Covid-19, for leaving them short-staffed. Having cut staff once the pandemic began, the industry is trying to meet renewed demand for travel after the UK lifted the last testing restrictions on 18 March. Moriarty, though, says recruitment should have been faster, and insists the travel sector sets \u201cdeliverable\u201d schedules: We know that you are working hard to recruit these new colleagues, but it is clear that this has not always happened sufficiently quickly to cope with the increased passenger travel in recent days. Given the consequences for passengers of cancelled and disrupted journeys I encourage you to do all you can to ensure that you have the necessary level of appropriately-trained and cleared staff resources in place.\u201d It is \u201cvery important\u201d that airlines are setting schedules \u201con a basis that is deliverable given available staff (including contractors), and has resilience for staff sickness, including from Covid,\u201d Mr Moriarty added. Hundreds of flights have been cancelled in recent days, with British Airways cancelling another 74 flights on Thursday and easyJet 52. There\u2019s also disruption in Kent, where an eastward section of the M20 was shut this week for thousands of lorries to park, due to delays at the port of Dover. Also coming up today. In the energy markets, the Brent crude oil price is hovering around $100 per barrel after members of the International Energy Agency agreed to release another 60 million barrels of oil from their emergency stocks yesterday, amid a shortage exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Boris Johnson is set to meet the German Chancellor as they look to discuss how to help European countries wean themselves off Russian gas following the attack on Ukraine.

Can you imagine being Melania? Every year they sing happy birthday, then she spends the next 10 minutes watching the gibbon she married wolf down a whole cake.\u201d Kimmel also ragged on Donald Trump\u2019s app Truth Social, \u201cwhich is such a disaster he himself hasn\u2019t even posted on it for 11 weeks\u201d. Though he will probably be allowed to return to Twitter under Elon Musk, who bought the company for $44bn this week, Trump has said he will not go back to the bird app. (His account was banned after the 6 January attack on the Capitol.) But \u201che 100% will go back on Twitter\u201d, Kimmel predicted. \u201cAnd then this dumb new company he conned everybody out of their money for will become, I guess, the social media equivalent of a RadioShack.\u201d \u201cA RadioShack that is run by Devin Nunes,\u201d he added of the former California congressman, who claimed on Fox News that Truth Social has gotten more engagement than both Twitter and Instagram. \u201c\u2018Engagement\u2019 means the four people who are on it have been liking each other\u2019s posts.\u201d Dr Deborah Birx, the former White House Covid response coordinator to Trump, has published a tell-all book called Silent Invasion: The Untold Story of the Trump Administration, Covid-19, and Preventing the Next Pandemic Before It\u2019s Too Late. \u201cWhich is a lot of words for someone who never spoke up at all,\u201d said Kimmel. In the book, Birx calls the press conference in which Trump advised Americans to drink bleach as a Covid treatment a \u201ctragedy\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing \u2013 all it took for the people to finally say something was an advance from a book publisher,\u201d Kimmel mused. Trevor Noah On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also mocked Truth Social, which has \u201cso far been a total bust\u201d, with 500,000 daily users. \u201cTo put it in perspective, Twitter, the thing that it\u2019s supposed to be replacing, has 217 million daily users,\u201d Noah said. \u201cSo Truth Social is \u2018competition\u2019 for Twitter the same way that guy on the plane was \u2018competition\u2019 for Mike Tyson.\u201d Trump has posted on Truth Social just one time, for its launch two months ago. \u201cThink about how crazy that is!\u201d Noah exclaimed. \u201cPeople, when he was on Twitter, Trump would send, what, 50 tweets every time he went to the bathroom. But now? He hasn\u2019t posted in two months? I\u2019m just saying, man, someone needs to get this guy some prune juice stat.\u201d Noah also cited reports that a lot of Republicans would be secretly thrilled if Trump never returned to Twitter, \u201cbecause they don\u2019t like the drama that he would create\u201d, Noah said. \u201cAnd it makes sense. You remember what it was like when he was on Twitter \u2013 he would say something, he would tweet something random like \u2018Congress should make it illegal to speak Spanish,\u2019 and then all day reporters would be tracking down Republican senators in the hallway. Remember, they\u2019d chase them and be like \u2018do you agree with the president that it should be illegal to speak Spanish?\u2019 And the senators would have to come up with new ways to answer without answering.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, though,\u201d Noah concluded. \u201cThe only reason I would want Trump back on Twitter \u2013 the only reason \u2013 is because I know, yes, it would probably lead to another term and it would destroy the country, but I just really want to see his Wordle scores.\u201d Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers recapped former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey\u2019s endorsement of Musk\u2019s purchase of Twitter, saying he supported Musk\u2019s \u201cmission to extend the light of consciousness\u201d. \u201cWell, I feel a lot better knowing that Twitter wasn\u2019t in great hands before,\u201d said Meyers. In other news, Joe Biden said he had tried to congratulate Emmanuel Macron for his recent election victory, but couldn\u2019t reach him because the French president was \u201cat the Eiffel Tower having a good time\u201d. \u201cOof, that\u2019s gotta hurt. That\u2019s not even a good lie,\u201d said Meyers. And officials in New York are reportedly considering a proposal to allow pizzerias and other restaurants to sell cannabis-infused foods. \u201cOh, they only come here if they\u2019re already high \u2013 said Papa John\u2019s,\u201d Meyers joked."

            "content": "The US justice department has joined an effort to strike down a new Alabama law that makes it a felony to provide transgender children with certain kinds of medical care. The ban is discriminatory, violating the equal protection clause embedded in the 14th amendment to the US constitution, the federal government argued in a court filing on Friday. Alabama senate bill 184 \u201cdenies necessary medical care to children based solely on who they are\u201d, the filing in federal district court in Huntsville said. Besides asking that the law be deemed unconstitutional, justice department lawyers asked for an order stopping it from taking effect. Alabama lawmakers passed SB 184 this month. It makes it a felony for anyone \u201cto engage in or cause\u201d so-called gender-affirming medical treatments for transgender people 18 or younger, including what are colloquially known as puberty blockers. Offenders including medical professionals and parents could get up to 10 years in prison and $15,000 in fines. The US justice department argues that the law is unconstitutional because non-transgender minors can legally access the same or similar procedures, meaning only transgender children are barred. \u201cSB 184 would force parents of transgender minors, medical professionals, and others to choose between forgoing medically necessary procedures and treatments or \u2026 criminal prosecution,\u201d the justice department contended. \u201cSB 184 violates the equal protection clause by discriminating on the basis of sex and transgender status.\u201d The Alabama law is part of a wave of restrictions aimed at transgender youth in Republican-led states, despite medical professionals recommending gender-affirming care for people who identify as transgender, meaning a gender that is different from the one assigned at birth. The families of two transgender teens, along with a pair of doctors, have filed a federal lawsuit against Alabama which seeks to have SB 184 stricken from the books. The filing from the US justice department essentially serves as notice from the federal government that it is supporting the plaintiffs. In a statement to the news website AL.com, the office of the Alabama governor, Kay Ivey, said the state was \u201cprepared to defend \u2026 our values and this legislation\u201d. The site also quoted the state attorney general, Steve Marshall, as saying Joe Biden\u2019s administration \u201chas chosen to prioritize leftist politics at the expense of Alabama\u2019s children. \u201cThe science and common sense are on Alabama\u2019s side,\u201d Marshall added. \u201cWe will win this fight to protect our children.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-04-13T17:52:05Z",
            "content": "Boris Johnson has been hit by the first ministerial resignation since he was fined by police for breaking Covid rules, as the justice minister, David Wolfson, said the prime minister\u2019s actions were \u201cinconsistent with the rule of law\u201d. Lord Wolfson said it would be wrong for \u201cthat conduct to pass with constitutional impunity, especially when many in society complied with the rules at great personal cost, and others were fined or prosecuted for similar, and sometimes apparently more trivial, offences.\u201d In a letter posted on Twitter, the Conservative peer added that he had \u201cno option other than to tender my resignation\u201d. Wolfson\u2019s resignation will reignite questions about Johnson\u2019s leadership, coming hours after the Conservative MP Nigel Mills said publicly that he would submit a letter of no confidence in the prime minister. The fallout after Johnson, his wife, Carrie, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were issued with fixed-penalty notices as part of Scotland Yard\u2019s Partygate investigation has been somewhat muted, given the fines were handed out while many MPs are on holiday during recess. But despite some of Johnson\u2019s allies\u2019 attempts to play down the gathering that he was fined for attending by claiming he was only present for nine minutes for people to wish him happy birthday, Wolfson seemed clear that the event broke Covid rules. He wrote in a letter to Johnson on Wednesday afternoon: \u201cJustice may often be a matter of courts and procedures, but the rule of law is something else \u2013 a constitutional principle which, at its root, means that everyone in a state, and indeed the state itself, is subject to the law. \u201cIt is not just a question of what happened in Downing Street, or your own conduct. It is also, and perhaps more so, the official response to what took place. As we obviously do not share that view of these matters, I must ask you to accept my resignation.\u201d Wolfson said he was proud of helping the government with planned judicial reforms. But he added: \u201cWe can only undertake these and other legal reforms at home, and also credibly defend democratic norms abroad, especially at a time of war in Europe, if we are, and are seen to be, resolutely committed both to the observance of the law and also to the rule of law.\u201d In his reply, Johnson said he was \u201csorry to receive\u201d the letter and thanked Wolfson for his service, highlighting his work with the judiciary during the coronavirus pandemic. The government had \u201cbenefitted from your years of legal experience\u201d, Johnson said. Wolfson is the second justice minister to quit under Johnson\u2019s leadership, after the resignation of Lord Keen in September 2020 over the prime minister\u2019s attempt to potentially break international law by overriding parts of the Brexit deal. Steve Reed, the shadow justice secretary, congratulated Wolfson \u201cfor taking a principled stand\u201d. But he asked: \u201cWhat does this mean for the lord chancellor, Dominic Raab, who\u2019s constitutionally charged with upholding the law but is instead condoning law-breaking?\u201d Johnson received and paid his \u00a350 fine on Tuesday, and is said to be being investigated by the Met for attending up to six potentially law-breaking events. He faces the prospect of being issued with further fixed-penalty notices if officers decide other gatherings he was at \u2013 including the \u201cbring your own booze\u201d garden party to which more than 100 people were invited \u2013 are deemed to have breached Covid rules."

            "date": "2022-04-28T15:30:15Z",
            "content": "The Sun attempted to expose Jimmy Savile as a paedophile while he was still alive, only to have to back down because of Britain\u2019s tough libel laws, according to one of the journalists who investigated the case. Meirion Jones said the tabloid was ready to publish the story in 2008, which could have brought the entertainer to justice. The newspaper\u2019s reporters had signed affidavits from women who had been abused as children by Savile at the notorious Haut de la Garenne children\u2019s home in Jersey. In an article for the Guardian, Jones said the Sun\u2019s journalists and editors had confidence in the evidence that Savile had abused individuals on the island. However, the tabloid\u2019s lawyers were worried they would lose any subsequent libel case and be left with a \u00a31m bill, partly because the victims might not be believed in court. Jones said the newspaper knew Savile was highly litigious and if they published a story they \u201cwould be facing the best QCs money could buy, representing a man who could potentially call Prince Charles, Margaret Thatcher, the heads of charities, the head of the BBC and the pope as character witnesses.\u201d The journalist, who features in a recent Netflix documentary about Savile, said: \u201cThe best guess of the lawyers was that a libel action could cost \u00a31m and the Sun would definitely lose. The story was canned and the journalists and editors were furious. But this wasn\u2019t the first or last time that Savile escaped because of our libel laws, which rewarded his deliberate targeting of vulnerable victims.\u201d Instead, the Sun published a carefully worded article about child abuse at the Jersey care home, along with a picture of Savile on the premises \u2013 while repeatedly emphasising that the BBC presenter had no knowledge of what happened there. Despite this, Savile\u2019s lawyers still threatened legal action. A copy of a letter sent to the Sun in 2008, seen by the Guardian, was written on behalf of the presenter by Fox Hayes Solicitors, a Leeds business that is now defunct. Emphasising the \u201chuge sums\u201d that Savile\u2019s charity work had raised for children, the lawyers demanded the Sun issue a prominent statement \u201cmaking clear that any visit to the home was entirely innocent\u201d, delete the article from its website, and pay Savile compensation \u201cfor the injury to his feelings and reputation\u201d. The legal firm said child abuse was the \u201cantithesis of everything he [Savile] has worked tirelessly to prevent\u201d. They insisted the entertainer did not remember visiting children at the care home in the 1970s and that \u201cany such visit would have been unexceptional save for the pleasure it may have given\u201d. After Savile\u2019s death in 2011, hundreds of his victims came forward. The public eventually learned that one of Britain\u2019s most famous light entertainment stars was also one of the country\u2019s most prolific paedophiles. Jones, now editor of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, helped to tell the victims\u2019 stories, but only after BBC bosses blocked his initial investigation from appearing on Newsnight, in one of the corporation\u2019s worst scandals. He is now urging the government to reform Britain\u2019s libel laws to make it easier for investigative stories to be published, warning they have been used by people ranging from Savile to major corporations and Russian oligarchs to avoid scrutiny. The justice secretary, Dominic Raab, is currently overseeing a review of the relevant legislation. A spokesperson for the Sun declined to comment."

            "date": "2022-04-21T01:47:10Z",
            "content": "The Department of Justice is filing an appeal seeking to overturn a judge\u2019s order that voided the federal mask mandate on planes and trains and in travel hubs, officials said Wednesday. The notice came minutes after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) asked the justice department to appeal the decision handed down by a federal judge in Florida earlier this week. A notice of appeal was filed in federal court in Tampa. A federal judge in Florida on Monday had voided the national mask mandate covering planes and other public transportation, ruling that the Covid-19 mitigation measure exceeded the authority of federal health officials. In her decision, Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle had also said the CDC failed to justify its decision and did not follow proper rule-making procedures. The CDC said in a statement on Wednesday that its \u201ccontinuing assessment\u201d was that \u201cat this time an order requiring masking in the indoor transportation corridor remains necessary for the public health\u201d. Joe Biden\u2019s administration has offered mixed messages in the wake of the Monday ruling. While officials said Americans should heed the CDC\u2019s guidance even if it was no longer a requirement, Biden himself suggested they had more flexibility on masking up during transit. \u201cThat\u2019s up to them,\u201d Biden declared during a Tuesday visit to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The White House nonetheless continues to require face coverings for those traveling with him on Air Force One, citing guidance from the CDC. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said Wednesday that Biden still is encouraging Americans to wear masks when traveling and that he had been \u201canswering the question quite literally\u201d a day before. \u201cPeople are not legally bound to wear masks,\u201d she said, after the court order. \u201cSo, it is a point in time where it is up to people. It is their choice, in that regard.\u201d Most airlines and airports, many public transit systems and even ride-sharing company Uber lifted their mask-wearing requirements in the hours following Monday\u2019s ruling. The Transportation Security Administration said on Monday that it would no longer enforce the mask requirement. Mizelle, who judged the rule as exceeding the authority of US health officials in the coronavirus pandemic, overturned the mask mandate on Monday. She added that the CDC had failed to justify its decision and did not follow proper rule-making procedures. In the 59-page ruling, Mizelle said the only remedy was to vacate the rule entirely because it would be impossible to end it for the limited group who objected to it in the lawsuit. She added the court had the full authority to make the decision to end the mask mandate, even if the CDC was attempting to handle the virus in the most spirited way. \u201cBecause our system does not permit agencies to act unlawfully even in pursuit of desirable ends, the court declares unlawful and vacates the mask mandate,\u201d Mizelle wrote. The CDC had recently extended the mask mandate, which was set to expire Monday, until 3 May to allow more time to study the BA.2 omicron subvariant, which is now responsible for the vast majority of US cases. But the court ruling Monday put that decision on hold. The CDC said on Wednesday that it would continue to monitor public health conditions to determine if a mandate would remain necessary. It said it believed the mandate was \u201ca lawful order, well within CDC\u2019s legal authority to protect public health\u201d. Justice department spokesman Anthony Coley said on Wednesday night that the department was filing the appeal \u201cin light of today\u2019s assessment by the CDC that an order requiring masking in the transportation corridor remains necessary to protect the public health\u201d. After a winter surge fueled by the omicron variant that prompted record hospitalizations, the US has seen a significant drop in virus spread in recent months, leading most states and cities to drop mask mandates. But several north-east cities have seen a rise in hospitalizations in recent weeks, leading Philadelphia to bring back its mask mandate. The appeal drew criticism from the US Travel Association, which, along with other industry groups, had been pressuring the Biden administration for months to end the mask mandate for travel. \u201cMasks were critically important during the height of the pandemic,\u201d said Tori Emerson Barnes, the group\u2019s executive vice-president of public affairs and policy, \u201cbut with low hospitalization rates and multiple effective health tools now widely available, from boosters to therapies to high-quality air ventilation aboard aircraft, required masking on public transportation is simply out of step with the current public health landscape.\u201d"

            "content": "The great abuses of power by Richard Nixon\u2019s administration which are remembered collectively as Watergate had one tremendous benefit: they inspired a raft of legislation which significantly strengthened American democracy. This new book from the Brookings Institution, subtitled How to Restore Ethics, The Rule of Law and Democracy, recalls those far-away days of a functioning legislative process. The response to Watergate gave us real limits on individual contributions to candidates and political action committees (Federal Election Campaign Act); a truly independent Office of Special Counsel (Ethics in Government Act); inspector generals in every major agency (Inspector General Act); a vastly more effective freedom of information process; and a Sunshine Law which enshrined the novel notion that the government should be \u201cthe servant of the people\u201d and \u201cfully accountable to them\u201d. Since then, a steadily more conservative supreme court has eviscerated all the most important campaign finance reforms, most disastrously in 2010 with Citizens United, and in 2013 destroyed the most effective parts of the Voting Rights Act. Congress let the special counsel law lapse, partly because of how Ken Starr abused it when he investigated Bill Clinton. The unraveling of Watergate reforms was one of many factors that set the stage for the most corrupt US government of modern times, that of Donald Trump. Even someone as inured as I am to Trump\u2019s crimes can still be astonished when all the known abuses are catalogued in one volume. What the authors of this book identify as \u201cThe Seven Deadly Sins of Trumpery\u201d include \u201cDisdain for Ethics, Assault on the rule of law, Incessant lying and disinformation, Shamelessness\u201d and, of course, \u201cPursuit of personal and political interest\u201d. The book identifies Trump\u2019s original sin as his refusal to put his businesses in a blind trust, which led to no less than 3,400 conflicts of interest. It didn\u2019t help that the federal conflict of interests statute specifically exempts the president. Under the first president of modern times with no interest in \u201cthe legitimacy\u201d or \u201cthe appearance of legitimacy of the presidency\u201d, this left practically nothing off limits. The emoluments clause of the constitution forbids every government official accepting \u201cany present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State\u201d but lacks any enforcement mechanism. So a shameless president could be paid off through his hotels by everyone from the Philippines to Kuwait while the Bank of China paid one Trump company an estimated $5.4m. (As a fig leaf, Trump gave the treasury $448,000 from profits made from foreign governments during two years of his presidency, but without any accounting.) Trump even got the federal government to pay him directly, by charging the secret service $32,400 for guest rooms for a visit to Mar-a-Lago plus $17,000 a month for a cottage at his New Jersey golf club. The US Office of Special Counsel catalogued dozens of violations of the Hatch Act, which prohibits political activity by federal officials. Miscreants included Peter Navarro, Dan Scavino, Nikki Haley and most persistently Kellyanne Conway. The OSC referred its findings to Trump, who of course did nothing. Conway was gleeful. \u201cLet me know when the jail sentence starts,\u201d she said. There was also the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, addressing the Republican convention from a bluff overlooking Jerusalem during a mission to Israel. In a different category of corruption were the $43,000 soundproof phone booth the EPA administrator Scott Pruitt installed and the $1m the health secretary Tom Price spent on luxury travel. Those two actually resigned. The book is mostly focused on the four-year Trump crimewave. But it is bipartisan enough to spread the blame to Democrats for creating a climate in which no crime seemed too big to go un-prosecuted. Barack Obama\u2019s strict ethics rules enforced by executive orders produced a nearly scandal-free administration. But Claire O Finkelstein and Richard W Painter argue that there was one scandal that established a terrible precedent: the decision not to prosecute anyone at the CIA for illegal torture carried out under George W Bush. This \u201cfailure of accountability\u201d was \u201cprofoundly corrosive. The decision to \u2018look forward, not back\u2019 on torture \u2026 damaged the country\u2019s ability to hold government officials to the constraints of the law\u201d. However, the authors are probably a little too optimistic when they argue that a more vigorous stance might have made the Trump administration more eager to prosecute its own law breakers. The authors point out there are two things in the federal government which are even worse than the wholesale violation of ethical codes within the executive branch: the almost total absence of ethical codes within the congressional and judicial branches. The ethics manual for the House says it is \u201cfundamental that a member \u2026 may not use his or her official position for personal gain\u201d. But that is \u201cvirtually meaningless\u201d because members can take actions on \u201cindustries in which they hold company stock\u201d. The Senate exempts itself from ethical concerns with two brilliant words: no member can promote a piece of legislation whose \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d is \u201cto further only his pecuniary interest\u201d. So as long as legislation also has other purposes, personal profit is no impediment to passage. The authors argue that since the crimes of Watergate pale in comparison to the corruption of Trump, this should be the greatest opportunity for profound reform since the 1970s. But of course there is no chance of any such reform getting through this Congress, because Republicans have no interest in making government honest. Nothing tells us more about the collapse of our democracy than the primary concern of the House and Senate minority leaders, Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell. Their only goal is to avoid any action that would offend the perpetrator or instigator of all these crimes. Instead of forcing him to resign the way Nixon did, these quivering men still pretend Donald Trump is the only man qualified to lead them.

            "title": "Queensland police update manual after signalling reforms to how officers accused of domestic violence are handled",
            "date": "2022-04-25T17:30:45Z",
            "content": "The Queensland police service appears to have balked at substantial reform to the way it handles officers who are accused of domestic violence, after promising to act on a \u201cconcerning increase\u201d in the volume of complaints. Last May the assistant commissioner Brian Codd told Guardian Australia that police were \u201cgrappling\u201d with how to respond to the increase officer-involved domestic violence, and that reforms were \u201cvery much\u201d on the agenda. \u201cYou can be a truck driver and you can be subject to a domestic and family violence order and it may not have any impact on your employment or where you sit within society \u2026 but we expect and are entitled to more from police officers,\u201d Codd said last year. He said at the time he had met with the Queensland police ethical standards command \u201cto work out a position we might need to take on this\u201d. Asked last week what progress had been made in Queensland, a police spokesperson pointed to changes to the operational procedures manual in July 2021 to \u201csupport greater officer accountability and ensure the confidence of the public is maintained while an investigation takes place\u201d. A comparison with the previous operational procedures manual shows the relevant section was updated to require additional paperwork by officers, including ensuring that the \u201cactioning district\u201d submits a briefing note to police ethical standards command for consideration of disciplinary action. \u201cImmediate consideration of the officer\u2019s circumstances, current position, and the level of contact that member may have with members of the public is reviewed on a case-by-case basis,\u201d the police spokesperson said. Officer-involved domestic violence poses a significant problem to authorities; specifically allowing natural justice to a person accused of an offence, or subject to a domestic violence order. At the same time, women\u2019s advocates say it is problematic that a domestic violence victim seeking assistance could theoretically encounter an officer who is subject to a complaint, charge or conviction. Domestic violence now makes up about 40% of calls for police assistance. Victoria has attempted to address the issue by establishing a specialist police unit to investigate complaints against officers. Angela Lynch, a domestic violence protection advocate, said changes to operational procedures in Queensland did not go far enough, and victims needed \u201cconfidence their case will be dealt with appropriately\u201d. Lynch said officer-involved domestic violence would be under-reported, and Queensland should have some mechanism where complaints against officers could be made and assessed independent of police. \u201cThe community needs confidence that police acknowledge that this is a problem, and that there\u2019s some level of independent oversight,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has to be some oversight of the decision-making process. I don\u2019t think the community in the end does have confidence that police can do this themselves. It\u2019s Caesar judging Caesar.\u201d Guardian Australia reported in 2020 that 84 serving police officers had been accused of domestic violence in the previous five years. Police say this rate is \u201clower than the general public\u201d but evidence suggests officers are \u201cas likely as anyone else\u201d to perpetrate domestic violence. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cOn occasion QPS members are subject of domestic and family violence complaint reporting,\u201d a police spokesperson said. \u201cWhile these particular matters may be lower than the rate of the general public, any report of members suspected of perpetrating domestic and family violence is taken extremely seriously. \u201cResponding to incidents of domestic and family violence is often challenging and complex. \u201cThe Queensland police service remains committed to refining and enhancing the police response to DFV, including improving processes for reporting and investigating matters in a timely manner, taking protective action tailored to the needs of the victim and holding perpetrators to account.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-04-14T07:00:08Z",
            "content": "The mayors of Liverpool city region and Greater Manchester have written to all 650 MPs in advance of the 33rd anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster on Friday, urging them to support fundamental reforms of the legal system known as the \u201cHillsborough law\u201d. Steve Rotheram and Andy Burnham said in their letter that victims of other disasters suffer the same systemic failures that forced the bereaved Hillsborough families to fight a decades-long campaign against injustice. The Hillsborough law proposals principally are that all public officials, including police officers, should have a legal \u201cduty of candour\u201d; for bereaved families to have full funding for lawyers to represent them at inquests, and for public bodies to sign a charter committing them to fair conduct. The proposals, supported by families, were developed after the 2014\u201116 second inquest into the deaths of 96 men, women and children at the FA Cup semi\u2011final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989. However, the government has not passed any of the reforms into law. Theresa May\u2019s government in 2017 did support one measure, a public advocate for bereaved families, championed by the Labour MP Maria Eagle, but did not introduce it. James Jones, the former bishop of Liverpool, made 25 recommendations that formed the basis for the Hillsborough law proposals, in a 2017 report commissioned by May, but the government has not yet responded to it. Rotheram and Burnham describe that as \u201cdisrespectful to the Hillsborough families\u201d. The 2016 inquest jury found that the 96 people \u2013 now 97, since the death of Andrew Devine, 55, last July \u2013 were unlawfully killed due to gross negligence manslaughter by the South Yorkshire police officer in command, Ch Supt David Duckenfield. The jury also rejected years of allegations by South Yorkshire police officers that Liverpool supporters misbehaved at Hillsborough, and determined that no conduct of the supporters contributed to the disaster. Despite that verdict, nobody has been legally held to account for causing the 97 unlawful killings, nor for the discredited police case. Duckenfield was acquitted of a criminal charge of gross negligence manslaughter in 2019. Rotheram and Burnham wrote in their letter that injustice is also being suffered by victims of the British army\u2019s 1950s nuclear tests, the contaminated blood scandals, the Grenfell fire and the Manchester Arena bombing. \u201cThe reason why this pattern keeps on repeating is simple,\u201d their letter states. \u201cThe scales of justice are weighed against ordinary families and in favour of public authorities who hold all the power.\u201d Saying \u201cthe need for a Hillsborough Law is clear\u201d, they wrote: A fundamental re-balancing of the legal, coronial and judicial systems , creating a level playing field for bereaved families with agencies of the state, will prevent future generations experiencing the injustices we have seen in our lifetimes.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson praised the Hillsborough families\u2019 \u201ctremendous courage\u201d, and said: \u201cThe Home Office has been working closely with its partners in the relevant government departments and organisations to carefully consider the points of learning made by Bishop James Jones. Our focus now is engaging with the Hillsborough families and publishing the government\u2019s overarching response to the bishop\u2019s report in due course.\u201d"

            "content": "The British public has \u201crun out of patience\u201d with English football\u2019s failure to reform itself, the sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, has said, as he confirmed legislation for an independent regulator would be in place before the next general election. The government has endorsed 10 key principles in Tracey Crouch\u2019s fan-led review into football governance, with a new regulator the central idea among them. Huddleston said government also expects the Premier League to distribute more money across the football pyramid and for a solution to be agreed with the Football League before the summer. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got incredibly frustrated over years, in fact decades, of football recognising it\u2019s got problems and singularly failing to sort them out,\u201d Huddleston said. \u201cQuite frankly I think the British public, and football fans in particular, have run out of patience and there is a need to intervene.\u201d While responses to the government\u2019s decision to support the Crouch review were largely positive, some, including Crouch herself, said the lack of a timeline for delivery of new legislation was \u201cworrying\u201d. Huddleston insisted the government had committed to bringing a regulator into law before the next election, which is currently scheduled for 2024. \u201cThere are some people expecting this is going to happen tomorrow or next week and there are other people thinking it\u2019s two years but we do have the commitment to get this done before the next election,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to move forward quickly because we know there\u2019s overwhelming demand for this and we know the problems in football. But, if we implemented it tomorrow, we could have exactly the opposite impact of what we are intending: making sure that clubs can survive and that they are financially sustainable.\u201d Huddleston said that details on the regulator\u2019s powers would be published this summer as part of a white paper, including possible measures to ensure greater financial redistribution within the English game. In its response to the fan-led review the government said that such a settlement should be agreed within football, ie between the Premier League and EFL directly, but it later confirmed that such an outcome needs to be confirmed by the summer. \u201cI think the message to the Premier League is quite clear,\u201d Huddleston said. \u201cThey need to act sooner rather than later because, otherwise, it will be forced on them through the regulator.\u201d The sports minister said he encouraged football to take pro-active measures on other recommendations from the report, such as creating better representation for supporters and ensuring the preservation of assets of \u2018cultural heritage\u2019 like football stadiums, so as to avoid the possibility of those solutions being imposed by government too. Huddleston said there were those within his own party who are \u201cvery uncomfortable with this level of intervention we\u2019re proposing\u201d, but the Conservative government now looks to have committed itself fully to independent regulation of one of the country\u2019s greatest culture exports. As one headline within the government\u2019s official response put it: \u201cThe free market will not rectify the problems.\u201d"

            "title": "Retirement savings reform is a good idea that both parties can get behind",
            "date": "2022-04-24T11:00:20Z",
            "content": "Congress is divided on just about every issue but a recent bill passed in the House of Representatives showed that there is at least one area that our representatives from both sides of the aisle can agree on: retirement savings. Of course, it\u2019s no secret that people aren\u2019t saving enough for retirement. A recent survey from the Federal Reserve found the median amount of savings in Americans\u2019 retirement accounts was only $65,000. Another study from the Insured Retirement Institute\u2019s data found that an estimated 33% of workers are saving less than 5% of their income for their retirement and 25% of Americans have no retirement savings at all according to a report from accounting firm PWC. The Wall Street Journal warns that a generation of Americans is entering old age the least prepared in decades and, according to the Government Accountability Office, about half of households age 55 and older have no retirement savings at all. So \u2026 enter Washington, with two bills aimed at addressing this issue. The most recent of these bills is called the Securing a Strong Retirement Act and it recently passed the House by a margin of 414-5. It builds on 2019\u2019s Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement. Both bills are referred to as the Secure Act 1.0 and Secure Act 2.0. The original Secure Act 1.0 kind of fell under the radar due to its passage so close to the Covid outbreak. But it includes many incentives for small businesses to help their employees save for retirement. Among those incentives are tax credits to pay for half of the costs to start a 401(k) plan for employers with fewer than 100 employees, an additional tax credit for making existing plans require automatic enrollment, a pushing back of the age where distributions from a retirement plan are required to 72 (allowing older employees to work longer), the ability to include more part-time employees in a retirement plan and tax incentives to allow the distribution of funds from 529 Education Plans for student loan repayments. The bill also expanded the availability multi-employer plans so companies could share administrative expenses. So popular was the first bill that a version 2.0 bill from the House is now making its way to the Senate, where bipartisan approval is also expected, after a few minor changes. This bill adds even more retirement incentives for both businesses and employees including a 100% reimbursement of 401(k) plan startup costs to employers through tax credits, a further increasing of the minimum distribution age to 75 and now a requirement to automatically enroll new employees in a company\u2019s retirement plan (they can still opt out) with contributions increasing from 3% to 10% over seven years. The new bill also establishes a \u201cretirement savings lost and found\u201d national online database for people who may have lost track of their participation in a retirement plan. It also allows more distributions from retirement and after-tax plans like Roth IRAs to help victims of domestic abuse and other hardships. Is all of this really needed? Some experts, like Andrew G Biggs at the American Enterprise Institute, makes a strong case for why the media\u2019s retirement \u201ccrisis\u201d is overblown. And maybe it\u2019s not a retirement \u201ccrisis\u201d but it\u2019s certainly a problem. The Secure Act 2.0 will still benefit both employees and employers. To me, it\u2019s a no-brainer \u2013 a low-cost regulation that strongly encourages people to do what they should be doing and that\u2019s being financial prudent. I believe we\u2019ll see passage of this bill by the Senate and signed legislation this year, all with significant bipartisan support. That\u2019s because \u2013 as most small business owners will agree \u2013 this is one of those bills that\u2019s pretty tough to oppose."

            "date": "2022-04-15T11:44:06Z",
            "content": "Some of the world\u2019s most ancient buildings are being destroyed by climate change, as rising concentrations of salt in Iraq eat away at mud brick and more frequent sandstorms erode ancient wonders. Iraq is known as the cradle of civilisation. It was here that agriculture was born, some of the world\u2019s oldest cities were built, such as the Sumerian capital Ur, and one of the first writing systems was developed \u2013 cuneiform. The country has \u201ctens of thousands of sites from the Palaeolithic through Islamic eras\u201d, explained Augusta McMahon, professor of Mesopotamian archaeology at the University of Cambridge. Damage to sites such as the legendary Babylon \u201cwill leave gaps in our knowledge of human evolution, of the development of early cities, of the management of empires, and of the dynamic changes in the political landscape of the Islamic era\u201d, she added. Mesopotamia, the land between the two rivers of modern-day Iraq, is rich with salt (mun in Sumerian) that exists naturally in the soil and groundwater. Cuneiform texts mention the profession of a salt collector and describe the use of salt in everything from preserving food, to healthcare and rituals. There is a Sumerian proverb that says the basic necessities of life are bread and salt: \u201cWhen a poor man has died, do not revive him. When he had bread, he had no salt. When he had salt, he had no bread.\u201d Salt in the soil can aid archaeologists in some circumstances, but the same mineral can also be destructive, and is destroying heritage sites, according to the geoarchaeologist Jaafar Jotheri, who described salt as \u201caggressive \u2026 it will destroy the site \u2013 destroy the bricks, destroy the cuneiform tablets, destroy everything\u201d. The destructive power of salt is increasing as concentrations rise amid water shortages caused by dams built upstream by Turkey and Iran, and years of mismanagement of water resources and agriculture within Iraq. \u201cThe salinity in Shatt al-Arab river started to increase from the 90s,\u201d said Ahmad N A Hamdan, a civil engineer who studies the quality of the water in Iraq\u2019s rivers. In his observations, the Shatt al-Arab \u2013 formed by the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates - annually tests poor or very poor quality, especially in 2018, which he called a \u201ccrisis\u201d year when brackish water sent at least 118,000 people to hospital in southern Basra province during a drought. The climate crisis is adding to the problem. Iraq is getting hotter and dryer. The United Nations estimates that mean annual temperatures will rise by 2C by 2050 with more days of extreme temperatures of over 50C, while rainfall will drop by as much as 17% during the rainy season and the number of sand and dust storms will more than double from 120 per year to 300. Meanwhile, rising seawater is pushing a wedge of salt up into Iraq and in less than 30 years, parts of southern Iraq could be under water. \u201cImagine the next 10 years, most of our sites will be under saline water,\u201d said Jotheri, a professor of archaeology at Al-Qadisiyah University and co-director of the Iraqi-British Nahrein Network researching Iraqi heritage. He started to notice damage from salt at historic sites about a decade ago. One spot suffering significant damage is Unesco-recognised Babylon, the capital of the Babylonian Empire, where a salty sheen coats 2,600-year-old mud bricks. In the Temple of Ishtar, the Sumerian goddess of love and war, the base of the walls are crumbling. In the depths of the thick wall, salt accumulates until it crystallises, cracking the bricks and causing them to break apart. Other sites that have been affected are Samarra, the Islamic-era capital with its spiral minaret that is being eroded by sandstorms, and Umm al-Aqarib with its White Temple, palace and cemetery that are being swallowed up by the desert. This year, Iraq lost a piece of its cultural heritage. On the edge of the desert, 150km south of Babylon, is a bed of salt that was once Sawa Lake. The spring-fed water was home to at least 31 species of bird, including the grey heron and the near-threatened ferruginous duck. Now, it is completely dry because of overuse of water by surrounding farms and climate change. Lack of enforcement of regulations over groundwater use means farmers can freely drill wells and plant wheat fields that are an eruption of lush green in the dusty desert landscape. \u201cWhen I was a child I remembered that Sawa Lake was a big lake, a large lake. It looked like the sea. But now it\u2019s gone. Totally gone. We don\u2019t have any lake any more,\u201d said Jotheri. Desert plants are growing where there once was water and Sawa is fated to become yet another source of sandstorms. \u2022 Photo captions were amended on 20 April 2022 to make clear that prominent features in the main view of Babylon are modern constructs, and that the Ishtar gate is not entirely original as earlier stated."

The apparent haunting would continue for the next 12 years, grabbing plenty of hysterical headlines along the way.

West Cork True crime \u2013 in both television and podcast form \u2013 has a fine line to tread in moral terms, especially when dealing with the brutal and high-profile murder of a woman. But voyeuristicor gratuitous are not adjectives you could ever apply to West Cork, an investigation by British documentarian Jennifer Forde and her journalist husband Sam Bungey into the 1996 killing of French television producer Sophie Toscan du Plantier in a remote part of Ireland.

Deborah Brosnan, adjunct professor of biology at Virginia Tech University in the US and a scientific consultant, told the Observer: \u201cThat [working group 2] report was widely anticipated, but completely ignored. Eclipsed mostly by the war in Ukraine, and domestic issues such as inflation, most major media have barely reported let alone analysed the findings.\u201d She said people were shocked by the Ukraine war, and concerned about soaring prices, but that the climate crisis also needed urgent attention. \u201cThe war in Ukraine is a terrible tragedy playing out before our eyes, and families rightly fear being pushed into poverty by inflation. Yet we seem blind to the fact that an even larger and existential crisis is already unfolding today \u2013 one that will result in a global humanitarian crisis and on a scale never seen before.\u201d Daniela Schmidt, professor at Bristol University and one of the lead authors of the working group 2 report, said the world\u2019s current upheavals show how vulnerable we are to the impacts of the climate crisis, already being felt. Policymakers should consider where their resources are allocated, she advised. \u201cDue to the geopolitical challenges, little political capacity is spent on climate action, and vast amounts of funding are allocated to defence,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201c[But] the current situation also clearly shows people\u2019s widespread vulnerability to climate change.\u201d Governments have at least been waking up to the problem behind the scenes, said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics. \u201cThe IPCC report did struggle to gain attention. But while public discussion may have been muted, governments around the world are now studying the details of the report, and particularly its findings about how to make countries, companies and communities more resilient to those consequences of climate change that cannot now be avoided,\u201d Ward said. The report will deal with ways governments and the public can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including greater use of renewable energy, growing trees and cutting-edge technology to suck carbon from the air. But its warnings \u2013 that the world is failing to deploy these methods at the scale required to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 will be muted by the bureaucracy of the IPCC\u2019s processes. The report itself \u2013 part 3 of the sixth comprehensive assessment of climate science to be published by the IPCC since its foundation in 1988 \u2013 is based on thousands of scientific papers from the last seven years. But the key document published on Monday, the summary for policymakers, could be as short as 20 to 30 pages, consisting of a series of short messages and data. These messages are subject to intense wrangling by both scientists and governments. Under the IPCC methods, all governments have the right to make changes to the final summary \u2013 and some are exercising those rights by toning down findings and vetoing some of the strongest statements. Saudi Arabia, India, China and a few other countries have sought to make changes that would weaken the final warnings, the Observer understands. Some governments are anxious to avoid policy advice such as cutting subsidies to fossil fuels, even though these are widely espoused by leading authorities.This process of refinement \u2013 which has also been a complaint in the previous chapters of the IPCC assessment \u2013 is defended by some, as producing a document that all governments must \u201cown\u201d, as they have all had input. But many scientists are growing increasingly frustrated, as it produces a conservative and sometimes watered down document that many feel does not reflect the urgency and shocking nature of the threat."

Yet its northernmost point, Peary Land (named after the explorer Robert Peary, widely credited as being the first person to reach the north pole), is actually ice free, because the air is so dry that snow does not fall there, making it a polar desert. As the world\u2019s largest island, with a land area of more than 2m sq km, Greenland stretches over 34 degrees of latitude, from 83 degrees north to 60 degrees north \u2013 roughly level with the Shetland Islands. Three-quarters of Greenland lies within the Arctic Circle, so the summers are brief and cool, while the winters are long and very cold. The town of Qaanaaq (also known as Thule) is one of the most northerly in the world, with average temperatures of just 5Cin July, plummeting to -25Cin February. Farther south, in the capital, Nuuk, temperatures are a few degrees higher. Greenland holds the unenviable record of the lowest temperature ever recorded in the northern hemisphere. In December 1991, near the summit of the Greenland ice sheet, it fell to -69.6C. But with the onset of the climate crisis, summer temperatures in the high 20s are now being recorded; an ominous sign for the future."

            "date": "2022-04-05T15:29:55Z",
            "content": "The fossil fuel industry and its influence over policy was the major elephant in the room looming over the release of the third and final report, out this week, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world\u2019s leading climate authority. The major source of contention: how do you talk about mitigating climate change without confronting the fossil fuel industry? \u201cIt\u2019s like Star Wars without Darth Vader,\u201d says environmental sociologist Robert Brulle, of Brown University. The first two reports, both released over the last year, highlighted the physical science on climate effects and countries\u2019 vulnerability to further warming. But this third report deals more with the potential solutions, which have been a focal point of controversy in recent years for both the fossil fuel industry and the governments of oil-rich nations. Social scientists were successful in pushing for more of their research to be included in the IPCC\u2019s reports, with chapters that touch on everything from debunking claims that less developed countries need fossil fuels to help tackle poverty to a rundown of efforts to block climate policy. The report made one thing abundantly clear: the technologies and policies necessary to adequately address climate change exist, and the only real obstacles are politics and fossil fuel interests. The role of the fossil fuel industry is highlighted throughout the report\u2019s nearly 3,000 pages, but researchers note it was mysteriously absent from the \u201cSummary for Policymakers\u201d \u2013 traditionally the first part of the report that\u2019s released and often attracts the most media attention. An earlier draft of the summary leaked to the Guardian, however, described the fossil fuel industry and others invested in a high-carbon economy as \u201cvested interests\u201d that have actively worked against climate policy, noting: \u201cFactors limiting ambitious transformation include structural barriers, an incremental rather than systemic approach, lack of coordination, inertia, lock-in to infrastructure and assets, and lock-in as a consequence of vested interests, regulatory inertia, and lack of technological capabilities and human resources.\u201d Brulle, whose research is cited multiple times in the report, was dismayed to see the cut. \u201cThe scientists clearly did their job and provided ample material on climate obstruction activities in the report,\u201d he says. \u201cThe political process of creating the Summary for Policymakers ended up editing all of this information out.\u201d Unlike the research-heavy chapters, which are controlled entirely by the scientists who research and write them, the Summary for Policymakers must be approved by government representatives from 195 countries around the world; the approval process for this year\u2019s mitigation report was the longest and most contentious in the history of the IPCC. According to leaked reports, representatives from Saudi Arabia in particular argued for multiple references to carbon capture and storage and the watering down of language on shutting down fossil fuel production. Oil company representatives were also included in this process as both authors and editors of the report, which has been the case since the IPCC began. For the latest report, a senior staffer for Saudi Aramco \u2013 Saudia Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil and gas company \u2013 was one of the two coordinating lead authors, a position of considerable influence, for the chapter on cross-sector perspectives. A longtime Chevron staffer was also the review editor for the chapter on energy systems. \u201cObviously, none of this was secret,\u201d notes Julia Steinberger, professor of ecological economics at the University of Lausanne, and a lead author of the section on mitigation pathways compatible with long-term goals. While authors and contributors are required to disclose their affiliations, Steinberger says that contributions from oil industry insiders represent an untenable conflict of interest. \u201cJust because a person fills out forms does not mean that they don\u2019t have other interests at heart that are not reflective of the science and the public interest, but more reflective of their employer.\u201d Despite the influence of oil companies and oil-rich nations, the report does still highlight the fossil fuel industry\u2019s influence on policymaking, and eviscerates some of the industry\u2019s favorite myths. In the new chapter on \u201cDemand, Services and Social Aspects of Mitigation\u201d, for example, researchers challenged the long-held belief that fossil fuel consumption is entirely driven by demand. \u201cWhat we were able to demonstrate was actually the contrary: there is no sustainable development or development, full stop, possible without climate mitigation,\u201d said Steinberger, who was a contributing author on the chapter. \u201cUnless you mitigate climate, the impacts are going to catch you every step of the way and just make people\u2019s lives increasingly hard and miserable, especially in the global south.\u201d The connection between social justice and climate mitigation is one that runs throughout the report. \u201cPeople are beginning to realize how serious the climate crisis is, and that the ways to meet the challenges of the climate crisis \u2013 moving to low-carbon energy, looking after the environment, shifting transport \u2013 tend to also improve energy security, justice, social concerns, there are a lot of win-wins and co-benefits,\u201d says Catherine Mitchell, professor of energy policy at Exeter University, and one of the two coordinating lead authors on the chapter focused on policy. Social scientists hoping to make further inroads into not only the IPCC process, but policymaking more broadly, have a chicken-and-egg problem, according to Dana Fisher, director of the program for society and the environment at the University of Maryland and a contributing author to chapter 13. Fisher\u2019s research focuses on the impact that activism has had on climate policymaking. \u201cWe have insufficient funding to support the sort of large-scale research that enables you to have high confidence in your findings,\u201d she says, which limits the amount of social science research that can be used in the report. Less than 1% of research funding on climate from 1990 to 2018 went toward social sciences, including political science, sociology, and economics. That\u2019s despite the fact that even physical scientists themselves agree that inaction on climate will probably not be solved by more scientific evidence. \u201cBack in the 80s, we believed in the information deficit model of social change, and that if we could only get the information to policymakers they would do the right thing,\u201d says atmospheric scientist Ken Caldeira, senior scientist for Bill Gates\u2019s Breakthrough Energy. \u201cAnd now we see that really it\u2019s not about information deficit, it\u2019s about power relations, and people wanting to keep economic and political power. And so just telling people some more climate science isn\u2019t going to help anything.\u201d That\u2019s not to say there\u2019s no further need for atmospheric models, or a better understanding of various aspects of climate science. But what this report makes abundantly clear is that acting on climate is not being restricted by a lack of scientific knowledge or technological options, but by entrenched power structures and an absence of political will. To effectively address that, and act in time to avoid the worst impacts of warming, social scientists agree: we\u2019re going to need more than climate models.

            "date": "2022-04-04T05:00:39Z",
            "content": "High-carbon goods imported into the UK should be subject to new tariffs, to help ensure other countries are fulfilling their obligations to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions as well as the UK, an influential committee of MPs has said. A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) would penalise companies and countries trying to evade responsibility for cutting emissions, the MPs said, and provide an incentive for certain industrial sectors to move away from environmentally damaging practices. Philip Dunne, the Tory chair of the committee, said such a move was needed to reach net zero: \u201cThe targets, timetables and overall strategy for meeting net zero have been set: now the work must speed up to make the ambitions a reality.\u201d For some industries, such as steelmaking, moving to the greener production methods needed to cut the UK\u2019s emissions in line with the 2050 net zero target may incur short-term costs, in new equipment and techniques. But if rivals in other countries fail to take such steps, and carry on using fossil fuels and emitting high amounts of carbon, their products could be cheaper and undercut the UK, leaving British industry at a severe disadvantage. This is known as carbon leakage, as greener industries in the domestic market lose out and the carbon is emitted overseas instead. A CBAM could level the playing field, by imposing tariffs or taxes on imports of such products, and has broad support among many economists, provided it can be used to target specific products and practices rather than be used as a protectionist measure to keep out goods from developing countries in particular. The environmental audit committee of MPs called on ministers to act unilaterally in putting such a tax in place. The EU is considering imposing CBAMs, and the US government has also signalled it could be open to such measures in the future. The Treasury is understood to be wary of imposing CBAMs, as they could increase the price of some goods at a time when consumers are already facing a cost-of-living crisis. There are also fears in government that implementing a CBAM now would set back attempts by ministers to forge post-Brexit trade deals around the world. But Dunne said the MPs had considered these points carefully. \u201cOur committee is clear that the pros of a CBAM outweigh the cons,\u201d he said. \u201cFor too long the emissions from our consumption have effectively been \u2018offshored\u2019, leaving the problem as out of sight and out of mind. But we must all take greater responsibility for our consumption and the practices that our businesses and organisations adopt.\u201d The UK is president of the UN climate negotiations for most of the rest of this year, having hosted the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow last November. That puts the government in a powerful position to pioneer CBAMs, which have been widely discussed for years but not put into effect. Dunne added that the government should consult with businesses at all stages: \u201cOur committee is under no illusions that this will be a challenging policy to get right, with a clear advantage to moving multilaterally with other trading partners, and therefore all businesses must have a voice in the discussions, and government must be upfront with its intentions.\u201d A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK is leading the way on the transition to net zero, has reduced emissions faster than any other country in the G20 and continues to have the most ambitious climate targets for 2030. \u201cAs we transition to net zero, we recognise the importance of continuing to address the risk of carbon leakage to ensure that our ambitious policy of decarbonisation is not undermined. \u201cThis is a global problem, which is why we\u2019re working with our international partners to address this and other climate challenges as well as exploring domestic options.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-04-22T07:00:18Z",
            "content": "Northern Ireland will need to lose more than 1 million sheep and cattle to meet its new legally binding climate emissions targets, according to an industry-commissioned analysis seen by the Guardian. The large-scale reduction in farm animals comes after the passing of the jurisdiction\u2019s first ever climate act, requiring the farming sector to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and reduce methane emissions by almost 50% over the same period. About a third of human-caused methane emissions come from livestock, mostly from the burps and manure of beef and dairy cattle. Analysis by KPMG, commissioned by industry representatives including the Ulster Farmers\u2019 Union (UFU), estimates more than 500,000 cattle and about 700,000 sheep would need to be lost in order for Northern Ireland to meet the new climate targets. Separate analysis by the UK government\u2019s climate advisers suggests chicken numbers would also need to be cut by 5 million by 2035. Both the pig and poultry sectors in Nothern Ireland have seen rapid growth in the past decade. Northern Ireland has for some years been the only devolved administration without dedicated climate legislation and targets for emissions reduction. The region\u2019s agrifood industry and associated farming groups have long raised concerns about the expected impact of emissions reductions. Agriculture accounts for about 27% of Northern Ireland\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, with the vast majority coming from livestock. Its heavily export-driven meat industry principally supplies Great Britain, but it also exports to China and North America. The country\u2019s principal poultry processor, Moy Park (a subsidiary of the Brazilian meat giant JBS), has grown into one of Europe\u2019s biggest such firms and Northern Ireland\u2019s largest company, while the Armagh-based JMW Farms pig producer saw its gross turnover nearly treble to \u00a354m between 2011 and 2020. A spokesperson for KPMG said: \u201cUnder the [Climate Change Act\u2019s] net-zero target, we have assumed that \u2018beef and other cattle\u2019, \u2018dairy\u2019 and \u2018sheep\u2019 do the most work to decarbonise due to these sectors accounting for the largest livestock-related impact on NI\u2019s carbon emissions. \u201cBoth the \u2018pig\u2019 and \u2018poultry\u2019 sectors have a minor impact on agriculture carbon emissions (2% and 1%, respectively) and, therefore, any effort to decarbonise can be assumed to have a minor impact on total carbon emissions.\u201d Ewa Kmietowicz, head of the land use mitigations team at the Climate Change Committee (CCC), said: \u201cIf you look at the evidence on the lifecycle of greenhouse gas emissions, the red meat livestock sources \u2013 beef, dairy, sheep \u2013 have the highest emissions because they\u2019re ruminant and they have high methane emissions. \u201cBut pigs and poultry also have a lot of indirect emissions through fodder growth and supply. A lot of food for pigs is imported in the UK, which wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact on UK territorial emissions, but it\u2019s still important because we don\u2019t want to increase consumption emissions for the UK.\u201d Chris Stark, CCC chief executive, told the Guardian that a switch to arable farming would probably be necessary if food production levels are to remain the same in Northern Ireland. \u201cA condition in our modelling is that we produce the same amount of food per head in 2050,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s very difficult to do this unless you see a change in farming practice, and especially unless you see a shift in arable farming versus livestock. \u201cSo it\u2019s a big challenge \u2013 and I\u2019m interested to see what the executive comes up with now, since the majority of emissions come from animals. That will very soon come home to roost for Northern Ireland.\u201d The devolved Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs has been contacted for comment.

            "date": "2022-04-19T05:00:18Z",
            "content": "The billowing black smoke that has cloaked the US Pacific north-west during wildfire disasters in past years has caused atmospheric carbon monoxide levels to spike, with the contaminants offsetting recent reductions in emissions, scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research have found. As the American west faces increasing threats from big blazes that are fueled by a climate that\u2019s growing warmer and drier, researchers have documented the impact of smoke on public health. But scientists are increasingly finding that the fires may be part of a feedback loop that could accelerate the change in conditions and that health impacts officials have long warned would worsen with climate crisis, may in fact already be here. \u201cOur research contributes to the growing body of research that shows that fires \u2013 in particular Pacific north-west region fires \u2013 are becoming more important for North American air quality\u201d said Dr Rebecca Buchholz, a project scientist at National Center for Atmospheric Research. Looking at carbon monoxide, a trace gas emitted during fires, researchers analyzed the impact on atmospheric chemistry from 2002 to 2018, Buchholz explained. Though the scientists relied on carbon monoxide data to guide them, the contaminant also provided a framework to understand how other sources of pollution might be tied to the flames. Her team, which also included scientists from across the country and around the globe, found that the dangerous pollutant peaks in August when fires are typically raging in the region, but dips during other months. The deviation from the annual cycle, she said, \u201cis telling us that fires are compromising the ability of the atmosphere to self-clean\u201d. Globally, carbon monoxide concentrations receded by half a percentage point a year over the 16-year study period. But across North America, the scientists found that August was an outlier. Carbon monoxide levels in the atmosphere follow a seasonal flow, driven to ebb and increase through a photochemical process. Prior to 2011, the regions fell in line with this pattern and levels of the pollutants peaked in the spring and waned in late summer. In a more recent period the researchers analyzed, from 2012-2018, a new trend began to emerge. In August \u2013 when CO was expected to be driven to its lowest points \u2013 there were instead spikes. The scientists found that this not only affects atmospheric carbon monoxide, but was found closer to the Earth\u2019s surface as well. The deviation from the worldwide trend was strongest in the Pacific north-west, where wildfire risks are high during that month, but the effect lingered in data collected in areas across the country and into the north-east of the North American continent. The study\u2019s findings were supported by four different global fire emission inventories, which consistently showed carbon monoxide fire emissions peaked in the Pacific north-west in August. Data from two other inventories that catalog emissions from human activity show carbon monoxide was not increasing in the region during the study period, helping the researchers rule out other causes of the August surge and its spread. A growing body of research has shown how wildfires raging across the west can impact the air locally and afar, with the potential to affect millions across the country. Last year the sun glowed ominously red as far away as New York City, shrouded in haze from land burning on the other side of the country. In 2020, which had the worst wildfire season on record, levels of the most dangerous type of air pollution rose by 7% in the US even after the pandemic shutdowns delivered steep reductions in fossil fuel use. The toxic output from fires is dangerous, contributing to an estimated loss of more than 15,000 lives in the US each year. Some scientists say that number will double by the end of the century. Smoke from western fires has also been attributed to up to 5,900 asthma-related emergency department visits a year, according to a separate study published last year. Nearly three-quarters of these visits and hospital admissions tied to smoke inhalation were outside the western US. While some questions still remain about the connection between ignitions and climate crisis, it\u2019s clear that spiking temperatures are spurring the desiccation of landscapes and priming them to burn. Fires are still predominantly caused by people. Land management, including the use of prescribed fire \u2013 which doesn\u2019t burn with the same amount of intensity or smoke \u2013 plays an important role in mitigating the potential for disasters. But as the west warms, bigger blazes are expected to follow. This study shows that this could have a more lasting effect. \u201cThere is definitely a feedback between fires and climate,\u201d researcher Buchholz said, noting that big questions about the specifics of the relationship between the two still remain. But her research shows that the conflagrations have a compounding effect on bad air quality and that it has the potential to affect millions across the continent. It will be important to start looking at August as a significantly changing month when it comes to contaminants, she said."

            "date": "2022-04-02T20:00:07Z",
            "content": "On a rainy day 50km west of Moree in north-west New South Wales, Brisbane artist Jane Milburn navigates through the sinking black soil quintessential to this farming region. Pure white cotton material is draped over her shoulder, the only thing to set her Driza-bone apart against the brown backdrop. With a flourish, she lays it down, painting the fabric with the mud that helped grow it. The slow-fashion advocate plans to convert the farm-grown cotton material into a dress to wear and tell a story about the place where it came from: Keytah Farm, the carbon positive farming operation owned by Sundown Pastoral. \u201cA lot of farmers naturally are cautious about opening the doors and part of that is they can be subject to criticism,\u201d Milburn says. \u201cBut I think transparency and shining light and showing the good things they are doing here is important.\u201d Just 100 metres away, more artists take shelter from the rain under a row of grain silos while they paint the landscape. Leo Robba is among them. He\u2019s a lecturer at Western Sydney University and at the helm of the pilgrimage of city artists who travel west each year. The visit is part of The Painted River Project, combining creativity and science to highlight the importance of healthy waterways. The project started at Parramatta in western Sydney in 2017, and extended to the Moree region in 2021 through a collaboration between Western Sydney University and the Bank Art Museum Moree (Bamm). According to Robba, the artists come not just to create but to contribute to and understand the carbon conversation. \u201cAs climate change kicks in, people become more aware,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important that city people get a different understanding of how country people live and where their food comes from, how it\u2019s grown, how we could work together to understand each other\u2019s perspectives and work for a collective approach around that.\u201d Licence to farm The Keytah Farm manager, Nick Gillingham, doesn\u2019t mind the company the project generates and the chance to gain direct feedback from the consumer. \u201cIt puts back to us how we need to make sure we do the right thing to maintain our licence to farm in the public sector,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to keep pressing on and try and do the best job we can and improve on what we are doing.\u201d The operation uses sustainable farming practices, including minimal soil disturbance, incorporating stubble and reducing usage of fertiliser, and according to Sundown Pastoral it\u2019s made water efficiency improvements of up 235%. In 2019, the 65,000-acre (260 sq km) cropping property underwent a carbon emissions audit that found the production of cotton and other crops on the property reduced carbon emissions. \u201cWe were one of the first farms to do a really thorough study. We compared from 2013 to 2018 \u2013 we\u2019d increased our levels in that time, and hopefully in the next few years will be on the up and up,\u201d Gillingam says. Consumer responsibility According to Robba, the view that farmers are wasting water is simplistic. \u201cThey are running businesses, so it is in their own interest to be responsible,\u201d he says. Many in the broadacre farming sector are now using minimal soil disturbance practices and slowly building the health of the soil to increase yields, but Gillingham says sustainable decisions are still motivated by consumer demand and \u201cat the forefront of every political talk\u201d. In a pre-budget announcement, the federal government recently offered tax cuts to farmers and landholders receiving revenue from the production of Australian carbon credits, to encourage more participation in carbon offset projects and practices. But as Milburn walks back to the grain shed with her mud-dipped masterpiece, she speaks of her own responsibilities as a consumer in the farming supply chain to make more sustainable choices. \u201cIt is actually how we as wearers use the cotton, so if we wear it for longer until it wears out, then really there is no issue because we need to wear something,\u201d she says. In the next shed, Moree artist Nick Osmond has been sitting on a chair looking out at the rain to inspire his colourful figurative piece on paper. While the presence of the artists on the farm is a juxtaposition, Osmond\u2019s self-reflection would have you thinking he could be a farmer. \u201cYou do get set in your ways, you really do. You should be continually looking for different aspects of your work,\u201d he says. Bamm recently held an exhibition of work completed as part of The Painted River Project 2021.

But in an increasingly climate-conscious society, it is increasingly trying to present itself as sustainable to appeal to customers.

However, the Guardian can exclusively reveal how the fashion industry\u2019s impact on the planet is being hidden. Thanks to the way the scores are calculated, household names such as H&amp;M and Nike can claim an overall decrease in annual carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 and receive high scores from the CDP \u2013 despite their actual emissions increasing. It\u2019s all about the fine print. These fashion brands do report their gross global emissions, but these are calculated against total revenue. This means that as long as their emissions increase less than their revenue increases each year, the total emissions are scored as a decrease. In Nike\u2019s 2020 climate change report, it describes how \u201cemissions increased 1% year over year, which was offset by 7% year-on-year revenue growth, resulting in over a 5% drop in emissions per revenue in [financial year 2019]\u201d. Despite the rise in emissions, the CDP scored Nike A-. H&amp;M also self-reported \u201cgross global emissions\u201d increases in 2017 and 2018, but because those emissions increased less than revenue did, it reported an overall decrease and was also awarded an A- each year. Linking emissions and revenue is only one of the tools provided by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which sets the scheme for emissions reporting. How emissions are broken down, into Scope 1, 2 and 3, is also critical to understanding how brands can appear to decrease their total emissions. Scope 1 emissions are those that stem directly from the company burning fossil fuels. Scope 2 emissions are those which come from energy bought from utility providers. Scope 3 emissions are all the other indirect emissions that occur along the value chain. For the CDP report, companies provide \u201cgross global combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions\u201d, and self-report whether these have increased or decreased against revenue increase. Nike\u2019s Scope 1 emissions \u2013 the metric tonnes of CO2 produced by the company\u2019s burning of fossil fuels \u2013 have increased every year since 2016. It includes retail, distribution and offices, among other things. The sportswear manufacturer self-reported emitting 17,975 metric tonnes of CO2 in 2015, jumping to 47,398 in 2021 \u2013 a 163% increase. H&amp;M\u2019s have increased from 10,723 in 2015 to 11,973 in 2021, which is down from a high of 13,380 in 2020. Critically, many companies exclude Scope 3 emissions, which are categorised as upstream or downstream, meaning they do not account for the pollution produced by their supply chain. Although Nike tracks these emissions, it does not provide a gross total. Business travel is calculated as Scope 3 upstream emissions, meaning the impact of its employees\u2019 flights is not included in its \u201cgross global emissions\u201d. Nike did not respond to a request for comment, but has previously stated that Scope 3 emissions such as business travel are not included in its future sustainability targets. H&amp;M is accounting for and targeting its Scope 3 emissions. In a statement to the Guardian, the company said: \u201cScope 1 and 2 emissions stand for less than 1% of our reported emissions and while they are important, they are not our focus of work towards reaching our 56% reduction goal. This will not be enough. Our main focus is Scope 3. We see significant opportunities to grow in a way that respects planetary boundaries.\u201d The company made a profit of \u20ac1.36bn (\u00a31.14bn) in 2021. Experts are dismayed at the industry\u2019s self-proclaimed progress, warning that focusing on increasing efficiency rather than reducing absolute emissions \u2013 known as relative decoupling \u2013 puts the planet at risk. \u201cCelebrating the success of this sort of relative decoupling is a recipe for disaster,\u201d said James Dyke, an associate professor in Earth system science at the University of Exeter. \u201cGlobal warming will stop when we stop pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Nike having a few million more in the bank doesn\u2019t change that.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-04-18T15:29:40Z",
            "content": "Dozens of pro-independence Catalan figures, including the president of the north-eastern Spanish region and three of his predecessors, have been targeted using NSO Group\u2019s Pegasus spyware, according to a report from cybersecurity experts. The research published on Monday by Citizen Lab, considered among the world\u2019s leading experts in detecting digital attacks, said victims of the mobile phone targeting included Pere Aragon\u00e8s, who has led Catalonia since last year, as well as the former regional presidents Quim Torra, Carles Puigdemont and Artur Mas. It also found that MEPs, legislators, lawyers, civil society activists and journalists were targeted, as were some members of their families. Although NSO Group claims that Pegasus is sold only to governments to track criminals and terrorists, a joint investigation two years ago by the Guardian and El Pa\u00eds established that the speaker of the Catalan regional parliament and at least two other pro-independence supporters were warned the spyware had been used to target them. The Citizen Lab report said at least 65 individuals had been targeted or infected with mercenary spyware, of whom at least 63 were targeted or infected with Pegasus. Almost all the incidents took place between 2017 \u2013 the year of the failed bid for Catalan regional independence \u2013 and 2020. Victims\u2019 phones were said to have been targeted using fake texts or WhatsApp messages. It said Aragon\u00e8s wastargeted while serving as vice-president of Catalonia, while Torra \u2013 who served as regional president between 2018 and 2020 \u2013 was targeted while in office. Puigdemont, who led the failed, unilateral push for independence almost five years ago, was also targeted \u2013 as was Mas, who was targeted after leaving office. Thirty-one regional MPs \u2013 27 of them from the three pro-independence Catalan parties \u2013 were reportedly targeted, as were nine members of the two powerful grassroots groups, the Catalan National Assembly and \u00d2mnium Cultural. The Citizen Lab investigation also concluded that multiple lawyers representing prominent Catalan separatists Catalans were targeted and infected with Pegasus. According to the report, they include Gonzalo Boye, who represents Puigdemont, and Andreu Van den Eynde, a lawyer for several high-profile pro-independence politicians including the former regional vice-president Oriol Junqueras. The report said the number of confirmed mercenary spyware victims was \u201cextraordinarily high \u2026 [and] gives a window into what is likely a larger effort to place a significant slice of Catalan civil society under targeted surveillance for several years\u201d. Citizen Lab pointed out that NSO Group claims that Pegasus is sold only to governments, adding: \u201cWhile we do not currently attribute this operation to specific governmental entities, circumstantial evidence suggests a strong nexus with the government of Spain, including the nature of the victims and targets, the timing, and the fact that Spain is reported to be a government client of NSO Group.\u201d It called for an official inquiry to determine who had ordered the targeting, what judicial oversight had applied, and how the hacked material was used. Aragon\u00e8s said Citizen Lab\u2019s findings, which were first reported in the New Yorker, had revealed \u201ca case of espionage against a democratic European movement, which puts fundamental rights at risk everywhere\u201d. He called on the Spanish government to provide immediate explanations, saying: \u201cSpying on public representatives, lawyers or civil right activists is a red line.\u201d Amnesty International, which peer-reviewed Citizen Lab\u2019s investigation and said it had found evidence of Pegasus targeting and infection in all cases, said the Spanish government needed to clarify whether it was an NSO Group customer. It also urged the government to conduct \u201ca thorough, independent investigation\u201d into the reported use of Pegasus against those identified by Citizen Lab. \u201cGovernments around the globe have not done enough to investigate or stop human rights violations caused by invasive spyware like Pegasus,\u201d said Likhita Banerji, Amnesty International\u2019s technology and human rights researcher. \u201cThe use, sale and transfer of this surveillance technology must be temporarily halted to prevent further abuses of human rights.\u201d A spokesperson for NSO said: \u201cNSO continues to be targeted by a number of politically motivated advocacy organisations like Citizen Labs and Amnesty to produce inaccurate and unsubstantiated reports based on vague and incomplete information. \u201cWe have repeatedly cooperated with governmental investigations, where credible allegations merit. However, information raised regarding these allegations are, yet again, false and could not be related to NSO products for technological and contractual reasons.\u201d A spokesperson for Spain\u2019s interior ministry said neither the ministry, the Polic\u00eda Nacional, nor the Guardia Civil had ever had any dealings with NSO Group and had consequently never contracted any of its services. He added: \u201cAll communications intercepts are carried out under judicial authority and with full respect for the law.\u201d Spain\u2019s National Intelligence Centre (CNI) has previously told the Guardian and El Pa\u00eds that its work is overseen by the supreme court and that it acts \u201cin full accordance with the legal system, and with absolute respect for the applicable laws\u201d. In US court filings in response to claims by WhatsApp, NSO Group has denied allegations that it bore any responsibility in the targeting of individuals and said it did not operate the technology itself."

            "date": "2022-04-01T04:40:55Z",
            "content": "The Morrison government has axed a $1.3bn program to buy armed drones, redirecting the money towards the \u201cRedspice\u201d cybersecurity package that the Coalition trumpeted as a centrepiece of the defence budget. As political parties prepare for the possibility of the election campaign formally beginning within days, officials revealed the government was cancelling a project it previously hailed as a \u201ccutting-edge armed remotely-piloted aircraft system\u201d. The government also confirmed it was yet to decide on the future of a Chinese company\u2019s lease over the Port of Darwin, describing last year\u2019s review as a \u201clive process\u201d that was not yet complete. The Coalition is known to be keen to campaign on its national security credentials and it used Tuesday\u2019s budget to promote what it called \u201cthe biggest ever investment in Australia\u2019s cyber preparedness\u201d. Australia\u2019s electronic spy agency, the Australian Signals Directorate, will double in size and ramp up its ability to launch its own offensive cyber operations as part of a $10bn pledge dubbed Redspice, short for \u201cresilience, effects, defence, space, intelligence, cyber and enablers\u201d. But the funding is spread over 10 years and only $4.2bn will be spent in the first four-year budget cycle. Given the government is partly offsetting the package with savings from other parts of the defence portfolio, the cyber pledge is worth only $588.7m in new money in the first four years. Defence officials confirmed at a Senate estimates hearing on Friday that the Redspice-related savings included cancelling the SkyGuardian program, under which Australia had planned to acquire up to 12 armed drones which could also be used for surveillance. The government had previously said it would try to maximise Australian industry content in that acquisition. The then defence minister, Linda Reynolds, said in 2019: \u201cCutting-edge technology of this kind, with advanced sensors and systems, would complement advanced aircraft such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and ensure that Australian Defence Force maintains state-of-the-art capability.\u201d So far, just $10m has been spent on the envisaged $1.3bn SkyGuardian program. The acting secretary of the Department of Defence, Matt Yannopoulos, said the cancellation of the program was made \u201cby government as part of the decision for Redspice\u201d. Asked whether the cancellation had been previously announced, Yannopoulos said: \u201cNo, I did that here \u2013 20 minutes ago.\u201d Pressed on why it was only revealed during Senate estimates, he added: \u201cTo answer a direct question from Senator [Penny] Wong on what was adjusted in the integrated investment program to support Redspice.\u201d Officials said there were also some cost offsets from within the ASD\u2019s own programs. Labor said the cancellation would \u201creverberate around Australian defence industry\u201d and \u201cdemonstrates this government doesn\u2019t care about Australian manufacturing\u201d. Labor\u2019s defence spokesperson, Brendan O\u2019Connor, said: \u201cHow on earth can Australians trust this government to deliver what they promise when they hide unpopular decisions?\u201d O\u2019Connor also claimed that \u201cup to $5.5bn will be wasted on a non-existent fleet of submarines\u201d. On Friday, defence officials were unable to shed light on the likely costs of cancelling the French submarine contract, but said they expected it would be able to be covered within existing budgeted amounts. Defence budget papers say $5.4bn is the total approved project expenditure for the Future Submarine Mobilisation and Design. That includes estimated total spending up to 30 June 2022 of $3.2bn and a further $494m in the 2022-23 financial year. Officials told Friday\u2019s hearing that the attack-class submarine program had so far cost $2.5bn, up to the end of January 2022. But they said the figures for the program outlined in Tuesday\u2019s budget were as originally earmarked \u2013 prior to the cancellation \u2013 because \u201cwe haven\u2019t determined what the final cost is\u201d. Talks with the French company Naval Group are continuing. The Senate hearing also scrutinised the government\u2019s plans for new port infrastructure in the Northern Territory, amid speculation the Coalition may campaign on the matter during the election. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said on budget night that the government would invest \u201c$1.5bn to build new port infrastructure, such as a wharf, an offloading facility and dredging of the shipping channel, to boost the region\u2019s importing and exporting ability\u201d. Defence officials confirmed they have been in talks with counterparts from the infrastructure department, but noted that the Northern Territory had been promoting plans for the trade-focused \u201cMiddle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct\u201d for some time. The Northern Territory\u2019s then-Country Liberal party government granted a 99-year lease over the Port of Darwin to the Chinese company Landbridge Group, under a controversial 2015 agreement. The federal government announced a review on national security grounds last year. The Australian newspaper reported in late December that Defence\u2019s review had found there were no national security grounds sufficient to recommend a government intervention to overturn the controversial lease. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, said on Friday: \u201cI have no information on the genesis of that media speculation. I have information and advice which indicates to me that the review is still in process. So I would say that the speculation is incorrect.\u201d The article in the Australian had noted the government was still reviewing the matter, but speculated that the position of the Department of Defence \u201cmakes any decision to overturn the port lease more politically challenging\u201d. Peter Tesch, a deputy secretary of the Department of Defence, told the hearing his agency had \u201cconsidered the implications for defence\u201d and provided its judgment, \u201cbut the process is not entirely within the remit of Defence\u201d. He said other agencies and departments were also involved and it was still \u201ca live process\u201d. Guardian Australia has previously reported the government was considering options that went beyond the binary choice of keeping or scrapping the lease. That could include imposing additional requirements on the operator, Landbridge Group, under critical infrastructure laws. Landbridge said last year the company had \u201cacquired the lease to Darwin Port in good faith following a transparent process in 2015\u201d and was willing to assist any review."

            "date": "2022-04-19T19:02:48Z",
            "content": "Boris Johnson should \u201cpay close attention\u201d to basic rules of cybersecurity, a former national security adviser has said, after it emerged that the United Arab Emirates was accused of hacking into a mobile phone at Downing Street. Peter Ricketts, who held the post between 2010 and 2012, said the cyber-attack demonstrated that \u201ccommercially made\u201d Pegasus software from NSO Group allowed a \u201cwide range of actors\u201d to engage in sophisticated espionage. Anybody with access to secret information needed to be aware of the fast-changing risk, the peer added, including the prime minister, who was forced to change his mobile number last year after it emerged it had been available online. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that anyone with access to sensitive material up to and including the PM have to pay close attention to the basic rules of cybersecurity, including their phone numbers,\u201d Ricketts said. Johnson was forced to suddenly change his mobile phone last spring after it emerged that his number had been available online for 15 years. It was published on a thinktank press release from 2006 and never deleted. Pegasus is sophisticated software, made by the Israeli company NSO Group, that can covertly take control of a person\u2019s mobile phone, take and copy data from it and even turn it into a remote listening device without their permission. But for it to be effective, it needs to be given a phone number to target. NSO Group said the allegations were \u201cwrong and misleading\u201d and the company denied involvement. \u201cFor technological, contractual and legal reasons, the described allegations are impossible and have no relation to NSO\u2019s products,\u201d the company said. On Monday, Citizen Lab, a group of technology researchers based at Toronto University, said they had uncovered evidence of \u201cmultiple suspected instances of Pegasus spyware infections\u201d within official UK networks including Downing Street and the Foreign Office. Using digital forensic techniques developed over several years, the researchers said they concluded the attack on Downing Street was \u201cassociated with a Pegasus operator we link to the UAE\u201d, and took place on 7 July 2020. There is no firm evidence as to why the UAE may have wanted to target Downing Street on that date. However, a day earlier the British government announced a range of economic sanctions targeting 20 Saudi nationals accused of being involved in the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, plus individuals from Russia, Myanmar and North Korea. Neighbouring UAE is a close ally of Saudi Arabia. The UAE ambassador to London, Mansoor Abulhoul, denied reports that the UAE may have used spyware to hack into either Downing Street or the Foreign Office. He said: \u201cThese reports are totally baseless and we reject them. The UK is one of the UAE\u2019s closest and dearest allies and we would never do such a thing to them.\u201d He added he was shocked that the allegations had even been made, pointing to the recent enhancement of relations between the two countries, including a growing economic partnership. The denial is a reflection of the importance that the UAE attaches to the relationship, and the potential damage the espionage allegation could cause if it were given credence. One Citizen Lab researcher told the New Yorker, which first reported on the story, that it believed some data may have been stolen from Downing Street by the hackers. But the research group said it could not identify whether Johnson\u2019s own phone or that of any other named official was targeted. The Foreign Office declined to discuss the story, saying: \u201cWe do not routinely comment on security matters.\u201d But Citizen Lab said that it had alerted the UK, and officials from the National Cyber Security Centre are understood to have tested several phones but were unable to locate which one was compromised. Pegasus is sold to governments for counter-terror or national security purposes, but there have been repeated accusations that it has been used to spy on opposition politicians, human rights defenders and journalists by at least 10 countries, including the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Three civil society activists in Britain are in the process of bringing a civil claim against NSO Group, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, after an investigation by the Guardian and others that showed more than 400 phone numbers had been selected for potential targeting. Last year the high court and the court of appeal also ruled that \u201cservants or agents\u201d of sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the vice-president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, had engaged in \u201cthe surveillance of the six phones\u201d in Britain \u2013 including of his former sixth wife, Princess Haya, with whom he was embroiled in a bitter divorce case, and her lawyer Fiona Shackleton. After the episode was discovered, in August 2020, NSO Group is understood to have rewritten its software to prevent Pegasus from being allowed to target UK numbers."

A report released by Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said the United Arab Emirates was suspected of orchestrating spyware attacks on No 10 in 2020 and 2021. Pegasus is the hacking software \u2013 or spyware \u2013 developed, marketed and licensed to governments around the world by the Israeli firm NSO Group. It has the capability to infect phones running either iOS or Android operating systems. Citizen Lab added there had also been suspected attacks on the Foreign Office over the same two years that were also associated with Pegasus operators linked to the UAE \u2013 as well as India, Cyprus and Jordan. The researchers, considered among the world\u2019s leading experts in detecting digital attacks, announced they had taken the rare step of notifying Whitehall of the attack as it \u201cbelieves that our actions can reduce harm\u201d. However, they were not able to identify the specific individuals within No 10 and the Foreign Office who are suspected of having been hacked. In a statement, Citizen Lab said: \u201cWe confirm that in 2020 and 2021 we observed and notified the government of the United Kingdom of multiple suspected instances of Pegasus spyware infections within official UK networks. These included: the prime minister\u2019s office (10 Downing Street) [and] the Foreign and Commonwealth Office \u2026 \u201cThe suspected infections relating to the FCO were associated with Pegasus operators that we link to the UAE, India, Cyprus and Jordan. The suspected infection at the UK prime minister\u2019s office was associated with a Pegasus operator we link to the UAE.\u201d The Biden administration took the extraordinary step of placing NSO on a US blacklist last November, saying it had evidence the company had sold surveillance spyware to foreign governments that had used it for \u201ctransnational repression\u201d. At the time, an NSO spokesperson said it was \u2018\u201cdismayed by the decision\u201d. The allegations will raise significant questions about a possible national security breach at the highest levels of the British government. The governments of the UAE, India, Cyprus and Jordan have been approached for comment. A UK government spokesperson said: \u201cWe do not routinely comment on security matters.\u201d An NSO spokesperson said: \u201cNSO continues to be targeted by a number of politically motivated advocacy organisations like Citizen Lab and Amnesty to produce inaccurate and unsubstantiated reports based on vague and incomplete information. \u201cWe have repeatedly cooperated with governmental investigations, where credible allegations merit. However, information raised regarding these allegations are, yet again, false and could not be related to NSO products for technological and contractual reasons.\u201d The Pegasus project, a collaborative investigation into NSO that included the Guardian, the Wire, Le Monde and the Washington Post, revealed dozens of cases last year in which NSO\u2019s Pegasus was used by government clients, from Saudi Arabia to Mexico, to target dissidents and journalists. The work was among the recipients of the prestigious 2021 George Polk awards in journalism. NSO is regulated by the Israeli defence ministry and sells Pegasus spyware to governments around the world. When it is successfully deployed against a target, Pegasus can infect any phone. It can intercept phone calls, view photographs, track an individual\u2019s location and turn a phone into a remote listening device. The Citizen Lab director, Ron Deibert, said he believed the infections could have been related to FCO devices located abroad. Explaining his reasoning for alerting Johnson, he explained that the UK \u201cis currently in the midst of several ongoing legislative and judicial efforts relating to regulatory questions surrounding cyber policy\u201d. Therefore, he added \u201cwe believe that it is critically important that such efforts are allowed to unfold free from the undue influence of spyware\u201d. The UK development comes months after an investigation into NSO found that the mobile phone of a serving French minister, Fran\u00e7ois de Rugy, showed digital traces of activity associated with Pegasus spyware. His details appeared on a leaked database, which also included mobile numbers for the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and most of his 20-strong cabinet, along with the then prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe. In response, an NSO Group spokesperson said Macron and other French officials on the list \u201care not and never have been Pegasus targets\u201d. They added: \u201cIt is not a list of targets or potential targets of NSO\u2019s customers.\u201d In October last year, a UK court found that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum of Dubai used Pegasus to hack the phone of his ex-wife Princess Haya and five of her associates. The court found that the hacking of Haya and her associates, including Fiona Shackleton, who sits in the House of Lords, occurred while the former couple were locked in court proceedings in connection to the welfare of their two children. Johnson\u2019s government was accused by some MPs last November of prioritising trade agreements over national security in its handling of surveillance abuses on British soil by governments using Pegasus. In November, a letter to the prime minister signed by 10 MPs and peers called on the government to end its cybersecurity programmes with countries that are known to have used NSO spyware to target dissidents, journalists and lawyers \u2013 and impose sanctions on NSO. It also called for the suspension of all UK spyware licences and cybersecurity contracts with Gulf nations implicated in cyber-attacks in the UK."

Economic growth slowed markedly at the start of the year. In the last three months of 2021 US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of the economy \u2013 grew by 1.7% or 6.9% on an annualized basis.

But he said it was unlikely to deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates as it attempts to tackle rising inflation. The Fed raised rates in March as inflation hit a 40-year high of 7.9%. It meets next week and is expected to raise rates once again. Fed chair Jerome Powell has suggested the central bank may raise rates by 0.5 percentage points, twice March\u2019s rise. \u201cThe unexpectedly severe 1.4% annualised decline in first-quarter GDP growth probably won\u2019t stop the Fed from hiking interest rates by 50 basis points next week, since officials will chalk it up to the temporary impact of Omicron and point to the strength of underlying demand,\u201d Ashworth wrote in a note to investors. The surprise drop in growth comes as other sectors of the US economy remain strong. Employers have added an average of 600,000 new jobs a month over the last six months and the unemployment rate fell to 3.6% in March, close to its pre-pandemic low."

            "date": "2022-04-21T05:00:47Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden must act to reduce mounting economic pressure by ditching \u201cwoke advisers\u201d, Mitt Romney said. The Utah senator and former Republican presidential nominee made the demand in a column for the Wall Street Journal. \u201cA new set of priorities requires a new set of principals,\u201d Romney wrote. \u201cPresident Biden needs to ditch his woke advisers and surround himself with people who want to get the economy working again.\u201d Romney\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about what a \u201cwoke adviser\u201d was or who might qualify for the title. The White House did not comment. As midterm elections approach, the Biden administration faces strong economic headwinds. Inflation is at long-term highs, adding to a cost-of-living crisis fueled by the coronavirus pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. Biden\u2019s favourability rating has plummeted as polling shows disapproval of his handling of economic affairs. As the Associated Press put it, \u201chopes for a lasting economic renaissance have faded as Americans cope with higher food and energy costs. And the promise of a country no longer under the pandemic\u2019s sway has been supplanted by the uncertainty of war in Europe.\u201d Romney is a rare Republican not under Donald Trump\u2019s sway, having been the only GOP senator to vote to convict Trump in both his impeachment trials. Romney has also plotted a middle course on some political issues. Earlier this month, he was one of three Republicans to vote to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson as the first Black woman on the supreme court. Biden compared Romney to his father, the Michigan governor George Romney, who also \u201cstood up and made these decisions on civil rights\u201d. But in the Journal, Romney came out swinging. He wrote: \u201cThe Biden administration did pretty much everything wrong, injecting $1.9tn into a supply constrained economy, sending out stay-at-home checks, letting tenants live rent-free, squeezing oil and gas production, launching an avalanche of growth-killing regulations, lining up behind unions, and pushing yet another deficit-financed budget.\u201d Biden \u201cmust stop nominating doves to the Fed\u201d, Romney said, demanding \u201chard-nosed economists\u201d instead. He also demanded Biden drop his Build Back Better spending plan, which aims among other goals to boost social care and combat the climate crisis. Romney repeated Republican calls for increased domestic oil and gas drilling but also indicated splits in his own party. The senator called for reform of programmes such as social security and Medicare rather than their end, as outlined in a controversial proposal by Rick Scott of Florida. Romney also said Biden should \u201cfind a way to stop the flood of illegal immigration while accelerating legal immigration\u201d, a less hawkish stance than most in his party. His call to ditch \u201cwoke advisers\u201d came alongside advice ahead of midterms in which Republicans are favoured to retake Congress. \u201cRemember Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 mantra,\u201d Romney wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s the economy.\u201d In fact, the phrase associated with Clinton\u2019s victory over George HW Bush, coined by the adviser James Carville, was: \u201cThe economy, stupid.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-04-28T16:08:17Z",
            "content": "Time to wrap up - here are today\u2019s main stories: Goodnight. GW Stocks in Europe have ended the day higher, despite the suprise fall in US economic growth last quarter. In London, the FTSE 100 closed 84 points higher at 7,509, up 1.1%, led by Standard Chartered (+14%), Aveva (+6.75%) and Whitbread (+4.3%). Germany\u2019s DAX (+1.35%) and France\u2019s CAC (+1%) also gained. David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital, says the announcement the US economy contracted at an annual rate of 1.4% in the first quarter of this year was a big surprise. It is worth remembering the economy expanded by 6.9% in the final quarter of last year, so it is a major deceleration. Two consecutive quarters of negative growth defines a technical recession. Keep in mind, the Russian invasion happened more than halfway through the first quarter, so if the first three months saw a negative reading, it does not bode well for the second quarter. Despite the pull back, the US dollar is still up 0.5% on the day, which speaks volumes about the strength of the currency. In light of the -1.4% growth report, the Fed might look to rein in its hawkish commentary because negative growth and higher borrowing costs is not a good combination. The unexpected drop in US GDP in 2022 Q1 is not that unexpected given the uncertainty gripping the US, argues Professor Costas Milas of University of Liverpool. Prof Milas has plotted the U.S. output gap (output relative to potential in the U.S) along with a measure of \u2018aggregate uncertainty\u2019 in the US. That measure covers financial, economic, epidemiological and geopolitical uncertainty, which have all risen recently: He explains: Their correlation is astonishingly high and equal to -0.62 which suggests a very damaging impact of rising uncertainty on the U.S. economy. The figure draws from my recent piece for LSE Blog Politics where I argue that rising uncertainty is a very reliable predictor of U.S. and U.K. output. In other words, once uncertainty is taken into consideration by the Fed and the Bank of England (as early as next week), sharp and rapid rises in interest rates are far from certain. In the currency markets, the US dollar has climbed to its highest level in two decades. The dollar index hit a 20-year high against a basket of currencies today. It extended its recent surge as rival currencies falter, and traders anticipate sharp increases in US interestg rates this year. The yen weakened to a new 20-year low after the Bank of Japan strengthened its commitment to keep interest rates ultra-low by vowing to buy unlimited amounts of bonds, to keep government bond yields low. The euro has also weakened, on concerns over the eurozone economy if gas supplies from Russia are cut off. The pound has also dropped again, hit by concerns over the UK\u2019s economic health. It has lost another cent to hit a new 21-month low to $1.245, with traders concerned that the British economy is being hit by weak consumer confidence, a cost of living crisis, rising input costs and supply chain disruption. US president Joe Biden has blamed \u2018technical factors\u2019 for the drop in GDP in the first quarter of the year. In a statement, Biden points out there were bright points in the growth report, such as rising consumer consuption: The American economy \u2014 powered by working families \u2014 continues to be resilient in the face of historic challenges. Last quarter, consumer spending, business investment, and residential investment increased at strong rates. The number of Americans on unemployment insurance remains at the lowest level since 1970. Later this morning, I will meet with small business owners who are creating and growing their businesses at a historic rate. While last quarter\u2019s growth estimate was affected by technical factors, the United States confronts the challenges of Covid-19 around the world, Putin\u2019s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and global inflation from a position of strength. Biden also urges Congress should agree a bipartisan innovation bill to bolster US supply chains and make more in America. More here. Those \u2018technical factors\u2019 would include the drop in business inventories, which knocked GDP lower. But growth was also pulled down by the slump in net trade, as America\u2019s imports jumped as exports fell (as explained earlier). The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment support remains low, in a sign that the jobs market remains solid. There were 180,000 \u2018initial claims\u2019 filed last week, down from 185,000 the previous week, data today shows. Initial claims reflect whether more people are being laid off. After surging over 6 million in April 2020, claims have fallen back as the economy reopened. With firms struggling to hire staff, claims fell to 166k earlier this month, the lowest in over 50 years. The US GDP report captures many of the cross currents in the world\u2019s largest economy, says Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors: While consumer spend, probably the most important piece, powered ahead at +2.7%, even that had some underlying pockets of softness, especially in hard goods. Inventories and trade brought down the overall number, and inflation was hot. Taken together this will likely not assuage fears that the economic picture is cloudy, with significant risks, and cracks already evident.\u201d KPMG US senior economist Ken Kim also argues that the US economy is in better shape than the headline GDP figure suggests. Kim says there\u2019s a \u201clow likelihood of a recession this year\u201d: Two swing factors, inventories and trade, pulled GDP lower. Excluding these two measures, a core version of GDP growth, referred to as \u201cfinal sales to domestic purchasers,\u201d showed a solid increase of 2.7% in Q1 2022. The best way to interpret today\u2019s GDP data is to combine this quarter and last quarter\u2019s growth rates. In Q4 2021, real GDP growth clocked in at a super-charged rate of 6.9%. The average for the two quarters works out to 2.8%, still a respectable rate of economic growth.\u201d A surge in US defense spending this year will help keep the economy out of recession, predicts Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM Investments: Here\u2019s his take on the 1.4% drop in US GDP in the last quarter (on an annualised basis) \u201cConsumer spending was marginally weaker-than-expected, no doubt with some price pressures affecting behaviour, but the big hit came through in the overall trade inputs with net imports dragging growth into the red for the quarter. This print is confusing, as on the surface you would be forgiven for thinking all is not well economically speaking. \u201cTake out the trade deficit and the picture is less alarming. This is what the Fed will be focused on when they raise rates again in less than a week. There is little doubt that the next quarter\u2019s numbers will be firmly back in the positive, due to a massive ramp up in government spending in defence. Nothing to see here that alters the Fed trajectory, as they will be looking past the wood for the trees and this data release does nothing to change that.\u201d Stocks have opened higher in New York, despite the surprise fall in US GDP in the last quarter. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 147 points, or 0.5%, at 33,449, while the tech-focused Nasdaq is 0.9% higher. Meta has jumping 13% after reporting last night that Facebook added more users than projected in the last quarter, despite revenues missing forecasts. The US economy shrank in the first three months of the year, contracting by -0.4% in the first quarter, or -1.4% on an annualized basis, its weakest quarter since the early days of the pandemic. Economic growth slowed markedly at the start of the year. In the last three months of 2021 US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of the economy \u2013 grew by 1.7% or 6.9% on an annualized basis. The Commerce Department said the slowdown was caused by a drop in private inventory investment, exports, federal government spending, and state and local government spending. Consumer spending, the largest component of the US economy, grew 0.7% in the first quarter despite the impact of the Omicron wave of the coronavirus. Here\u2019s the full story: Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics predicts America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, will not be deterred from lifting US interest rates sharply next week: The unexpectedly severe 1.4% annualised decline in first-quarter GDP growth probably won\u2019t stop the Fed from hiking interest rates by 50bp next week, since officials will chalk it up to the temporary impact of Omicron and point to the strength of underlying demand - with the growth rate of sales to private domestic purchasers accelerating to a very healthy 3.7%. Net export subtracted a massive 3.2% points from overall GDP growth, with inventories subtracting an additional 0.8% points. Exports fell by 5.9% annualised while, as shipping congestion eased, imports increased by 17.7%. The negative contribution from inventories was inevitable after stock building added 5.3% points to fourth-quarter GDP growth, which was as strong as 6.9%. The other source of weakness in the first quarter was the public sector, as fiscal support was withdrawn, with government expenditure falling by 2.7%. The US economy is now technically on the brink of recession (two negative quarters in a row), after shrinking in the January-March quarter, but economists are suggesting this isn\u2019t likely. Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, argues that the recovery is still on track, once you recognised that weak trade and softer business inventories pushed GDP down in Q1. \u201cGDP contracted in the first quarter by 1.4%, which is a scary drop from 6.9% growth in the fourth quarter of last year, but not scary when you look at the underlying numbers in two categories\u2014trade and inventories. In the other two categories that count most, business and consumer spending, first quarter GDP did well, and clearly those categories are accelerating now into the second quarter. Also, while GDP is an imperfect short-term measure of economic health, better measures such as employment and consumer spending indicate the expansion is steady and on track.\u201d Other economists also insists the US isn\u2019t about to drop into recession, as CNBC explains: \u201cThis is noise; not signal. The economy is not falling into recession,\u201d wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cNet trade has been hammered by a surge in imports, especially of consumer goods, as wholesalers and retailers have sought to rebuild inventory. This cannot persist much longer, and imports in due course will drop outright, and net trade will boost GDP growth in Q2 and/or Q3.\u201d Here\u2019s more reaction: Economists are pointing out that US consumer spending and business investment remained strong in the last quarter, despite the economy shrinking. Instead, it was the drop in inventories, along with falling exports and lower government spending, that pulled GDP down, the Bureau of Economic Analysis data shows: The US economy shrank unexpectedly in the first quarter of this year, for the first time since early in the Covid-19 pandemic. US GDP fell by around 0.35% in January-March, new data shows, or at an annualised rate of 1.4%. Surging inflation, the Omicron variant, and supply chain problems all dragged on growth. Economists had expected the US economy to keep growing, at an annualised rate of 1.1%, after strong growth of 6.9% in the last quarter of 2021. This is the first contraction since the second quarter of 2020, when the pandemic hit. It suggests America\u2019s economy is at greater risk of a downturn, as inflation soars and the Ukraine war hits the global economy. The drop was partly due to a fall in business inventories, as companies ran down their stocks. Net trade also weakened sharply, with annualised exports down 5.9% and imports jumping 17.7% (which will subtract from GDP). Consumer spending and business investment continued to rise. Richard Flynn, Managing Director at Charles Schwab UK, says the figures are likely to cause concern. The US economy accelerated incredibly sharply as we exited the acute phase of the pandemic and this pace of growth continued until late last year. Whilst the healthy labour and housing market are positive indicators, today\u2019s figures confirm there is now no shortage of headwinds facing the US economy, including the consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, persistently high inflation, and tightening monetary policy. \u201cConsumer confidence is low. We\u2019re in a period of counter-cyclical inflation \u2013 when high prices put downward pressure on demand and growth. The Fed\u2019s eye is on inflation as it tightens monetary policy in a bid to slow aggregate demand and cool price rises. With high inflation and low growth expectations, it may be difficult for the Fed to raise rates without slowing growth. Economic data has been generally weakening recently, which is likely to persist, increasing the probability of a downturn.\u201d Veterinary groups have criticised the decision to delay checks at the UK border on imports of EU animal and agrifood products. They fear this latest suspension could threaten health, because sanitary and phytosanitary checks would continue to take place away from the border at \u2018places of destination\u2019, potentially giving pests and diseases more opportunity to enter the UK. Port operators are also concerned that the money they\u2019ve spent on infrastructure for Bexit checks could have been wasted. The FT has the details: James Russell, senior vice-president, of the British Veterinary Association, said the government\u2019s move \u201cflies in the face\u201d of ministers\u2019 commitment to preserving high levels of animal and human health in the UK at a time when diseases such as African swine fever had already had a catastrophic impact in parts of Europe. \u201cWe urge the government to abandon these plans and close off the threat of causing significant damage to our food and farming industries,\u201d he said. Tim Morris, chief executive of the UK Major Ports Group, said port operators feared the facilities they had built \u201cwill be highly bespoke white elephants\u201d. \u201cGovernment needs to engage urgently with ports to agree how the substantial investments made in good faith can be recovered,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will of course be working closely with the government on its new vision of a slimmer and smaller regime of border checks.\u201d There would have been \u2018devastating\u2019 disruption to food shipments to the UK if EU import controls hadn\u2019t been delayed again, says Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation (which represents firms in the UK\u2019s temperature-controlled supply chain). That highlights how the UK still wasn\u2019t ready to handle the impact of Brexit at the border, leading to today\u2019s delay. As predicted earlier, the UK has -- again -- dropped plans to impose further checks on goods entering the UK from the European Union. The change means restrictions on the imports of chilled meats from the EU and border checks on plant and animal products will not be introduced in July. Instead, Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said a \u201cnew regime of border import controls\u201d will be established by the end of 2023. Taking the opportunity to kick import controls further into the future, Rees-Mogg has said it would be \u201cwrong to impose new administrative burdens and risk disruption at ports\u201d when costs are already rising due to the energy price shock and the Ukraine war. Instead, the Government is accelerating its transformative programme to digitise Britain\u2019s border, he explains. But in the meantime, goods from the EU will continue to arrive in the UK with minimal checks. Rees-Mogg told MPs in a statement: No further import controls on EU goods will be introduced this year. Businesses can stop their preparations for July now. We will publish a Target Operating Model in the Autumn that will set out our new regime of border import controls and will target the end of 2023. The move, he says, would save British businesses up to \u00a31bn in annual costs when importing goods. Federation of Small Businesses national chair Martin McTague has welcomed the latest delay: \u201cImposition of full import controls this summer would have meant yet another burden for small firms which are already wrestling with new trade rules and spiralling operating costs. However, the EU introduced full customs controls back in 1 January 2021, meaning UK exporters have faced extra red tape and trade frictions for 16 months now. EU firms will continue to sell goods into Britain without those rules. Here are the changes that now won\u2019t start in July: A requirement for further Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) checks on EU imports currently at destination to be moved to Border Control Post (BCP). A requirement for safety and security declarations on EU imports. A requirement for further health certification and SPS checks for EU imports. Prohibitions and restrictions on the import of chilled meats from the EU. And here\u2019s the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam: Energy companies in Europe are considering opening Russian accounts to pay for gas from Gazprom after Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime cut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria and insisted other countries must pay in roubles. Big gas distributors in Germany and Austria confirmed they were seeking ways to continue to make payments after Putin signed a decree at the end of March calling for a \u201cspecial procedure for foreign buyers\u2019 fulfilment of obligations to Russian suppliers of natural gas\u201d. The decree stipulates that non-Russian buyers of gas must open special \u201cK\u201d type rouble and foreign currency accounts at Gazprombank, the third-largest bank in Russia. Gazprombank was set up to be a service provider to Gazprom, the state-owned gas producer that has a monopoly on exports via gas pipelines to Europe. The German distributor Uniper and Austria\u2019s OMV confirmed they were considering how to comply with the decree. A spokesperson for Uniper, one of Germany\u2019s main buyers of gas from Russia, on Thursday confirmed it was in talks with Gazprom \u201cin close coordination with the German government\u201d over \u201cconcrete payment modalities\u201d, but that it would continue to pay in euros for now. \u201cUniper can say for its contracts: we consider a payment conversion compliant with sanctions law and the Russian decree to be possible. For our company and for Germany as a whole, it is not possible to do without Russian gas in the short term; this would have dramatic consequences for our economy.\u201d The Financial Times reported that companies in Hungary and Slovakia, as well as Italy\u2019s Eni, were also considering signing up for the accounts in the hope of securing continued supplies, despite the European Commission saying that doing so could breach sanctions. Here\u2019s the full story: Reuters has heard that some European traders have started to pay Russia for gas sales in roubles, while large clients have yet to do so. \u201cSeveral traders, maybe more than five, have startedpayments,\u201d one source said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media. The cost of living crisis, on top of the pandemic, drove company insolvencies in England and Wales to a 10-year high in the last quarter. Christina Fitzgerald, President of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3, explains that many firms are choosing to fold: \u201cThis has been the busiest quarter for corporate insolvencies since 2012 as firms who have struggled with the economic consequences of the pandemic are now having to deal with the sharp rise in inflation. These statistics provide further proof that while the Government\u2019s Covid support measures prevented an initial sharp rise in corporate insolvencies, the economic damage caused by the pandemic couldn\u2019t be mitigated away forever. \u201cThe main cause of the increase in corporate insolvencies this quarter is an increase in Creditors Voluntary Liquidations (CVLs), which are now at a level not seen for more than 60 years. It seems more and more directors feel they can\u2019t carry on trading and are choosing to close their business\u2019s doors before they are forced to. Fitzgerald adds that companies face a critical time: \u201cThe figures published today reflect the tough climate businesses have been operating in over the last quarter. At a point where many businesses needed a return to normality, rising fuel and energy costs have put them under additional strain, and the effects of the increased cost of living has prevented the spending boom many were hoping for from happening. \u201cAlthough the economy has largely returned to pre-Covid levels in many respects, and consumer spending has increased, rising inflation and stagnant wage growth have left many people unwilling and unable to spend money on anything other than the basics. \u201cBusinesses have also faced the end of the final set of Covid measures and creditors can once again issue winding-up petitions against companies for debts of \u00a3750 or more (with the exception of landlords with Covid rent arrears). Personal insolvencies have also jumped this year, to a three-year high, as the cost of living crisis leaves people unable to repay their loans. There were 32,305 individual insolvencies in England and Wales in January-March, which is a 17% jump on the previous quarter. It shows that household finances have been under rising pressure this year, as inflation rose to 30-year highs. Joe Cox, Senior Policy Officer at Jubilee Debt Campaign, says the UK faces a debt crisis. \u201cThe clear and alarming upward trend in personal insolvencies shows that a debt crisis is overwhelming UK\u2019s households. The government needs to stop burying its head in the sand and take urgent action by writing-down large amounts of problem debt to give millions weighed down by arrears a chance to reset their finances and rebuild their lives.\u201d The cost of repaying government support is also pushing some businesses to insolvency. Svend Pearce, founder of the Watford-based small business accountant and bookkeeper, Bficient, says: \u201cWhile it\u2019s pleasing the pandemic appears to be under control, the debt accumulated by many companies to stay afloat is substantial. Much of the assistance came in the form of cheap loans with a grace period to commence repayment after 12 months. It\u2019s sadly now payback time and the pain many businesses are now experiencing is real. Bounce Back and CBILS loan repayments are proving a significant drain on companies\u2019 working capital. Restructuring any business is equally not without cash drains and so many directors will conclude that the battle is simply too great, future prospects too bleak and that further loans would simply be pouring fuel onto the fire. Company insolvencies in England and Wales have more than doubled so far this year to the highest level in a decade. Surging costs and the withdrawal of some Covid-19 support packages have left firms struggling to keep afloat. There were 4,896 company insolvencies across England and Wales in January-March, the Insolvency Service reports, which is 112% higher than in Q1 2021, and the highest recorded since 2012. It was driven by a record number of creditors\u2019 voluntary liquidations, in which directors voluntarily put their business into liquidation in order to pay its debts. There were 4,274 CVLs in Q1, the highest quarterly level since the start of the series in 1960. This is the first full quarter since the UK\u2019s furlough scheme ended on 30 September 2021, while other schemes are being phased out. Hospitality firms also missed out on Christmas trading due to the Omicron variant, which would normally tide them through the January lull. Plus, companies across the economy are hit by increased commodity and energy prices, supply chain disruption, and a tightening cost of living squeeze. Samantha Keen, UK Turnaround and Restructuring Strategy Partner at EY-Parthenon, warns that many firms are seeing their margins being squeezed. \u201cLooking ahead, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see further waves of insolvencies among larger businesses as the impact of rising costs affects their bottom line. Businesses in sectors most affected by fluctuations in cost and supply chain pressures and changes in business confidence, such as retail, food producers, and high energy users \u2013 such as chemical and paper manufacturers \u2013 are likely to be most vulnerable. Nigel Fox, director in the restructuring and recovery services team at Tilney Smith &amp; Williamson, warns that companies could also face an economic downturn. Now that the government\u2019s measures to support businesses have ended, it is more important than ever for directors to regularly review their company\u2019s finances and prepare projections to ensure that they know where their business is likely to be heading so that they can take any corrective action that is needed before it is too late. For any directors who are worried about the financial position of their business, we recommend seeking professional advice as early as possible. The earlier that advice is sought then the greater number of options there will be for the business. The importance of directors paying close attention to the health of their business has become critical as a result of a number of factors. Inflation in the UK has now risen to 7%, the highest rate it has been for 30 years. In addition the rising price of energy for businesses, for which there is no cap, leaves them very exposed. Climate change, whether directly or indirectly, also threatens almost all industries. Whether these and other factors will result in the UK falling into recession later this year is unclear, but the slender growth of UK GDP by just 0.1% in February \u2013 below expectations \u2013 means that this cannot be ruled out. More work is needed to protect the financial system from shocks such as the Ukraine war and the Covid-19 pandemic, a senior Bank of England official warns. Sarah Breeden, the BoE\u2019s executive director for financial stability strategy, says these recent shocks have shown that the system remains vulnerable to panics. She cites the \u2018dash for cash\u2019 in March 2020 which hit government bond markets and drove up the cost of borrowing, and the links between energy and commodity markets and the real economy, shown clearly by the Ukraine war. In a speech at Lancaster University this morning, Breeden says: Let me briefly mention a few of the lessons from our experience in Covid-19. First the capital framework does not in practice support use of bank capital buffers in a stress as we intended. And that would have mattered a lot in the absence of the substantial government support for the corporate sector. Second, we need to change our approach to stress testing in a stress if we are to avoid those stress tests further amplifying any downturn. And third, in a shock of roughly half the size of the global financial crisis, it was only large-scale use of central bank balance sheets that calmed dysfunction in the system of market-based finance. We are continuing to learn through the Russia-Ukraine crisis too. We are exploring concentrations in, and interconnections across, energy and other commodity markets, the financial system, and the real economy, as well as the potential for feedback loops between them. And we have observed too that commodity markets are relatively opaque. We must now develop the macro-prudential framework to reflect the lessons from these recent stresses. Here\u2019s the full speech. Unilever has confirmed that more price rises are coming, as it is hit by \u2018extreme\u2019 increases in raw material costs. That would be on top of the 8% rise in prices in the first quarter of the year, as cost pressures began to mount. Reuters has the details: \u201cAs far as pricing and volumes, I think we are in unchartered territory,\u201d Chief Executive Alan Jope said on an earnings call. \u201cWhile we\u2019re acutely aware of the pressure on consumers, we believe that increasing prices in response to this extreme commodity cost pressure is the right thing to do.\u201d Analysts said prices were only going to go higher. Unilever\u2019s full-year costs \u201care going to quadruple versus a year ago. That\u2019s why the pricing needs to be so high, and that\u2019s why the price is going to go much higher,\u201d Barclays\u2019 Warren Ackerman said. \u201cThis is not the peak.\u201d \u201cThe worry is what will happen to volumes when pricing goes up more?\u201d In the first quarter, Unilever hiked prices the most in Latin America - by 16.4% - and in other emerging markets. As flagged in the introduction, Unilever now expects its input cost inflation would reach \u20ac2.7bn in July-December, a jump of \u20ac1.2bn on its previous forecast. The increase in oil, grain, other agricultural costs, and fertiliser following the invasion of Ukraine is hitting many consumer goods makers. Unilever, whose brands also include Knoor stock cubes, Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise and Magnum icecreams, is clearly exposed. And while it raised prices by over 8% in the first quarter of the year, sales grew 7.3% after volumes fell 1% as some customers shifted to cheaper, own-brand options. In China, authorities have said they are cracking down on price gouging as food shortages due to Shanghai\u2019s lockdown continue and fears in Beijing prompt a run on supermarkets. It comes as social media platforms shut down the account of a high-profile critic of the government\u2019s insistence on a traditional Chinese medicine product being rolled out to millions of residents. On Wednesday, the Ministry of Public Security pledged any individuals taking advantage of outbreaks to make a profit would be dealt with strictly, with fines of up to 3m yuan (\u00a3363,400). In Shanghai, one man faced administrative punishment for \u201cfabricating and disseminating price increase information and disrupting market price orders\u201d. The man was accused of buying produce and reselling it online at prices increased by up to 360%. Another was accused of renting someone else\u2019s business licence and selling produce and food online at inflated prices, making $230,000 (\u00a3180,000) in profit. Last month, Shanghai\u2019s market supervision authorities said they had already issued about 20,000 warning letters over price gouging. More here: Sweden\u2019s surprise rate hike could be a sign that the European Central Bank will lift its own interest rates from current record lows soon, experts say: Ima Sammani, senior FX analyst at Monex Europe, says the inflation outlook has worsened in Sweden (as in the UK!): Today marks a crucial day in Riksbank history as the central bank, which only moved out of negative interest rate territory in December 2019, embarked on its first interest rate hike since the pandemic. While timing the first rate hike in this environment has been a challenge for all central banks in the DM space, it has been all the more difficult for the Riksbank given their recent failed experiment of negative rates; the last thing the central bank wants to do is hike rates too early and risk having to enter negative territory again. However, with inflation having soared over the last months and several Riksbank policy makers including Governor Ingves having voiced concerns around the inflation outlook and accommodative policy, expectations for today\u2019s meeting were elevated. Price hikes on everything from detergent to food is hitting consumers hard and Unilever is expecting things to get worse as the year progresses, explains Laura Hoy, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: Here\u2019s her take on this morning\u2019s results: The group\u2019s already raised prices more than 8% to the detriment of volumes, but more hikes are on the agenda as inflation continues to bite. It seems we\u2019re willing to pay more for the things we missed in lockdown, like going out for ice cream, but beyond that Unilever\u2019s seen consumers pull back as their wallets are squeezed. This is expected to put a damper on margins moving forward as the group tries to find a balance between covering rising input costs and keeping customers from abandoning branded products altogether. Consumers are becoming increasingly comfortable with private label brands, and generic replacements are going to start looking a lot more acceptable as the pressure on household budgets continues to build. That\u2019s bad news for companies like Unilever, that rely on familiarity and consumer trust in order to charge a premium for their products. For now it seems the trade-off between volume and price is working, but that won\u2019t last forever. Plus, this opens the door for private labels and own-brands to pinch long-term consumers. If they\u2019re happy with their swap, they may never return even if they can afford to.\u201d Sainbury\u2019s CEO Simon Roberts says customers are starting to \u2018watch every penny\u2019 as the cost of living rises. Speaking to reporters following this morning\u2019s results, Roberts said: \u201cIt\u2019s early days, the first month with the (higher) fuel bills landing ... But we can see the early signs of customers being a bit more cautious, watching every penny, every pound.\u201d Energy bills soared this month because the price cap was lifted by 54%. Other bills also jumped too, such as council tax and telecoms bills. Sweden\u2019s central bank has unexpectedly raised interest rates, in another sign that policymakers are concerned about global inflation pressures. The Riksbank has hiked its benchmark borrowing rate from zero to 0.25%, and signalled that it could raise rates two or three more times this year. It says it acted to prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched in price and wage-setting, after it hit 6.1% the highest level since the 1990s. The rise in inflation last year was largely due to rapid increases in energy prices. But since the turn of the year, inflation excluding energy has also risen rapidly and has been significantly higher than the Riksbank\u2019s forecast in February. The outcomes indicate that the upturn is now broad and prices of goods and food as well as services are rising unusually quickly. European stock markets have rallied in early trading, as better-than-expected results from Facebook owner Meta reassure investors. In London, the FTSE 100 has jumped by 60 points, or 0.8%, to 7485 as it continues to recover from Monday\u2019s slump when fears over the global economy hit stocks. Banking group Standard Chartered are the top Footsie riser, up 12% after beating forecasts with a 6% increase in pre-tax profits. Across Europe, Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC are both 1.8% higher. Meta\u2019s shares are up 18% in pre-market trading, even though it missed revenue forecast last night, after it reversed its fall in daily active users. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor says, \u201cEuropean markets have opened in the green, with positive momentum carrying forward from the overnight session in Asia. Corporate reports are driving price action with a slew of earnings in the US and Europe. The FTSE 100 is pushing higher, inching closer towards resistance at 7,500 lifted by shares in Standard Chartered which are trading up double digits. However some of this positivity is being offset by disappointing results from Sainsburys which is languishing at the bottom of the UK index. And on Meta: Once the darling of the tech sector, Meta has fallen out of favour among investors, spooked by rising inflation and interest rates as well as its disappointing quarterly scorecard in February. Even after February\u2019s sharp gap lower, price action continued to see the stock push lower. Brexit is also a key factor keeping inflation high, according to Adam Posen, a former Bank of England policy maker. Posen warned yesterday that the impact of leaving the EU was a key factor why inflation is expected to remain high for longer in the UK. The ex-MPC member also said he\u2019d vote for a half-point interest rate increase to curb an upward surge in prices. Bloomberg has the details: The economist who heads the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, a prominent research group, said that 80% of the reason why the International Monetary Fund expects Britain\u2019s inflation to remain elevated for longer than its Group of Seven peers is the impact of its departure from the European Union on immigration. \u201cWe see a very large gap between the inflation rate in the U.S. and the inflation rate in Europe -- the U.K. ends up in between,\u201d Posen said at a conference hosted by the U.K. in a Changing Europe research group. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen a huge drop in migrant labor. When you look at the macro factors, it\u2019s very difficult to see anything other than the labor market issues. It really seems like Brexit has to bear a disproportionate role in explaining the inflation.\u201d UK firms have been warning of labour shortages for many months, with vacancies soaring over the one-million mark to record highs. Inflation is, though, a global problem, with energy bills and supply chain problems driving it to 40-year highs in the US. More here: Brexit Explains 80% of U.K. Inflation, Former BOE Official Says The UK government is set to announce a fourth delay to physical checks on fresh food imported from the European Union later today, having continually struggled to get the necessary technology or infrastructure ready since leaving the EU. My colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll explains: The Brexit opportunities minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg, is expected to frame the move as use of the UK\u2019s newfound independent powers to control the trade border since the departure from the EU and the single market. He is also expected to say it is a response to supply chain fears in a trading environment already hit by the Ukraine war and cost of living crisis. Banking group Barclays has warned that the cost of living crisis is hitting its customers. Reporting its latest financial results, chief executive C. S. Venkatakrishnan told shareholders that inflation, supply chain issues and higher energy costs are hitting people and companies: We remain focused on the impact higher prices are having on our customers and our small business and corporate clients, all of whom are facing far harder conditions this year as a result of inflation, supply chain issues and higher energy costs. We will support them through this difficult period wherever we can, and support the wider economy just as we did through the COVID-19 pandemic. But revenue rose 10% to \u00a36.5bn, beating forecasts, as Barclays\u2019 investment banking arm benefited from volatile markets amid the war in Ukraine. Our income growth was driven partly by Global Markets, which has been helping clients navigate ongoing market volatility caused by geopolitical and economic challenges including the devastating war in Ukraine, and by the impact of higher interest rates in the US and UK. Barclays reported that pretax profits dropped to \u00a32.2bn in the first three months of the year, down from \u00a32.4bn a year ago. That included \u00a3500m of \u2018litigation and conduct costs\u2019, including \u00a3320m set aside over a blunder in which it issued about $15bn more structured notes and exchange traded notes than it had registered for sale. The FT\u2019s banking editor Stephen Morris it was a \u2018messy quarter\u2019: Barclays has now put its share buyback plans on hold as US regulators probe the blunder. \u201cBarclays remains committed to the share buyback programme and the intention would be to launch it as soon as practicable following resolution of filing requirements being reached with the SEC.\u201d Shares in Sainsbury\u2019s have dropped over 5% at the start of trading in London, after it warned that profits will fall this year due to soaring inflation. Supermarket chains are locked in a fight to hold onto customers as prices jump. Earlier this week, Asda committed \u00a373m to cut or freeze prices on 100 products, while Morrisons says it will cut prices on 500 products. Sainsbury\u2019s says it is raising prices less sharply than rivals on some popular products, such as milk, eggs, bread, fish and meat. CEO Simon Roberts says: We have been able to drive more investment into lowering food prices funded by our comprehensive cost savings plans. As a result, we continue to inflate behind competitors on the products customers buy most often. Last week we announced the next bold phase of investment, lowering prices across 150 of our highest volume fresh products. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. A flurry of UK companies are warning today that inflation pressures are rising, intensifying the cost of living squeeze on consumers. Consumer goods giant Unilever, whose brands include makes Marmite, Dove soap and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream, has reported that input costs have \u201cfurther accelerated\u201d through the first three months of the year. It plans to pass these costs onto consumers - having already raised prices by over 8% year-on-year in the last quarter. With the Ukraine war driving up raw material inflation, Unilever now expects its costs in the second half of this year to rise by \u20ac2.7bn. That\u2019s up from a forecast of \u20ac1.5bn three months ago, and on top of input cost inflation of around \u20ac2.1bn in the first half. Unilever says: This period of unprecedented inflation requires us to take further pricing action with some impact on volume as a result. CEO Alan Jope explains the company is navigating \u2018unprecedented cost inflation\u2019, adding: Underlying sales growth of 7.3% was driven by strong pricing, with a limited impact on volume in the quarter. This performance was delivered against the backdrop of significant rises in input costs that have further accelerated through the first three months of the year, and the human tragedy of the war in Ukraine. While prices soared 8.3%, sales volumes were down 1% -- suggesting consumers may have sought out cheaper options as inflation hit household budgets. Unilever now expects full-year underlying sales growth to be towards the top end of its 4.5-6.5% guidance range, but the full-year underlying operating profit margin could be the bottom end of its 16-17% range. Supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s is also seeing the impact of rising costs, with the Ukraine war having driven up energy costs, and a wide-range of agricultural products including cooking oil and wheat. It told shareholders this morning: The year ahead will be impacted by significant external pressures and uncertainties. Sainsbury\u2019s warned shareholders that profits this year will be hit by soaring inflation and a fall in customers\u2019 disposable incomes. It now expects underlying profit before tax to fall to between \u00a3630m and \u00a3690m, from the \u00a3730m underlying profit in the last 12 months. Sainsbury\u2019s CEO Simon Roberts says it\u2019s been a year of unprecedented change: \u201cThe dreadful situation in Ukraine continues to have a profound impact. We\u2019re doing everything we can to help with the humanitarian effort, and are working to manage the supply chain impacts. \u201cWe have a clear long term focus on keeping prices low and we remain committed to helping everyone eat better, whatever the external environment may bring.\u201d Cost pressures in the hospitality sector are rising too. Whitbread, which runs the Premier Inns hotel chain, has warned that cost inflation this financial year is now expected to hit around 8%-9%, which is 1% higher than previously guided. Whitbread says it will use its \u2018pricing power\u2019 to offset these higher costs, along with cost efficiencies, and growing its estate. The firm has also returned to profit last year, with a pre-tax profit of \u00a358.2m - compared with a loss of around \u00a31bn - due to the easing of Covid-19 restrictions.

            "title": "UK economy slows more than expected as car production slumps",
            "date": "2022-04-11T07:19:39Z",
            "content": "UK economic growth slowed by more than expected in February as a slump in car manufacturing undermined a sharp recovery in holiday bookings after the easing of Covid travel restrictions. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product rose by only 0.1% in February, down from a monthly growth rate of 0.8% in January when the economy was recovering from the coronavirus Omicron variant. City economists had forecast a monthly growth rate of 0.3%. Overall, the economy was 1.5% bigger in February than its pre-pandemic level . Raising questions over the strength of the economy before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in late February, manufacturing slumped as car producers continued to struggle with sourcing parts amid global supply chain disruption and shortages of vital components. Activity in the sector fell 0.4% on the month, driven by a 5.4% drop in the manufacture of transport equipment and a 4.3% fall in computer, electronic and optical products, where disruption to the availability of microchips has hit production volumes around the world. Tourism rose strongly after the easing of pandemic restrictions led to an increase in people booking holidays in the UK and overseas, with growth of 33.1% for travel agencies and tour operators. The accommodation sector, which includes hotels, recorded a 23% rise in activity as more people travelled within the UK, contributing to the first month of positive growth for hotels and camping grounds since August. However, growth in the services sector of the economy slowed amid a drop in the health sector, largely reflecting a fall-back from high levels in the NHS test-and-trace and vaccination programmes in December and January when Omicron was at its peak. The latest snapshot comes as business leaders and economists warn that Britain will probably struggle for growth in the coming months as soaring energy bills and the rising cost of the weekly shop drags down consumer spending power. \u201cThe news that the economy was hardly growing at all in February suggests the economy had a little less momentum in the first quarter than we had previously thought,\u201d said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. \u201c[It] increases the risk of a contraction in GDP in the coming months as the squeeze on household real incomes intensifies.\u201d Thomas Pugh, an economist at the accountancy firm RSM UK, said February may be the last month of growth for a while. \u201cSurging fuel prices, slumping business and consumer confidence and supply chain disruptions will start to be felt from March and will really kick into gear in April when consumer energy prices rose by 54%,\u201d he said. Some businesses said disruption from the storms Dudley, Eunice and Franklin during the month had hindered trade, including in the building industry, restaurants and takeaways, hairdressing and beauty, and leisure parks and holiday centres. Some companies reported a positive impact, such as those in fencing, torch sales and temporary off-grid power. Reflecting the hit to the building industry as sites were forced to close and cranes became idle amid the disruption, output in the construction sector fell by 0.1% on the month. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the government needed to provide more financial support to companies and businesses to deal with rising cost pressures. \u201cFebruary\u2019s slowdown is likely to be the start of a prolonged period of considerably weaker growth as rising inflation, surging energy bills and higher taxes increasingly damages key drivers of UK output, including consumer spending and business investment,\u201d he said. It comes amid growing pressure on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, over his wife\u2019s tax affairs and criticism for his spring statement last month over a lack of action to help those most in need during the cost of living emergency. Sunak admitted the economy faced uncertainty, although he argued that \u00a322bn of support for the increased cost of living was being made available to households this year, as well as tax cuts worth \u00a31,000 for half a million small businesses. \u201cRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is creating additional economic uncertainty here in the UK, but it is right that we are responding robustly against Putin\u2019s unprovoked invasion,\u201d he said."

            "content": "Creatives in Ukraine are trying to harness consumer power in an attempt to keep the country\u2019s economy going amid the Russian invasion. Before the war began in February, Ukraine was known as a hotbed of creativity in fashion, art and design. Now its designers and artists are launching initiatives to support creatives with various websites that support Ukrainian brands. Earlier this month Angel for Fashion launched \u2013 a website with more than 30 Ukrainian fashion brands, ranging from the frills of Paskal to the modern tailoring of Elena Burenina. It was set up by Jen Sidary, a former Vivienne Westwood staffer who spent the pandemic in Kyiv, and the Ukrainian designer Alina Kachorovska. In a press release Sidary said Angel for Fashion \u201cwas created to mobilise the global fashion community and ensure Ukrainian fashion continues to thrive\u201d. She added: \u201cYou are supporting these companies with your purchase as the money goes directly to the brand.\u201d This follows other online resources, including Spend With Ukraine, which links to Ukraine-based businesses across everything from digital fashion to blankets and electric bikes, and the Ukrainian Emergency Art Fund, which allows people to donate three-month stipends to support artists. Bettter Community, set up by the former Vogue Ukraine fashion director Julie Pelipas, is a platform for those in the industry to hire photographers, stylists, makeup artists and others based in the country. Spend With Ukraine\u2019s founders, Yaroslav Azhnyuk and Andrey Klen, are clear about the power that comes from buying Ukrainian. \u201cArmies win battles, but economy wins wars,\u201d says Klen. \u201cProduct teams in Ukraine keep working while being shelled, displaced, and pressured \u2026 Backing Ukrainian-made businesses equals supporting the economy which nears our victory.\u201d Klen says the simplicity of the idea is essential. \u201cGlobal media and influencers are taking notice because the whole thing is very reasonable and logical \u2013 it\u2019s quite easy to support Ukraine with your purchase decisions.\u201d The fashion designer Anna October makes 90s-style slip dresses and knitwear and is featured on Spend With Ukraine. She agrees with Klen. \u201cAlmost all [Ukrainian brands] are operating now, so when buying a dress for the date, you can support the brand teams and Ukraine,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery brand is donating to different needs to support the country.\u201d For each Anna October sale, 30% is donated to the Children\u2019s Emergency Fund. These initiatives are primarily about helping Ukrainian creatives in a way that supports existing industries, and even provides some semblance of normality. \u201cProduct demand allows businesses to stay afloat and contributes to a very important financial balance,\u201d says Klen. \u201cLife goes on \u2013 investments definitely help with that.\u201d After leaving Vogue, Pelipas was in the midst of setting up an upcycling business \u2013 then the war began. She pivoted her website to become a platform for young creatives in Ukraine. This was partly prompted by her experience travelling to Paris early on in the war: \u201cIt was a very, very dramatic day for me because I witnessed this contrast between my worlds in Ukraine and, you know, the beautiful world of fashion.\u201d Bettter Community came about as a response to her international colleagues asking how they could help. \u201cThis will make it easy to help these kids on all levels,\u201d says Pelipas. \u201cIf they will feel that they have a job, they have a chance for their future.\u201d Klen says sustaining interest in spending with Ukraine is key. \u201cWe are seeing some indications of increased demand and frankly we want it to blow out. That\u2019s why getting the word out is so important. This programme is working and we\u2019ll take any help [we can get] to scale it.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-04-05T08:00:00Z",
            "content": "One recent Friday afternoon far-right militia figure Ammon Bundy started a live video feed on his YouTube channel in the wake of being arrested on trespassing charges at a hospital in Idaho, where he is running for governor. Bundy appeared disappointed to tell his followers what he believed the government was forcing him to do next. He looked down at the camera, wearing an open-collared shirt and his usual cowboy hat, and let out a sigh. Then he threatened a sitting Idaho judge, summoning his supporters to go to his home. Addressing his followers, he told them: \u201cI\u2019m calling on you to put off whatever you\u2019re doing tomorrow, and come to [the judge\u2019s] house \u2026 Patriot groups all across Idaho and around the country, I cannot try to hold you back any longer.\u201d What had excised Bundy so much was a child custody case. But what his actions really revealed was a troubling development in America\u2019s ever-more divided political landscape where far-right figures feel emboldened enough to threaten a judge, wield their followers against the institutions of the state and where an implicit threat of violence is increasingly present as they seek elected office. By the time Bundy made his remarks, his 17,000 YouTube subscribers were receiving near daily updates about a 10-month-old child near Boise, Idaho, who was taken into temporary protection from his parents after officials determined the child was suffering from severe malnourishment and in imminent danger. Diego Rodriguez, Bundy\u2019s campaign consultant and friend, is the grandfather of the child at the center of a controversy in which even the far-right deputy governor, Janice McGeachin, has become embroiled. An ultra-converative pastor, Rodriguez is emblematic of the Christian fringe pushing to create a US \u201ctheocracy\u201d in Idaho. Bundy railed against what he considered a \u201ckidnapping\u201d at the hands of the government. After an Ada county judge signed a warrant transferring temporary custody of the child to health and wellness officials, Bundy urged his followers \u2013 who are often armed \u2013 to physically descend on the judge\u2019s house, to the deep alarm of local police. It was hardly Bundy\u2019s first time in the headlines. Nor was it even his first time getting his followers to swarm an Idaho judge\u2019s home, following a similar call in 2021. Bundy and his family have long been established figures in anti-government folklore after leading an armed standoff at their ranch in Bunkerville, Nevada. For 20 years Cliven Bundy, Ammon Bundy\u2019s father, avoided paying grazing fees to the Bureau of Land Management, insisting that his cattle had more right to the land than the federal government. When armed federal agents were sent to confiscate the cattle for non-payment, hundreds of protesters and some armed militia members came to their support. Charges for Cliven and his two sons, Ammon and Ryan, were dismissed after a mistrial in which the federal prosecutor failed to turn over evidence and disclose the existence of surveillance camera footage and the presence of federal snipers in the area. Two years later in 2016 Ammon Bundy led a high-profile armed takeover and lengthy occupation of the Malheur national wildlife refugee, a sanctuary for birds in eastern Oregon. That year Ammon and Ryan Bundy were charged with conspiracy in federal court but again found not guilty. But Bundy has adapted to new times in US politics as the Republican party has lurched right under the influence of Donald Trump, and far-right militia groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers have dominated headlines, including after the January 6 assault on the Capitol. Bundy, however, has attracted far less attention as he built up a state-by-state-level, cell-like network that can host dinners to create a sense of community but also produce on-demand protesters. Bundy\u2019s People\u2019s Rights Network aims to form a coalition of militia members, anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theorists, preppers and other far-right travelers. Its size eclipses most far-right groups put together. And many experts see it as a real threat to democracy. \u201cThey\u2019ve repeatedly shown an ability to mobilize large number of armed far-right activists to threaten, harass, and intimidate public officials,\u201d said Devin Burghart, director of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, a non-profit that monitors the far right. While 2021 saw a retreat for many of the national far-right groups as they came under intense scrutiny from law enforcement, People\u2019s Rights Network grew last year by 53%. Today it has 33,000 members across 38 states, according to a report from the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights. \u201cAmmon Bundy, with People\u2019s Rights Network, was the first to grasp on to Covid-19 denial as a mobilizing vehicle. The first to galvanize militants to oppose Covid-19 restrictions and to meld together anti-vaxxers, paramilitaries, Proud Boys and others into a larger movement to protest and protect these kinds of efforts,\u201d said Burghart. Burghart says Bundy has shown the ability to radicalize people by \u201cengaging in local conflict. Whether that\u2019s showing up at vaccination sites and threatening healthcare providers or showing up at school boards and harassing school board members.\u201d In the case of the call for militias to descend on the Ada county judge\u2019s home, local police announced the baby at the center of the spat would be returned to the parents under stipulations agreed upon by the court. In a statement, Meridian police concluded with a plea: \u201cThere is no need to continue protesting or harassing our public health officials, police officers or anyone else involved.\u201d Bundy called off the protest. But within a week Bundy had announced a new rally \u2013 a potluck to recruit new members to the cause. \u201cAmmon Bundy is important because in many ways his efforts are a bellwether for where the paramilitary side of the movement is moving,\u201d said Burghart."

This completely overlooks the battle that took place between Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government and local authorities in the 1980s. A range of measures such as block grants and compulsory competitive tendering ensured that power was transferred to the centre. As this process has continued, it has become increasingly difficult for councils to undertake \u201cmunicipal pride\u201d-type projects, unless central government approves. Unfortunately, when they are not supported, local authorities are then criticised for being inefficient and wasteful. John Kirkwood Sheffield \u2022 Having studied art and architecture when I was at school in Sheffield in 1952-65, I enjoyed Oliver Wainwright\u2019s article about the city\u2019s Park Hill development \u2013 especially as our teacher included the topic in our subject matter. The wonderful theatre production Standing at the Sky\u2019s Edge, featuring Richard Hawley\u2019s splendid music, celebrates Park Hill and those who lived there through the decades. I felt privileged to have seen the debut of the production at Sheffield\u2019s Crucible theatre before the pandemic, and look forward to returning for a second helping this year. Hawley is, of course, a Sheffield lad too. Chris Bone Swaffham, Norfolk \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

            "content": "If, as your editorial suggests, we feel \u201cwe are governed by ministers who regard the rules as being for other people\u201d (\u201cChancellor has damaged faith in democracy\u201d, Comment), it is because they operate with the complacent condescension of Roman patricians, a group that governed by birthright and among whom Boris Johnson behaves like Caesar. It helps to explain what Andrew Rawnsley calls \u201cThe stench of entitlement now oozing from Rishi Sunak\u2019s home as well as Mr Johnson\u2019s\u201d (Comment). Rawnsley wonders whether Sunak was \u201cnaive, idiotic, complacent, cavalier or arrogant\u201d over his wife\u2019s tax affairs, but once we recognise that Tory ministers think of themselves not as a class but a political caste all becomes clear. Only those who believe that governing is their inherited prerogative could display the indifference, deceit and hypocrisy shown by cabinet ministers over the last two years, to which Mr Sunak has added his sense of outraged privilege. They see no wrong in ringfencing wealth in the midst of massive economic inequality. They are indifferent to criticism unless it might register in a ballot box uncomfortably close to home. They recognise no allegiance to the public they belittle, until it gathers periodically as an electorate. Paul McGilchrist Colchester, Essex Your view that people in Rishi Sunak\u2019s seat (Richmond, Yorkshire) may forgive his latest errors is interesting but decidedly partial (\u201cSunak\u2019s stunts and mistakes expose lack of political savvy\u201d, News). Many of his constituents have long noted that our local MP rarely misses an opportunity for self-publicity or situations that lend themselves to his seemingly insatiable need to hone the Rishi brand. Our local weekly paper invariably contains two to three \u201cnews\u201d items with photos of the MP. These are reinforced with his occasional personally financed glossy pamphlet. This latter publication has a rare and idiosyncratic style (no doubt confected by his private publicist) of using 30-40 self references to \u201cRishi\u201d over a couple of sides. Local people are not daft; they recognise spin masquerading as \u201cnews\u201d. The burghers of Northallerton may well wish to stay calm but many of us in the wider constituency are tiring of our MP\u2019s incessant thirst for publicity. Indeed, many of us believe he\u2019d do well to adopt the Kingsley Amis posture of believing less equals more. Gus Pennington Stokesley, North Yorkshire The silence of solar power Your claim (\u201cThree-quarters of Britons back expansion of wind power\u201d, News) has raised howls of protest in North Devon, where many hills are blighted by the noise and flicker of these giant protrusions. The countryside should not be industrialised in this hideous way. If, instead, every new-build, supermarket, car park, barn, shed and factory were to be compulsorily fitted with solar panels \u2013 silent, unobtrusive and comparatively cheap \u2013 it would be far better, alongside expanding offshore wind power that, as an island, we have in abundance. We must get to net zero fast, but not by destroying our land and skies. Amanda Craig Lifton, Devon Preventing more Grenfells You report (\u201cMinisters admit ignoring repeated warnings in the years before Grenfell\u201d, News) that Eric Pickles, Gavin Barwell and Stephen Williams, then government ministers, failed to consider the recommendations of the inquest into the Lakanal House fire. I was the solicitor for the families of the three women and three children who died in that fire. Will the Grenfell Tower inquiry consider stating that an obligation should be placed on government to at least make a reasoned response to recommendations made by coroners on safety to prevent future deaths? Louise Christian London N16 Flexible hours in the stone age Reading Sonia Sodha on working hours and the value of leisure time (\u201cCovid has shown flexible working is a benefit only for the privileged few\u201d, Comment) had me thinking of anthropologist Marshall Sahlins\u2019s essay, The Original Affluent Society, published more than 50 years ago, in which he demonstrated that for most of history our hunter-gatherer ancestors devoted three hours a day to fulfilling their basic needs, leaving the rest of the time free for social and cultural activities. Other studies indicate that medieval peasants probably enjoyed more leisure time than those of us living in modern industrial societies. Will Douglas-Mann Petrockstowe, Devon Operation Mincemeat\u2019s hero Given the resurgence of interest in Operation Mincemeat, now both a film and comedy musical (\u201cWar legend takes on a new identity for our times\u201d, Focus), it feels important to be precise about the nature of the enterprise and its cultural representation. One of the most remarkable theatre works I have experienced was the 2009 production Mincemeat, by Cardboard Citizens\u2019 Adrian Jackson and Farhana Sheikh. It focused notably on the homeless man \u2013 Glyndwr Michael \u2013 whose corpse made the venture possible. Despite his pivotal role, he was described by Ewen Montagu, who cooked up the plan, as \u201ca bit of a ne\u2019er-do-well\u201d. History might be written by the victors but it\u2019s important not to forget those whose bodies \u2013 literally \u2013 made that possible. Fully acknowledging those who came before us would surely make our \u201cfinest hour\u201d something to revisit. Gareth Evans, Whitechapel Gallery London E8 Rethink Thought for the Day On behalf of what I suspect are a number of your readers who profess a faith, I welcome Catherine Bennett\u2019s justified criticisms of recent contributions to Thought for the Day Radio 4\u2019s Today programme (\u201cI pray in vain for wisdom amid the platitudes of Thought for the Day\u201d, Comment). A number have been frankly embarrassing and serve only to discredit a faith-based view of the world. Assuming that it has to continue to be broadcast, it is time that it was opened up to contributions from those who espouse a non-religious approach. This would more truly reflect the society in which we live, give voice to currently unrecognised insights and refresh a tired formula. The Revd Stephen John Terry Hassocks, West Sussex"

            "date": "2022-04-30T18:05:59Z",
            "content": "The writer Sonia Purnell was sitting in a TV studio, just about to go on air, when the Conservative politician beside her leaned in close. And then, she says, he whispered in her ear a shockingly graphic slur about her sex life. It was meant, she believes, to embarrass and befuddle her just as the cameras rolled; as the author of a highly critical biography of Boris Johnson, she isn\u2019t popular with his supporters. \u201cI wasn\u2019t confident enough to just say \u2018this man just said THIS in my ear!\u2019 And yes, of course, afterwards I was a bit flustered,\u201d she remembers. What Purnell describes is an aggressively sexualised form of undermining that many women in politics have experienced down the years. For some it was male MPs mouthing obscenities across the chamber when they rose to speak \u2013 Labour women newly elected alongside Tony Blair in 1997 were greeted by Tory MPs shouting \u201cmelons!\u201d and making breast-juggling gestures, while Labour\u2019s Lisa Nandy has recalled an MP shouting \u201cknickers!\u201d when she went to sit down in a skirt \u2013 and for others, garish smears about their sex lives being spread behind their back. For some, it was a grope or grab. For Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, last week it was anonymous Tory MPs telling the Mail on Sunday that she liked to distract Boris Johnson by flashing her legs at him. But all are forms of sexual shaming, making it clear that no woman is so powerful she can\u2019t instantly be reduced to meat. And it\u2019s the long pent-up fury created by such treatment that finally bubbled over at Tuesday night\u2019s meeting between chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris and the 2022, a new Tory grouping set up by the former women\u2019s minister Maria Miller. Intended to discuss retaining women in politics, it turned into something far more cathartic after one MP accused a male colleague of watching porn on his phone in the chamber. The man was later publicly identified as Neil Parish, who on Saturday resigned after what he described as his \u201cmoment of madness\u201d. \u201cThe MP who complained, who is no shrinking violet, hadn\u2019t reported it until that moment \u2013 I think she was concerned about the pushback from colleagues,\u201d says one of those present. \u201cBut that\u2019s why at these meetings the frustration bubbles over so quickly, because people haven\u2019t voiced these things.\u201d A second woman promptly said she too had seen the MP watching porn at work. Heaton-Harris, says the source, was \u201cabsolutely stunned. We all were. I mean, I\u2019ve heard a lot of things, but I couldn\u2019t believe that.\u201d And then the floodgates opened. Once the story became public, the international trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan revealed that another ex-MP had pinned her against the wall and insisted she must want him because, he said: \u201cI am a powerful man.\u201d A Labour MP disclosed that an unnamed shadow cabinet minister once told her that women wanted to be her friend and \u201cmen want to sleep with you\u201d, although in cruder terms. Caroline Nokes, chair of the women and equalities select committee, said she had experienced \u201ctouching, staring, bullying\u201d and been cold-shouldered for speaking up. Secrets withheld even during Westminster\u2019s post-#MeToo outpouring of sexual harassment claims five years ago are tumbling out, amid concerns that reforms introduced following those scandals haven\u2019t lived up to promises. While at least 56 MPs have been reported to the new Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), users say it\u2019s slow and bureaucratic. Although the Conservative whip was removed from the MP Rob Roberts for making repeated and unwanted sexual advances to a male staffer and from David Warburton after allegations of sexual harassment (which Warburton denies), both still sit in parliament. There is irritation with what some see as a \u201cblokey\u201d culture in government that sidelines women, and deeper cross-party frustration that little seems to have changed despite years of painful revelations. The veteran Labour MP Margaret Hodge tweeted that after 50 years of campaigning for equality in public life, \u201cdemoralised doesn\u2019t even begin to cover how I feel\u201d. Parliament isn\u2019t quite the rowdy boys\u2019 club it was when I started out as a lobby reporter in 1997. Women political journalists were still a novelty then in a male-dominated world, routinely accused of flirting to get stories. (One afternoon as I hovered in the members\u2019 lobby, where reporters linger to chat privately with MPs, someone asked if I was enjoying \u201cplying my trade on the Reeperbahn\u201d, which is Hamburg\u2019s red light district). The irony is that it was female MPs and advisers, often patronised and briefed against by their own sides, who regularly proved the best sources; at least they took us seriously, and didn\u2019t fondle knees under the table. I still remember a farcical lunch with a senior Labour man, where I kept shuffling my chair out of reach as he shuffled his towards me. At one point he leered: \u201cWhat do you do that\u2019s dangerous?\u201d, to which I regret not saying, \u201chave lunch with men like you\u201d. The journalist Charlotte Edwardes has accused Boris Johnson himself of squeezing her thigh at lunch when he was editor of the Spectator in the 1990s, something Downing Street has denied. There were darker moments. One woman I knew had to physically fight off the Labour MP who shared her taxi home one night. A Tory wife explained matter-of-factly how she\u2019d learned which bottom-pinching members of her husband\u2019s constituency association to avoid being trapped by. More disturbing was an after-work drink with a Whitehall source who made me uncomfortable for reasons I couldn\u2019t articulate. I cut the evening short. He was later arrested on suspicion of rape. Then, as now, it was junior interns and researchers \u2013 women, and young men subject to unwanted advances by MPs \u2013 who suffered most, powerless to challenge men on whom their futures in politics depended. But for many of us, to complain seemed embarrassing, career-destroying, and almost as pointless as complaining about the weather, since it was everywhere. What I saw in parliament seemed little different to what happened in newspaper offices, or to friends in the City, or even at university in the 1990s where drunken rugby boys would whip their tackle out in the college bar at night. It was almost what we were conditioned to expect. Those expectations were thankfully changing by 2017, when the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment reached Westminster. Theresa May, by then PM, was publicly committed to bringing women into public life and took a firm line. Defence secretary Michael Fallon was forced out after the journalist Jane Merrick said he\u2019d tried to kiss her. Damian Green, one of May\u2019s oldest friends in cabinet, resigned after an inquiry \u2013 triggered by the Tory activist Kate Maltby accusing him of inappropriate advances \u2013 found he had misled newspapers about a previous occasion when porn was found on his work computer. A spreadsheet of supposedly \u201chandsy\u201d politicians compiled by junior Westminster women was leaked, and senior ones \u2013 including then leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom, Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips and Maria Miller \u2013 fought to support the victims and establish what would become the ICGS. But even then, not all complaints were taken seriously. One Tory MP went straight to the whips after being told that one of her male staff was sexually harassing other women, and had allegedly been \u201crubbing his genitalia on my telephone when I wasn\u2019t in the office\u201d. Although she sacked him, she says now, the evidence she handed over was ignored. \u201cHe was re-employed by another Conservative MP, up the corridor, literally 50 yards away from my office.\u201d If Westminster has a problem with women, it\u2019s hardly alone. Last week saw a fresh scandal in the music industry, with the former Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood facing seven separate allegations (which he denies) of sexual misconduct. Two months ago a report found police officers based at Charing Cross police station in London had joked about rape and beating their wives. More than a quarter of Britons were sexually harassed at work in the previous year, according to a 2020 Government Equalities Office survey. For all last week\u2019s debate over what makes Westminster unlike other workplaces, from late-night boozing in its bars to the lack of an HR department, perhaps equally striking are the ways in which it\u2019s similar. Even watching porn in public is now surprisingly widespread: the Commons women and equalities select committee warned in 2018 it was a \u201creal concern\u201d on public transport, recommending a ban. Asking around on Twitter, I heard grim stories of men openly using porn on rush-hour trains (sometimes with the sound up) and buses, in cafes and restaurants, in class at school, even on the public computers in libraries. Lord Bethell, the former Conservative science minister, told me he had challenged one offender on his morning commute and \u201cgot a \u2018whaaaaaaat\u2019 response\u201d, as if he was the one being unreasonable. But most women hadn\u2019t dared object. It\u2019s unclear whether publicly pawing through porn represents its sheer normalisation in some men\u2019s lives, or a creepier form of digital flashing deliberately intended to make women uncomfortable. But the chilling message it sends is that men can do whatever they like, wherever they like; that however far women think they\u2019ve come, they can always be pushed back into their boxes. It\u2019s that fear of fragile progress unravelling which seems to be driving anger at Westminster. One former Tory MP thinks things started sliding backwards during the parliamentary battle over Brexit, which saw bitter party infighting and a more rightwing, proudly \u201canti-woke\u201d faction of MPs in the ascendancy. \u201cThe party was very split, and the kind of one-nation Conservatives were fair game for all sorts of misogyny. It was all very blokey, and there was kind of a Praetorian Guard in the WhatsApp groups that felt very able to criticise and put down women who were making perfectly valid comments or raising concerns, making derogatory and false comments about women and leaking them to the press.\u201d Some also wonder whether the perception that ministers no longer have to resign for breaching the ministerial code, or the Partygate scandal, have emboldened rogues. \u201cJohnson creates a culture in which it\u2019s felt that whatever you do there aren\u2019t really any consequences, so I think that makes people do things they might not have tried before,\u201d says Sonia Purnell. A former minister argues, however, that the real problem is that cultures only change when that\u2019s continuously driven from the top, and lately that has slipped down the agenda. \u201cIt\u2019s not that [Johnson] wouldn\u2019t care about it \u2013 it would just never be a priority.\u201d If so, MPs across all parties now plan to make it one. \u201cWomen in politics are not victims,\u201d the Labour frontbencher Alison McGovern tweeted. \u201cChange will happen.\u201d And not before time."

            "content": "Angela Rayner has hit out at \u201csexism and misogyny\u201d in politics, as a storm of criticism erupted after a newspaper reported that she crosses and uncrosses her legs during prime minister\u2019s questions to distract Boris Johnson. Cabinet ministers including Johnson himself, and MPs from across the House of Commons condemned the Mail on Sunday report, which the chair of the House of Commons women and equalities committee, Caroline Nokes, a Conservative, called a \u201cdirty little story\u201d. The paper reported that unnamed senior Tories had \u201cmischievously\u201d suggested Labour\u2019s deputy leader deploys what it called \u201ca fully clothed parliamentary equivalent of Sharon Stone\u2019s infamous scene in the 1992 film Basic Instinct\u201d. The article quoted a Conservative MP saying: \u201cShe knows she can\u2019t compete with Boris\u2019s Oxford Union debating training, but she has other skills which he lacks. She has admitted as much when enjoying drinks with us on the [Commons] terrace.\u201d It also contrasted Rayner\u2019s background, as a former care worker who left school at 16, with that of the Old Etonian prime minister. Rayner is widely regarded as performing strongly when she stands in for the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, against the prime minister. Nokes told LBC the Mail on Sunday had a \u201clong track record of reporting misogynistic stories about female MPs\u201d. She said she had contacted the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, to ask whether the story\u2019s author, the Mail on Sunday political editor, Glen Owen, should have his parliamentary lobby pass revoked \u2013 and suggested her committee could examine sexism in political reporting. Owen declined to comment. In a series of furious tweets on Sunday, Rayner hit back against the anonymous briefing, saying she was a victim of \u201csexism and misogyny\u201d. \u201cI stand accused of a \u2018ploy\u2019 to \u2018distract\u2019 the helpless PM \u2013 by being a woman, having legs and wearing clothes,\u201d Rayner said. She accused Johnson\u2019s allies of \u201cresorting to spreading desperate, perverted smears in their doomed attempts to save his skin\u201d. \u201cHe and his cheerleaders clearly have a big problem with women in public life. They should be ashamed of themselves. I won\u2019t be letting their vile lies deter me. Their attempts to harass and intimidate me will fail,\u201d she said. Johnson tweeted on Sunday: \u201cAs much as I disagree with Angela Rayner on almost every political issue I respect her as a parliamentarian and deplore the misogyny directed at her anonymously today.\u201d The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, subsequently published an identically worded tweet. Reports on Sunday night said Johnson had contacted Rayner on Sunday insisting the \u201cmisogynistic\u201d claims were deplorable and not made in his name. The Conservative party chair, Oliver Dowden, also rejected the claims, describing them as \u201ctotally ludicrous\u201d. \u201cI like the Mail on Sunday and I enjoy reading it but I think it\u2019s a totally ludicrous story that I don\u2019t recognise,\u201d he said. The former leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom agreed, criticising the \u201ctotally unacceptable comments and reporting\u201d. The Johnson ally Conor Burns said the story was \u201ctruly poisonous,\u201d calling it \u201ctypical of the baseless stories planted by drunk nonentities puffing up their egos on the [House of Commons] terrace\u201d. Westminster has been plagued by claims of misogyny and sexual harassment in recent years, and many female MPs say they continue to face a sexist culture in their workplace. Some reports have suggested more than 70 MPs have been named in evidence to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme, which investigates MPs\u2019 conduct. Recent cases have included Bob Roberts, who was suspended after being found to have repeatedly made unwanted sexual advances towards an aide, and David Warburton, currently under investigation over sexual harassment and drug use. Rutland MP Alicia Kearns said: \u201cWhen women in politics are consistently demeaned and denigrated for their sex and appearance, misogynists across our country are empowered.\u201d Rayner last confronted Johnson at prime minister\u2019s questions in January, when Starmer was self-isolating with Covid. She challenged the prime minister over the cost of living crisis, pointing to his previous relaxed stance about inflation and asking: \u201cHow did he get it so wrong?\u201d Rayner sparked controversy at last autumn\u2019s Labour conference for describing the Conservatives during a party event as \u201chomophobic, racist, misogynistic \u2026 scum\u201d. In Basic Instinct, Stone plays a violent psychopathic killer, who in its best-remembered scene briefly flashes her vulva while being interrogated by a police detective played by Michael Douglas. The notorious moment was later declared the most-paused in movie history."

            "date": "2022-04-21T20:35:23Z",
            "content": "US Drug Enforcement Administration agents have extradited the Honduran former president Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez to New York, where he will face federal drug trafficking and weapons charges. Honduran national police delivered a handcuffed Hern\u00e1ndez to DEA agents at the Tegucigalpa airport just over two months after he was arrested outside his home on 15 February following an extradition request from the US Department of Justice. Hern\u00e1ndez, 53, left office on 27 January after two terms as president. Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York have accused him of accepting millions of dollars in bribes from violent drug traffickers in exchange for protection from law enforcement. He is charged with drug trafficking conspiracy and two related weapons charges, which carry a combined mandatory minimum sentence of 40 years in prison. Hern\u00e1ndez is expected to plead not guilty upon arraignment. He has repeatedly denied any involvement with drug traffickers, describing the allegations as lies made up by criminals who are trying to reduce their own sentences through cooperation. \u201cThis is revenge from the cartels, it\u2019s an orchestrated plot so that no government will confront them again,\u201d he said in a handwritten letter published last month. \u201cPart of that conspiracy has been a campaign of hate and misinformation. But it\u2019s evident, the contradictions of criminals, trial after trial, they lie and contradict themselves.\u201d Considered one of Washington\u2019s top allies in the region during his first term, garnering praise from US officials including the then vice-president, Joe Biden, the conservative president fell out of favour with Democrats following his questionable 2017 re-election and mounting drug trafficking allegations after the arrest of his brother, the former legislator Juan Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez, on the same charges in 2018. Tony Hern\u00e1ndez was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison. President Biden shunned Hern\u00e1ndez upon taking office last year, but has since embraced the new Honduran president, the centre-left Xiomara Castro, who was elected by a landslide in November in a vote considered a referendum on the eight scandal-plagued years of the Hern\u00e1ndez administration. The extradition of Hern\u00e1ndez \u2013 once untouchable in Honduras \u2013 presented an early test for the Castro administration, which came to power on a promise to fight drug trafficking and corruption. Over the past three years, the case US authorities were building against Hern\u00e1ndez became increasingly clear. Prosecutors named Hern\u00e1ndez as an unindicted co-conspirator in his brother\u2019s trial and two subsequent cases, including that of the former national police chief Juan Carlos Bonilla. According to the complaint filed against Bonilla, nicknamed \u201cel Tigre\u201d (the Tiger) for his fierce appearance and violent reputation, the former top cop allegedly protected drug shipments and carried out special tasks for the Hern\u00e1ndez brothers, including murder. He was captured on 9 March after nearly a year on the run and is likely to be extradited to New York in May. Hern\u00e1ndez had been protected from prosecution by US authorities because of a Department of Justice policy not to indict sitting presidents. But a warrant for his arrest was issued under seal within hours of his leaving office, and the request for his extradition was sent to Honduras three weeks later. In 2012, as president of the National Congress, Hern\u00e1ndez played a key role in the passage of a constitutional reform allowing Honduran nationals to be extradited to the US on drug trafficking and other charges. He often cited this as evidence of his innocence, stating that someone who worked to push extradition through Congress would not conspire with drug traffickers. Hern\u00e1ndez is the 30th Honduran to be extradited to the US. Organised crime has infiltrated politics across Latin America, but Hern\u00e1ndez is the first former president in the region to be extradited to the US to face drug trafficking charges. The case draws close comparison to that of Panama\u2019s former dictator Manuel Noriega, a general and de facto leader who was extradited to the US on drug trafficking charges following a December 1989 US military invasion that ousted him. Like Hern\u00e1ndez, Noriega was accused of double-crossing the DEA. He was convicted and spent almost two decades in prison."

            "content": "Democracy watchdogs and civil society activists in Serbia have warned that the country is sliding towards autocracy under President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, who was elected for a second term this month with a large majority. After a campaign marred by reports of widespread bribery, intimidation and gerrymandering, Vu\u010di\u0107 won 60% of the presidential vote. The outcome of the parliamentary and Belgrade city elections, however, is still unclear. The opposition is waiting for courts to decide whether balloting will be repeated in areas where they have raised complaints of severe irregularities. As a result, a new government will not be formed for several months. \u201cThe most likely situation is that Vu\u010di\u0107 will drag this process out and it will be chaos, and he always uses chaos to his advantage,\u201d said Bojan Elek, deputy director at the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy. \u201cHe is such a great calculator and strategist he is able to turn any situation to his favour.\u201d However, the war in Ukraine presents the president with a significant challenge, as Serbia is seemingly poised between its application to be a member of the EU and an instinctive alliance with Russia. The two countries have close historic, religious and cultural ties and Moscow has provided crucial support to Belgrade at the UN security council, blocking Kosovo\u2019s independence. Moreover, Serbia is totally dependent on Russian oil and gas. This week, Vu\u010di\u0107 accused Ukraine and an unnamed EU country of orchestrating a series of bomb hoax threats against Air Serbia planes. He did not provide evidence for the claim, which Ukraine called \u201cbaseless\u201d. But after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the signals coming from European capitals to Belgrade make it clear that Vu\u010di\u0107\u2019s balancing act is no longer viable. \u201cThey are asking for more harsh condemnation \u2013 this could be an easy win \u2013 and definitely to join some sort of sanctions,\u201d said Elek. \u201cHe will try to play it a little longer like this, but I think if he finally has to make a decision, the only rational choice would be to pick the pro-European side. They might decide to join packages of sanctions that would not hurt Serbia too much.\u201d The president was slow to condemn the Russian aggression, which was initially reported in pro-government tabloids as a Ukrainian invasion of Russia. Nor has Serbia adopted any of the EU\u2019s sanctions against Russia since the 2014 annexation of Crimea. But Serbian analysts believe the president is likely to join direct sanctions on Moscow if the war is still going on when his new government is finally formed. Despite a clear awareness of Vu\u010di\u0107\u2019s autocratic tendencies, Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen both made visits to Belgrade within a month of each other last year. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful but I can understand. The issue is that the EU doesn\u2019t see in the opposition a credible, strong enough partner,\u201d said Biljana \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107, an opposition MP with the newly formed green-left coalition Moramo (we must), which won 13 seats. She described a culture of endemic abuse of parliament by the ruling party, using as an example the 2018 budget, which was passed without debate after its MPs used hundreds of amendments to filibuster and block any questions from the opposition. \u201cUnfortunately they [European leaders] chose stability over democracy, which is really bad. It has also undermined the EU here in Serbia. People have become Eurosceptics, which is understandable.\u201d Stability in the Balkans is critically important to the EU, and in Vu\u010di\u0107 Brussels appears to have found a politician who can offer that. At the last election in 2020, Vu\u010di\u0107 secured 188 seats in the 250-seat parliament. This result was, however, largely because of a boycott by opposition politicians who were protesting against verbal abuse and sabotaging of parliamentary processes by ruling party MPs. \u201cThe situation in parliament was really bad. People from the ruling party were very verbally aggressive, it\u2019s insane the things they say about you,\u201d said \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107. Vukosava Crnjanski, the director of democracy watchdog CRTA, explained that in the absence of an opposition in parliament for the past two years, civil society figures were unwillingly thrust into the role. \u201cWe were constantly under attack,\u201d Crnjanski said, describing smear campaigns against CRTA and her personally in parliament and pro-government media. \u201cWhat we are seeing is a serious backsliding of democracy in Serbia, especially in the functioning of institutions, including parliament. In 2016, [the ruling party] started silencing every free voice in Serbia.\u201d Sofija Todorovi\u0107, a programme director at the Youth Initiative for Human Rights in Belgrade, said that far-right and nationalist groups are intimidating civil rights bodies with impunity. Todorovi\u0107 was attacked by nationalist football supporters at the Mir\u00ebdita, dobar dan festival in 2017, an annual event promoting cultural ties between Kosovo and Serbia that she helps to organise. After the assault, she was fined more than \u00a3350 for protesting during a speech made by convicted war criminal Veselin Sljivancanin at an event organised by the president\u2019s party. Serbia is one of four Balkan countries negotiating access to the EU. A 2021 report by the European Commission on its progress in areas of necessary reform noted an alarming lack of media freedom, assaults on opposition and civil society activists, corruption, organised crime and state control of police and judiciary. \u201cInflammatory language against political opponents and representatives of other institutions expressing diverging political views was still used during parliamentary debates,\u201d the report warned. \u201cThe nature of autocracy is that you can\u2019t go back, it\u2019s very difficult to \u2018de-autocratise\u2019 a leader, unless there is some huge external shock, which may have happened with the war in Ukraine,\u201d said Elek. \u201cIn order to stay on his path towards autocracy, Vu\u010di\u0107 needs the support of the west. Our fear is if he decides to turn his back on Russia, this will allow him to continue.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-04-21T12:06:26Z",
            "content": "The multibillionaire Russian oligarch Vagit Alekperov has stepped down as the president of the London-listed firm Lukoil after sanctions were imposed on him by the UK and Australia. In a statement to the stock market, Russia\u2019s second-largest oil company said Alekperov, who is on good terms with Vladimir Putin, had formally notified the company of his decision to resign on Thursday. Lukoil is among 27 firms whose shares were suspended by the London Stock Exchange in early March in order to avoid market turmoil. The Moscow-headquartered firm is not subject to sanctions. However, the UK government has said Alekperov was targeted because of his role in the Russian energy sector, including an 8.5% equity stake in Lukoil that was worth \u00a33bn before the shares were suspended. \u201cThrough his directorship of Lukoil, Alekperov continues to obtain a benefit from and/or continues to support the government of Russia by working as a director [\u2026] trustee, or equivalent, of entities carrying on business in sectors of strategic significance to the government of Russia, namely the Russian energy sector,\u201d the official sanctions list states. Lukoil\u2019s latest annual report detailing its tax payments to the Russian government do not appear to be available on the company\u2019s website. But archived copies show it contributed more than \u00a35bn to the Kremlin\u2019s coffers in 2020 alone. The sanctions imposed on Alekperov \u2013 whose personal wealth has previously been estimated at $20bn (\u00a315bn) \u2013 are likely to have made it harder for him to exercise his duties as the company\u2019s president. The British restrictions prevent him, or any boats or planes belonging to him, from entering the UK, where Lukoil has significant business interests. These include a supply agreement with the Stanlow oil refinery in Ellesmere Port in the north-west of England, which supplies 16% of the UK\u2019s road fuel and is ultimately owned by the billionaire Ruia brothers behind India\u2019s Essar conglomerate. Litasco, a Switzerland-based subsidiary of Lukoil, has a key trading relationship with Stanlow that involves the supply of oil products. The deal includes a trade credit facility that means Litasco could, in theory, claim ownership of Stanlow\u2019s oil terminal if Essar Oil (UK) were to default on payments. Alekperov, 71, is a former oil rig worker, born in Baku, Azerbaijan, who rose to become deputy oil and gas minister of the Soviet Union and later one of post-Soviet Russia\u2019s richest men. After the fall of the USSR, he took control of three large state-controlled oil fields and set up Lukoil, Russia\u2019s second-largest oil company behind Rosneft and the biggest that is not state-owned. He has frequently been pictured with Putin and was among a large group of oligarchs who were summoned to the Kremlin in late February, in the days leading up to the invasion of Ukraine. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 April 2022 to specify that recent sanctions against Vagit Alekperov were enacted by Australia, not the EU as earlier said."

            "date": "2022-04-30T15:13:11Z",
            "content": "Even though Donald Trump recently sparred with Mike Pence over whether the former vice-president could have done more to overturn Trump\u2019s loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race, Trump on Friday handed an endorsement to Pence\u2019s brother in an Indiana congressional race. Trump\u2019s endorsement of Greg Pence, who is seeking a third term as the US House representative for Indiana\u2019s sixth congressional district, is politically intriguing for a couple of reasons. It comes a little more than a year after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 and demanded \u2013 among other things \u2013 Pence\u2019s hanging. A bipartisan Senate committee has connected seven deaths to the attack, which delayed a joint session of Congress to certify Biden\u2019s win by several hours. And the endorsement comes a couple of months after Mike Pence, in a rare stand against the former president, rejected Trump\u2019s claim that Pence could have reversed Trump\u2019s election defeat during the joint congressional session that was temporarily interrupted by the Capitol insurrection. At one point that day, Secret Service agents tried to drive Pence away from the Capitol, where he was tasked with leading lawmakers\u2019 certification of the presidential election results. But Pence wouldn\u2019t leave, signaling his opposition to the mob\u2019s goal of keeping Trump in power, the Maryland Democratic congressman Jamie Raskin, who serves on a House panel investigating the Capitol attack, said recently. \u201cPresident Trump is wrong,\u201d Pence told the conservative Federalist Society in February, according to National Public Radio (NPR). \u201cI had no right to overturn the election. The presidency belongs to the American people and the American people alone. And frankly, there is no idea more un-American than the notion any one person could choose the American president.\u201d When asked later about his brother\u2019s remarks, Greg Pence stopped well short of agreeing with them, highlighting how reluctant Republicans are to speak out against Trump while it remains unclear how much power his still-coveted endorsements carry. \u201cI stand by my brother and always will, and I\u2019ll let him speak for himself about his remarks,\u201d Greg Pence told NPR, in part. Greg Pence earlier this month also voted against referring criminal contempt charges against Trump aides Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino to the US justice department. Congress ultimately ended up making the referral, saying Navarro and Scavino ignored subpoenas issued to them as part of the investigation into the Capitol attack that imperiled Mike Pence. That stance on Friday helped the former vice-president\u2019s brother net a statement from Trump reading: \u201cGreg Pence has my Complete and Total Endorsement!\u201d Trump also hailed the Republican congressman for opposing Biden\u2019s immigration policies on the southern border, keeping guns accessible, standing against abortion and supporting the military. Greg Pence\u2019s office did not immediately issue a statement in response to Trump\u2019s endorsement. The former oil executive and Marine Corps veteran is facing a challenger in James Dean Alspach in the Republican primary on 3 May. The victor would advance to an 8 November runoff against the winner of the Democratic primary, whose candidates are George Thomas Holland and Cynthia Wirth."

            "title": "Is Brazil ready for the next incarnation of President Lula?",
            "date": "2022-04-30T14:43:46Z",
            "content": "For weeks Hilton Acioli wrestled with the melodies and lyrics that would become the theme tune to one of the most remarkable political careers in recent history. Finally, one morning in the winter of 1989, something clicked. \u201cLula l\u00e1 \u2013 a star is sparkling. Lula l\u00e1 \u2013 the flourishing of hope,\u201d the Cat Stevens-loving Brazilian songsmith sang as he sat before his computer with a guitar. The subject of Acioli\u2019s ditty was Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a shoeshine boy turned union leader who was preparing to launch a once-unimaginable bid to become Brazil\u2019s first working-class president. \u201cI felt so excited,\u201d Acioli said of the moment he composed the unforgettable jingle for Lula\u2019s first presidential run. \u201cI called everyone on the campaign and told them: \u2018I think I\u2019ve nailed it.\u2019\u201d Lula\u2019s debut campaign ended in failure but Acioli\u2019s song, Sem Medo de Ser Feliz [Unafraid of Being Happy], became an enduring hit, providing the soundtrack as the bearded leftist continued his quest for power over the coming years. Lula lost two more elections, in 1994 and 1998, before finally triumphing in 2002 \u2013 a watershed moment for Latin America\u2019s largest democracy that ushered in almost a decade of historic social inclusion and poverty reduction. Many thought Lula\u2019s extraordinary poverty-to-power tale was over when he stepped down in 2010 with sky-high approval ratings and having been declared \u201cthe most popular politician on Earth\u201d by Barack Obama. When Lula was jailed for alleged corruption and barred from the 2018 election his political future looked in shreds. But allies say the chaos unleashed by the man who won that year\u2019s election, the far-right radical Jair Bolsonaro, and Lula\u2019s unexpected political rehabilitation last year, persuaded the veteran leftist to postpone retirement and return to the fray. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way he would flee from this mission,\u201d said F\u00e1tima Bezerra, a leading figure in Lula\u2019s Worker\u2019s party (PT) who has known him since its foundation in the 1980s. \u201cHe understands perfectly the danger we are facing,\u201d Bezerra said of the incessant authoritarian outbursts from Brazil\u2019s dictatorship-admiring president. \u201cWhat\u2019s at risk right now is democracy itself.\u201d On 7 May Lula, now 76, will formally announce his sixth bid for the presidency, at an event in S\u00e3o Paulo. Acioli\u2019s anthem is again on the playlist as a new generation of leftwingers look to bring the curtains down on Bolsonaro\u2019s ultra-conservative era. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to swallow the fact that Lula will be our country\u2019s next president,\u201d said Nanda Matinny, a 24-year-old actor, after dancing to a remixed version of Acioli\u2019s jingle at a pro-Lula rally near Rio. Matinny, who was five when Lula first took power in 2003, said the song made her feel nostalgia for a past she was too young to have known. \u201cI want to live through what I didn\u2019t live through before. I need to,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need this man to be elected to reconstruct Brazil.\u201d Tens of millions of Brazilians seem to agree, with polls giving Lula a substantial advantage over Bolsonaro, a former paratrooper who many blame for catastrophically botching Brazil\u2019s response to a Covid outbreak that has killed more than 660,000 people, as well as undermining democracy and devastating the environment. Felipe Nunes, the head of the pollster Quaest, said Lula\u2019s lead did not mean he was seen as an \u201cuntainted character\u201d or that voters had forgotten the major corruption scandals that marred his administration and that of his successor, Dilma Rousseff. But, unlike the incumbent, Lula was considered a dependable political expert who could bring stability. \u201cPeople are looking for someone who can sort out the economy. People are looking for the hope of having a decent quality of life once again,\u201d said Nunes. Many progressive Brazilians worry about the lack of generational renewal at the top of Lula\u2019s party, whose key figures are mostly now in their 60s or 70s. Lula will be 81 at the end of his term if elected. But the former president remains by far Brazil\u2019s best-known leftwing politician and \u2013 with no immediate heir in sight \u2013 the one best placed to defeat Bolsonaro. During an interview at his home in Natal, the seaside capital of the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte, Acioli expressed optimism Lula would be able to end four years of Bolsonarian misery in October\u2019s election. \u201cEverything suggests he\u2019s going to win,\u201d the 82-year-old composer enthused. Bezerra, Rio Grande do Norte\u2019s governor, said she was \u201cimmensely hopeful\u201d her friend would lead Brazil out of \u201cauthoritarian and obscurantist nightmare\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him and he\u2019s full of energy and raring to go,\u201d said Bezerra, 66, flanked by a red Lula banner stamped with the words: \u201cBrazil Happy Again\u201d. Yet recent weeks have suggested Lula\u2019s mission may be tougher than some progressives had hoped. With public anger over Brazil\u2019s Covid disaster apparently fading as normality returns, some polls have shown Bolsonaro gaining ground. Around the corner from Nat\u00e1lia Bonavides\u2019s headquarters in Natal, a graffiti artist has painted a pun on the president\u2019s name: \u201cAcabou-sonaro\u201d (Bolson-over). But Bonavides, the PT\u2019s youngest member of congress, urged the president\u2019s opponents not to underestimate him. \u201cEven after all the tragedies that have been caused over the last three years, Bolsonaro remains an extremely strong candidate,\u201d the 33-year-old insisted. Bonavides, who is one of the leading lights of Brazil\u2019s new left, said part of the danger was Bolsonaro\u2019s ability to use the state machine and federal funds to buy political support and win over voters. She also worried about the dissemination of fake news, whether Bolsonaro would accept the election result, and the poisonous political atmosphere that has gripped Brazil under its pro-gun president. In recent weeks the Donald Trump-admiring populist has billed the 2022 election as an epic war between God-fearing \u201cgood\u201d and communist \u201cevil\u201d leading some to fear violence. Bonavides feels the toxic mood more than most. Last year a rightwing television pundit who is close to Bolsonaro publicly declared that people like her needed eliminating with machine guns and urged her to stick to washing her husband\u2019s pants. A picture of Marielle Franco, the leftist Rio politician who was assassinated in 2018, hangs outside Bonavides\u2019s office \u2013 a reminder of the dangers of doing politics in 21st-century Brazil. But the young congresswoman vowed to persist. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m not afraid \u2026 but it\u2019s crucial we don\u2019t allow these things to paralyse us.\u201d Bonavides believed one of the keys to beating Bolsonaro was engaging with the urban poor who were worst hit by the economic fallout from Covid. On a recent evening she drove north to an abandoned railway depot that had been occupied by dozens of impoverished families Bonavides said had been plunged further into destitution by Bolsonaro\u2019s social policies, rising unemployment and inflation. \u201cEvery day new families are arriving. It\u2019s frightening,\u201d said one of the occupation\u2019s leaders, Matheus Ara\u00fajo, as families used mud-caked sheets of plastic and planks of rotting wood to build shacks in the dank warehouse around him. Outside, Bonavides pledged to help the squatters fight eviction and urged them to make the link between their plight and the policies of Brazil\u2019s current leader. \u201cThe Bolsonaros of this world have never done anything to grant people their rights \u2013 and they never will. Because rights aren\u2019t granted \u2013 they are seized,\u201d she shouted through a loudhailer, as an activist clutched a red flag emblazoned with the words: \u201cFora Bolsonaro!\u201d (Bolsonaro Out!). For all his excitement over Lula\u2019s comeback, the composer Acioli also sounded a note of caution, comparing the coming months to a political minefield. \u201cMany pitfalls lie ahead,\u201d the musician warned. \u201cEven now, there are so many lies that people still believe.\u201d Despite the scale of Brazil\u2019s coronavirus calamity and the corruption scandals that have blighted Bolsonaro\u2019s administration and relatives, the president has retained the unwavering support of about 25% of voters. Hardcore followers remain convinced their leader is spearheading a righteous conservative crusade to stop Brazil becoming a communist dictatorship under Lula. Thomas Traumann, a political commentator and former communications minister under the PT, said it was wishful thinking to imagine Bolsonaro stood no chance. \u201cLula is the favourite. It\u2019s 70-30. But that doesn\u2019t mean 70 always wins,\u201d Traumann warned, urging Lula\u2019s campaign not to underestimate the depth of anti-PT feeling and the association many still made between the party and economic crisis and corruption. Helio Oliveira, an air force reservist and pro-Bolsonaro activist in Natal, said he would consider leaving Brazil or moving to a remote part of the countryside if Lula won: \u201cHe\u2019s a bad character who lacks values.\u201d As he pondered the coming showdown, Acioli sat down on his veranda and began to perform the song he had written to launch Lula\u2019s first campaign more than three decades ago. \u201cUnafraid to be happy! Unafraid to be happy! Unafraid to be happy!\u201d he sang as he strummed his guitar. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate to talk about a saviour of the nation but that\u2019s kind of what it is. There is no one else,\u201d Acioli said. Bonavides was a baby when Acioli wrote his most famous ballad but, like millions of Brazilians, knows its lyrics by heart. She said it reminded her of how close Lula came to succeeding in his first presidential bid, and how close to reclaiming power he is now. \u201cIt\u2019s song that brings me great hope,\u201d she said, a portrait of her party\u2019s leader hanging on the wall behind her. \u201cBolsonaro represents the cesspool of politics and Lula represents hope,\u201d Bonavides said. \u201cLula \u2013 as [Salvador] Allende would say \u2013 represents the great avenues down which free women and men will pass.\u201d"
