            "date": "2024-07-11T17:47:38Z",
            "content": "On the face of it, it was a busy Nato summit, not short of outcomes: badly needed air defence systems and fighter jets for Ukraine and a commitment that Kyiv was on an \u201cirreversible path\u201d to membership \u2013 plus a cross-alliance warning to China for its discreet help to Russia as it continues its assault on Ukraine. Yet, behind the activity lurks the cliff-edge of the US election. In the Washington heat, the worry is not so much about Joe Biden\u2019s health, but the Democrats\u2019 ability to defeat Donald Trump in the November election. The reality is that Nato will struggle if the US is sceptical, fitful or unengaged. During the last Trump presidency, Nato survived by hunkering down, making minimal commitments during a period of less geopolitical uncertainty. This time, with a major war continuing on the edge of Europe, a dysfunctional Nato is not obviously an attractive option, but it nevertheless lingers. Karin von Hippel, the director general of the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said: \u201cEverybody is worried about Trump, everybody is worried about US commitments to Nato. Last time around Trump couldn\u2019t do much damage because he didn\u2019t understand how the bureaucracy works. But now he does.\u201d The plan had been for Biden to promote Nato, to Americans and to the world, at a summit in the US capital to mark the 75th year of the alliance. Speaking in the Mellon auditorium, the very room Nato\u2019s founding treaty was signed in 1949, Biden emphasised the alliance\u2019s durability could not be taken for granted \u2013 a point aimed at Trump. \u201cLet\u2019s remember: the fact that Nato remains the bulwark of global security did not happen by accident. It wasn\u2019t inevitable. Again and again, at critical moments, we chose unity over disunion, progress over retreat, freedom over tyranny, and hope over fear,\u201d the president said on Tuesday night. Yet at the same time, US media was dominated by concerns about Biden\u2019s health and fitness for the presidency, and while his speech was delivered forcefully enough, a lengthy struggle to tie a sash bearing the presidential medal of freedom on to the outgoing Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, was a graphic reminder of the problem. In the same speech, Biden announced that Ukraine would receive four new Patriot missile defence systems. However, the reality is that Ukraine has been asking publicly for extra air defence since April \u2013 a need tragically underlined on Monday when 44 were killed in attacks by Moscow, including the strike on a children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv. A day later, Denmark, the Netherlands and the US declared that the first of about 85 F-16 fighters were in the process of being transferred to Ukraine \u2013 more than 18 months after the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, began pressing for them. Few believe F-16s, as they arrive, can be a gamechanger in isolation \u2013 and though the hope is they can suppress attacks from air-launched glide bombs, they may at first be used to pick off Russian drones as they fly over Ukrainian airspace, a necessary but relatively basic task. Ukraine has received weapon systems from the west that nobody would have thought possible immediately after Russia first launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, but the political fanfare that greets each new arrival has so far been followed by relative disappointment on the battlefield. That risks reinforcing the idea that no amount of military aid can help Kyiv recover its lost territories and somehow win the war, though it misses the more important argument that without US military aid, Ukraine risks starting to lose. When fresh US aid was withheld by Trump allies in Congress for months in the spring, Ukraine first lost Avdiivka in February, then border territory near Kharkiv in May, before sufficient supplies started coming through. Nato allies in Washington did agree some positive diplomatic language on Ukraine\u2019s eventual membership, describing the country as on an \u201cirreversible path\u201d to joining in the summit communique. Artful though this was, however, in practical terms Kyiv is no nearer joining, and the reality is that Russia\u2019s invasion is now preventing Ukraine becoming a member, because Nato does not want to join in the war. A key tactic of the Biden White House has been to link concerns about China, one of the few bipartisan issues in the US, with Nato, traditionally focused on the Euro-Atlantic. That all 32 allies could agree on describing China\u2019s discreet supply of military components and chemicals to Russia as a \u201cdecisive enabler\u201d of the war in Ukraine was a success from the point of alliance unity, Von Hippel said. Such statements are unlikely to persuade Beijing to change its mind \u2013 \u201cThis is a hard nut to crack,\u201d Von Hippel said \u2013 but anything that puts off China from supplying weapons to Russia can be defined as a success for the west. Depending on the results of the US election, come the next summit in The Hague, a year from now, such moments of diplomatic unity may prove harder to coordinate."

            "content": "Keir Starmer says he respects Joe Biden\u2019s decision to pull out of the US presidential election, describing the 81-year-old\u2019s political career as \u201cremarkable\u201d. The UK prime minister said: \u201cI respect President Biden\u2019s decision and I look forward to us working together during the remainder of his presidency. \u201cI know that, as he has done throughout his remarkable career, President Biden will have made his decision based on what he believes is in the best interests of the American people.\u201d Starmer was among a number of British politicians who responded to Biden\u2019s announcement on Sunday evening, which came after weeks of pressure to quit due to concerns about his mental acuity and ability to beat Republican nominee Donald Trump. Rishi Sunak praised Biden\u2019s \u201clove for America and dedication to service\u201d. Writing on X, Sunak, who served as prime minister until the UK general election earlier this month, said: \u201cWorking with Joe Biden, I saw first-hand his love for America and dedication to service. \u201cOur partnership has led to significant achievements, including [military pact] Aukus, steadfast support for Israel and joint efforts in defending our people from Houthi threats. I wish him all the best.\u201d Boris Johnson, who was prime minister when Biden won the 2020 US election, paid tribute to the president\u2019s \u201cbravery\u201d. He wrote on X: \u201cI salute Joe Biden for the bravery of his decision and also for all he has done as president. \u201cHe has been a staunch Atlanticist and friend to Britain throughout his career and it was a privilege to work with him.\u201d Scotland\u2019s first minister John Swinney commended Biden for his \u201cselfless\u201d decision. In a post on X, he wrote that Biden had \u201cserved the people of the USA with devotion and total commitment\u201d. \u201cNow, in a typically selfless act, he steps aside to do what he thinks is right for his people. \u201cHe came to Scotland for Cop26 and made a powerful contribution. He has our best wishes for the future.\u201d Green party co-leader Carla Denyer said Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw from the presidential race was \u201ca true sign of leadership\u201d. She said: \u201cWe wish President Biden well and thank him for his many years of public service. \u201cThis cannot have been an easy decision for him. But to take a decision that is personally difficult, but that is in the public interest, is a true sign of leadership.\u201d She added: \u201cThe foundations of our democracy are under threat and this presidential election is a pivotal moment. All elected representatives must be able to undertake their democratic duties without facing the threats of violence. \u201cEqually, showing respect for democratic results is perhaps the most fundamental cornerstone of our democratic foundations. All leaders must now not just abide by our democratic principles but cherish and protect them at every turn. \u201cIt is abundantly clear that President Trump has no interest in this grave responsibility. My hope is that the Democratic party can find a suitable candidate that can take on this responsibility. \u201cIt\u2019s not hyperbole to say that the future of democracy relies on it.\u201d Former foreign secretary James Cleverly thanked Biden for being \u201ca great friend to the UK\u201d. In a post on X, he said: \u201cIt was a pleasure meeting President Biden as foreign secretary on his visits to the UK, especially at the signing of the book of condolence for Her Late Majesty. \u201cThank you for being a great friend to the UK as our two governments defended freedom and democracy around the world.\u201d"

            "title": "Kamala Harris makes history as whirlwind week upends US election",
            "date": "2024-07-27T09:00:21Z",
            "content": "The telephone line was a little fuzzy, and the voice on the end gravelly from several days of Covid isolation. Yet the poignancy of the message, and the moment itself, could not have been clearer: \u201cI\u2019m watching you, kid. I love you,\u201d the speaker said. Joe Biden\u2019s warmhearted call to his vice-president, Kamala Harris, at the Democratic party\u2019s campaign headquarters in Delaware on Monday marked a generational shift in US politics, a symbolic passing of the torch from parent to progeny. In terms of the 2024 presidential election race it was also a defining moment. Harris, a former prosecutor, state attorney general, California senator, and for three and a half years the 81-year-old Biden\u2019s White House understudy, was appearing for the first time as her party\u2019s preferred new candidate, less than 24 hours after her boss\u2019s stunning announcement that he would not seek a second term of office sent a seismic shock across the country. There followed what by any metric could be called a whirlwind week on the campaign trail in an extraordinary month in American history already notable for the attempted assassination of former president Donald Trump, the Republican party\u2019s candidate for the 5 November election. By Wednesday, Harris was addressing an historically Black sorority in Indianapolis as the Democratic presumptive nominee, having secured the support of enough delegates at the party\u2019s national convention in Chicago next month to clinch the nomination. It was the same day as Biden gave an emotional, nationally televised address from the White House explaining his decision to step aside \u201cin defense of democracy\u201d. \u201cI revere this office, but I love my country more,\u201d he said, urging the country to stand behind Harris. One by one, other heavyweight Democratic figures had stepped up to endorse her, culminating on Friday with the outsized backing of Barack Obama. The former speaker Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton, all 23 of the party\u2019s state governors, and elected officials from the most junior Congress members to Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, respectively the House minority leader and Senate majority leader, also gave their approval. \u201cWe are not playing around,\u201d Harris told supporters at the sorority gathering in Indiana on Wednesday. \u201cThere is so much at stake in this moment. Our nation, as it always has, is counting on you to energize, to organize, and to mobilize; to register folks to vote, to get them to the polls; and to continue to fight for the future our nation and her people deserve. \u201cWe know when we organize, mountains move. When we mobilize, nations change. And when we vote, we make history.\u201d It was a rousing speech from a politician who only three days previously was still in a supporting role, despite weeks of swirling speculation about Biden\u2019s future following his disastrous debate performance against Trump in June. But things moved swiftly once the president\u2019s decision to step aside was announced on Sunday afternoon. The Biden campaign apparatus, and election war chest of almost $100m (\u00a377.6m), became the property of a new entity called Harris for President (Republicans have vowed to challenge the funds transfer in court). And staff hastily drew up a new travel schedule for the vice-president, which saw her crisscrossing the country, including the Wilmington, Delaware, appearance on Monday, at which she acknowledged the \u201crollercoaster\u201d of the previous 24 hours. On Tuesday, she was rallying in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with the campaign message: \u201cWe\u2019re not going back\u201d to the \u201cchaos\u201d of the Trump years. On Wednesday, to Black women in Indianapolis, Indiana, she said: \u201cWe face a choice between two different visions for our nation: one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\u201d On Thursday, she told teachers in Houston, Texas: \u201cIn our vision, we see a place where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead.\u201d Also on Thursday came her first meeting with a foreign leader \u2013 Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 in her own right as a presidential candidate, not in a joint summit as vice-president. In a White House statement issued in her name, not Biden\u2019s, Harris condemned violence at Wednesday\u2019s anti-Netanyahu protest in Washington DC and the burning of the US flag. In forceful public remarks following the meeting , she also went further than Biden ever had to criticize civilian suffering in Gaza. \u201cI will not be silent,\u201d she said. \u201cIsrael has a right to defend itself \u2026 [but] we cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering.\u201d Activities behind the scenes, meanwhile, progressed every bit as quickly as Harris\u2019s front-of-house appearances. Fundraising operations cranked up, pulling in an all-time record $81m for any 24-hour period in presidential campaign history, a windfall for the newly branded Harris Victory Fund that surpassed $130m, mostly from small or first-time donors, by Thursday night. Seizing on enthusiasm from younger voters that polling found was conspicuously absent for Biden, or the 78-year-old Trump, Harris\u2019s team also released to social media its first campaign video. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2016 hit Freedom, the unofficial anthem of Harris for President, provided the soundtrack for a message countering what it says was Trump\u2019s \u201cchaos, fear and hate\u201d vision for the country. Harris has enormous appeal with generation Z, noted by backing from numerous youth organizations, including March for Our Lives, the student activist group formed in the aftermath of the 2018 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida. There could have been no better illustration than the declaration on X/Twitter by the British singer Charli xcx that \u201ckamala IS brat\u201d. Viewed by more than 53 million people, the simple message encapsulating a pop culture lifestyle delighted the younger generation and confounded their elders in equal measure. \u201cYou just got to go listen to that Charli xcx album and then you\u2019ll understand it,\u201d Florida\u2019s Maxwell Frost, the first gen Z member of Congress, told CNN. \u201cWhether it\u2019s coconut trees or talking about brat or whatever, the message is getting across to tens of millions of young people across the entire country, and across the entire world, and that\u2019s really inspiring.\u201d Wrongfooted by Biden\u2019s abrupt exit, and alarmed by polls showing Harris gaining ground or even surpassing Trump in popularity, the former president\u2019s campaign scrambled to find attack lines for their new opponent. At a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday, Trump tested insults including calling Harris a \u201cradical left lunatic\u201d and \u201cthe most incompetent and far-left vice-president in American history\u201d. Republican party acolytes have also been busy with racist attacks, accusing Harris, who has Black and Asian heritage, of being \u201ca DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] hire\u201d or \u201cunqualified\u201d for the presidency. Experts warn to expect an all-out attack of misogyny and racism on Harris as the election approaches. This week, however, while Harris\u2019s fledgling campaign took its first steps, it was sharpening its own knives. Framing the upcoming campaign as \u201cthe prosecutor versus the felon\u201d, it took swipes at Trump\u2019s 34 felony convictions on fraud charges, and in a searing missive on Thursday mocked the former president\u2019s rambling anti-Harris diatribe on a rightwing news channel by issuing a \u201cstatement on a 78-year-old criminal\u2019s Fox News appearance\u201d. The gloves are off. Now, with the first full, buoyant week of Harris\u2019s presidential challenge about to be in the history books, the question is whether the initial enthusiasm and momentum can be maintained through the gruelling 101 days left until the election. Harris and her team are confident it can. Contradicting the statement by the liberal British politician Joseph Chamberlain more than a century ago that \u201cin politics, there is no use looking beyond the next fortnight\u201d, they have their sights set not only on November\u2019s election, but the eight years beyond it."

            "date": "2024-07-26T09:00:48Z",
            "content": "Barack Obama has endorsed Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for US president, meaning the vice-president has now won the backing of all the party\u2019s politically active high-profile figures for her White House bid. The former president had conspicuously withheld his endorsement in the immediate aftermath of Joe Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw from the campaign, and was initially believed to favour an open nominating contest at next month\u2019s Democratic national convention in Chicago. But after Harris earned the backing of Bill and Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, a host of state governors and the most senior Democrats in Congress \u2013 as well as Biden himself \u2013 Obama has added his voice in what amounts to a major boost for the vice-president. The 44th president was joined by wife Michelle, the former first lady, in a phone call with Harris that was filmed and released by her campaign on Friday. In the video, Harris is seen listening to the Obamas on an iPhone in her right hand. \u201cI can\u2019t have this phone call without saying to my girl Kamala: I am proud of you,\u201d Michelle Obama says. \u201cThis is going to be historic.\u201d Barack Obama weighs in: \u201cWe called to say Michelle and I couldn\u2019t be prouder to endorse you and do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office.\u201d Smiling, standing near a vehicle, Harris replies: \u201cOh my goodness. Michelle, Barack, this means so much to me, I am looking forward to doing this with the two of you, Doug and I both. And getting out there, being on the road.\u201d She adds: \u201cBut most of all, I just wanna tell you that the words you have spoken and the friendship that you have given over all these years mean more than I can express. So thank you both! It means so much. And, and we\u2019re gonna have some fun with this too, aren\u2019t we?\u201d The endorsement comes as the Harris campaign, which has made a flying start, launches a \u201cweekend of action\u201d marking 100 days until the election with more than 170,000 volunteers and 2,300 events across battleground states. Obama was the first Black US president and is endorsing a candidate who, if she wins against Donald Trump in November, will become the first woman, first Black woman and first person of south Asian descent to serve as president. Harris has narrowed the gap with Trump in opinion polls, trailing him 48% to 47% among likely voters in a New York Times/ Siena College survey. Trump was leading Biden by six percentage points in this poll after their debate."

            "date": "2024-07-22T14:20:24Z",
            "content": "Ukraine will continue to reach out to Republicans and Democrats and avoid being sucked into US internal politics and a bruising probable contest between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, officials in Kyiv have indicated. Its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, paid a warm tribute to the departing Joe Biden on Sunday, thanking him for his \u201cunwavering support\u201d. He praised the US president\u2019s \u201cbold steps\u201d taken in response to \u201cchallenging times\u201d and Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion. \u201cHe supported our country during the most dramatic moment in history, assisted us in preventing Putin from occupying our country, and has continued to support us throughout this terrible war,\u201d Zelenskiy wrote on social media. He said he \u201csincerely hoped America\u2019s continued strong leadership will prevent Russian evil from succeeding or making its aggression pay off\u201d. Zelenskiy\u2019s administration has taken pains to pursue an even-handed approach to unpredictable and fast-moving events in Washington. Its top priority is to avoid being dragged into a US domestic political row, which could ultimately weaken its fight against Moscow. \u201cOur official position is clear. We are looking for bipartisan support,\u201d one source said on Monday, declining to answer what Harris \u2013 as presidential candidate or potential future president \u2013 could mean for Ukraine. The result of November\u2019s US election would not change Ukraine\u2019s international priorities, they added. The main one is an end to the war \u2013 not with freezing of current battlefield lines but with a \u201cjust\u201d settlement. This could only happen with strong US leadership and backing, they said. Additionally, Kyiv wants favourable decisions that would allow it to degrade Russian capabilities. The Biden administration has refused to allow long-range US weapons to strike targets inside Russia such as military airfields. These are being used to launch cruise missile strikes at Ukrainian cities; a children\u2019s hospital was hit this month in Kyiv. Zelenskiy has repeatedly called for these US red lines to be lifted, most recently in London where he met Keir Starmer and addressed the cabinet. It is unclear if a future President Harris would be more sympathetic to Ukraine\u2019s argument. Its military is already conducting regular strikes within Russia using long-range kamikaze drones. In April the Washington Post said Harris raised these attacks during a private meeting with Zelenskiy at the Munich Security Conference. She reportedly urged him to stop blowing up Russian oil refineries, arguing that this tactic drove up global oil prices and invited Kremlin escalation. The request \u201cirritated\u201d Zelenskiy and his top aides, the Post suggested. Harris has met Zelenskiy on five other occasions. Their last encounter took place in June at a peace summit organised by Ukraine in Switzerland, where she deputised for Biden. Their talks have been friendly and, it is understood, relatively brief. They also met in Munich in February 2022, a momentous period just before Russian tanks rolled across Ukraine\u2019s international borders. As vice-president, Harris has been forthright in her support for Kyiv. During the 2020 election campaign she condemned \u201cRussia\u2019s illegal occupation of Crimea\u201d, calling it a \u201cflagrant violation\u201d of post-1945 international norms. She opposed the six-month delay by congressional Republicans to a $61bn Ukraine security package. And she described Kremlin attacks on Ukrainian civilians as \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d. Despite frustrations over targeting, and the slow pace of arms deliveries, Kyiv\u2019s relations with the Biden White House have been warm. At the same time Ukraine\u2019s leadership has made pragmatic overtures to the Republicans. Speaking in April, the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told how Ukrainian deputies had wooed Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, by inviting him to a prayer breakfast. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow, or how political elites in the US will behave,\u201d Kuleba said. \u201cWhat we learned from the first tenure of Donald Trump as president is there is always a way out of any crisis. We\u2019ve been so many things since 2014 [when the war with Russia began] that, without exaggeration, we are ready for anything.\u201d Trump has famously boasted he will settle the Russo-Ukrainian war in a day. It is widely assumed that if he wins this autumn\u2019s US presidential election Trump will cut off aid \u2013 military and economic \u2013 to Kyiv. Ukrainian officials think this is a misreading of the situation. They say Trump is unpredictable and add that nobody quite knows what his Ukraine policy will be, if he wins. In 2019 the then President Trump rang Zelenskiy and urged him to dig up dirt on Biden\u2019s son Hunter. The phone call lead to Trump\u2019s impeachment. Last week, on Friday, the two men spoke again after Trump formally accepted the Republican party\u2019s nomination for president. Writing on Truth Social, Trump talked of Zelenskiy in glowing terms and said they had \u201ca very good phone call\u201d. It lasted about 20 minutes, it is understood. Zelenskiy began by asking Trump about the \u201cshocking\u201d assassination attempt against him in Pennsylvania the previous weekend. \u201cI wished him [Trump] strength and absolute safety in the future,\u201d Zelenskiy posted afterwards on X. He confirmed they had agreed to meet in person to discuss a \u201cfair and truly lasting\u201d peace."

            "date": "2024-07-06T08:25:15Z",
            "content": "The reformist Masoud Pezeshkian has pulled off a stunning victory in the Iranian presidential runoff, reflecting deep dissatisfaction with the direction of the country in recent years and opening potential new avenues of cooperation with the west. Pezeshkian won 16,384,403 votes to defeat the ultra-conservative Saeed Jalili, who received 13,538,179 votes, on a final turnout of 49.8% \u2013 a big increase on the record low turnout of 39% recorded in the first round. In the first round, Pezeshkian came top, defeating three Conservative rivals. The turnout included more than 1m invalid votes. Pezeshkian has been an advocate of letting women choose whether to wear the hijab and ending internet restrictions that require the population to use VPN connections to avoid government censorship. He said after his victory: \u201cThe difficult path ahead will not be smooth except with your companionship, empathy and trust.\u201d Under the slogan \u201cFor Iran\u201d, Pezeshkian had promised to be a voice of the voiceless, saying protests must not be met with the police baton. Although some regard him as naive in high politics, a large part of his campaign was deliberately framed around his personal integrity, as well as his absence from ministerial office for the past decade. There were immediate calls from his backers to release political prisoners from jails, a symbol of the pent-up demands he may struggle to satisfy. Pezeshkian faces a minefield in trying to bring about change, and although he has said he is loyal to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, he has also said he will resign if he feels he is being thwarted, and will then call on the population to withdraw from the political process. The precise powers of the president in the field of foreign policy are disputed, but Pezeshkian argued in successive, often acrimonious TV debates that he could not bring about change, including the lowering of 40% inflation, unless he could secure the lifting of some sanctions, which would require a less confrontational approach to international relations. During the campaign, he said Iran had found itself inside an economic cage as a result of its foreign policy, and needed to be more cooperative to see if sanctions could be lifted. His in effect running mate in the campaign had been the former foreign minister Javad Zarif, who negotiated the nuclear deal in 2015 that led to a lifting of sanctions before Donald Trump pulled the US out of the plan in 2018. Zarif said sanctions meant Iran had been bypassed. The stock market rose on the news of the reformist victory. Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator close to the supreme leader, had claimed Iran could thrive by building stronger economic ties away from the west. Far from Iran being a cage, he said, Iran was a sanctuary. Pezeshkian\u2019s victory is all the more remarkable since no reformist was allowed to stand in the last presidential election in 2021, and it was thought the high tide of Iranian reformism had long passed, with many voters convinced there was no point going to the polls since a \u201cshadow government\u201d took all the decisions. The repression of the \u201cwomen, life, freedom\u201d protests in 2022 only added to a sense that the path to change through the ballot box was closed. Many senior reformists from the green movement as well as political prisoners inside Evin jail had called for a boycott. But after Pezeshkian topped the first round \u2013 defying the rule of Iranian politics that reformists lose if turnout is low \u2013 his campaign team grew in confidence that he could win if more voters took part in the runoff. It also became clear that supporters of the more centrist conservative Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf were not going to transfer their votes to Jalili, with whom they had sharp ideological differences. Zarif urged the abstentionists to vote, saying: \u201cThose who did not participate in the first round, you sent your message in the first period, now you must complete your message with your presence.\u201d Another leading Pezeshkian backer, the former communications minister Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi, said: \u201cWe must prove the people are the people, not those who consider themselves guardians of the people.\u201d On Saturday evening, reformists became nervous that a sudden surge in late votes was a sign of the regime seeking to rig the result, something it has been accused of doing before. There were reports that government funds were being used to send clerics into rural villages to solidify support in Jalili heartlands. But then late on Saturday, government news channels leaked that Pezeshkian had won before the Iranian election headquarters declared him the official victor, sending his supporters into the streets of Tehran. About 5,000 had attended his final election rally in a football stadium in Tehran, suggesting his campaign might not have sparked the support he needed among abstentionists. After a quiet campaign in the capital, his jubilant supporters poured on to the streets of Tehran to celebrate a victory that few saw coming. In parliamentary elections earlier this year marked by low turnout, the conservatives trounced reformists. Ghalibaf\u2019s authority as speaker of the parliament has, meanwhile, been weakened by his defeat in the presidential elections. The political complexion of the parliament will be one of the many obstacles facing the new president since it has the power to impeach ministers. The first round of voting on 28 June had the lowest turnout in the history of the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution. Iranian officials have long pointed to turnout as a symbol of the legitimacy for the country\u2019s Shia theocracy, but Khamenei said those who stayed away from the polls had not done so due to opposition to the regime. The snap presidential election was caused by the death of Ebrahim Raisi, the incumbent, in a helicopter crash in May. Raisi had been seen as a potential successor to the 85-year-old supreme leader, and his death has thrown that succession into disarray. The decision is taken by an 88-strong body, the assembly of experts. The west will now have to make a judgment on whether to help Pezeshkian or maintain the blanket of sanctions due to the continued escalation of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, and its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels. Iran is enriching uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build several nuclear weapons, but does not yet have the warheads or missile technology. It is also providing Russia with drones for use in Ukraine. Pezeshkian\u2019s second foreign policy adviser alongside Zarif was a former ambassador to Moscow, Mehdi Sanei. The US state department said the election would not lead to any change in the US approach to Iran. The US officials pointed to the boycott of the elections by a large part of Iranian voters and wrote: \u201cThe elections in Iran were not free and fair. As a result, a significant number of Iranians chose not to participate at all.\u201d The statement added: \u201cWe have no expectation that these elections will lead to a fundamental change in Iran\u2019s path or greater respect for the human rights of citizens. As the candidates themselves have said, Iran\u2019s policy is determined by the leader.\u201d"

            "content": "Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has been declared the winner of Venezuela\u2019s presidential election by the government-controlled electoral authority. Venezuela\u2019s electoral council claimed Maduro had won with 51.21% of votes compared with 44.2% for his rival, the former diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia. Independent observers had described the election as the most arbitrary in recent years. The US vice president, Kamala Harris, said \u201cthe will of the Venezuelan people must be respected. Despite the many challenges, we will continue to work toward a more democratic, prosperous, and secure future for the people of Venezuela.\u201d Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said \u201cwe have serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people.\u201d Luis Lacalle Pou, the president of Uruguay, said: \u201cNot like that! It was an open secret that they were going to \u2018win\u2019 whatever the real results were.\u201d Colombia\u2019s foreign minister, Luis Gilberto Murillo, called for a \u201ctotal vote count\u201d in Venezuela, with \u201cits verification and independent audit to be carried out as soon as possible\u201d. Argentina\u2019s populist, firebrand president, Javier Milei, was characteristically insistent. \u201cGET OUT, MADURO, YOU DICTATOR!!!\u201d he wrote on X. Brazil\u2019s only observer of the Venezuelan election, Celso Amorim, the top advisor for president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, stated that the Brazilian government will only comment on the results after reviewing the records. Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, has stressed that \u201cthe people of Venezuela voted on the future of their country peacefully\u201d and \u201ctheir will must be respected.\u201d The British foreign office said \u201cwe are concerned by allegations of serious irregularities\u201d and \u201cwe call for the swift and transparent publication of full, detailed results to ensure that the outcome reflects the votes of the Venezuelan people.\u201d Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, congratulated Maduro, and the Kremlin said that Russia was working to deepen its ties with Venezuela. Ione Belarra, who leads Spain\u2019s far-left, anti-austerity Podemos party, has called for people to respect Sunday\u2019s result, saying \u201cthe right only goes along with democracy when it wins and that is unacceptable.\u201d Mike Pence, the former US vice president, has said Joe Biden \u201cmust restore sanctions immediately and rally the free world until Maduro is Gone and Libertad is Restored.\u201d Some political groups in the European parliament have also weighed in on their concerns about Venezuela\u2019s election. The Socialists and Democrats\u2019 Iratxe Garc\u00eda said \u201ctransparency is the essence of democracy.\u201d Nicola Procaccini, from the European Conservatives and Reformists, said \u201cit is highly curious that Nicol\u00e1s Maduro should be the winner of the elections in Venezuela when the polls blatantly predicted the opposite.\u201d Here\u2019s an image from Caracas today. The Associated Press reports that normally bustling western Caracas awoke as if it was a holiday, with several businesses shuttered. Eating a breakfast on a bench, 28-year-old Deyvid Cadenas told the AP he felt cheated. \u201cThe majority voted for the opposition,\u201d said Cadenas. \u201cI don\u2019t believe yesterday\u2019s results.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so happy,\u201d said Merling Fern\u00e1ndez, a 31-year-old bank employee. \u201cThis is the path toward a new Venezuela,\u201d added Fern\u00e1ndez, holding back tears. \u201cWe are all tired of this yoke.\u201d Brazil\u2019s only observer of the Venezuelan election, Celso Amorim, the top advisor for president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, stated that the Brazilian government will only comment on the results after reviewing the records. A former foreign minister, Amorim has been in Caracas since Friday and observed the voting yesterday. In an interview with the Brazilian newspaper O Globo, he mentioned that he is still familiarising himself with what happened: \u201cThe main issue is transparency.\u201d He added: \u201cThe (Brazilian) government continues to monitor the situation until we have the necessary data to make an informed decision (on whether or not to recognise the results), as with any election. \u201cIt must be transparent. I\u2019m not necessarily questioning what is being said, but the government was supposed to provide the records from which this number is derived, and that has not yet happened.\u201d The Brazilian Electoral Court had planned to send two additional observers to monitor the votes yesterday but abandoned the plan after Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed last week, without evidence, that the election in Brazil is not auditable. Reuters reports that Edison Research published an exit poll showing opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia had won 65% of the vote, while Nicol\u00e1s Maduro won 31%. Panama\u2019s president, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, posted on X that the country \u201cjoins the widespread rejection of the electoral result in Venezuela\u201d and that it \u201cwill take action both individually and collectively in favour of Venezuelan democracy.\u201d Once an ally of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Colombia\u2019s president, Gustavo Petro, has yet to comment on the election results in Venezuela. But his foreign minister, Luis Gilberto Murillo, posted on X a call for a \u201ctotal vote count\u201d in Venezuela, with \u201cits verification and independent audit to be carried out as soon as possible\u201d. \u201cThe international community and the Venezuelan people hope that transparency and electoral guarantees prevail for all sectors. It is important to clear any doubts about the results. This means that international observers and monitors should present their conclusions about the process,\u201d wrote Murillo. Ecuador\u2019s president, Daniel Noboa, is now calling for the permanent council of the Organization of American States to meet to discuss the situation in Venezuela. Venezuela\u2019s election is featuring in US campaign rhetoric. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s apparent re-election as Venezuela\u2019s president has been met with scepticism, suspicion and calls for a transparent and detailed breakdown of the vote in Sunday\u2019s controversial poll. Although the results, released by the government-controlled electoral authority, were immediately hailed by Maduro\u2019s allies in Latin America, they drew a guarded and often accusatory response from others in the region and farther afield. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Washington had \u201cserious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people\u201d. He said the international community was watching the vote \u201cvery closely\u201d and would react accordingly. An even more direct response came from Luis Lacalle Pou, the president of Uruguay. \u201cNot like that! It was an open secret that they were going to \u2018win\u2019 whatever the real results were,\u201d he said on X. \u201cThe process, right up to the day of the election and the count itself, was clearly corrupt. You can\u2019t recognise a win if you can\u2019t trust the forms and mechanisms used to bring it about.\u201d Argentina\u2019s populist, firebrand president, Javier Milei, was characteristically insistent. \u201cGET OUT, MADURO, YOU DICTATOR!!!\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cVenezuelans chose to put an end to Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s communist dictatorship. The data shows a crushing opposition victory and the world is waiting for the defeat of years of socialism, misery, decadence and death to be recognised.\u201d Milei said Argentina would not recognise \u201canother fraud\u201d and said he hoped Venezuela\u2019s armed forces would \u201cdefend democracy and the will of the people\u201d. Read the full story here. Germany\u2019s foreign ministry has said that \u201cthe announced election results are not enough to dispel doubts about the vote count in Venezuela.\u201d \u201cWe call for the publication of detailed results for all polling stations &amp; access to all voting and election documents for opposition and observers,\u201d it added. Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo, the president of Guatemala, has said that Venezuela deserves transparent results. \u201cWe receive the results announced by the CNE with many doubts,\u201d he said. Meanwhile in the US, several members of Congress have spoken out about the election in Venezuela. The Dutch foreign minister, Caspar Veldkamp, has said that \u201cthe Kingdom of the Netherlands is worried about the current developments and calls for full transparency in the electoral process and the handling of results.\u201d The vote \u2013 and its results \u2013 were being closely monitored across the Canary islands, which is home to an estimated 100,000 Venezuelans and a part of Spain with such tight migratory ties to the Caribbean nation that Venezuela is nicknamed the \u201ceighth Canary island\u201d. \u201cThe links across the Atlantic are so strong that you\u2019ll find a Canarian in any corner of Venezuela and a Venezuelan in any corner of the Canaries,\u201d said Agust\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez, the president of the UCVE Canarian-Venezuelan Union. Rodr\u00edguez said excitement was high even though a lot of exiled Venezuelans would be unable to vote in Sunday\u2019s election because the electoral register was out of date or because they had been unable to register to vote. But for all worries over how fair and transparent the election would be, he added: \u201cPeople are really hopeful here.\u201d The British foreign office has issued a statement on the situation in Venezuela calling for the publication of detailed results. We are concerned by allegations of serious irregularities in the counting and declared results of Sunday\u2019s presidential election in Venezuela. We call for the swift and transparent publication of full, detailed results to ensure that the outcome reflects the votes of the Venezuelan people. Compare and contrast Ione Belarra\u2019s comments with this from Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the leader of Spain\u2019s conservative People\u2019s party: Yesterday Venezuela voted massively in favour of peace and a transition to freedom. There are solid reasons to think that the result announced by the regime doesn\u2019t reflect how the people voted. That\u2019s why we, along with the international community, are demanding an audit of the process \u2026 Let\u2019s defend democracy. Among the many international figures weighing in on the situation in Venezuela was the US vice president, Kamala Harris. \u201cThe will of the Venezuelan people must be respected. Despite the many challenges, we will continue to work toward a more democratic, prosperous, and secure future for the people of Venezuela,\u201d she said. There is lots of interest in Venezuela\u2019s election in Spain. Ione Belarra, who leads the far-left, anti-austerity Podemos party, has called for people to respect Sunday\u2019s result, saying: More than a thousand international observers have taken part in the Venezuelan election. The people have spoken and their will should be respected. The right only goes along with democracy when it wins and that is unacceptable. Gabriel Boric, the president of Chile, has said that \u201cthe Maduro regime must understand that the results it publishes are difficult to believe.\u201d \u201cThe international community and especially the Venezuelan people, including the millions of Venezuelans in exile, demand total transparency,\u201d he added. Vicente Fox, a former president of Mexico, has said that \u201cthe people already decided\u201d in Venezuela. Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent, recently spoke to Venezuelans abroad to see how they were feeling ahead of yesterday\u2019s vote. A hint of the emotion felt by many of the hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans resident in Spain was evident in one of the placards on display at a pro-change rally in Madrid the Sunday before last. \u201cLa \u00fanica cola que quiero hacer es para patearte el culo Maduro!\u201d it read \u2013 \u201cThe only queue I want to join is the one to kick your arse, Maduro!\u201d Thabata Molina, a Venezuelan journalist who has been in Spain for three years after spending seven years in Panama, said the demonstration showed the widespread desire for a major political shift back home. \u201cI think Venezuelans who want a change in their country are really excited right now because it feels like the first time in a long time that we\u2019ve had a real hope for change,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the people who\u2019ve always been against the regime; there are now a lot of people who were chavistas for years but who are now feeling hopeless and impatient for a drastic change that will improve things in Venezuela.\u201d According to Tom\u00e1s Pa\u00e9z, a university professor who is the president of the Venezuelan Diaspora Observatory, Spain is estimated to be home to around 600,000 of the 9 million people who have left Venezuela over the past 25 years and headed to more than 90 countries. Pa\u00e9z said many people abroad still had trouble understanding what had happened in Venezuela under Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, pointing out that the country\u2019s economy had contracted by 80% between 2014 and 2021. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to explain what\u2019s been going on in Venezuela,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a university professor in Venezuela, I wouldn\u2019t be able to earn more than $50 a month \u2013 and the cost of a month\u2019s basic food for a family is $400.\u201d Sunday\u2019s election, said Pa\u00e9z, had raised hopes that \u201cthe country\u2019s deterioration could be brought to an end and the process of free reconstruction begun\u201d. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares, Spain\u2019s foreign minister, has called for respecting the will of Venezuela\u2019s voters. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has expressed concern that the announced results in Venezuela do not reflect the votes. Speaking in Tokyo, he said: We applaud the Venezuelan people for their participation in the July 28th presidential election. We commend their courage and commitment to democracy in the face of repression and in the face of adversity. We\u2019ve seen the announcement just a short while ago by the Venezuelan electoral commission. We have serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people. It\u2019s critical that every vote be counted fairly and transparently, that election officials immediately share information with the opposition and independent observers without delay, and that the electoral authorities publish the detailed tabulation of votes. The international community is watching this very closely and will respond accordingly. The Kremlin said today that Russia was working to deepen its ties with Venezuela, Reuters reported. Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, has congratulated Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, has stressed that \u201cthe people of Venezuela voted on the future of their country peacefully\u201d and \u201ctheir will must be respected.\u201d \u201cEnsuring full transparency in the electoral process, including detailed counting of votes and access to voting records at polling stations, is vital,\u201d he added. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has been declared the winner of Venezuela\u2019s presidential election by the government-controlled electoral authority. The result appeared to dash opposition hopes of ending his authoritarian, socialist rule after 25 years, and which was immediately challenged by rivals and several governments in the region and beyond. After a six-hour delay in releasing the results of Sunday\u2019s poll sparked an outpouring of international concern, Venezuela\u2019s electoral council claimed Maduro had won with 51.21% of votes compared with 44.2% for his rival, the former diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia. Independent observers had described the election as the most arbitrary in recent years, even by the standards of an authoritarian regime that started with Maduro\u2019s mentor and predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s campaign had generated a rare wave of optimism among millions of disillusioned citizens after a wretched decade during which the economy of the country with the world\u2019s largest oil reserves contracted by 80% and nearly 8 million people \u2013 almost a third of Venezuela\u2019s population \u2013 fled abroad.

            "date": "2024-07-05T04:00:58Z",
            "content": "Iranians vote today in the run-off round of a presidential election offering a choice between a veteran hardliner and a reformist who has backed pragmatic cooperation with the west \u2013 but against the backdrop of an expected low turnout that critics say reflects opposition to the Islamic Republic. Iran\u2019s two identities were on display in the final rallies of the campaign as the two presidential candidates offered contrasting visions of their country\u2019s prospects, focused on whether sanctions have trapped Iran or are just a broken western lever that can no longer inflict damage to the economy. The contest has become distilled into an increasingly sharp choice: on the one hand Saeed Jalili, for two decades close to the centres of power and the 85-year-old supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and on the other Masoud Pezeshkian \u2013 a reformist outsider with a subtle appeal. Jalili says Iran has bypassed sanctions. Pezeshkian and his effective running mate, the former foreign minister Javad Zarif, claim that sanctions mean Iran has been bypassed. Jalili\u2019s campaign used the giant Imam Khomeini Mosalla mosque for its final event \u2013 a slick hi-tech cinematic mass rally. From the atmosphere it would have been hard to have known that in the first round of the elections a week ago only 39% voted and Jalili had been beaten into second place with 1m fewer votes than Pezeshkian. Videos of the Jalili campaign broadcast on six giant screens gave the impression of a leader that is being mobbed and praised wherever he goes, while mini-drones ran along lines in the ornate roof transmitting footage of the crowd\u2019s enthusiasm as celebrities sang in Jalili\u2019s praise, including a female actor who argued the hijab empowers women. Traditional songs were sung and slogans chanted in praise for Qassem Suleimani, the former leader of the Revolutionary Guards Quds force killed in Iraq by the Americans. The crowd waved the flashlights on their phones when told Jalili was on his way and by the time there was a first glimpse on one of the screens of a shock of Jalili\u2019s white hair, the volume of cheering meant it took at least five minutes between him being hoisted by his bodyguards on stage and the opening lines of his speech. He said in his address that the election result would not affect Iran for just four years but possibly for 40, portraying his rival as a man that had no confidence in his own nation and repeatedly attacking Pezeshkian\u2019s claim that the country is trapped in a cage. \u201cThe nation does not see its country as a cage but like Martyr Suleimani it sees the country as a sanctuary. \u201cThe enemy knows that this nation is a civilisation maker and that it gets what it wants and can become a model for the world. The enemy admits Iran is the most powerful country in the region and if hundreds of rockets are fired at Israel, the enemy dare not respond.\u201d Pezeshkian\u2019s rally later that evening in the open air Haidarnia stadium was perhaps half the size \u2013 a younger wealthier crowd arriving independently on foot and willing to tell the heavy police presence they did not want the \u201cmorality police\u201d around here. Women and men mixed together in the stands and on the pitch, and hardly a single chador was in sight, even if most women wore the hijab. A heart surgeon with a record of opposition to the suppression of the women, life, freedom! protests after the death of Mahsa Amini, Pezeshkian knows he is entering a minefield if he is elected. He has staked a huge amount on his personal integrity to try to convince abstainers it is worth voting and that as president he can effect change. He knows voters\u2019 experience of eight years of Hassan Rouhani, an earlier reformist, was of a president seemingly powerless in the face of the so-called shadow government. \u201cIf I try my best and if for any reason I cannot fulfil my commitments I will withdraw and ask people to withdraw their votes and I will no longer take part in politics,\u201d Pezeshkian pledged. His supporters have argued on social media that abstention will only lead to worse censorship online, more girls being beaten, more professors fired and more migration of young people. \u201cThose who think they send a message by not voting are making a mistake. If your message was meant to be heard by the authorities it would have been heard by now,\u201d one said. Dr Ebrahim Mottaghi, the head of the faculty of law and political sciences at Tehran University, said he believed Pezeshkian would win, with a small increase in turnout. \u201cIt is like a domino because more people realise after the first ballot in which Pezeshkian came first that he can win the presidency.\u201d Khamenei on Wednesday rejected the claims that a 39% turnout was an expression of opposition to the system. Mottaghi\u2019s explanation was more subtle: that Iran was in a phase of transition. \u201cJust as there is a gen Z in US and the UK, there is a new generation here that criticise everything, and cannot match themselves with the patterns of politics and authority here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey live like in the novel The Stranger by Albert Camus, alienated and indifferent to their fate. Gen Z in the US support Gaza because the authorities support Israel, but Gen Z here are indifferent to the killing and genocide of the Palestinians. Discourse is no longer through the mosque or family but instead through social networks. Instagram is banned in Iran but 90% of young people use it. It has restricted social coherence throughout the Middle East. He argued many voters feel their vote makes no difference. \u201cAs in The Stranger, voters feel they have no power to choose so they become indifferent.\u201d"

            "title": "This Nebraska congressional district could be the key to the presidential election",
            "date": "2024-07-07T12:00:08Z",
            "content": "For Joe Biden and Donald Trump, the road to the White House runs through battleground states clustered along the Great Lakes, and in the fast-growing \u201csun belt\u201d of the south. But if the election turns out to be extremely close, the two candidates\u2019 fortunes may hinge on a few hundred thousand voters clustered in a single congressional district in the middle of the country. This lesser-known front can be found in Nebraska, one of only two states in the country, along with Maine, that allocate a portion of their electoral votes by congressional district, rather than giving all of them to the winner of the state. In 2020, Biden became the first Democrat in 12 years to win Nebraska\u2019s second congressional district, which encompasses the largest city, Omaha, and its suburbs. The pressure to win a majority of its voters is expected to be even higher this year, as Biden looks to fend off a resurgent Trump while reassuring Democrats that he can still do the job after his troubling performance in their first debate. While much of the candidates\u2019 attention is focused on the seven swing states expected to decide the election (Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia) the Biden campaign also counts winning the Nebraska district as among its priorities \u2013 so much so that some Trump allies are encouraging the state\u2019s Republican lawmakers to change their rules to ensure the former president wins the entirety of its electoral votes. \u201cI think the district is probably going to get more attention this time than it did even in 2020,\u201d said Ryan Horn, a Republican media strategist who splits his time between Omaha and Washington DC. Though Biden won its vote in 2020, the district was then not essential to his victory, since he also triumphed in all the battleground states that Trump had won four years earlier, albeit narrowly. But polls indicate the Democrat\u2019s standing with voters has weakened since then, and it is not difficult to imagine a scenario in which the race does come down to the urbanized and relatively diverse district spread across three counties on Nebraska\u2019s eastern flank. If Trump wins Arizona, Georgia and Nevada and a Republican-leaning district in Maine, but Biden wins the three traditionally Democratic Great Lakes states and Nebraska\u2019s congressional district, that would give the president the 270 votes he needs to clinch re-election. But if the Nebraska district flips to Trump, that would tie the candidates with 269 electoral votes each, and the House of Representatives would determine the election\u2019s outcome. Each state\u2019s delegation would get one vote, and Republicans would have the advantage: the GOP controls 26 delegations and Democrats 22, while two are tied. Unlike in the battleground states, there are few publicly available polls of the second congressional district\u2019s voters. In interviews, local Democrats and the Biden campaign sounded optimistic about the president\u2019s chances of once again winning what they call Nebraska\u2019s \u201cblue dot\u201d. \u201cTrump is too extreme for the second congressional district,\u201d said Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic party. The state began splitting its electoral votes in the 1992 election, and prior to 2020, the district had only once before supported a Democrat, giving Barack Obama a one-percentage-point victory in 2008. Four years ago, Biden beat Trump by a six-percentage-point margin in the region of more than 650,000 people, which in addition to African American and Hispanic communities includes many of the sorts of suburbs that have become key to Democratic victories nationwide. In March, second gentleman Doug Emhoff made a visit to Omaha focused on reproductive rights \u2013 an issue on which Democrats hope to rally voters nationwide, even in conservative states. The party is also backing efforts to get initiatives legalizing medical cannabis and protecting abortion access onto Nebraska\u2019s November ballot. It\u2019s unclear what infrastructure the Trump campaign has deployed in the district, and spokespeople for the former president did not respond to emails seeking comment. Republicans are the dominant party statewide, controlling the legislature, the governor\u2019s mansion and the entire congressional delegation, but the state party has been gripped by infighting ever since officials casting themselves as more aligned with Trump took over two years ago. Earlier this year, conservative activist Charlie Kirk pressured Nebraska lawmakers to support changing to a winner-take-all system for allocating its electoral votes. But a push to do that in the legislature failed, and though the Republican governor, Jim Pillen, said he was willing to reconvene lawmakers to implement the change, he will only do so if enough support exists for the measure to pass. \u201cI believe this practice is inconsistent with our constitutional founding, out of step with most of the rest of America, and signals disunity,\u201d Pillen wrote late last month, as he convened a special session intended to lower property taxes. \u201cI continue to await a signal that support exists within the legislature to justify a special session to address the winner take all issue.\u201d Malia Shirley, an executive director of the Nebraska Freedom Coalition, which was among the leaders of the takeover of the state Republican party, believes the GOP will ultimately come together to change the state\u2019s electoral vote allocation. \u201cIt\u2019s not about Trump, it\u2019s about conservative values, it\u2019s about the state of Nebraska, it\u2019s about doing what is best for Nebraskans,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cAnd, rest assured, if Democrats were in the position that we\u2019re in, they would not hesitate or even think twice to leverage the tools and the rules that are already in place to be able to further their agenda.\u201d Changing to a winner-take-all system has been debated by Nebraska lawmakers in the past, and has ultimately gone nowhere because of hesitancy by Omaha-area Republicans who see benefits to the district\u2019s economy from the political attention, Horn said. \u201cHistorically, there\u2019s always been one or two of these that just doesn\u2019t want to go along with this, because they know that, while it might be good for Republicans or Donald Trump in the short term, it\u2019s bad for the state in the long term,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the minute you go to winner take all is the minute that no one involved in a race for president gives a shit about the state of Nebraska anymore, because it\u2019s no longer in play.\u201d John Hibbing, a retired political science professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, predicts that if Trump or Biden\u2019s fate comes down to Nebraska\u2019s second district, \u201cit would be a disaster\u201d. While he views the outcome as unlikely, Hibbing said the concerted effort by Trump and his supporters to cast Biden\u2019s victory four years ago as illegitimate serves as as a poor omen for what would happen if the district were pivotal to the election outcome. \u201cIf they made a big to-do out of things when it wasn\u2019t close, what [is it] going to look like if it really should come down to just one district? I think it would be bad,\u201d he said."

            "content": "How the election works This is the 10th election for the EU parliament, in which all 720 seats will be contested and 361 seats are needed for a majority. No single political group is likely to achieve this target. Each country is allocated a number of MEPs based on the principle of degressive proportionality, meaning MEPs from larger countries represent more people than MEPs from smaller countries. The minimum number of MEPs from any country is six, while the maximum number is 96. The number of seats in the EU parliament has increased compared to the outgoing parliament, meaning that some of the seat change numbers need to be treated with care. France, Spain and the Netherlands each have two more seats. Poland, Belgium, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Slovakia, Ireland, Slovenia and Latvia each have one more seat. Within each country, the number of MEPs elected from each political party is proportional to the number of votes it received. While seats are allocated by parties within each nation, most MEPs then join a series of transnational political groups \u2013 there are now seven, from the rightwing ID group to the Left group \u2013 based on shared ideals. Each group requires a minimum of 23 MEPs from at least a quarter of EU countries. A month after the elections, the far-right ID group was dissolved and the new Patriots for Europe group was formed, with France\u2019s National Rally, Hungary\u2019s Fidesz and Italy\u2019s Lega being its largest parties. About these results Source: European parliament. Change figures are based on the outgoing parliament as of Friday 7 June 2024. Countries are grouped in regions according to the United Nations geoscheme. Results will be tagged with one of three notes, to indicate how final the seat projections are for each country: Estimate, when when voting is finished and there is an estimate of a country\u2019s results based on polling institutes; Projection, for when there is an estimate of the full EU parliament composition; Provisional, for when a country\u2019s official election authority has published its first voting results but the final result is not known, and when the full EU parliament\u2019s composition depends on such provisional national figures; Final, for when a country\u2019s official election authority has published full results; Constitutive, for when the full EU parliament\u2019s composition is officially confirmed. Although the seat allocations per party per country will be final once the count is concluded in each member state, the seats per parliamentary grouping at country and EU levels will be provisional until all parties have decided which, if any, parliamentary grouping they will join, which may take days or weeks."

            "date": "2024-07-03T17:40:02Z",
            "content": "Close results in constituencies at the election could be challenged in the high court because of delayed postal votes, experts have said. Caroline Morris, a barrister and reader in public law at Queen Mary University of London, said people could get a hearing if four constituents petition the high court arguing their vote could have had a material impact on the result. The prospect of legal challenges comes as thousands of voters have complained of not receiving their postal votes on time. In Scotland several councils have opened special units to provide duplicate ballot papers. Jane Golding, co-chair of the campaign group British in Europe, said members had complained about delays in postal proxy votes arriving. Pete Jones, a British citizen who lives in Switzerland with his partner and daughter, condemned the \u201cutter incompetence from those involved in the organisation of postal votes\u201d. Two of his family received their ballot pack on different days but he has yet to receive his, leaving him with no possibility of voting unless he flies back to the UK on Thursday. Morris said the system appeared to be under \u201ca great deal of strain\u201d, partly because of the compressed timetable for the election. A judge could open a fact-finding inquiry to assess whether a re-run of a vote should be called. In an egregious case a judge has powers under the Representation of the People Act 1983, part III to call for a new ballot straight away. While the bar is high and courts will not order re-runs in general, it is not without precedent, said Morris. In 1997, there was a re-run in Winchester when the Liberal Democrat Mark Oaten won with a majority of just two votes. After a legal challenge over an administrative bungle that left 54 ballot papers not stamped correctly, the high court ordered a fresh ballot and Oaten was elected with a majority of more than 21,000 seats. In 2015 Diane Abbott also faced a legal challenge after registration papers did not show up at polling booths, meaning some voters were denied their chance to participate in the election. However, Morris said the challenge was unsuccessful as it was deemed that a re-run would not have changed the result because she had a commanding majority. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard [to get a re-run] but not impossible. The court has to answer two questions. First of all, has there been a breach of electoral law? Then there are administrative irregularities and the court would have to establish what went wrong. \u201cBut the main question is whether the error made a material difference to the outcome of the election? If the loss of postal votes [is] in a particular constituency where the contest is very narrow, then it could make a difference.\u201d She also said the \u201ccompressed timetable\u201d for this election puts \u201cpressure on people to get things done quickly and when people do things quickly mistakes can be made\u201d. \u201cEven if everything is done correctly, and you are relying on a third party such as the Royal Mail and they make a mistake, the impact of that is compounded because of the lack of time,\u201d she said. Councils could not legally do anything before the deadline for candidates to register closed on 7 June, or complete list of ballot packs for postal voting until the deadline for applications closed on 18 June. They were able, however, to send out postal packs earlier to those who had registered for votes earlier or had long-term postal option in place, the Electoral Commission said. A South Ayrshire council spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of delays nationally with postal votes. \u201cThe delays have not been a result of local processes, and South Ayrshire council have taken urgent steps to ensure that, where possible, all residents can cast their vote on Thursday.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-08T05:00:27Z",
            "content": "The push for electoral reform in the UK has received a shot in the arm after the \u201cmost disproportionate election in history\u201d, according to campaigners and academics. Longstanding reform campaigners have become uneasy bedfellows with Reform UK\u2019s Nigel Farage in recent days after Labour secured a 174-seat majority with just 34% of the popular vote. \u201cThis election has thrown the spotlight on to the electoral system as the result was the most disproportional on record,\u201d said Darren Hughes, the chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society. \u201cWe have already had a growing chorus of calls for PR [proportional representation] in the aftermath.\u201d Farage said the first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system was \u201cunfair\u201d after Reform took 14.3% of the popular vote \u2013 making it the third biggest party by vote share \u2013 but won only five seats. The Green party received 6.8% of the vote for its four seats. \u201cI think these results will reinforce in people\u2019s minds the need for reform,\u201d Farage said. Some experts argue that PR has produced more social democratic politics in Wales and Scotland, but others say it could also be a pathway for extremist politics, as has happened in some places in Europe. Hughes said the major political parties and FPTP advocates could no longer use fears of the rise of extreme parties as an excuse to resist change. \u201cThe debate around electoral reform can often focus on which parties would benefit from which voting system, but the only people the electoral system should be biased towards is the voters,\u201d he said. If the UK used the additional member system of PR, used for the Scottish and Welsh parliaments, Reform would have won 94 seats across the country on Thursday and the Greens 42, according to the Electoral Reform Society. It noted that Labour and the Conservatives had received their joint lowest vote share on record, and for the first time four parties had gained more than 10% of the vote. The additional member system is a hybrid system under which half of a tranche of MPs are elected by FPTP and the rest by a proportional list system, where parties are allocated the remaining MPs on the basis of vote share. The Liberal Democrats under Ed Davey ruthlessly targeted resources at winnable seats rather than focusing on vote share. As a result, they won a record 72 seats, up from eight in 2019, despite a similar vote share of about 12%. One Lib Dem insider said: \u201cIt\u2019s not that we like first past the post. But it\u2019s fair to say that we had to use the system in front of us and play the board that was there.\u201d Analysis of the results at the cross-party pressure group Make Votes Matter found that 58% of voters did not choose their MP. The group\u2019s spokesperson, Steve Gilmore, said previous election results using FPTP had also been \u201cdisproportional and unrepresentative\u201d. In 2015 the Conservatives won a majority with 36.9% of the vote, and in 2017 they had to form a minority government with 42.4%. Then in 2019 they landed an 80-seat majority on a vote share increase of 1.2 percentage points. Gilmore argued that Thursday\u2019s result should still be seen as an outlier. \u201cA government has been elected on a third of the vote and they\u2019ve got two-thirds of the seats,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is pretty extraordinary, even by the discreditable standards of first past the post.\u201d In a referendum in 2011, a proposal on changing the electoral system was comprehensively defeated. Campaigners were hopeful that a Labour government could result in reform after delegates at the 2022 party conference, including from the major unions Unison and Unite, backed PR. Keir Starmer said during his leadership campaign in 2020 that the party had to \u201caddress the fact that millions of people vote in safe seats and they feel their vote doesn\u2019t count\u201d. Since then his official spokesperson has said he has a \u201clongstanding view against proportional representation\u201d. Insiders say there is growing support for reform among the Labour party ranks. \u201cMore progress has been made internally then at any stage before,\u201d Gilmore said. Martin Smith, a professor of politics at the University of York, said it was likely that self-interest would be the factor that would push the main political parties to change the voting system. \u201cThe more the party system fragments, the more disproportionate the electoral system becomes, and that fragmentation is not going to go away,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a point when both Labour and the Conservatives will see the current system as threatening their interests, and then they may start to think: \u2018OK, we need to change this.\u2019\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-01T00:04:03Z",
            "content": "This blog is closing soon but we\u2019ll back in a few hours with all the latest updates. In the meantime, here\u2019s a roundup of the key developments: Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally won about 34% of the vote in the first round of legislative election, exit polls showed, putting it in reach of becoming the biggest political force in the French parliament. The New Popular Front (NFP), a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, was projected to win around 29% of the vote, the exit polls showed, while President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Together alliance was on about 20.5%-23%. Nevertheless, national estimates for the first round may not reflect the final breakdown of seats in the national assembly, which depends on races in constituencies. Turnout was very high, with pollster Ipsos estimating that 65.8% of eligible voters cast ballots. Speaking after polls closed, Le Pen said French people had shown \u201cin an unambiguous vote \u2026 their wish to turn the page on seven years of the disdainful and corrosive [presidency]\u201d of Macron. Far-right figures from across Europe congratulated the National Rally. Sixty-five MPs were elected in the first round \u2013 a high number. These included 38 MPs for the far-right National Rally and its alliance with Eric Ciotti of Les R\u00e9publicains. That figure is more than double the number Le Pen had said she expected. Pressure was mounting during the evening from left and centrist figures for tactical voting in the second round next Sunday. Thousands took part in street demonstrations against the far right, including at the Place de la Republique in Paris, where barricades were set on fire and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, leader of the hard left France Unbowed party, addressed the crowd. Gabriel Attal, the prime minister and a Macron ally, said \u201cnot one single vote\u201d should go to the National Rally. \u201cThe stakes are clear: to prevent the National Rally from having an absolute majority,\u201d he said. M\u00e9lenchon said the left alliance would withdraw all its candidates who came third in the first round, saying: \u201cOur guideline is simple and clear: not a single more vote for the National Rally.\u201d However it is not so clear that Macron\u2019s centrist alliance will do the same. In a written statement, Macron called on voters to rally behind candidates who are \u201cclearly republican and democratic\u201d, which, based on his recent declarations, would include the NFP\u2019s more moderate leftwing parties but exclude candidates from France Unbowed. Attal had been due to sign a decree on Monday morning introducing new limits on unemployment benefits \u2013 a policy that had been attacked by the far right and the left \u2013 but decided to suspend the decree. Market reaction to Sunday\u2019s result was muted, Reuters reports, with the euro gaining around 0.23% in early Asia-Pacific trading. Fiona Cincotta, senior markets analyst at London\u2019s City Index, described relief that the result yielded \u201cno surprises.\u201d She said: Le Pen had a slightly smaller margin than some of the polls had pointed to, which may have helped the euro a little bit higher on the open. Attention now is on July 7 to see whether the second round supports an absolute majority or not. So it does feel like we\u2019re a little bit in limbo. President Emmanuel Macron, whose centrist alliance is trailing in third place in exit polls, was seen out and about on the streets of Touquet in northern France earlier, rocking something of an aviator look: A bit more analysis from professor of political science Fr\u00e9deric Sawicki at the Sorbonne. His tweet reads, For their own benefit, the dominant parties have been refusing to introduce proportional representation since 1988. The two-rounds majority vote has now turned against them; with a third of the votes the RN [National Rally] can in its turn win 50% of the seats. It\u2019s up to these parties to prevent if by forming a republican front. Some more images have come through to us via the wires of the Place de la Republique in Paris, where thousands of people have gathered to protest the first round election results that put National Rally in the lead: A bit of snap analysis from one of our regular commentators, Cas Mudde: French voters went to the polls for the first round of a snap legislative election. An estimate by pollster Ipsos put the far right National Rally and its allies in the lead with 33.2% of the vote. The estimate put the left wing New Popular Front at 28.1% and Emmanuel Macron\u2019s allies, Together, at 21%. Nevertheless, national estimates for the first round may not reflect the final breakdown of seats in the national assembly, which depends on races in constituencies. Turnout was very high, with Ipsos estimating that 65.8% of eligible voters cast ballots.

Here are more images from protests in Paris With the results of final counts still coming in from constituencies, 65 MPs have been elected in the first round \u2013 a high number. These included 38 MPs for the far-right National Rally and its alliance with Eric Ciotti of Les R\u00e9publicains. That figure is more than double the number Marine Le Pen had said she expected. Twenty-one MPs from the left alliance were elected in the first round, with two for Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist grouping. A majority of constituencies will face a second-round run-off. The hard left France Unbowed\u2019s Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon is now addressing a crowd at Place de la R\u00e9publique in Paris. In a sign of the far-right National Rally\u2019s historic surge, at least 20 of its candidates were elected to parliament in the first round on Sunday night \u2013 a higher number than the party had expected. Far-right candidates were elected in northern areas including l\u2019Aisne, the Somme and the Pas-de-Calais as well as in Burgundy. Marine Le Pen was re-elected in the former coal-mining town of H\u00e9nin Beaumont in the north. Marie-Caroline Le Pen, Marine Le Pen\u2019s older sister, is in a strong position for the second round run-off in the Sarthe, historically a stronghold of the traditional right. The French Union of Jewish Students has said \u201cdanger is imminent\u201d and called on candidates to withdraw from three-way races to help defeat the far-right \u2013 with the exception of races involving France Unbowed (LFI). Here\u2019s where the estimates stand, according to Ipsos. Estimates are indicators of the national political dynamics, but not necessarily of the final outcome of the election, which depends on races in individual constituencies. The prime minister, Gabriel Attal, had been due to sign a decree on Monday morning introducing new limits on unemployment benefits \u2013 a policy that had been attacked by the far right and the left. Attal announced on Sunday he had suspended that decree. To win one of the 577 seats in the national assembly in the first round, a candidate must get more than 50% of ballots cast, representing at least 25% of registered voters. This usually happens only rarely, although the 2024 election\u2019s high turnout has seen the number rise sharply to perhaps as many as 80. If no candidate in a constituency achieves that, the two highest scorers plus anyone else who collected at least 12.5% of total registered voters advance to a second round. In that round, the candidate who obtains the most votes is elected. The combination of the highest turnout since the 1980s and fewer candidates \u2013 4,011 against 6,290 in 2022 \u2013 from just three main camps (left, centre and far right) \u2013 means the second round of the 2024 ballot will feature a record number of \u201ctriangular\u201d contests. The situation is highly uncertain and will remain fluid until the actual candidates running in the second round become clear. With up to half the seats in the assembly potentially becoming three-way contests, the scope for an anti-National Rally \u201cRepublican front\u201d is clearly there \u2013 but the extent of inter-party cooperation will be critical, as will be voters\u2019 willingness to vote tactically. Read the full story here. The prime minister, Gabriel Attal, has suspended the publication of a government decree on unemployment insurance reform. Several thousand people gathered at Place de la R\u00e9publique in Paris where leading figures in the left alliance were due to speak out against the far right. Some people carried cardboard signs saying: \u201cBardella out\u201d. Some young people were photographed in tears. Street demonstrations also took place in cities including Strasbourg, Lyon, Nantes and Lille. \u201cThis evening, in the serious moment in which France finds itself, it is essential that, in each constituency, the Republicans block both LFI [France Unbowed] and the RN [National Rally],\u201d said Michel Barnier. Congratulations are coming in from Europe\u2019s far right. The far-right National Rally\u2019s surge since the last parliament election in 2022 is unprecedented. The party has taken almost 12 million votes in the first round, compared with the 4.2 million votes it took in 2022. Gabriel Attal, the prime minister and an ally of Emmanuel Macron, is speaking now. The lesson of this evening is that the far right is at the gates of power, he warned. The goal is to prevent the far right from governing, he said, telling citizens that no votes should go to the National Rally. He said the responsible move is for candidates in third place in runoffs to withdraw and support other candidates who defend the values of the republic. The stakes are clear: to prevent the National Rally from having an absolute majority. An ELABE estimate for BFMTV of the seat distribution puts the far-right National Rally at 255-295 seats and the New Popular Front at 120-140. But it\u2019s still early and we should treat these numbers with caution. And here are the updated estimations from Ifop \u2013 with the caveat that these numbers do not necessarily represent the final outcome in the national assembly. The hard left France Unbowed\u2019s Fran\u00e7ois Ruffin said \u201cthe candidates who come third must withdraw to beat the RN.\u201d \u201cNow the ball is in the court of Gabriel Attal and Emmanuel Macron,\u201d he said. The Socialist leader, Olivier Faure, was re-elected in Seine-et-Marne in the first round. Here are the latest Ipsos estimates. As always, these numbers should be treated with caution. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a former president of France who is running in the legislative election as part of the New Popular Front, said there\u2019s a need to prevent the far right from getting a majority in the national assembly. Here are some images from election night Edouard Philippe, a former prime minister, has called on citizens to vote for forces committed to liberty and respect for the rule of law. He said no votes should go to the far right National Rally and the hard left France Unbowed. In northern France, one of the most popular figures on the French left \u2014 the head of the Communist party, Fabien Roussel \u2014 has been knocked out in the first round by the far-right National Rally candidate, Guillaume Florquin. Here are the updated numbers from IFOP \u2013 with the caveat that these national estimates do not necessarily reflect the final results in the national assembly, given the races in individual constituencies. Far right National Rally: 34% Leftwing New Popular Front: 29.1% Emmanuel Macron\u2019s allies Together: 22% Marine Le Pen elected The far-right politician won a seat in the first round in her district in Pas-de-Calais. In recent French parliamentary elections, the vast majority of second-round contests have been head-to-head duels between the two leading candidates from the first round, with fewer than a dozen so-called \u201ctriangular\u201d run-offs. However, the combination of a very high turnout - estimated at nearly 70%, the highest since the 1980s - and fewer candidates (because they are concentrated into three main blocs, the left, the centre and the far right) means that number is likely to surge dramatically. The pollster Ipsos has estimated that there will be between 285 and 315 three-way contests, up to four times as many as the previous record in 1997. Traditionally, in triangular runoffs where far-right National Rally (RN) is in the lead, the third-placed candidate has pulled out so as not to split the opposition vote. The fact that nearly half the seats in the 577-seat assembly will go to three-way runoffs makes an estimate of the final distribution of seats in the national assembly extremely hard to predict and is likely to lead to frantic horsetrading. Senior figures in the left-green New Popular Front (NFP) alliance - including Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the firebrand leader of Unbowed France (LFI) - have already pledged that in all constituencies where RN finished first and the NFP candidate third, the NFP candidate would withdraw. Emmanuel Macron\u2019s camp, however, has so far been far less clear about what it would do in the same situation, promising only to examine each constituency on its merits. The president\u2019s coalition could yet decide not to stand its candidates down if they are faced with a candidate from LFI rather than one of the other three NFP members. The socialist party\u2019s Olivier Faure said this evening that \u201cfor the first time since the Second World War, the far right could govern the country.\u201d \u201cWe must block the RN in the second round,\u201d he said. The far-right National Rally\u2019s Jordan Bardella is speaking now, calling on voters to remain mobilised for next Sunday\u2019s second round. The choice is clear, he said, calling the far-left dangerous. Next Sunday, if his camp wins an absolute majority, Bardella said he would be a prime minister who focuses on purchasing power, restoring order and migration policy. It\u2019s a historic choice, he said, arguing that victory is possible next Sunday. Let\u2019s be mobilised for change, he added. Place Publique is calling for different groups to come together to defeat the far right, by withdrawing candidates in third place in three-way races in the second round. \u201cThe far right is at the gates of power.\u201d Today\u2019s vote is a defeat for the president\u2019s camp, the hard-left France Unbowed\u2019s Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon said. The New Popular Front is the sole alternative, he said. He also said that in cases where there is a three-way race in the second round, and that the left is in third place, they would withdraw their candidates to oppose the far right. \u00c9ric Coquerel, a candidate for the left-wing New Popular Front, said on BFMTV that Gabriel Attal won\u2019t be the next prime minister. He the second round will be between the project of the National Rally and the New Popular Front. Speaking to supporters just after the first estimates were published, the far-right\u2019s Marine Le Pen said democracy has spoken and said that citizens have shown they want to turn the page. But she also stressed the importance of the second round next week. There\u2019s a need for an absolute majority so that Jordan Bardella can become prime minister, she said. No French person will lose rights, she argued, calling for supporters to mobilise. The far-right National Rally\u2019s Marine Le Pen will soon address supporters after first estimates put her party in the lead. With polls now closed, first estimates have been published. Note that these numbers should be treated with caution: while these figures show broad election dynamics, they do not necessarily reflect the final outcome given that there are 577 constituency votes \u2013 and a second round next weekend. Here are the estimates from IFOP: Far right National Rally: 34.2% Leftwing New Popular Front: 29.1% Emmanuel Macron\u2019s allies Together: 21.5% Here are the estimates conducted for BFMTV: Far right National Rally: 33% Leftwing New Popular Front: 28.5% Emmanuel Macron\u2019s allies Together: 22% IFOP estimates that the final turnout will stand at 69%. Here\u2019s how that compares with previous elections. Our Paris correspondent, Angelique Chrisafis, has written a useful guide for what to expect this evening. Estimations at 8pm CET will project the national vote share of parties. But this figure must be taken with caution. It will show the broad dynamic of support for each party across France, but it does not indicate the shape of a future parliament because the 577 different constituency votes will be defined by local context and candidates. Polls have shown that, in terms of overall national vote share, the far-right National Rally could substantially increase its showing from the last parliament election, when it took just over 18%, to about 35%. The left alliance has been predicted to follow on about 27% and Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrists behind on about 21%. Read the full guide here. Turnout has been much higher today than during France\u2019s last legislative election in 2022. At 5pm local time, turnout stood at 59.39%, compared with merely 39.4% at that time in the 2022 election. Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist grouping was fighting for survival this weekend before the first round of France\u2019s high-stakes snap election, which could lead to the far-right National Rally (RN) becoming the biggest force in parliament. Macron, who warned last week that France risked \u201ccivil war\u201d if Marine Le Pen\u2019s anti-immigration RN, or the leftwing New Popular Front coalition, came to power, said at the European summit in Brussels that \u201cuninhibited racism and antisemitism\u201d had been unleashed in France. But his strategy of stoking a climate of fear, in which his centrists are presented as the only rational force to hold back the breakdown of French society, is seen as backfiring. Antoine Bristielle, the director of opinion at the Fondation Jean-Jaur\u00e8s thinktank, said that since Macron called the election, France\u2019s political future was extremely difficult to read. \u201cMacron is more and more unpredictable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s as if he\u2019s running the country like he\u2019s in a Netflix series \u2013 and has to put a cliffhanger at the end of each episode.\u201d Read the full story here. The last polls are scheduled to close at 8pm local time. Here are some images from election day in France. Jordan Bardella, a 28-year old member of the European parliament, is the far-right National Rally\u2019s candidate for prime minister. He has one of the biggest TikTok followings in French politics and never says no to a selfie with teenage fans. The son of Italians who arrived in the 1960s, Bardella is presented as a \u201cgood immigrant\u201d who embraced French culture and civilisation, which he now warns is under threat from what he calls Islamist ideology. He has taken a deliberately humble tone with voters, part of a strategy to deliver the final phase of Marine Le Pen\u2019s decade-long drive to soften the far-right party\u2019s image. Bardella does not seek to dilute the party\u2019s hardline anti-immigration message, which has not changed since the 1970s; instead he wants to make it respectable and fully mainstream ahead of Le Pen\u2019s fourth attempt at the presidency in 2027. Read more here. The last IFOP poll before the first round of the French election, published Friday, put the far-right National Rally at 36.5% and the left-wing New Popular Front at 29%. The same poll found that the far-right would take between 225 and 265 seats in the 577-seat national assembly \u2013 falling short of the 289 required for a majority - while the New Popular Front would take 170-200. Nevertheless, some other polls put the far-right in a stronger position, predicting that it could even win a majority of seats. A poll conducted for BFMTV put the far-right at between 260 and 295 seats. Good evening and welcome to the French election blog. Citizens across France went to the polls today for the first round of a snap legislative election unexpectedly called by Emmanuel Macron after his allies performed poorly in the European elections on 9 June, while the far-right won the most votes. The election is widely seen as a gamble from the French president, who is facing a presidential election in 2027. But polls ahead of today\u2019s election also put the far-right in the lead, with Macron\u2019s allies trailing behind in third place. A second round is scheduled for next Sunday, 7 July.

            "date": "2024-07-13T10:00:18Z",
            "content": "A low turnout, difficulties in polling ethnic minority voters, a surge in tactical voting and a late swing to the Greens are being examined by pollsters, after an election campaign in which Labour\u2019s vote share was widely overstated in the polls. It was perhaps the most polled election in British political history, with surveys consistently showing a Labour landslide and devastating losses for the Conservatives. While that is the overall result voters delivered on 4 July, Labour secured a lower vote share than polls had predicted. The polling average for Labour going into the election stood at about 39%, while Keir Starmer\u2019s party actually secured 33.7% across the nation. A detailed dissection of the discrepancy is planned, with a meeting in early September of British Polling Council members, the body representing pollsters, for a \u201csharing lessons\u201d exercise. However, pollsters already point to a number of small factors that might have combined to create the disparity. \u201cIt could just be one of those occasions where all the errors are small, but they all went one way,\u201d said Peter Kellner, the veteran pollster. The main factor pollsters cite is the relatively low turnout, which might well have disproportionately affected projections of Labour\u2019s vote share. The final Opinium poll for the Observer gave Labour a vote share of 40%. The company had already changed its models in an attempt to take account of a tendency for Labour\u2019s vote share to be overstated. \u201cThe thing that really wrong-foots polling is turnout,\u201d said Adam Drummond, research director and partner at Opinium. \u201cWe had turnout of about 60% \u2013 7 points down on last time. It could be that voters saw what the overall picture was and voted to get their desired results accordingly. \u201cTherefore, in places where it was a tight Labour-Tory contest, they voted Labour, while in places where it was probably a safe Labour seat and not in doubt, they felt able to vote in other ways, or not at all. Low turnout does seem to have disproportionately affected one party.\u201d Another problem appears to be the success of independent candidates, who focused on concerns about Labour\u2019s position on the war in Gaza. Several figures said that the polling industry simply did not have good enough surveys on the behaviour of ethnic minority voters, overstating the numbers in which they would vote for Labour. Luke Tryl, the executive director of the More in Common public opinion and polling company, raised the issue at a conference last month. \u201cI just don\u2019t think our samples across the industry of [Black, Asian and minority ethnic] voters are good enough,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw it a little bit in the West Midlands mayoral race. We all underestimated the share of the vote of [independent candidate] Akhmed Yakoob, who was standing on a more pro-Gaza, independent platform. He got more than twice as much as anyone predicted, so there\u2019s clearly something there.\u201d A late swing is also being examined, amid signs that some voters may have switched from Labour to the Greens in the final days. \u201cIt does seem from all of the evidence that there was a late breakaway from Labour among some of its voters, or some people not voting,\u201d said Tryl. The degree of tactical voting, apparently deployed by a record number of voters at the election, might also have further chipped away at Labour\u2019s vote share. Voters initially saying they would back Labour could have opted instead to support the Liberal Democrats in order to remove the Conservative in their area. \u201cIn 1997, the Tories lost 30 seats to tactical voting \u2013 20 to Labour and 10 to the Lib Dems,\u201d said Kellner. \u201cMy guess is that, when we look at this in detail, it was a much higher figure of 60, 70 or 80 seats [in 2024]. Whether the tactical voting websites played a role, I don\u2019t know \u2013 we didn\u2019t have that in 1997. But the degree of tactical voting was clearly huge.\u201d"

            "title": "Could the WhatsApp election hurt Labour at the polls? ",
            "date": "2024-07-02T09:00:39Z",
            "content": "When Keir Starmer was interviewed for the Sun\u2019s YouTube live stream last week, only about 10,000 people tuned in to watch him pledge to get tough on illegal immigration. Under pressure to prove he would speed up deportations, the Labour leader singled out one example in particular: \u201cAt the moment people coming from countries like Bangladesh are not being removed because they\u2019re not being processed.\u201d Two days later, Labour was in a panic: a clip of Starmer\u2019s comments, largely unremarked on by the dozens of journalists covering the Sun debate, was being forwarded thousands of times around Bangladeshi community WhatsApp groups. Amid anger from his own MPs and facing the resignation of several councillors, Starmer ripped up his campaign schedule to give an apologetic interview to the London-based ATN Bangla UK television channel. In some constituencies \u2013 often, but not always, with large Muslim populations \u2013 over the past six weeks a parallel WhatsApp election has taken place where the big issues have been Labour\u2019s policy towards Gaza and the party\u2019s tough talk on immigration. One Labour candidate in a seat with a large Muslim population said the Bangladesh video was a real problem for the party. \u201cThings are flying around WhatsApp in a way they didn\u2019t in previous elections,\u201d they said. \u201cWe\u2019re rebutting it on the doorstep but the correction doesn\u2019t fly on WhatsApp. \u201cWhen they hear the reply it\u2019s quite powerful \u2013 Keir Starmer\u2019s first trip was to Bangladesh. We\u2019re just trying to get people in the know in the community to spread the word.\u201d Dr Patr\u00edcia Rossini of the University of Glasgow, who has studied the effect of WhatsApp on elections in her native Brazil, said the messaging app is a \u201ccompletely hidden information environment\u201d, which can lead to big surprises when votes are counted. \u201cIt\u2019s virtually impossible to factcheck or remove content once it\u2019s gone viral,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even possible to know how viral something has become.\u201d She said people are more likely to trust text, memes and videos forwarded by people they know, adding: \u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating to me about WhatsApp is there\u2019s no algorithmic amplification. It\u2019s entirely driven by people and peers.\u201d As a result, if there is one big unknown before Thursday\u2019s election, it is whether Labour\u2019s success in winning over former Tory voters across the country will be undermined by the loss of some previously safe seats \u2013 where campaign activity is often driven by the rapid forwarding of content on the messaging app. Activists in nominally safe seats across the West Midlands and Greater Manchester are being told to stay home and campaign in constituencies where Labour might have expected 20,000-vote majorities but now fear losses to pro-Gaza independent candidates or George Galloway\u2019s Workers party. This alternative peer-to-peer distribution model means that news that matters to communities can be widely broadcast, even if mainstream outlets are not overly focusing on it. An early sign of this was a video clip of Starmer on the radio station LBC, where he pledged his support for Israel\u2019s right to defend itself after Hamas\u2019s deadly 7 October attacks. This, and other Gaza-related clips going viral on WhatsApp, were partly credited with Galloway\u2019s victory in this year\u2019s Rochdale byelection. One young woman in the supposedly safe Labour seat of Birmingham Hodge Hill interviewed for the Guardian\u2019s project looking at voters\u2019 media habits said she had never heard of an Israel-Palestine conflict until last October. Now, having been horrified by Gaza content she had seen online \u2013 on TikTok and Instagram as well as WhatsApp \u2013 she rated it as one of her top issues, causing her to change her vote from Labour to Green. By comparison, national campaign coverage of Gaza as an election issue has been limited, with the war barely featuring in the various televised leaders\u2019 debates. Labour campaigners said there was no doubt the Bangladesh clip had now been seen by far more people than tuned in for the original Sun interview. One viral edit of the video omits the fact that Starmer was discussing illegal immigration from Bangladesh, causing Labour to call it \u201cmisinformation\u201d. Rossini said WhatsApp could change elections because it rewards politicians who \u201cfocus on micro issues that are really emotional\u201d in an election, as opposed to a broader pitch. \u201cRather than thinking about an election as a choice for a government on economy, health or other things, you\u2019re thinking about their stance on a particular thing you deeply care about,\u201d she said. She said all of this reflected a different approach to consuming political news compared with the past, saying: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to follow the news because things that matter to you or concern your community will reach you. \u201cIt\u2019s discovery that is unintentional. A small minority of users are thinking of WhatsApp as a major source of news \u2013 but more people on WhatsApp are being found by pieces of news.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-03T15:18:24Z",
            "content": "David Dimbleby, the election broadcast grandee, has said exit polls are \u201cthe worst invention ever\u201d because they take the fun out of election nights. The veteran broadcaster announced to the nation the result of 11 exit poll projections as host of the BBC\u2019s general election coverage from 1979 to 2019. But speaking to the BBC\u2019s Newscast podcast he confessed that he had never liked exit polls. The 85-year-old broadcaster said: \u201cThe exit poll is the bane of the broadcaster\u2019s life. It\u2019s the worst invention ever brought in \u2013 it\u2019s like a thriller and you\u2019re given the answer before we\u2019ve even started on page one.\u201d Dimbleby recalled the last time the exit poll \u201ccompletely screwed up\u201d was in 1992, when it predicted a hung parliament in an election that John Major\u2019s Conservatives won with a majority of 21 seats. Since then, the increasing accuracy of exit polls has taken the thrill out of election nights, Dimbleby said. He recalled the excitement of watching election night in the 1950s and 60s before exit polls. Dimbleby said: \u201cI do remember way back the excitement when David Butler, who was the psephologist at the time, when the first result came in he\u2019d take out his slide rule and he\u2019d say very simply: \u2018If the whole country goes like this, the result will be whatever majority\u2019 \u2013 now that\u2019s what I call real reporting. \u201cBut stopping people as they come out of the polling booth and asking: \u2018How do you vote?\u2019 and then producing an increasingly accurate picture, seems to me entirely detrimental to the excitement of election night.\u201d He added: \u201cIt gives people something to talk about until three in the morning when the first serious results flow starts. But I never liked them. It takes the fun away.\u201d However, Dimbleby admitted that the sound of the BBC\u2019s election night theme tune, which he hummed, still \u201csends a shiver down my spine\u201d. He added: \u201cAs the curtain goes up, you have this moment of \u2018I\u2019ve got to get this right\u2019, this first five minutes before the exit poll. And then Big Ben bong, bong: \u2018It\u2019s 10 o\u2019clock. And we can now say \u2026 that it will be a Labour majority or Conservative majority.\u2019 That\u2019s the kind of heart-stopping moment. So I\u2019ll watch that on BBC and see how they handle that.\u201d After that, he said he would also watch how Sky, Channel 4 and ITV covered the vote. \u201cIf I can get my television to work \u2013 it always seemed to be on the blink every time I change it.\u201d"

But, the great news is that Andrew Sparrow is ready to take you through the general election evening and into Friday morning in this new blog: The Guardian\u2019s community team want to hear how people are spending Thursday night as results begin to come in. They would like to hear from UK voters \u2013 in the country and abroad \u2013 and other residents in the UK, about whether they\u2019ll be following the results tonight. So, please share your stories and pictures of election night where you are, via the form in the below link. The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has shared a post on X asking people to share their experience of voting by filling in a short survey. In its post today, the RNIB said that a young lady featured in its video, Khadija, was able to vote independently and in secret using a McGonagle reader. In the video, Khadija says: \u201cI went into the polling station and they did have the McGonagle device, so that was great. It was the first time they\u2019d ever used it before and I think I was their first person using it. So, I think they were a bit nervous. But it worked really well. They did align. I checked that they aligned the ballot correctly underneath. The person assisting me gave me headphones to use with it, which was good for the secret portion of it. I was a bit worried that it would be more complicated on an election day than the previous times. I\u2019ve used it as a test, but it was really simple to use. So, it was the first time I\u2019ve ever voted by just listening to the ballot myself and marking the box for myself.\u201d The RNIB noted though that \u201cnot everyone\u2019s voting experiences have gone as smoothly\u201d. Last week, the RNIB called on all political parties to commit to remove barriers that prevent blind people voting on their own and without help in future elections. It estimated that 160,000 people in the UK of voting age with severe sight loss would struggle to vote independently because of the lack adjustments made at polling stations. At the last general election, research for the RNIB found that only 13% of blind people felt they could vote independently and in secret. The Guardian photographer Jill Mead was granted exclusive access to spend polling day with the deputy leader of the Labour party, Angela Rayner. You can see Mead\u2019s day on the road with Rayner as the Labour battlebus made its final stops on polling day: The BBC have a short video on how the elections expert Prof Sir John Curtice prepares for a general election night. In the clip, Curtice says: The truth is that preparing for election night begins almost the day after the last election, because you\u2019re trying to work out what happened and why. And that\u2019s important to understanding what\u2019s going to happen in the next election. Thereafter, it\u2019s a continuous process, following the polls, particularly of course as the election campaign gets on.\u201d Under bright, blustery skies across most of the UK, British voters went to the polls on Thursday to elect their fourth prime minister in five years, with Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour party heavily tipped to win an overwhelming parliamentary majority and bring to an end 14 years of Conservative-led government. After weeks of campaigning after Rishi Sunak\u2019s surprise gamble to call a July election, he and the other party leaders cast their votes across the country while making their final appeals to the electorate. Sunak voted early with his wife, Akshata Murty, in his home constituency of Richmond and Northallerton, urging voters on X to \u201cstop the Labour supermajority which would mean higher taxes for a generation\u201d. Starmer, accompanied by his wife, Victoria, was met by a small group of supporters at a polling station in Kentish Town, north London. On social media, he repeated Labour\u2019s campaign theme that \u201cit is time for change\u201d. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, the Green party co-leader, Carla Denyer, and party leaders in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were also pictured at their constituencies. Davey, whose campaign has been characterised by stunts including bungee jumps, water slides and Zumba dancing, paid tribute to his wife, saying: \u201cWithout my rock, Emily, I simply would not be on the ballot paper.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn, running against Labour in his north London constituency after being expelled by the party he formerly led, tweeted: \u201cI just voted for the independent candidate in Islington North. I hear he\u2019s alright.\u201d The Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, posted a TikTok video of himself buying a drink in a Clacton pub. Thank you for sending in your pictures of dogs at polling stations today. Here are a few more that have popped up in my inbox: Pam has sent a lovely message saying that she\u2019s enjoying seeing all the dog pictures making it on to the live blog today. This sweet pooch is Lola, Pam\u2019s parson russell terrier, making her first visit to a polling station in the Angus and Perthshire Glens constituency in Scotland. Barnaby has shared a picture of a very keen Freddie from 7.15am this morning. He was \u201cdesperate to get to the polling station in Hackney,\u201d says Barnaby. Incidentally, it\u2019s also where his pal, Duster, was this morning (16:04 BST). \u201cHere\u2019s Crumble, fulfilling her civic duty in Hove, this morning,\u201d says Simon. Excellent work. Christian has got in touch to share a picture of his friend\u2019s dog, Lenny the dachshund, that he\u2019s looking after. \u201cI took a photo of him waiting outside \u2013 eager to know the results. It\u2019s going to be a long day,\u201d says Christian. Basset hounds Pippin and Padfoot have also been our at a polling station today. This time in Lewisham, along with owner, Rob. This \u201cpensive pooch\u201d, pictured in south-east London was provided by Terry. The UK is not the diplomatic powerhouse it once was, with Brexit leaving it looking inward and years of economic failures meaning the Conservatives and Labour are both sidelining foreign policy in their campaign messaging. Still, leaders around the world (some more than others) will be taking an interest in the 4 July election. The Guardian\u2019s Oliver Holmes has taken a look at some of the key issues here: Live election results for the UK\u2019s 650 constituencies will start to be announced at about 11:30pm. You can follow the results later via our live tracker. There\u2019s also an election night guide, via the Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast. Presented and produced by Lucy Hough with Archie Bland, it has tips on when to set your alarm for the potential Portillo-moments, the seats to watch and how to make it through to dawn. The Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross has voted and shared a picture of himself with a dog outside the polling station. Everyone is getting in on it. \u201cIt has been a terrible general election. The least we can do is learn from it,\u201d writes the Guardian\u2019s executive opinion editor, Hugh Muir. Muir writes: It started with dark comedy. The sight of Rishi Sunak, behind the podium at No 10, drenched by the rain \u2013 a drowned rat in a sharp suit, drowned out by a hostile loudspeaker, bellowing out the fact of his sudden-death election \u2013 belonged to vaudeville. The race itself belonged to Hobbes: \u201cpoor, nasty, brutish and short\u201d. And at the end, after all the speeches, the televised debates, the photo ops, the accusations, the helicopter rides, the leaflet-filled vehicles crisscrossing the country, the vox pops, what did we learn about our country and our politics? We learned more about the foolish recklessness of those who have ruled us. Sunak called his election for himself and for his party and for his faction. There was nothing further from his mind, as he dripped rainwater, than the good of the nation or our democracy. He had no plan, other than to parrot the inanity that \u201cthe plan\u201d was working. Tell that to the food bank volunteers or the coastguard at Dover. You can read his full opinion piece here: What happens next for former MPs defeated at the general election? Well, the PA news agency\u2019s parliamentary editor, Richard Wheeler, has answered just that question, and more, in this explainer: When did they stop being an MP? Parliament was dissolved on 30 May and at that point there ceased to be any MPs until the election took place. Ministers continue in their roles and remain in post until a new government is formed. What happens next for a former MP who failed to be re-elected? For some, the defeat will be a surprise, for others they will have seen the writing on the wall during the campaign. There will be several removal vans on the parliamentary estate in the coming days and weeks as the former MPs clear out their offices and make way for the new intake. It is expected some new MPs will start arriving in parliament just hours after the results are announced as they begin a new chapter in their lives. They will eventually be assigned office space in parliament by their party whips once the areas have been cleared out. What help is available to former MPs? The taxpayer-funded Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) \u2013 which governs MPs\u2019 expenses \u2013 supports those candidates who have lost their seat. Winding-down payments are designed to help departing MPs close their office and manage the departure of staff. They have up to four months to carry out the necessary tasks. How much financial support is there? Former MPs are entitled to receive a one-off winding-up payment to help them close down their parliamentary affairs. This is the equivalent of four months of their salary, minus tax and national insurance contributions. The basic annual salary for an MP is \u00a391,346. The government\u2019s tax calculator estimates this would mean take-home pay is \u00a363,541.68 \u2013 which would suggest four months of salary is about \u00a321,000. Former MPs are also able to claim for certain costs during the winding-up period, including office rent. What is the loss of office payment? A candidate who loses their seat or stands unsuccessfully in a different seat could also be eligible to receive a loss of office payment. It is similar to a redundancy payment and is equal to double the statutory redundancy entitlement. It will therefore vary by individual as it takes into account age as well as length of service. Ipsa guidelines state a former MP will be eligible for such a payment if they held office for a continuous period of at least two years at the point they lost their seat. And what about ministers who lose their jobs in government as a result of the election result? Regardless of whether an outgoing minister remains an MP or not, they are entitled to receive severance pay, as outlined in 1991 legislation. This is separate from winding-up payments and loss of office entitlement. The severance pay amounts to 25% of the annual ministerial salary they were being paid. Not all polling stations are the same. Some make use of a community hall or church, while others are located at more unusual venues. Here is a selection of interesting polling stations via the newswires. I\u2019d love to hear from you about any unique, or just beautiful, polling station spots. As always, pictures (of the outside \u2013 don\u2019t go breaking any rules) are very welcome and I can try to post a mix of them. With about four hours to go until the polls close, more voters have been in touch to tell us about how election day has gone. And for some, today was an important milestone as it was the first time they were eligible to have their say in a general election. Liv Skinner, 19, was one of those casting her first vote in a general election in North Devon this morning. \u201cI\u2019ve been excited to vote in a general election since I started becoming interested in politics in Year 10. I understand the importance of making sure my vote counts,\u201d she said. Skinner, who works as a barista and will study politics and philosophy at university this September, will also be assisting at the vote count tonight with a friend. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to it. I was planning to stay up and watch the results roll in anyway,\u201d she said. She has been preparing for the overnight count, which can go on until the wee hours. \u201cWe have to get there at 9:30pm, and then it can go on anytime until 6am. We went to shop and got loads of food and snacks, and I\u2019m planning to have a nap soon!\u201d James Watts, 20, also voted for the first time in a general election, marking his ballot in the constituency of North Bedfordshire. \u201cI was happy to do it \u2013 I voted in local elections last year but was at university in Southampton this year and was upset to miss it. It felt good to vote in a general election \u2013 I was glad to participate, when before I was just watching.\u201d Watts, who is studying politics, said he felt \u201ccivic duty\u201d to vote and planned to stay up to watch the results trickle in. \u201cMy mum and dad and I are in different areas but we plan to all be on a call tonight. We\u2019ll probably mainly watch Channel 4, but also go back and forth between BBC, Sky and ITV. I\u2019ll be staying up all night.\u201d And in south London, Maddie McVickers, 19, accompanied by Ruby the dog, 14, voted for the first time. As Martin explained earlier, there\u2019s not a whole lot that we can report on at the moment. So, while we wait, here is a reminder of a few useful general election 2024 pieces and explainers from the Guardian. What constituency am I in? The general election on 4 July will be fought across 650 new constituencies after boundary changes were approved by parliament. You can use the tool in the below interactive to find your new constituency \u2013 and see what the notional results would be. What photo ID do I need to vote in the 2024 UK general election? For the first time in a UK general election people will need to produce photo ID at polling stations today to be able to vote in person. You can find everything you need to know, including which forms of photo ID are accepted here: What is tactical voting and how does it work? This guide looks at what tactical voting involves and discusses what campaign group Best for Britain recommends. What time will we know who won? Want to catch a few results before bed, or see it through to the moment of reckoning? We\u2019ve got you covered with this hour by hour guide to election night and into Friday morning. If the pictures of dogs at polling stations is too much for you, then you might want to skip past this post. If you\u2019re still enjoying the canine content, then please enjoy this visual compilation that the Guardian video team have put together: Voters arriving at a Glasgow polling station were met with posters listing the wrong instructions, reports the PA news agency. According to the report, posters displayed at Notre Dame primary school told voters to rank candidates in order of preference. This is how ballots are cast in local elections in Scotland, which use the single transferable vote system, while general elections use the first-past-the-post system, which requires voters to put a single \u201cX\u201d next to their chosen candidate. Glasgow city council said the error was spotted \u201cvery soon\u201d after the polling station opened at 7am on Thursday and \u201cafter the first few voters\u201d. A council spokesperson said the posters were replaced with the correct information. The PA news agency reports that the council said no one had been disfranchised as voters\u2019 first preferences would be used from the affected ballots. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) have their own take on the \u2018dogs at polling station\u2019 pictures. Over on X, the charity has been urging voters to share photographs of any feathered friends they spot near a polling station. The UK\u2019s political parties are on track to spend more than a million pounds on online adverts on Thursday, circumventing a media blackout rule that forces television and radio stations to stop their election coverage when polls open. British parties have traditionally ceased top-level campaign activity when voting began as they had no way to get out their message out. This is because of a longstanding broadcasting rule, enforced by the media regulator Ofcom, that states: \u201cDiscussion and analysis of election and referendum issues must finish when the poll opens.\u201d The switch to online campaigning over the past two decades has increasingly made a mockery of this rule, with early indications suggesting political parties are viewing Thursday as an incredibly important campaign day for pushing their core messages to wavering voters. Sam Jeffers of WhoTargetsMe, which has monitored election advertising in the UK for the last decade, said substantial funds had been released for Thursday. \u201cThe parties are on track to spend a million pounds today on Meta and probably another \u00a3250,000 on Google,\u201d he said. If these figures are correct, it could mean that more money is spent by political parties buying online political advertising on polling day than was spent online during the entire 2015 general election campaign. The Conservatives have been attempting to spur on support for the party by sending out emails saying turnout is much higher than expected. \u201cWe\u2019re getting reports from our teams on the ground. And the more reports we get, the more it looks like turnout is higher than expected,\u201d according to messages sent out from the \u2018CCHQ data team\u2019 to those signed up on the party\u2019s mailing list. \u201cThat means we could have a MUCH better chance than polls have suggested. So if you haven\u2019t voted yet, now\u2019s the time to get out.\u201d The claim by the Tories that a higher turnout would benefit the party would be contested at this point. Turnout was 67.3% at the last election in 2019, down from 68.8% during the previous one. When Labour won in 1997, turnout was relatively high at 71.4%, although lower than the previous poll \u2013 77.7% in 1992 \u2013 which was won by the Conservatives in what was a relative surprise to some. Let\u2019s step away from the canine contributions for a moment. As people cast their votes on Thursday, the opinion polls continue to predict that Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour party will win the general election with one of the largest ever parliamentary majorities. Conversely, Rishi Sunak\u2019s Conservative party is projected to suffer one of its worst ever losses. The Guardian\u2019s David Batty has looked at how this prediction of a dramatic Labour win compares with other landslide victories in British history. While Martin Belam has now headed off for a well-earned rest, I (Amy) have taken over the duties of posting pictures of dogs (and other animals) at polling stations. Here\u2019s a little selection that have come in via our readers. Jodie has shared a picture of the \u201cnoble Bill O\u2019Shea\u201d, who I\u2019m assured is a very good boy and has performed his civic duty in Greenwich today. Duster the double doodle at Hackney town hall is \u201chungry for change\u201d, says Oliver, who has sent in this lovely picture. Jon, has shared a photograph of his white golden retriever, Ted, outside the Hive community centre in Dollar in the new Scottish constituency of Dunfermline and Dollar. Justin has also got in touch via email with this delightful picture of his puppy, Oscar, going to the polling station today for the first time. If a week is a long time in politics, the five-year gap between UK elections is an eternity. The political landscape has changed dramatically since the Tories\u2019 landslide victory in 2019 \u2013 but so too has the social media landscape. In 2019 TikTok was, according to a Guardian explainer, \u201ca video-sharing app which has become phenomenally popular with teenagers\u201d. Fast-forward to 2023 when, according to an Ofcom survey, 10% of people aged 16-plus said they received their news from TikTok, ahead of BBC Radio 1 and on a par with the Guardian, and up significantly from 1% in 2020, after the last election. And while there are those who say the so-called battle for TikTok is overstated, platform creators are well aware there is an audience for political content among TikTok users, young and old. To help understand how the 2024 election played out on TikTok, a number of Guardian reporters monitored the platform using four separate accounts for an hour a day for a week, searching for the widely used tag #ukpolitics and campaign-specific hashtags and terms. You can see what they found here: Reporting by Carmen Aguilar Garc\u00eda, Pamela Duncan, Michael Goodier and Zeke Hunter-Green with videos by Elena Morresi. Fourteen years, five prime ministers, four election cycles, two UK-wide referendums and a global pandemic: a lot has happened since the Conservative party entered coalition in 2010. But there are other, bigger figures on voters\u2019 minds: 7.6 million people on waiting lists for hospital treatment in England (three times the 2010 figure); 3% of Britons having to use a food bank, all while the cost of a weekly shop, household bills and mortgage repayments is rising. Numbers matter and data tells a story. A selection of charts, put together by Pamela Duncan, Carmen Aguilar Garc\u00eda and Michael Goodier, show how 14 years of Conservative rule has changed the country in five key policy areas. You can take a look at their piece here: You can also then click through to explore the wider Tory legacy for each topic, in full, in charts. More readers have been getting in touch \u2026 and some who are living abroad have shared with us the lengths they\u2019ve gone to ensure their vote is counted today. Lawrence Cheung, 62, who lives in France but is voting in the Cities of London and Westminster constituency, said that he entrusted his voting envelope to a Londoner who was returning on the Eurostar from the Gare du Nord, in Paris this morning. Cheung did so after his postal vote arrived too late \u2013 an issue that the Guardian has been reporting on this week. \u201cI found a man who was a lone traveller with a simple backpack. He confirmed he was a Londoner who lives close to the City. As he understood what was at stake, it didn\u2019t take much persuasion. \u201cI received my polling documents yesterday, which was insufficient time for returning by post, even from within the UK. Thankfully, the postal vote can be deposited at any polling station within the constituency.\u201d Cheung\u2019s volunteer delivered the envelope in the Barbican this afternoon. \u201cIt turns out that his name is Moritz, and I cannot thank him enough.\u201d Andrew Murphy, 63, is one of many Britons living abroad who regained the lifelong right to vote this year after the 15-year rule ended. Remembering that his postal vote hadn\u2019t arrived in time in the past, Murphy, who works for the European Commission and lives in Waterloo, Belgium, wasn\u2019t leaving anything to chance: he decided to take the Eurostar in order to cast his vote in person. \u201cIn the past (until 2005, when I lost the right to vote) I had a postal vote but the papers were never sent early enough to be counted. This way, they won\u2019t be depriving me of my democratic right \u2013 I\u2019ve turned up in person,\u201d he said, explaining that he then travelled from London to Bristol to vote in the Filton and Bradley Stoke constituency. \u201cThey kept sending me reminders to get the postal vote \u2013 but I thought, I\u2019m not falling for that again!\u201d Murphy, who is from Liverpool, didn\u2019t have anyone in his constituency that could easily vote for him by proxy. He was determined to vote, particularly after he was deprived of the right during the 2016 referendum. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been able to vote since the EU referendum, so it\u2019s quite symbolic. \u201cIt was expensive \u2013 but I\u2019d probably have walked here, for this particular one.\u201d Other readers have expressed anger at not being able to vote at all. Despite applying for her postal vote on 25 May, Sarah, who lives in Copenhagen but votes in Orpington, said she only received her postal vote on 3 July, leaving her unable to vote. She explained that the options available to her were impractical \u2013 couriering it for same-day delivery would be extortionately expensive.\u201cOr I could ask my boss for permission to take an unplanned, last-minute day off in a busy season so I can fly to the UK and deliver it myself. Both options are unaffordable and terrible for the environment,\u201d she said, adding that she also had young children and childcare would be a problem. \u201cIt\u2019s a democratic right, it\u2019s not some company delivering a bikini I\u2019d ordered. I\u2019m cross \u2013 I really wanted to vote.\u201d The body that represents electoral officers and administrators has said electoral legislation is no longer adequate, amid widespread reports of disfranchisement of postal voters marring Thursday\u2019s general election. The Association of Electoral Administrators says pressure on running the services has mounted over recent years, with elections delivered \u201cin spite of rather than because of the fragmented framework of laws\u201d. It has called for sweeping reforms including a new timeline for postal votes, registration of candidates and powers for officers to investigate errors and reports of disfranchisement when they occur. Laura Lock, the deputy chief executive of the AEA, said: \u201cElection teams are doing their very best to run this snap election, but with a short timetable and an election held when many are on holiday \u2013 plus print and delivery suppliers working at capacity \u2013 demand has severely tested the system.\u201d Lock said earlier deadlines for absent voting applications would be \u201cbetter\u201d and help councils get voting packs posted earlier, including those overseas. Under existing laws, elections can be called a minimum of 25 days before polling day. The AEA says this is too tight and should be extended to 30 days as is the case for the London mayoral and Greater London authority elections. It also wants powers to intervene when needed to avert disfranchisement, allowing those who did not receive a postal vote the opportunity to get a friend, family member or trusted person to cast their vote on election day. The number of people seeking postal votes has rocketed in recent years, with 10 million this year and 8 million in 2019 compared with 1.7 million in 2010 and about 1 million in the decades stretching back to the 1970s. Data from the House of Commons shows the \u201cturnout\u201d of postal voters is exceptionally high, at more than 83% in the past four elections, representing 20% of the total number of valid votes cast. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for today. Thank you for all your comments, which I always enjoy and often find useful. I am handing over to Amy Sedghi. Andrew Sparrow will be along later for when the results are coming in. I will be back with you bright and early tomorrow. I did ask for your dog pictures, and you have sent me some lovely ones \u2013 apologies if I didn\u2019t get to use yours \u2026 This is Bilbo the Westie braving the drizzle in Mossley in the Stalybridge and Hyde constituency, sent in by Joseph and Emma. This is Dougal the cocker spaniel from Louisa. Here are Murphy and Macie enjoying the election in Dronfield, North East Derbyshire, from Sam. And I\u2019ll just finish to say the RSPCA have a #DogsNotAtPollingStations campaign to try to find some forever homes for rescue dogs this election. PS. There is still time to do my general election quiz. See you tomorrow. A couple of weeks ago my colleague Libby Brooks interviewed Prof Sir John Curtice about his work on the exit poll. It will be published at 10pm, and has an extremely good track record of accurately predicting the results of the election. Anyway, it appears by now they should have the answer that we have got to wait for another seven-and-a-half hours for. As he so memorably put it when talking to Libby \u201cFrom about 11 o\u2019clock in the morning, we\u2019re poring over an exit poll and from about 12 hours later, we\u2019re shitting bricks as to whether it\u2019s right or not.\u201d Kemi Badenoch, secretary of state for business and trade, has been castigating the local council in North West Essex over missing postal ballots, drawing a comparison with, she says, a desire for change at local elections that voted out the Conservatives, and suggesting that is the risk people take today if they vote for change from the party that has been in government for the last 14 years. \u201cDon\u2019t change for the worse,\u201d her series of messages ends. For a bit of balance, people are actually posting pictures of themselves taking their cats to polling stations as well. Some people have used alternative forms of travel in order to get out and cast their vote. Do these ducks count? And I\u2019m not at all sure how I would react if I went to vote and got confronted by this \u2026 Polling day is one of the stranger fixtures in the news calendar, as there is clearly huge interest and expectancy, and lots of traffic to the website \u2013 thank you for reading \u2013 but actually until the exit poll 10pm there isn\u2019t really much concrete to report except that senior figures have turned out to vote and said they have voted. That is how it comes to be that #DogsAtPollingStations comes to fill time. We will have more of that in a minute. Here are some politicians out and about campaigning though \u2026 Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey has paid tribute to his wife in a social media message, saying that without her support he wouldn\u2019t be on the ballot paper. Green party of England and Wales co-leader Carla Denyer is out and about in Bristol, and suggesting if you see their volunteers you should flag them down to get a sticker. Labour\u2019s leader in Scotland Anas Sarwar is also on a bit of a tour around constituencies. Sarah Dyke, formerly Liberal Democrat MP for Somerton and Frome, now contesting Glastonbury and Somerton after boundary changes, had the right idea, and borrowed somebody else\u2019s dogs to make sure she could get a mention in the blog. Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Michelle O\u2019Neill, has cast her vote today at St Patrick\u2019s primary school in Coalisland. PA Media reports that asked by photographers for a thumbs up, she laughed and said: \u201cWill a smile do?\u201d As she left the polling station, she shouted goodbye to local children and waved to voters. In a message on social media today, O\u2019Neill said \u201cEvery vote will count today. Vote Sinn F\u00e9in to help shape a brighter future for everyone who call this place home. For positive change, strong leadership, and a commitment to work for all.\u201d She also called on \u201cpeople to support progressive candidates in constituencies where Sinn F\u00e9in is not standing, ensuring the maximum number of progressive MPs are elected,\u201d adding \u201cLet\u2019s work together.\u201d In her column today Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett has come out batting for greeting a possible Labour victory with some enthusiasm. Here\u2019s a taster: If they had reservations about the Blair government, my parents kept them to themselves. My mother, who had never trusted Blair, certainly didn\u2019t allow it to temper her joy that morning. Both my parents are socialists, voters the modern Labour party would regard as being on the far left \u2013 people whose votes, perhaps, they feel they could even do without. Both, like so many Labour voters, would later be disgusted over Iraq. Yet they knew then what I also know now in my bones, which is that people\u2019s lives would be improved by a Labour government, even if it wasn\u2019t quite the kind of Labour government you had dreamed of. I saw my mother the other day, and we talked a bit about 1997. \u201cOur lives,\u201d she said, \u201cwould have been materially different under a Conservative government.\u201d A year after the Labour victory, we would become a single parent family. We would struggle financially, but not as much as we would have done under the Tories. The support we received from the local authority as a result of my brother\u2019s severe disability was life changing. On social media, people have been sharing the images that they feel sum up the last decade and a half of government, from the Johnson administration\u2019s pandemic parties to security tags on blocks of cheese, the Covid memorial wall, Grenfell Tower in flames. One person chose a screenshot of the gaunt little boy from the Channel 4 Dispatches documentary about child poverty, the haunting part where he says: \u201cWe try not to eat a lot in one day, even though most of us are really hungry.\u201d Could you look him in the face and say that life won\u2019t be any different for him and children like him under a Labour government? I couldn\u2019t. It has to be. Read more from Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett here: Pop the champagne, dance for your kids \u2013 if Labour wins, I\u2019ll be celebrating like my parents in 1997 Nigel Farage, the recently installed leader of Reform UK, has been in Clacton today, where he is hoping to become an MP after seven previous unsuccesful attempts. For the benefit of the cameras he has both had an ice cream by the seafront and been spotted in the pub. As an aside I can\u2019t really knock having a pint on polling day myself as an activity, as it is almost certainly guaranteed to be my first port of call after my shift finishes this afternoon. Jeremy Corbyn has again appealed on social media for people to come and help his campaign to get out the vote for him as an independent candidate in Islington North, saying \u201cWe are on the verge of a huge, historic victory\u201d. Rachel Reeves, who could be on the verge of becoming the first woman to be chancellor of the exchequer, has posted a picture of herself at a polling station today. Northern Ireland\u2019s political leaders have been among those casting their ballots. A total of 136 candidates are standing in the country\u2019s 18 constituencies. DUP leader Gavin Robinson and his wife Lindsay voted in east Belfast shortly after 9am while UUP leader Doug Beattie cast his ballot in Portadown minutes earlier. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood cast his vote in his Foyle constituency shortly before 11am, while Alliance leader Naomi Long and her husband Michael voted in east Belfast a short time later. Long and Robinson are contesting the same East Belfast constituency. Defeat for Robinson would cast doubt on his fledgling leadership of the DUP, while a loss for Long would raise questions on whether the Alliance has hit a high-water mark of support. Long indulged in a doggy-pun in her social media message. It is not a UK election day without numerous pictures of dogs at polling stations. So here are a few more from Guardian readers \u2026 Emma Towers, who voted in the Southgate and Wood Green constituency, was joined by Freckles and Bugsy, who were bribed with treats to sit for this photo. Philip Mountford, accompanied by Blossom the cockapoo, did a proxy vote for his daughter Hope, who is travelling around South East Asia and is now in Australia. He said queues had already formed before 7am at the Bishops Cleeve Tithe Barn polling station in the Tewkesbury constituency. Andrew Cleland, Cambridge was up early to vote with his Siberian Huskies, Reto and his son, Bruno. \u201cDespite almost four years\u2019 age difference, this is both of their first general elections. They feel \u2018cakeism\u2019 is an ideology worthy of further research.\u201d And one more from Gerry McLean, Camden Square, London. \u201cIt was as busy as I\u2019ve ever seen a polling station, but it was very efficiently run,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought you might be short of pictures of dogs, so here is Camilla outside the London Irish Centre.\u201d You can tell us what is happening where you are on polling day \u2013 and send a picture of your dog too \u2013 details of how to contact the team can be found here. We will also accept photos of more exotic animals out voting. An interesting polling day ding dong going on below the line at The Times this morning. There is disgruntlement among readers, who are less than happy that comments on its election leader \u2013 which grumpily sat on the fence and failed to endorse any party \u2013 have been switched off. The Murdoch-owned Times stopped short of endorsing Labour when it finally published its final editorial before the election at 8.30pm last night \u2013 some hour\u2019s after Starmer won the support of its stablemate the Sun \u2013 instead providing its readers with the resounding message of \u201cDon\u2019t know, really\u201d. After attesting that the Tories were dealt a bad hand, it adds that there were \u201cmany unforced errors\u201d and acknowledges that \u201cafter 14 years in power there is much baggage.\u201d It describes Starmer as \u201ca sensible man, flexible and pragmatic, a patriot committed to his country\u2019s defence\u201d but says there are \u201cwarning signs\u201d about a Labour government including \u201ca disdain for aspiration\u201d shown in its decision to close a loophole that exempts private schools from VAT and \u201cLabour\u2019s attitude to Trans rights\u201d. After some umming and ahhing it decides: \u201cThis newspaper wants the next government to succeed, and it will not be ungenerous in praise if that is the case. But Labour has yet to earn the trust of the British people. It has been sparing with the truth about what it will do in office and cannot expect an endorsement.\u201d Some of its readers were not best pleased. Initial comments under the leader included criticism of its editor Tony Gallagher, former editor of the Daily Telegraph and the Sun (with a little stint as deputy editor of the Mail in between). \u201cGallgher has penned a very long resignation letter,\u201d wrote one reader. \u201cOnce the election is over would The Times consider getting a proper Editor back in?,\u201d asked another. Then, the comments were inexplicably switched off. Wily readers, determined to have their say, instead took to the comments section of the paper\u2019s second leader, which carried the headline \u201cWe the People\u201d, and argued that politicians needed to reconnect with the people they are paid to represent. \u201cAnd we, the readers of the Times, petition the editor to reconnect with the readership of this paper and its once vigorous independent-minded ethos,\u201d wrote one reader. \u201cSo the Thunderer deems it necessary to switch off comments on its non-endorsement leader, after a stream of adverse comments. A leader, in which it fears for the freedom of the media. Hypocrites!,\u201d added another. Reader John Ness also reflected on the Times\u2019 nickname of the Thunderer, established \u2013 according to the paper \u2013 in 1830. \u201cThe irony is painful,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe Times election leader dithers and mumbles and then bravely decides to sit on the fence and then acts decisively to ban comments so that readers cannot point it out. It is election day but it is the date that the Thunderer became the Whimperer.\u201d The Justice4Grenfell organisation has staged a protest today near to a polling station in the vicinity of Grenfell Tower, the scene of the fire which killed 72 people just days after the 2017 general election. Since then there has been a further general election, and both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have followed Theresa May as prime minister, but seven years later over 150,000 homes still have flammable cladding, Grenfell inquiry recommendations remain unimplemented, and no prosecutions have been made. Organisers have placed 72 \u201cCaution, Slippery Politicians\u201d signs within view of the tower. In a statement, the organisation said the protest was \u201cto remind everyone to scrutinise politicians\u2019 pledges, particular those regarding housing safety or the treatment of renters and leaseholders, and urge them to ensure they chose a candidate who will serve the public interest.\u201d In what must be one of the most unusual \u2013 and smallest \u2013 polling stations in the country, in the remote village of Winwick in Northamptonshire people will be casting their vote in the hallway of someone\u2019s house. But even though the ballot box is literally under her own staircase, 80-year-old June Thomas said she always casts her ballot by postal vote. She has already walked the 300 yards to the village post box to send her vote in. She told the BBC: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever voted in my house \u2013 even though it\u2019s the polling station. I can see why people might laugh.\u201d Her home, the Old School House which was the village school until 1947, has been the polling station for the area since 1990, and is one of only a few remaining private residences still used as polling stations across the country. Thomas said she started voting by post as she previously worked as a polling station clerk elsewhere and didn\u2019t have time to cast her vote in person \u2013 and has remained doing so ever since. \u201cI know it sounds funny but I\u2019ve just kept using my postal vote and voting by post,\u201d she said. Green party of England and Wales co-leader Carla Denyer took a moment to sit down after casting her vote in Bristol. PA Media reports she greeted photographers and reporters outside the church. Denyer is standing in Bristol Central, which is one of four seats where the party hopes to win. In a message on social media Denyer said: No need to guess who I voted for! The energy in Bristol today is electric! On the short walk to the polling station, I met 8 Green volunteers and heard \u201cwell done\u201d and \u201cI voted for you\u201d from voters Thank you, everyone, and remember to bring ID to vote! On its social media channels the Green party has claimed the vote of Leap the dog \u2013 although the Guardian hasn\u2019t been able to verify whether they are on the electoral roll. They have also been able to claim the support of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who has been posing with a large vegetable that is occasionally wearing his glasses. You don\u2019t get this sort of content on the politics live blog every day, do you? People across the UK have begun casting votes in a general election expected to sweep Rishi Sunak\u2019s Conservatives out of power and usher in Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer as prime minister. Sunak\u2019s messaging on the day of polling remained about encouraging Tory voters out to \u201cstop the Labour supermajority\u201d rather than positioning himself to continue in Downing Street. Starmer\u2019s Labour were pushing people to go out and vote for change. Opinion polls suggest Labour is on course to secure a big majority, but last night Starmer told supporters to \u201cimagine a Britain moving forward together with a Labour government. That\u2019s what we are fighting for, let\u2019s continue that fight. If you want change, you have to vote for it.\u201d Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey, Scotland\u2019s first minister John Swinney, and Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth have all also voted. Davey, whose campaign has been marked by a series of extreme stunts, said \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day. I hope lots of people come out to vote.\u201d An exit poll, published shortly after polls close at 10pm on Thursday, will provide the first indication of how the election has gone on a national level. These take place at polling stations across the country, with tens of thousands of people asked to privately fill in a replica ballot as they leave, to get an indication of how they voted. If Starmer were to become prime minister, it would be the first time the UK\u2019s leader has changed as a result of a general election since 2010, when David Cameron succeeded Gordon Brown. Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Sunak himself all became prime minister after internal Conservative party mechanism rather than through a general election. You can tell us what is happening where you are on polling day \u2013 details of how to contact the team can be found here. Here is a video clip featuring Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer casting their votes. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, has voted in Surbiton. PA Media reports he said \u201cgood morning everybody\u201d to the assembled media and waved to the cameras as he arrived at Surbiton Hill Methodist Church. A voter leaving the polling station wished Davey good luck. Davey, who has certainly made a name for himself with his total dedication to eye-catching stunts this campaign, said \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day. I hope lots of people come out to vote.\u201d Our picture desk put together this gallery of the best of Davey\u2019s antics over the last six weeks. The Liberal Democrats are hoping that gains for them, especially in the south-west of England, combined with a Labour squeeze on SNP seats in Scotland, might return the party to being the third-biggest in the House of Commons. I wouldn\u2019t exactly say that people had been clamouring for it, but there have been a few questions in the comments on here and on the Thursday quiz recently about whether you would get to see my dog Willow visiting a polling station today. There are two issues. One, I\u2019m clearly doing the live blog, which precludes me being out and about at the moment, and two, thanks to missing the AV referendum in 2011 when I was suddenly called away for work, I\u2019ve had a postal vote for more than a decade. However, do not despair. The moment has been prepared for. Willow, the official dog of the Guardian Thursday quiz, \u201chelped\u201d me post my vote a couple of weeks ago, and here she is doing it. This also gives me an opportunity to shamelessly plug today\u2019s Thursday quiz, which has just gone live. Labour leader Keir Starmer has posted a picture of him with his wife Victoria on their way to vote with the message \u201cToday, Britain\u2019s future is on the ballot\u201d Labour have also posted a video urging people to go out and vote, saying \u201cnothing is decided yet\u201d. Using archive footage it mocks up the BBC\u2019s David Dimbleby announcing at 10pm tonight that Rishi Sunak\u2019s Conservatives are the largest party according to the exit poll, and then cuts to a clip of Sunak celebrating during Euro 2024. Just to confirm that as with Rishi Sunak, when Keir Starmer voted he breifly greeted people but did not speak to any of the gathered media. Labour\u2019s leader in Scotland, Anas Sarwar, has voted at Pollokshields Burgh Halls in Glasgow. He was accompanied by his wife Furheen, and son Aliyan. I think it is fair to say that the photo opportunity may have not gone entirely to plan. The family were photobombed by someone holding up a sign which read \u201cStarmer is a snake\u201d. The SNP have posted an election day message video, with first minister John Swinney reiterating the party\u2019s key messages at this election, calling for an end to the two-child benefit cap, and urging supporters to vote SNP to support \u201cending Westminster austerity\u201d, \u201ceradicating child poverty\u201d and \u201crejoining the European Union as an independent country, because we are a country that proudly looks out.\u201d My colleague Robyn Vinter has been looking into just how some constituencies return their results so quickly on election night: In most constituencies, counting the tens of thousands of votes cast during an election takes somewhere between five and eight hours, which means voters usually have to stay up very late or get up very early to discover the outcome. Sunderland has held bragging rights for decades, being the quickest to declare at every general election between 1992 and 2015, and setting that record time of 10.42pm for Sunderland South in 2001. The feat was described as a \u201cmilitary operation\u201d, with the count masterminded by the returning officer Bill Crawford, who left Sunderland in 2015. Under his stewardship, ballot counters were sourced from local banks because of their speed with small bits of paper. And he would recruit sixth-formers from nearby schools, training them on how best to run with ballot boxes in their hands. Read more here: Rapid results \u2013 UK ballot counters braced for race to declare first winner If you did not get a chance to do it yesterday, then can I recommend you spend a couple of minutes between now and the exit poll at 10pm having a crack at the Guardian\u2019s supermassive election quiz \u2026 Readers have been getting in touch as they head to the polls this morning. In Sheffield Central, NHS GP Tom McAnea, 54, said he is \u201cexcited\u201d to be voting. \u201cThe sun is shining brightly this morning which should be an encouragement for voters to turn out. This is my ninth general election where I can vote, the first being in 1992. I still find the whole process both a privilege and a huge responsibility.\u201d Tom was accompanied by his 17-year-old daughter, Freya, who hopes to study politics at university next year. \u201cShe\u2019s very keyed up today. She\u2019s frustrated she can\u2019t vote but is enthused by the whole process. We\u2019ll be tuning in this evening at 10pm for the exit poll. I voted not long after seven. It wasn\u2019t busy, but I could see that there was already a list of people who had been in and voted. I think they\u2019re expecting a good turnout today.\u201d Hayley voted earlier this morning in Ashton-under-Lyne with her dog Nova. She said there she didn\u2019t have any problem voting and there was no queue around 8am. Hayley added it was Nova\u2019s first election (she is 18 months old) though she may not have been as excited as some. \u201cShe was shown the leaflets from all the candidates but she was more interested in the one from the local pizza place.\u201d Andrew Dunning, 37, from Oxford, voted at 7.30 with his son, aged three. \u201cMy son had us up at 4.30 am asking whether \u2018goat\u2019 rhymes with \u2018poll\u2019. There was nobody at the polling station and I was the tenth person to vote. We put a cross on the ballot papers together.\u201d Having to show ID has made the process feel \u201cless friendly\u201d this year, he adds. \u201cThe very nice fellow who was running the polling station went to ask the manager if they should accept my passport because I\u2019ve grown my hair and beard out since the photo was taken nine years ago. Then he asked my son, \u2018Is this daddy?\u2019 My son said yes. \u2018That\u2019s fine, then.\u2019\u201d You can tell us what is happening where you are on polling day \u2013 details of how to contact the team can be found here. Plaid Cymru\u2019s leader Rhun ap Iorwerth has posted a video clip of himself after he cast his vote in Ynys M\u00f4n. He said: I\u2019ve just voted for Llinos Medi and Plaid Cymru here on Ynys M\u00f4n. For fairness. For ambition. For Wales. For fair funding for Wales. For the NHS. For your family. For your community. Thank you to you for all your support. It is one of the constituencies Plaid Cymru have been targeting in this election. Last time out Ynys M\u00f4n was won by Conservative Virginia Crosbie as a gain from Labour, but both Labour and Plaid Cymru were only narrowly behind with a couple of thousand votes in it. Keir Starmer has arrived to vote in London with his wife, Victoria. Polling ahead of the election suggests he is the person most likely to be the next prime minister of the UK, five years after his Labour party suffered a disastrous defeat in the December 2019 general election which saw Boris Johnson returned as UK prime minister. The country has changed leader twice since without holding a general election. Rishi Sunak and John Swinney have already voted, as has now, according to PA Media, Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie. He voted at Seagoe Primary School in Portadown. Beattie told reporters \u201cIt is an important day, it is a day for the people to cast their votes. We have run a good campaign.\u201d The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has also voted, posting a picture of himself outside a polling station with the message \u201cJust voted for the independent candidate in Islington North. I heard he\u2019s alright.\u201d Labour\u2019s deputy leader Angela Rayner has urged people on social media to \u201cbe part of it\u201d by voting for Labour today. Sunak\u2019s message seems to be one of accepting inevitable defeat, telling people to \u201cHead to your polling station. Bring ID. Vote Conservative. Stop the Labour supermajority*\u201d Jane Dodds, leader of the Liberal Democrats in Wales, has taken her dog Wanda down to vote. And Pickles the dachshund has been down to the polling station in Ticknall Village hall in the South Derbyshire, and appears to be showing there is a great deal more trust placed in his recall abilities than I would dare with my very mischievous miniature dachshund Willow. *There is no such thing as a \u201csupermajority\u201d in British politics. A government either enjoys a majority in the House of Commons, or it does not. Aletha Adu, our political correspondent, has this explainer on what different results would mean for Labour, looking three scenarios: a moderate majority of 0-80 seats, a Blair-style landslide of 80-179 seats, and a haul of more than 179 seats. Read more here: Blair-style landslide or \u2018supermajority\u2019: what different results would mean for Labour If you can\u2019t get enough politics coverage \u2013 and the fact you are reading an election day live blog more than twelve hours before we get the exit poll suggests you might be that kind of person \u2013 then tomorrow evening my colleague Hugh Muir will chair a panel of Guardian columnists and writers including John Crace, Gaby Hinsliff, Jonathan Freedland, and Zoe Williams at an event in London called Guardian Newsroom: Election results special. It is on from 7.30pm-9pm (BST) tomorrow, and you can join it in person or on a livestream. There are more details here. First minister of Scotland, John Swinney, has arrived to vote alongside SNP candidate Dave Doogan at the polling place in Blairgowrie, near Perth. PA Media report that addressing supporters at a pre-election rally in Leith on Wednesday evening, John Swinney said the Conservatives were going to be \u201cheavily defeated\u201d by the Labour party in England, but that there were \u201cnarrow margins\u201d between Labour and the SNP in Scotland. On social media the SNP has urged people to message friends and family reminded them to vote, saying \u201cDon\u2019t wake up on Friday thinking that you could have done more in the final days of the campaign. You can help to boost turnout at the election by messaging everyone you know to remind them to vote SNP today.\u201d The SNP candidate for Glasgow West, Carol Monaghan, has posted a pic of Wee Jean wearing an SNP rosette at a polling place in the newly formed constituency of Glasgow West. Monaghan was MP for Glasgow North West from 2015 to 2024. Robbie Butler is standing for the Ulster Unionist Party in Lagan Valley, where he came third in 2019. He has just posted to say thathe hasn\u2019t missed an election since he was 18 and has just cast his vote today, but what caught my eye was the similarity in his post to the internet meme of Timothy Dalton as Simon Skinner in Hot Fuzz. [Please note it is not Timothy Dalton\u2019s birthday today, that is just an old social media post] My colleague John Crace has clearly been up and early to vote, and has posted a picture of Herbert Hound to confirm it. If you missed it, his sketch of the last day of the campaign \u2013 Rishi sinks into TV sofa as Boris gloats and Mel goes rogue \u2013 can be found here, and he also teamed up with Marina Hyde alongside Helen Pidd to discuss the election on yesterday\u2019s Today in Focus podcast. Crace that is. Herbert Hound is not on the podcast. Here are some images from around the country as people go to vote this morning. Polling stations will be open until 10pm, and for the first time voters in England, Scotland and Wales will need to produce photo ID to vote in person during a general election. Northern Ireland introduced voter ID in 2002. Election day is always a good day for publicity stunts getting into the media, as this Peta activist dressed as a bear outside a polling station demonstrates \u2026 Here is a little glimpse behind the scenes, with the press pack of photographers marking time before Rishi Sunak arrived to vote in his constituency by taking lots of pictures of somebody putting up a sign. Labour leader Keir Starmer is expected to cast his vote at about 9.30am, with Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey and Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer both expected to vote \u2013 in different places obviously \u2013 at about 10.30am. If you want to start planning your evening, then here is our hour-by-hour guide to when we can expect to see results declared. I pity people who are not invested in #DogsAtPollingStations on social media because even the official Conservative party account is joining in. Former Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn has made an appeal for people to come out and help his campaign in North Islington as an independent. In it he says: We have built this campaign from nothing. We don\u2019t have party machinery. We don\u2019t have big donors. We have something more powerful: people. Another independent candidate in London who has previously stood for Labour, Fazia Shaheen, has also posted, saying \u201cLet\u2019s show the world what we\u2019ve got! Our community and people-powered campaign could win today. They know it and they are scared. The Tories are finally out, let\u2019s start a new politics.\u201d Polling seems to indicate that there are a lot of potentially undecided voters out there still. If you are undecided, maybe a quick peruse of the manifestos may be in order. Here is a handy list of manifestos for all the parties who had MPs at the end of the last parliament, plus a few select others \u2026 Conservatives Labour SNP Liberal Democrats DUP Sinn F\u00e9in [pdf] Plaid Cymru SDLP Alba Green Party of England and Wales Alliance Reform UK Workers Party of Britain Scottish Greens [pdf] UUP [pdf] TUV [pdf] Green Party of Northern Ireland Animal Welfare [pdf] Count Binface Obviously you will have this live blog open all through the night, but here is our guide to what you could be watching out of the corner of your eye while reading Andrew Sparrow later on \u2026 The prime minister has voted. PA Media reports: Rishi Sunak made the short journey from his grade II-listed manor house to vote at Kirby Sigston Village Hall in his Richmond and Northallerton constituency. Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty arrived in a Range Rover and walked hand-in-hand into the village hall. Sunak greeted the photographers outside the polling station. He left without commenting and was driven away. Various senior political figures have been posting messages to encourage people to vote for them on social media. Vaughan Gething has said in his clip that \u201cYou might not be particularly shocked by this, but I think that you should vote for the Labour party.\u201d The first minister of Wales accused the Conservative government in Westminster of having made a deliberate choice to starve Wales of investment, and said \u201cI can tell you that the number one thing the Wales needs right now is a UK Labour government to work in partnership with.\u201d Home secretary James Cleverly has posted a picture of him at Braintree railway station, with the message \u201cHappy polling day to all who celebrate this festival of democracy.\u201d In Northern Ireland, first minister Michelle O\u2019Neill has asked the country to \u201creturn the strongest Sinn F\u00e9in team\u201d. In a message for the wider UK electorate she said: I also urge people to support progressive candidates in constituencies where Sinn F\u00e9in is not standing, ensuring the maximum number of progressive MPs are elected. Let\u2019s work together. Nigel Farage, the recently installed leader of Reform UK, has reposted his party\u2019s party political broadcast featuring him in the Kent countryside with his dog, urging people to \u201cVote with your heart\u201d. My colleague Libby Brooks is not up for election, but she has urged people to go out and vote with the enthusiasm of a Labrador as displayed by her dog with its friends. My colleague Nimo Omer has been at the helm of our Thursday morning briefing email today, and has this to say about Rishi Sunak\u2019s election campaign: Despite trying to hammer home their central message (LABOUR WILL TAX YOU!), the moments everyone has remembered are actually Rishi Sunak\u2019s self-inflicted gaffes. A defining moment of the campaign that dogged the prime minister for weeks \u2013 a lifetime in a six-week campaign \u2013 was his decision to leave the D-day commemorations early to get back to London for an ITV interview. \u201cIn focus groups, when people were asked what they noticed, they remembered the rain announcement and D-day,\u201d the Guardian\u2019s senior political correspondent, Peter Walker says. There was no explaining it away and even though the prime minister apologised, \u201cit looked pretty bad\u201d. Another political headache for the beleaguered prime minister was the betting scandal, initially revealed by the Guardian, which followed Sunak everywhere he went. A material roadblock to an effective on-the-ground campaign has been that much infrastructure is not there any more. A local party official effectively told Peter a few weeks ago that there was no one to campaign in their marginal seat. \u201cThey have lost many, many local councillors over the last few elections that would have been door-knocking for them,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s hardly anyone left\u201d. The Conservative campaign has also been surprisingly defensive, particularly in the last few weeks. Sunak has visited what would normally be considered ultra-safe seats. You can read more of that here: Thursday briefing \u2013 The UK campaign trail\u2019s highlights, lowlights \u2013 and washouts Sign up here for our free daily newsletter, First Edition Rishi Sunak hasn\u2019t posted to social media since polls opened, but he did post a series of messages in an hourly countdown to \u201cstop the Labour supermajority\u201d, suggesting among other things that Labour intend to raise taxes, scrap exams, demolish the green belt and \u201ctax you just for driving\u201d. There is no such thing as a \u201csupermajority\u201d. A government in the UK either has a majority or it does not. We\u2019ve already got our first sausage dog at a polling station, so the day is going swimmingly. This is Maggie voting in Wellingborough and Rushden, which was won by Gen Kitchen for Labour in February, when she overturned an 18,000 Tory majority. This is the video that Labour leader Keir Starmer has put out on social media as polls open in the UK general election. With a significant lead in polling before the day, Starmer is widely expected to become the next UK prime minister. Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor Labour\u2019s post-election honeymoon will be short-lived unless it takes immediate action to deliver on workers\u2019 rights and brings a swift end to 14 years of public sector pay restraint, the president of the TUC has said. Matt Wrack, also the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), said Sir Keir Starmer should convene a summit with unions within days to plan how a new government would deliver for workers if Labour is victorious in Thursday\u2019s election. \u201cUnions should be invited in quickly to set out their priorities,\u201d Wrack said in an interview with the Guardian as Starmer prepares for an expected landslide victory. Wrack said there were issues that required urgent action, including delivering on Labour\u2019s New Deal for workers, resolving long-running public sector strikes and boosting wages. Read more here: Labour must take immediate action to deliver on workers\u2019 rights, says union chief Good morning everybody, Martin Belam here. This is the deal with comments. They are open on the blog today. The Representation of the People Act outlaws the reporting of how people voted, so you can let everyone know you cast a vote, but please don\u2019t say how you voted. I know I can trust you to behave yourselves. I will chip in where I think I can add any value and/or joy. As the UK goes to the polls on Thursday, our community team want to hear from voters about what\u2019s happening where they are. If you voted, how was your experience? Were there queues or was it quiet? Did you go alone or with others? Did you have any issues voting, such as problems with a proxy vote, or voter registration or ID? If so, tell us about it. Were you able to vote in the end? You can find out how to get in touch with the team here, and some of your contributions may end up on the live blog if you give permission. As well as the introduction of new photo ID requirements in England, Scotland and Wales, this election is also different from 2019 because a number of boundary changes have been implemented. With only 77 constituencies remaining unchanged, the boundary review changes which seat many people will be voting in. You can check which is your constituency with our interactive tool here. Don\u2019t get caught out like Boris Johnson did in May\u2019s local elections. For the first time in a UK general election people in England, Scotland and Wales will need to produce photo ID at polling stations on Thursday to be able to vote in person. Northern Ireland introduced voter ID in 2002. Here is what you need to know. The main things to use are either a passport or a driving licence. Passports can be from the UK, EU or Commonwealth, driving licences from the UK and EU. Documents from Norway, Iceland are Liechtenstein are also accepted, as are driving licences from the Isle of Man or any of the Channel Islands. There are also a mind-boggling 18 other types of document that can be used, including concessionary travel pass for older and disabled people. Student ID is not accepted. The ID can have expired, as long as you still look like the photo. You can find more details here. Voting has begun across the UK for a general election which polling suggests could bring an end to 14 years of the Conservative party in government, and see Labour opposition leader Keir Starmer installed in Downing Street as the new prime minister. Polling stations will be open until 10pm, and for the first time in England, Scotland and Wales general election voters will be required to provide photo identification before voting in person. Northern Ireland introduced voter ID in 2002. Prime minister Rishi Sunak called the election six weeks ago in a rain-soaked speech outside No 10 where he had to battle against the sounds of 1997 New Labour anthem Things Can Only Get Better by D:Ream being blasted out by a protester, and his campaign has been uphill ever since. The Conservatives have barely made a dent into Labour\u2019s polling lead, which has consistently shown Starmer\u2019s party to be about 20 points ahead, much higher than the swing needed to reverse the party\u2019s dismal 2019 general election result. The Conservative campaign has been bedevilled with scandal, as people close to the PM and Tory candidates were accused of betting on the timing of the election, leading to a police investigation. The last few days of the campaign have seen the Tories seize desperately on the Labour leader saying he intends to carve out some time with his family each week to claim he would \u201cclock off\u201d from being PM at 6pm, and claim that people should vote Conservative to avoid Labour winning a \u201csupermajority\u201d \u2013 a meaningless concept that has no formal existence in the Westminster system. Sunak has repeatedly used a discredited line that Labour policies will add more than \u00a32,000 to tax bills. Labour have faced their own problems, with selection rows over Diane Abbott and Faiza Shaheen overshadowing the early days of the campaign, and accusations that the party is putting forward an uninspiring programme that has undone much of the enthusiasm younger voters had developed for Labour during the years that Jeremy Corbyn was leader. Corbyn is standing as an independent candidate for his old seat in North Islington. Disquiet over the party\u2019s approach to Israel\u2019s conflict in Gaza is also expected to cost the party votes, especially in urban areas and areas with significant Muslim populations. Comments Starmer made in recent days about Bangladeshi immigrants have landed badly with that community. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey has tried to use a stunt-laden campaign to attract coverage of his party\u2019s policies as it attempts to overtake the SNP and once again become the third largest party in the House of Commons. For their part, the SNP with Westminster leader Stephen Flynn and recently installed first minister of Scotland John Swinney have campaigned on a platform insisting that however people feel about the government in Holyrood, this election is a chance to send a strong Scottish voice to London. Labour are looking to reclaim seats in Scotland\u2019s central belt that had for many, many years been traditional Labour heartlands. Polls have Labour and SNP closer than they have been for years in Scotland. In Wales, Labour\u2019s campaign has been hindered by controversy swirling around donations to first minister Vaughan Gething\u2019s leadership campaign, which Plaid Cymru will hope they can exploit. In Northern Ireland, DUP interim leader Gavin Robinson is defending a narrow majority in Belfast East. George Galloway is attempting to hold the Rochdale seat he won in a February byelection for the Workers Party of Britain. The Green Party of England and Wales have made four seats in England their main target. The early surprise of the campaign was Nigel Farage\u2019s decision to seize leadership of the Reform UK party from Richard Tice. MRP polling models have suggested the party might win as many as 18 seats, or indeed none at all. Predictions they would surge in polling have during the campaign have broadly not been met, but Farage has said his intention is to build a movement to oppose Labour that will put him in a position to become prime minister in 2029.

The Guardian\u2019s political media editor, Jim Waterson, explains how the party\u2019s campaign fell apart and whether it stood a chance to begin with: It is the King\u2019s duty as head of state to appoint a prime minister, and he is travelling from Scotland to Windsor Castle, ready to be on stand-by after being in Edinburgh for Holyrood Week. The role is one of the few remaining personal prerogatives of the sovereign, because Charles does not act on advice nor need to consult anyone before doing so. But the overriding requirement is to appoint someone who can command the confidence of the House of Commons \u2013 usually the leader of the party with an overall majority of seats in the Commons \u2013 to form a government. If Keir Starmer leads the Labour Party to victory, Charles could be set for the third prime minister of his less than two-year reign: his first was Liz Truss, and the King welcomed Rishi Sunak as his second PM just six weeks after acceding to the throne. Depending on the election outcome, Charles is set to hold a private audience with the leader of the winning party at Buckingham Palace in London on Friday. They will be invited by the King to form a government and become prime minister. On the last day of campaigning, the UK\u2019s most tattooed woman met the UK\u2019s richest-ever prime minister: Come with me to another country, far, far away, where things are a little bit different. In this fantastical land, young people can live and work in any country in Europe. You can swim in a river without catching Weil\u2019s disease, or see your doctor. Things aren\u2019t perfect in this country, but 40,000 people rely on food banks instead of 3.1 million. People live half a year longer. Five-year-olds are taller. Reader, you\u2019ll never guess what. That country is Britain! Or it was until 2010, when a parade of five Conservative prime ministers, seven chancellors and eight home secretaries (two of whom were Suella Braverman) climbed behind the wheel of Britain\u2019s temperamental but mostly reliable family hatchback, and drove it into a hedge. What the hell just happened? If you\u2019re feeling nostalgic, or just possibly a little angry, here is a recap of the lurches, plunges and nausea of 14 years on the Tory rollercoaster. Results come in throughout the night after polls close at 10pm, with the very earliest expected by about 1am. Houghton and Sunderland South is historically one of the quickest, if not often the first, constituencies to declare. The national record is 10.43pm for the declaration for its predecessor seat, Sunderland South, set in 2001. Houghton and Sunderland South competes every year \u2013 with youths running from polling to counting stations as fast as they can with boxes holding ballots \u2013 with Newcastle. All seats seats should be declared by 7am, with perhaps a few exceptions. The UK uses a voting system called \u201cfirst past the post\u201d (a horse racing term), which means that voters vote for a candidate in their constituency, rather than a party, and the candidate with the most votes wins and becomes a member of parliament. The UK \u2013 England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales \u2013 is divided into 650 constituencies. The party with the most MPs then has the chance to form government, either because it wins the majority of seats in the parliament, or makes a deal with one or more other parties to do so. If the party with the most seats forms government, its leader becomes the prime minister. This means that millions of votes for a party won\u2019t necessarily translate to seats. For example, in 2015 more than 3.8 million people voted for Nigel Farage\u2019s Ukip party, but this resulted in only one seat in parliament. If the UK had a proportional system like many other countries, the party would have won 82 seats. A candidate who is least liked in a constituency can still win if the opposition is divided. This election, a higher number of voters than usual may try to get past this system by voting tactically \u2013 casting their ballot not for their preferred candidate, but rather for the candidate most likely to unseat their least preferred candidate. The UK \u2013 that is England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland \u2013 is divided into 650 constituencies, a geographical electoral division or district. Voters cast a ballot for the person they want to represent their constituency in the UK Houses of Parliament. Candidates run as members of political parties with the key parties including: the Labour party, the Conservative party, Liberal Democrats, Scottish National party, Green party, Reform UK, Sinn F\u00e9in and the Democratic Unionist party. Candidates can also run as independents. The candidate with the most votes in that constituency is elected as a member of parliament (MP). The party with the most MPs then forms a government if it has a majority (at least 326 seats). Wind and rain are no match for a roughly three in five eligible Britons who turn out to vote every five years. If anything, it makes them more determined. Voter turnout is not generally affected by weather conditions, records suggest. According to the Parliament website, despite the last general election in 2019 being the wettest since records began in 1931, turnout was actually higher (67.3%) than in 2001 (59.4%) and 2005 (61.4%) when polling day fell in June and May respectively. The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK\u2019s public body for official data, show there are about 49 million people registered to vote in the UK. Could those be winds of\u2026 change? Winds of up to 40mph are set to blow accross the UK today, according to the Met Office. Showers are also expected across west and northwest Scotland, northwest England and across Northern Ireland on Thursday, according to the forecaster. Southeast England will experience the brightest, warmest weather with areas around London expected to reach temperatures of up to 22C. Chillier weather is predicted further north with most of the day\u2019s rainfall expected in northwest Scotland, the forecaster said. Liam Eslick, meteorologist at the Met Office, told PA: It\u2019s going to be quite a windy day across much of the UK. The strongest winds are going to be towards Northern Ireland, the western parts of Scotland and northern England - so we could see winds getting up to around 35, maybe even possibly 40mph, especially around the coasts of Scotland. It\u2019s going to be a windy day for most people but it is going to be bright for central and southern England as well as Wales.\u201d Campaigning has ended and voters are set to decide who will lead the UK for the next five years, with the country\u2019s newspapers covering the parties final pitches \u2013 while making a few suggestions of their own. \u201cStarmer hails \u2018new age of hope\u2019 as Britain votes in historic election\u201d, reads the Guardian\u2019s front page. The paper\u2019s lead story notes that Rishi Sunak\u2019s closest allies have already appeared \u201cto concede defeat\u201d, while the final opinion polls show Labour is on track for an unprecedented victory. \u201cOn the last day of a fractious six-week campaign, the Guardian was told Sunak had confided to members of his inner circle that he was fearful of losing his own seat\u201d, the paper reports. With voters about to go to the polls, the Mirror unsurprisingly comes out with an endorsement for Keir Starmer. Against a stark, black background, its headline reads \u201cVote for change. Vote Labour\u201d. Perhaps more surprisingly, the Sun\u2019s front page also come out in support for Labour, with \u201cTime for a new manager\u201d. Despite the waning impact of newspaper endorsements over recent years, there had been fevered speculation over who the Sun would back. It\u2019s the first time since 2005 that the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid has endorsed Labour and the editorial outlining its case is decidedly lukewarm, labelling Starmer an \u201cex-remainer\u201d who wants \u201ccloser ties with Brussels\u201d. It does however praise him for \u201cdragging his party back to the centre ground of British politics\u201d. The Times \u2013 another Murdoch-owned paper \u2013 also offered cautious support for Starmer. The historic scale this election is underline in its headline: \u201cLabour set for \u2018biggest majority since 1832\u2019\u201d. In an editorial headlined \u201cLeap in the dark\u201d, the paper states that \u201cdemocracy requires change\u201d and tellingly stopped short of urging people to vote Conservative. There is little enthusiasm in its message though, with the paper writing that \u201cSir Keir has left the British people with little clue as to his intentions in government\u201d. The Mail carries no such equivocations, with its front page dominated by a warning that votes for Reform will ensure a Labour victory. The headline reads \u201cVote Farage, get them \u2026\u201d above a picture of Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner. The paper\u2019s election day edition promises a tactical voting guide, that reads \u201cIf Labour win today, I warn you not to own a home, run a business, drive a car\u201d; a clear allusion to former Labour leader Neil Kinnock\u2019s celebrated speech, in the days before the 1983 election. North of the border, the Mail\u2019s Scottish edition tells voters to \u201cBack Rishi and beat the SNP\u201d, accompanied by a full page image of Nicola Sturgeon who resigned as first minister more than a year ago. Scotland\u2019s Daily Record also turns to recent political history, with a reference to Shepard Fairey\u2019s iconic \u201cHope\u201d poster of Barack Obama. Under an image of Keir Starmer shaded in red and blue, the paper urges voters to back Labour with the headline \u201cChange\u201d. The front page of Scotland\u2019s National reads as a direct rebuke to the Record\u2019s headline, with \u201cChange? What Change?\u201d Outlining the areas in which the paper believes Starmer\u2019s Labour will be identical to the Tories, the front page concludes by stating \u201cin Westminster nothing ever changes\u201d. Across the entirety of its front page, the Express urges Britain to \u201cVote Tory\u201d. Above the headline, the paper appears to take some time to convince itself of its position, acknowledging that frustration at the government is \u201cunderstandable\u201d and that it is the right of all voters to register there \u201cprotest\u201d, however it concludes by saying it will carry the \u201ctorch of Conservatism until it is burning bright again.\u201d The i reports that \u201cLabour\u2019s lead narrows in final poll but Starmer still on course for landslide\u201d. The paper notes that \u201cmost cabinet minister fear for their futures\u201d. The Financial Times says that Starmer is poised for a \u201c200-plus majority\u201d. \u201cTories braced for bleak night as polls put Labour on track for landslide win\u201d, is the paper\u2019s headline. Telegraph readers would be forgiven for forgetting there was an election on, with only one small story on \u201cpostal vote chaos\u201d indicating that it\u2019s polling day. The paper\u2019s main headline reads \u201cHomeowners face council tax raid under Labour\u201d. Finally, the Star\u2019s front page simply carries a picture of a pair of oversized clown shoes and the headline \u201cToodle pip!\u201d. The paper\u2019s front page story is just five lines long and reads \u201cRemeber Bozo. Remember Partygate. Remember Lettuce Liz. Remember Rishi and D-Day. Remember to vote.\u201d Today is the day! With one hour to go, in caravans, castles, cricket clubs, and, who knows, a laundromat, a hairdresser, someone\u2019s living room across the UK, staff at polling stations are on their way to unlock the doors, or inside making tea, or thumping a pile of ballot papers on a desk to get them straight, as they prepare to open in what is likely to be a particularly memorable election. As Britons prepare fill their ballots in today, Labour is in the lead over the Conservatives. We will be bringing you results as they happen after polls close at 10pm BST. Today is about the fun and excitement and power, even, of voting with me, Helen Sullivan, and my colleagues Martin Belam, L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong, Amy Sedghi and Andrew Sparrow. Our political reporters will be sending analysis and news live from around the country. It is, for journalists, a day that is about consuming many, many biscuits. We\u2019ll be with you throughout the day, night and all of Friday as results come in. Let\u2019s begin."

            "title": "Kamala Harris closing gap on Trump in tight 2024 race, polls show",
            "date": "2024-07-26T11:00:48Z",
            "content": "A spate of opinion polls carried out since Joe Biden abandoned his presidential campaign last Sunday show the vice-president, Kamala Harris, closing the gap on Donald Trump but still narrowly trailing in a tight race. While still often narrowly behind, the ability of Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, to gain ground on her Republican opponent suggests her elevation to the top of the ticket has reset the presidential race, pollsters say, especially after weeks of plummeting Democratic poll numbers under Biden. Fresh surveys carried out in battleground states show Trump ahead mostly within error margins in the swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia, while one survey showed the two are tied in Wisconsin at 47% apiece. Similarly tight margins have been reported in national polling, with Trump ahead by one point among likely voters, 48 to 47, in a New York Times/Siena poll released on Thursday - a stark contrast with the six point lead the Republican nominee held over Biden in the same poll at the beginning of July. Trump is ahead by two points in a Quinnipiac University survey already begun before Biden withdrew, one point in another from Marist College, and three points in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted over two days. Another poll from Ipsos/Reuters showed Harris with a two-point lead, 44% to 42%, while a You Gov/Yahoo survey had them tied at 46% each. While still trailing, the trend represents momentum for Harris, who has started her campaign with a rush of enthusiasm this week after being endorsed by most leading Democratic figures, including Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House of Representatives. She is also believed to be close to gaining the endorsement of Barack Obama. An aggregate of polls compiled by the Hill and Decision Desk HQ \u2013 and based on 80 polls \u2013 has Trump on 47.8% to 45.7% for Harris, a difference again within the margin of error that could essentially mean the two are tied. That\u2019s a narrower gap than the 3.3-point gap that had opened up in Trump\u2019s favor over Biden using the same aggregating methods. Patrick Murray, director of the polling institute at Monmouth University, said the movement in Harris\u2019s direction \u2013 although slight \u2013 indicated that the contest had been significantly reset by Biden\u2019s withdrawal, though much more data is likely to be needed over the coming weeks before a firmer picture emerges. \u201cBecause of the intense polarisation in the American electorate, you should never expect a lot of movement from any event, because so many people are just so dug down into their Democratic or Republican trenches that nothing will move them. So you\u2019re always fighting over a very small chunk of the persuadable electorate,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, the fact that the numbers have moved a few points suggest that there has been a reset of this election, although it doesn\u2019t tell us exactly what the trajectory is. It just simply tells us that we\u2019ve got a new election that we\u2019re looking at right now.\u201d Nevertheless, the improved Democratic numbers seem to justify the pressure put on Biden to remove himself from the party ticket following last month\u2019s baleful debate performance, which triggered a loss of confidence in his candidacy and a downward trend in his already stagnant polling numbers. \u201cThere\u2019s no question in the last month that the trajectory in a Biden-Trump race was going in Trump\u2019s favor,\u201d Murray said. \u201cWhether Democrats made the right choice or not, we won\u2019t know until November, but it was certainly the right choice at the time because it didn\u2019t look like Biden was going to be able to turn this around. \u201cThe polling is telling me \u2026 that voters are willing to take a fresh look at this campaign with Harris at the top of the ticket.\u201d The clearest indication of that is the jump in support from young voters following the sudden turnaround in the Democrat campaign. An Axios/Generation Lab poll conducted this week among voters aged 18-34 showed Harris leading Trump by 20 points, 60% to 40. This represented a quantum jump on Biden\u2019s small 6% lead. Some 45% among the cohort said they had a positive opinion of Harris, compared with 33% who said the same about Biden \u2013 and 34% who felt positively about Trump. Millennial and gen Z voters were a key component of Biden\u2019s 2020 win over Trump, turning out in large numbers. There are indications that Harris \u2013 with her focus on the threats to women\u2019s rights to abortion and stress on upholding freedoms in general \u2013 plans to target younger voters. Among swing states, Trump\u2019s biggest lead is in Arizona, where he holds a five-point, 49-44, advantage over Harris, according to polling conducted by Emerson College Polling and the Hill. Arizona, where the flow of migrants over the frontier with Mexico is a key election issue, is home to Mark Kelly, a popular Democratic US senator for the state, who is one of several figures under consideration to be Harris\u2019s running mate. Trump leads Harris by 46 to 45 points in Michigan, and 48 to 46 points in both Pennsylvania and Georgia, according to the same poll \u2013 smaller margins than he generally commanded over Biden in the weeks following the 27 June debate. Swing-state polling trends could be instrumental in Harris\u2019s choice of a running mate in the coming weeks, particularly given that two candidates in the running include the Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, and Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan. Biden won both states in 2020, along with Georgia and Arizona. \u201cThe first rule of choosing a running mate is to do no harm, because there\u2019s very little gain that you will get from a running mate, but there\u2019s a lot of harm that can be done,\u201d said Murray, who suggested Trump\u2019s choice of JD Vance as his vice-presidential candidate might fall into this category, given the notoriety being generated by his hardline anti-abortion positions and derogatory past comments on childless women. \u201cOn Kamala Harris\u2019s side, she probably should be looking at somebody who brings a key swing state with them.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-30T18:21:15Z",
            "content": "The far-right mob attack on two Israel Defense Forces bases in support of soldiers accused of sexually torturing a detainee did not come out of the blue \u2013 the parallels to a 2016 incident were immediately obvious. In March that year, Elor Azaria, an IDF soldier serving in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, calmly walked over to Abdel Fattah al-Sharif, an injured Palestinian knife attacker lying on the ground, and shot him in the head. A video of the killing released by a human rights group led to political uproar. IDF commanders and many political figures, including the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, condemned Azaria\u2019s actions as a breach of the military\u2019s ethical codes that must be prosecuted. But the right-wing reaction was swift and fierce. Polls suggested that more than half the Israeli public supported Azaria, and protests were held in his defence. Both the political and military establishments in Israel have been willing to deny or turn a blind eye to the repeated allegations of torture at Sde Teiman Netanyahu, playing to his base, appeared to change his mind: the prime minister went on to criticise his generals for investigating Azaria, and eventually joined calls for the soldier\u2019s pardon. Azaria served nine months of an 14-month sentence for manslaughter, and was released in 2018 to a hero\u2019s welcome. A retaliatory rampage carried out by Israeli settlers on the Palestinian town of Huwara in February last year was another grim incident, as are continuing well-documented war crimes such as looting, and the burning of food supplies and homes by IDF soldiers in Gaza. But until this week, government ministers had refrained from acts of violence themselves. On Monday, Israeli military police raided Sde Teiman, an IDF base in the Negev desert that has turned into a notorious Guant\u00e1namo-like detention centre for Palestinians since the war in Gaza began, arresting nine soldiers suspected of severe torture and sexual abuse of a prisoner. The detainee, a member of Hamas\u2019s elite Nukhba unit that carried out the 7 October attack, was admitted to hospital earlier this month and underwent surgery. The hospital is believed to have set off the investigation by following procedures for victims of sexual assault. What followed after news of the arrests spread was an astonishing insight into the political currents roiling Israeli society: about 200 right-wing demonstrators, including several members of the Knesset and government ministers, broke into the base in protest at the arrests and only dispersed several hours later after the reported use of teargas. Another confrontation then broke out between military police and soldiers, who barricaded themselves inside in solidarity with their arrested colleagues, Israeli media reported. There were also clashes with approximately 300 protesters at a military police base in central Israel, where demonstrators attacked journalists. The left-leaning Israeli daily Haaretz described Monday\u2019s events as evidence of a \u201cdeep moral deterioration that has developed during the long years of the occupation \u2026 along with the loosening of the rules and restraints\u201d. Allegations of abuse of Palestinians detained en masse in Gaza and held at Sde Teiman are rife, but Monday\u2019s arrests do not represent a newfound sense of responsibility towards Palestinian prisoners from the Israeli state. While the government has said it plans to move Palestinian detainees elsewhere, for now the base is still being used as a holding facility. Conditions for Palestinians held in regular Israeli prisons are not much better, and since 7 October Israel has broken international law by refusing to let Red Cross inspectors visit detention facilities. Investigations into alleged IDF abuses of Palestinians are vanishingly rare and prosecutions are even rarer. It seems that the only reason an inquiry was launched into this incident is because hospital officials who treated the victim off-base raised the alarm. If anything, it seems that heinous violence is becoming increasingly normalised in the latest round of bloodletting in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, set in motion by Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack. A recent UN report has estimated 27 detainees have died in custody on Israeli military bases and at least four more have died in the Israeli prison system from beatings or denial of medical treatment since the war began. Both the political and military establishments in Israel have been willing to deny or turn a blind eye to the repeated allegations of torture at Sde Teiman, encouraging brutal treatment of prisoners and reinforcing a culture of impunity. A key principle of international law is complementarity, which prevents the international courts of justice at The Hague from pursuing war crimes charges if they are subject to credible state-level investigations or criminal proceedings. Prosecutors there will have noted Monday\u2019s dramatic events in their efforts to determine whether Israel is able \u2013 or willing \u2013 to investigate itself. Israel\u2019s enemies will also be watching, closely following what they see as internal disunity and weakness. The IDF said in a statement on Tuesday that the attacks were damaging to national security and three combat battalions scheduled for deployment to Gaza have instead been diverted to Beit Lid. The rioting at the army bases on Monday in defence of soldiers accused of terrible crimes was not the first recent indication of the Israeli right\u2019s diminishing respect for human dignity and the rule of law. It is unlikely to be the last."

            "date": "2024-07-13T17:59:56Z",
            "content": "Mohammed Deif is the head of the military wing of Hamas and one of the masterminds of the group\u2019s bloody surprise attack on 7 October which triggered the latest war in Gaza. Israeli officials said Deif \u2013 whose real name is Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri \u2013 was the target of Saturday\u2019s airstrike, which levelled several buildings in Khan Younis and killed 90 people, according to local health authorities. Experienced, capable and utterly committed to the militant Islamist organisation, Deif has survived at least seven Israeli assassination attempts. The question is whether the 58-year-old has survived an eighth. If Israel has killed such a significant figure, this will be chalked up as a major step towards an increasingly elusive victory. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have so far only said the attack was based on \u201cprecise intelligence\u201d and \u201cstruck\u201d Deif but not that he is dead. Deif means \u201cthe guest\u201d in Arabic, a nom de guerre he owes to his effort to evade Israeli assassination attempts by moving location almost every night and staying in the homes of supporters of Hamas. He was born in 1965 in a refugee camp in Khan Younis, the southern Gaza City, one of dozens set up to house some of those Palestinians forced to flee their homes in the wars surrounding Israel\u2019s creation in 1948. His family was poor but Deif did sufficiently well at school to study for a degree in sciences from the Islamic University in Gaza, an Islamist stronghold. Deif joined Hamas when it was founded in 1987 in the first months of the first intifada, or Palestinian uprising. Working closely with Yahya Sinwar, the current leader of Hamas in Gaza, Deif soon showed a talent for military operations and internal security. In 1989, he was arrested by Israel and spent about 16 months in detention. Through the 90s, Deif helped plan and execute suicide bombings in Israel designed to derail the ongoing peace process and avenge assassinations of Hamas leaders. Deif and Hamas sources say he lost an eye and sustained serious injuries in one leg in one of Israel\u2019s past efforts to kill him. Some say he is confined to a wheelchair; others say this is not true though he has a pronounced limp. His wife, seven-month-old son, and three-year-old daughter were killed by an Israeli airstrike during the war in Gaza of 2014. In recent years, Deif has overseen Hamas\u2019 efforts both to build more effective rockets in Gaza and the immense tunnel complex across the territory. He is also thought to have been tasked with training the militants who attacked Israel last year, particularly the elite Nukhba forces. If Hamas\u2019s ability to fire rockets into Israel has been battered during the conflict and many of the Nukhba are dead, the tunnels continue to protect Sinwar and other leaders of the organisation. Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza has so far killed more than 38,000 according to Palestinian officials and reduced much of the territory to rubble. Deif is thought to have been directing military operations from the tunnels and, possibly, discreet locations above ground, though he has never been seen. There are only four known images of Deif: one in his 20s, another of him masked, an image of his shadow, which was used when an audio tape of a speech he made was broadcast on 7 October, and one found by Israel in an intelligence haul of millions of computer files during the invasion. Israeli security services will now be rushing to confirm Deif\u2019s death. This may take some time, but his passing will be hailed in Israel as a very significant achievement for the Israeli military and will be a welcome boost for the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. It would mean two of the three most senior individuals in Hamas in Gaza \u2013 described as \u201cdead men walking\u201d by top Israeli officials last year \u2013 have now been eliminated. Marwan Issa, the deputy head of Hamas\u2019 military wing, was killed in March. Sinwar remains alive."

            "date": "2024-07-25T17:19:41Z",
            "content": "North Korean state-backed hackers have mounted a campaign to obtain secrets related to nuclear materials, military drones, submarines and shipbuilding in the UK and US, as intelligence agencies warned of a \u201cglobal cyber-espionage campaign\u201d targeting sensitive industries. A joint notice from the US, UK and South Korea warned that the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) was using state-backed attackers to further the regime\u2019s military and nuclear ambitions. It added that Japan and India had also been targeted. Hackers have targeted sensitive military information and intellectual property in four main areas: nuclear, defence, aerospace and engineering. The assailants, working for a group called Andariel, have also sought to obtain secrets from the medical and energy industries. Paul Chichester, the National Cyber Security Centre\u2019s (NCSC) director of operations, said: \u201cThe global cyber espionage operation that we have exposed today shows the lengths that DPRK state-sponsored actors are willing to go to pursue their military and nuclear programmes.\u201d The NCSC said Andariel had been \u201ccompromising organisations around the world to steal sensitive and classified technical information and intellectual property data\u201d. The NCSC believes that Andariel is a part of DPRK\u2019s reconnaissance general bureau (RGB) and that the group\u2019s malicious cyber activities pose a continued threat to critical infrastructure organisations globally. The information targeted by the hackers includes data related to tanks, torpedoes, fighter aircraft, satellites, government nuclear facilities, nuclear power plants, robots and 3D printing, the NCSC said. The targeted countries include the US, UK, South Korea, India and Japan. The intelligence agencies said Andariel was funding its espionage campaign by launching ransomware attacks against the US healthcare sector. They said the attackers were likely identifying vulnerable systems using publicly available internet scanning tools. Chichester said: \u201cIt should remind critical infrastructure operators of the importance of protecting the sensitive information and intellectual property they hold on their systems to prevent theft and misuse. \u201cThe NCSC, alongside our US and Korean partners, strongly encourage network defenders to follow the guidance set out in this advisory to ensure they have strong protections in place to prevent this malicious activity.\u201d The advisory outlines how Andariel has evolved from destructive hacks against US and South Korea organisations to carrying out specialised cyber espionage and ransomware attacks. In some cases, the hackers carried out ransomware attacks and cyber espionage operations on the same day against the same victim. The US state department offered a reward of up to $10m (\u00a37.8m) for information on Rim Jong Hyok, who it said was associated with Andariel. The department said Rim and others conspired to carry out ransomware attacks on US hospitals and other healthcare providers to fund its operations against government bodies and defence firms. US law enforcement agencies believe Andariel targeted five healthcare providers, four US-based defence contractors, two US air force bases and Nasa\u2019s office of inspector general. In one operation that began in November 2022, the hackers accessed a US defence contractor from which they extracted more than 30 gigabytes of data, including unclassified technical information regarding material used in military aircraft and satellites. Unlike most other state actors, North Korea\u2019s motivations in cyberwarfare appear split between conventional military and national security goals and financial advantages. Over the past six years, according to a UN report, Korean hackers have been involved in almost 60 cyber-attacks on cryptocurrency-related companies alone, stealing an estimated $3bn. One single attack, against the crypto exchange Poloniex, seized more than $110m. \u201cThe key tasks of these cyberthreat actors are to obtain information of value to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and to illicitly generate revenue for the country,\u201d the report concluded. The hackers used any method they could to secure hard funds, including \u201cspearphishing, vulnerability exploits, social engineering and watering holes\u201d. The most damaging individual attack linked to the North Korean cyber-army was the WannaCry \u201cransomworm\u201d in 2017. The US and UK formally accused North Korea of building the virus, which the country denied. Although it appeared to be a piece of ransomware, WannaCry\u2019s payments infrastructure wasn\u2019t linked to anything, and the virus, which took down machines around the world and significantly hampered the NHS, raised just over $55,000."

            "title": "My fear of conflict is causing me to withdraw from life | Ask Annalisa Barbieri",
            "date": "2024-07-26T13:30:56Z",
            "content": "I have been afflicted by shame and guilt, leading to anxiety and very low self-esteem, all my life. Whenever I find myself in conflict initiated by another person, I am so overcome by guilt and the feeling that I must be in the wrong, that I cannot think clearly. This prevents me being able to work out at the time, whether I have actually done something wrong that requires me to address the issue, or that the other person is being unreasonable. It is not until I have had time to process what has happened, that I can understand what has occurred. By then, the moment has gone. If I do try to raise an issue of potential conflict with another person, I almost always do it in writing. I find that this way I can take time to express myself clearly. But where conflict arises on the spot, this is not an option. Because I try to avoid conflict, the situation does not often arise. However, this is often due to the fact that I let issues that I should address go. I find my inability to manage conflict and my feelings of guilt and shame are causing me to withdraw from life and become reclusive. So many people tell me they fear conflict but often it\u2019s not so much the conflict on its own that\u2019s feared, but confronting someone you think can\u2019t handle it. In this respect we anticipate trouble. And this usually goes back to a pattern learned very young in life, of having to be hyper vigilant of someone else\u2019s reaction. When you layer in guilt and shame, it becomes \u201cvery, very paralysing\u201d says psychotherapist, director of the Oxford Process and a specialist in conflict resolution, Gabrielle Rifkind. \u201cWe all,\u201d says Rifkind \u201chave these inner demons that are blaming and shaming us. What we need to do is make sense of where they came from.\u201d You may be experiencing this, points out Rifkind, because \u201csignificant people told you that you weren\u2019t good enough and were to blame and now this comes up every time there\u2019s a conflict\u201d. I wonder if you could try to work out who these significant people might be? \u201cIf you could identify who some of these voices were,\u201d says Rifkind, \u201cthey might not have the same power or control over you.\u201d Rifkind and I both liked that you know you communicate best by email. This is sensible and absolutely nothing to feel ashamed of. Many people find it better to reflect and have control over what is said. That one-way \u201cconversation\u201d can also feel safer because you only have to take responsibility for what you say, and not the other person\u2019s reaction, which I think is the thing you may be susceptible to. So email has its place but it can\u2019t be a substitute for all human interaction. \u201cConflict is very normal,\u201d says Rifkind, \u201cbut many people have difficulty with it and often avoid it or make it worse, by rubbing salt in the wound. We can usually progress, when we have time to think and find a language to communicate that the other person can hear.\u201d So we think that finding the root of this \u201cshame and guilt\u201d and fear of conflict is a really good idea to help you move forward. But in the moment here are some tips. Rifkind suggested some tactics to try next time this happens: \u201cYou could say something like \u2018I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m comfortable with this, can we talk about it later?\u2019\u201d, to give you time to reflect on what\u2019s happening and calm your nervous system down so you\u2019re not as reactive. Small silences are a great tool in confrontation. Don\u2019t be afraid to use them to buy yourself some thinking time. Also, a great phrase is \u201cwhat do you mean by that?\u201d which can encourage both of you to think cognitively rather than reactively. We often want to lash out, or run away, if we find conflict uncomfortable. With time, you could try to work out what\u2019s your stuff and what\u2019s theirs: you can only take responsibility for your own behaviour and not anyone else\u2019s.

            "date": "2024-07-25T17:33:35Z",
            "content": "The broadcaster beIN Sports requested that every player in Ligue 1 next season wear a Visit Qatar badge on their shirt for games shown live, as part of negotiations for its new TV deal, according to senior figures at French clubs. Multiple sources claim the request was made on behalf of the Qatari-owned company by its chairman, Nasser al-Khelaifi, who is also the president of Paris Saint-Germain, during a meeting between the presidents of several Ligue 1 clubs this week. A source close to the discussions at beIN Sports and PSG strenuously denied any such request was made. One owner, who did not want to be named, described it as \u201can attempt to build a captive league\u201d. This month, the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) announced it had reached an agreement for Dazn to show the vast majority of live Ligue 1 matches until 2029, with beIN Sports paying \u20ac100m a season for one primetime match a week. The deal with Dazn is believed to have been ratified by the LFP\u2019s board on Thursday but negotiations with beIN Sports are ongoing owing to what sources have described as the \u201cextremely complex\u201d nature of its offer. It is understood its original agreement with the LFP included only \u20ac50m a season in TV rights, with the rest made up in sponsorship deals. According to the French newspaper L\u2019\u00c9quipe, the LFP has negotiated the sponsorship element down to 20% in recent days. Senior club figures said a request for players to wear Visit Qatar badges had caused major friction. \u201cWhat if I want to bring in Saudi money as an investor?\u201d one said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to build a captive league. It\u2019s my understanding after the call among the presidents that there are a lot of new terms that are being put on the table.\u201d The source at PSG and beIN Sports described the claims as \u201can outrageous campaign from those clubs who want to launch an LFP channel direct, rather than have traditional broadcasters\u201d. Dazn is set to pay \u20ac400m a season for eight out of the nine matches in each round, although the agreement is believed to contain an exit clause after two years if it does not reach 1.5 million subscribers. Its deal represents a significant reduction in the \u20ac800m contract signed by Mediapro in 2018 despite the LFP president Vincent Labrune\u2019s prediction that the next round of TV rights would reach the \u20ac1bn mark. He had floated the idea of an in-house TV channel in partnership with Warner Bros Discovery\u2019s Max streaming service before agreeing the deal with Dazn and beIN Sports. The LFP did not respond to a request for comment."

            "date": "2024-07-26T10:00:47Z",
            "content": "After months of stonewalling by Georgia prosecutors, defense attorneys were allowed on Tuesday to visit the forest at the center of the state\u2019s criminal conspiracy case against a movement opposing the police training center colloquially known as \u201cCop City\u201d \u2013 only to come away frustrated by how much things had changed on the ground. The attorneys also found confusion about where arrests and alleged crimes occurred during the last two years, according to a handful who spoke to the Guardian. \u201c[W]e were provided very little to no guidance as to the alleged location of \u2026 events such as \u2026 arrests, camp sites or locations of any other police or protest activities that are part of the case,\u201d said Drago Cepar, one of at least 30 attorneys who visited the South River Forest south-east of Atlanta. Several attorneys told the Guardian they asked deputy attorney general John Fowler about such details, only to have the prosecutor say he didn\u2019t know, or give answers later confirmed to be incorrect. Although the attorneys hiked for several hours in a wooded area spanning hundreds of acres that include a public park and the Cop City construction site, Fowler basically told them, \u201cgo and look around\u201d, Cepar said. One thing several attorneys were able to confirm: any defendants arrested in the public park where protesters camped for more than a year could not have been \u201ctrespassing\u201d, as arrest warrants alleged. Signs are now posted in that part of the forest saying the area has been off limits to the public only since DeKalb county closed down the park in March 2023 \u2013 after all arrests occurred. Still, the visit was frustrating, they said. Several attorneys noted that the state prohibited them from bringing their clients to the forest, which the state calls a \u201ccrime scene\u201d. This added to the difficulty locating scenes of arrests and alleged crimes. \u201cWithout having the clients physically with us, it was impossible to know exactly where things happened,\u201d said Xavier de Janon, who filed a motion with Fulton county superior court earlier this month seeking to have all charges related to arrests in the forest dismissed due to the state\u2019s refusal to schedule the visits. De Janon\u2019s motion was the second in recent weeks centering on Fowler\u2019s apparent mishandling of the case. Another filed in late June highlighted how the deputy attorney general violated attorney-client privilege by sharing emails between defendants and their attorneys with Atlanta police investigators \u2013 instead of excluding them from evidence. De Janon and other attorneys had petitioned the state to visit the forest for at least seven months. After public pressure and media coverage bringing the motion to light \u2013 including in the Guardian \u2013 and after Fowler blew past a court-ordered June deadline, the attorney general\u2019s office finally relented, spreading the visits out over this week and last. The state\u2019s case centers on Rico, or criminal conspiracy law \u2013 originally developed to prosecute the mafia. It names 61 people in what experts have told the Guardian is the largest number of defendants ever in a Rico case involving a protest or social movement. The state\u2019s indictment, handed down on 29 August 2023, mentions the word \u201cforest\u201d 310 times in 109 pages, according to De Janon\u2019s motion. The Cop City training center is being built on a 171-acre footprint in the forest. A wide range of local and national protesters have expressed concerns from unchecked police militarization to clearing forests in an era of climate crisis. Atlanta police and the Atlanta Police Foundation say the center is needed for \u201cworld-class\u201d training. Twenty-three of the defendants were arrested on 5 March 2023 \u2013 including De Janon\u2019s client, James \u201cJamie\u201d Marsicano. A music festival was held on that date in Intrenchment Creek Park, the public park separated from the Atlanta-owned Cop City site by the creek that gives the park its name. As many as 1,000 people visited the festival or camped in the park during the March \u201cweek of action\u201d held in opposition to the training center. In the late afternoon, at least 100 people, most wearing masks, left the festival\u2019s site and walked nearly a mile to the construction site, where they burned equipment and set off fireworks, chasing off Atlanta police \u2013 who filmed the acts. But attorneys were also prevented from visiting the construction site, now fenced off from the surrounding forest. This also made the experience \u201cincomplete\u201d, De Janon said. Another clear issue is that Intrenchment Creek Park has been closed to the public for 16 months, and the training center site cleared of trees and under construction, meaning the state\u2019s alleged \u201ccrime scene\u201d has changed greatly. \u201cAll you can do is get a feel for the land,\u201d said attorney Brian Tevis. \u201cIf this site visit were to be of more value, it probably should have occurred shortly after arrests occurred,\u201d he said. Several attorneys noted how large and beautiful the forest is \u2013 secondary-growth woods filled with loblolly pines and water oaks. \u201cI had no idea such a forest existed, and so close to the city,\u201d said attorney Suri Chadha Jim\u00e9nez. The state permitted De Janon to bring an expert \u2013 Jacqueline Echols, board president of the South River Watershed Alliance, who has been visiting the forest for nearly 15 years. She was most stirred when looking over the construction site. \u201cIt\u2019s an ecological disaster,\u201d Echols said. \u201cThe land has been stripped down to clay, the topsoil has been cleared \u2026[I]t would take a long time for this land to heal enough to support life.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-08T10:00:45Z",
            "content": "The state of Georgia has dragged its feet for months on allowing defense attorneys to visit the forest where a criminal conspiracy allegedly operated in opposition to the \u201cCop City\u201d police training center, according to a motion filed this week and the Guardian\u2019s reporting. In his motion filed in Fulton county superior court, attorney Xavier de Janon is seeking to dismiss all charges related to the South River Forest, located south-east of Atlanta \u2013 for his client and for dozens of others. The forest\u2019s importance to the case is underlined by the fact that the indictment mentions the word, \u201cforest\u201d, 310 times in its 109 pages, according to the motion. Since January, deputy attorney general John Fowler has failed to schedule a visit to the alleged \u201ccrime scene\u201d, all while construction of the $109m training center has proceeded apace, according to the motion. Judge Kimberly Esmond Adams ordered Fowler at a court conference in early May to schedule visits by the end of June, adding that the jury in an eventual trial may also need to visit the site. Fowler sent an email to the more than 70 attorneys involved in the case shortly thereafter \u2013 but never followed up to schedule visits, effectively ignoring the judge\u2019s deadline. \u201cMaterial, exculpatory evidence has been forever lost\u201d due to months of construction, the motion asserts. The Guardian confirmed that other defense attorneys in the case have not been able to schedule visits to the construction site and surrounding forest. One attorney sent emails to Fowler \u201cat least six times\u201d about the matter \u2013 only to be ignored. The attorney general and Atlanta police did not return requests for comment. De Janon\u2019s motion is the second in recent weeks centering on Fowler\u2019s apparent mishandling of the case. Another filed in late June highlighted how the deputy attorney general violated attorney-client privilege by sharing emails between defendants and their attorneys with Atlanta police investigators \u2013 instead of excluding them from evidence. The Guardian confirmed these actions as well. The attorneys behind that motion filed another one 3 July asking the judge to schedule a hearing as soon as possible on the violation and their petition to disqualify Fowler and the \u201cstate law department\u201d from the case, asserting that \u201cthis is not a matter that should await consideration by the court\u201d. Fowler said in the same May court conference he did not think police were using Signal to communicate about Cop City \u2013 despite being presented by defense attorneys with evidence from the Guardian of law enforcement leadership ordering officers to download the encrypted phone app last year for that very purpose. The case centers on the state\u2019s use of Rico, or criminal conspiracy law \u2013 originally developed to prosecute the mafia. It names 61 people in what experts have told the Guardian is the largest number of defendants ever in a Rico case involving a protest or social movement. Twenty-three of them were arrested on 5 March 2023 \u2013 including De Janon\u2019s client, James \u201cJamie\u201d Marsicano. On that date, a music festival was held in Intrenchment Creek Park, a DeKalb county public park separated from the Atlanta-owned Cop City site by the creek that gives the park its name. As many as 1,000 people camped or visited the festival in the park during the March \u201cweek of action\u201d held in opposition to the training center. In the late afternoon at the festival, at least 100 people, most wearing masks, left the site of the festival and walked nearly a mile to the construction site, where they burned equipment and set off fireworks, chasing off police. Atlanta police filmed these acts. Within several hours, dozens of officers swarmed the forested public park as the sun set, creating a chaotic scene that included children running through the forest and teams of festival attendees negotiating their departure from the park with police. The arrests happened in the park, not at the construction site. Other defendants in the Rico case have also been arrested in the park \u2013 which, like the Cop City site, is part of South River Forest, or Weelaunee Forest to activists \u2013 a Muscogee (Creek) term. De Janon and other defense attorneys \u201chave never been able to set foot in the forest after the indictment\u201d \u2013 or since 29 August 2023 \u2013 the attorney told the Guardian. The state has provided photos and maps, but that does not substitute for walking through the forest \u2013 from where the construction equipment burned to where Marsicano was arrested, for example. \u201cWhen I read the indictment, I can\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d De Janon said. DeKalb county closed Intrenchment Creek Park to the public shortly after the festival. Joe Peery knows nearly every inch of the forest, on both sides of the creek. He has biked and walked there for more than a decade, created or maintained about six miles of trails himself, and led hundreds of people on tours. \u201cBy visiting the site \u2013 the exact, specific places \u2013 they would learn exactly how far away the music festival was from Cop City,\u201d Peery said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good hike.\u201d \u201cIt only benefits [the state] to keep everything hazy \u2013 given the fact that most people arrested [in the Rico case] were in a public park,\u201d he added. Actually seeing the alleged \u201ccrime scene\u201d is important \u201cnot only for the allegations my client is facing \u2013 but all other counts involving things that allegedly happened in the forest\u201d, the attorney said. Nolan Huber-Rhoades has been filming a documentary on the movement against Cop City for most of its four years, and was at the forest 5 March of last year. \u201cBeing there in person, you can understand the complexities of the land, the nuances of ownership and the legal proceedings around the forest,\u201d he said. \u201cThis information could sway a jury.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-09T22:59:32Z",
            "content": "In a make-or-break speech at the Nato anniversary summit in Washington DC, Joe Biden delivered a forceful speech about the importance of the alliance. Meanwhile, Democrats in Washington continued to scramble over the party\u2019s prospects in November as focus remained on Biden\u2019s ability to lead and keep the White House. But no groundswell has formed against the president, and it appeared most Democrats would remain quiet while Biden stayed on the ticket. Here\u2019s what has happened so far today: After a Senate Democrats lunch meeting, Democrats tried to avoid most direct questions about Biden, with some saying they were united in defeating Donald Trump, sidestepping Biden\u2019s role in that. Majority leader Chuck Schumer and Senator John Fetterman both reiterated they were with Biden, but it was far from a universal view. Vermont senator Peter Welch said \u201cwe\u2019ve got a ways to go\u201d to find a consensus. The White House defended against repeated questions about Biden\u2019s health and mental acuity, and the White House\u2019s candor (or lack thereof) on these issues, in a press briefing. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said Biden is committed to serving a full four years again and is physically and mentally able to, according to his medical team. Several questions revolved around Parkinson\u2019s disease, with reporters pressing over why Biden has not been screened for it. Jean-Pierre said his medical team doesn\u2019t believe testing is warranted. House Democrats left a meeting this morning about Biden\u2019s fate downtrodden, with many not giving comment to waiting reporters. Some key players \u2013 like the Congressional Black Caucus and Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez \u2013 stood by Biden. But one representative, Steve Cohen of Tennessee, said that not only is the party not on the same page about Biden, but they are \u201cnot even in the same book\u201d. Biden and House speaker Mike Johnson both confirmed they will meet at some point this week with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy with the Nato summit in town. Biden spoke at the Nato anniversary summit, and the imporance of an alliance that Trump has threatened to undermine. \u201cThe American people understand what would happen if there was no Nato,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey know we\u2019re strong with our friends, and we understand this is a sacred obligation.\u201d He awarded Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg the presidential medal of freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. At a campaign event in Nevada, Kamala Harris doubled down on her support of Biden, describing the embattled president as a \u201cfighter\u201d as she warned Trump would turn the country from a democracy into a dictatorship if he were re-elected to the White House in November. Representative Maxine Waters, the most senior woman in the Congressional Black Caucus, remained supportive of Biden\u2019s candidacy \u201cI\u2019ve absolutely come to the conclusion that we have to move forward with Joe Biden,\u201d Waters told Zerlina Maxwell on SiriusXM\u2019s Mornings with Zerlina. \u201cNumber one, I think there is a problem with logistics and timing and all of that, and reorganizing what has been done with the Democratic National Committee. So there\u2019s a practical problem, but the other problem is this, the man has been a good president.\u201d Maxwell praised Biden\u2019s choice of Kamala Harris as his vice-president, as well as policies and reforms she said have benefitted Black Americans: And with the Black community, you know, the man chose a Black woman to be vice-president. He put a Black woman on the United States supreme court for the first time in the history of this country. He supported and funded the HBCUs, our community colleges and universities. And so recognizing some of the health needs and the problems that we have, he put a cap on insulin \u2026 So I don\u2019t have any complaints about him. If I have any complaints at all, it\u2019s that he has not, and I, and others have not done enough to communicate his accomplishments. And so that\u2019s where I am. The White House has sent out more details on an air defense package for Ukraine. In a joint statement with Dutch prime minister Dick Schoof, German chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, Romanian president Klaus Iohannis, and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the allies said that Ukraine would receive additional strategic air defense systems. Today, we are announcing that, collectively, we are providing Ukraine with additional strategic air defense systems, including additional Patriot batteries donated by the United States, Germany, and Romania; Patriot components donated by the Netherlands and other partners to enable the operation of an additional Patriot battery; and an additional SAMP-T system donated by Italy. These five strategic air defense systems will help to protect Ukrainian cities, civilians, and soldiers, and we are coordinating closely with the Ukrainian government so that these systems can be utilized rapidly. We are working on a further announcement this year of additional strategic air defense systems for Ukraine. In addition, in the coming months, the United States and partners intend to provide Ukraine with dozens of tactical air defense systems, including NASAMS, Hawks, Iris T-SLM, Iris T-SLS, and Gepard systems. These systems will further expand and strengthen Ukraine\u2019s air defense coverage. Several allies \u2013 including Canada, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom \u2013 will continue to play an integral role in the provision of these systems, and many other supporters of Ukraine will assist in the provision of interceptors. For its part, the United States will re-sequence planned deliveries of foreign military sales of critical air defense interceptors in coordination with partners so they are delivered to Ukraine, providing Ukraine with hundreds of additional air defense interceptors over the next year. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris was speaking at a campaign event in Nevada. She doubled down on her support of Joe Biden, describing the embattled president as a \u201cfighter\u201d as she warned Donald Trump would turn the country from a democracy into a dictatorship if he were re-elected to the White House in November. The vice-president alluded to Biden\u2019s struggles since his calamitous debate performance last month. \u201cWe always knew this election would be tough, and the past few days have been a reminder that running for president of the United States is never easy,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut the one thing we know about our president, Joe Biden, is that he is a fighter. He is a fighter and he is the first to say, when you get knocked down, you get back up.\u201d An audience member shouted back: \u201cYes, we all know.\u201d Voters face the \u201cmost existential, consequential and important election of our lifetime\u201d, Harris warned at the event focused on Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) communities. Harris, the first person of south Asian descent to serve as vice-president, noted that Trump \u201cconsistently incites hate\u201d, including towards the AANHPI communities. \u201cSomeone who vilifies immigrants, who promotes xenophobia, someone who stokes hate, should never again have the chance to stand behind a microphone,\u201d she added. The president was forceful, and in his comfort zone tonight. This may not be enough reassurance for critics who worry about his performance during unscripted moments, but reading from a teleprompter, Biden delivered a speech without any hitches. Although he did not mention Donald Trump by name, he spoke of the broad US support for the alliance, and quoted Reagan in a nod to the bipartisan history of the US\u2019s commitment to Nato. \u201cThe American people understand what would happen if there was no Nato,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey know we\u2019re strong with our friends, and we understand this is a sacred obligation.\u201d \u2022 This post was amended on 10 July 2024 to correct the spelling of Ronald Reagan\u2019s surname. Joe Biden awarded Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg the presidential medal of freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. He also apologized to Stoltenberg\u2019s wife for keeping him in the job for so long. The president also quoted Ronald Reagan: \u201cIf you are not at peace, we are not at peace.\u201d He highlighted the importance of defending \u201cfellow democracies\u201d. \u2022 This post was amended on 10 July 2024 to correct the spelling of Ronald Reagan\u2019s surname. He said: Before this war Putin thought Nato would break. Today, Nato is stronger than it\u2019s ever been in its history ... The war will end with Ukraine remaining a free and independent country. Russia will not prevail. The US and partners will be providing Ukraine with dozes of new tactical air defense system, Biden announced. \u201cAll told Ukraine will receive hundreds of additional interceptors,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to host you in this milestone year,\u201d Biden said. He highlighted the strength of the alliance and progress since he took office. \u201cToday, Nato is better resourced than it ever has been. I want to pause on this because it\u2019s significant,\u201d he said. More Nato allies now are now paying dues \u2013 2% of their GDP \u2013 than ever before. Joe Biden is now taking the stage for his address. \u201cHistory was watching\u201d when leaders first came together to sign the Nato treaty in 1949, Biden began. Nato leaders have been emphasising that a record number of members, 23 out of 32, now meet a commitment first agreed 10 years ago to spend 2% of GDP on defence. Trump has repeatedly complained that smaller Nato countries do not \u201cpay their dues\u201d and this year threatened not to defend any country that was \u201cdelinquent\u201d. More recently, allies of Trump have argued that if elected again the Republican would demand a reorientation of Nato where European countries would be asked to increased defence spending further, while the US focuses more on China. But such is the size of the US defence budget \u2013 $860bn, two-thirds of the total of all Nato members \u2013 that it would be difficult for European countries to replace a significant reallocation of resources from a Trump White House and to continue supporting Ukraine at the existing level of about \u20ac40bn a year. On Monday Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House of Representatives and a leading Trump ally, said that while Republicans valued the military alliance and would stand by member countries in preventing conflict, \u201cwe also believe that Nato needs to be doing more\u201d. Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, started by highlighting the history of Nato. \u201cOur alliance was created by people who have lived through two devastating world wars,\u201d he said. The alliance is \u201cone for all and all for one\u201d, he added. He also noted that Nato\u2019s alliance was \u201cnever a given\u201d. The event tonight is taking place at the Mellon Auditorium, where the Nato treaty was first signed in 1949. A highlight reel showing clips from the end of the second world war and the cold war, featuring clips from John F Kennedy, Ronald Regan and finally Joe Biden is playing before Biden takes the stage. Joe Biden walked on stage, along with Nato allied leaders and Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general. All eyes will be on the president tonight as he fights to redeem his political prospects and convince skeptics that he can win the election. The president has said that his performance at the summit, which is commemorating 75 years of the transatlantic alliance and his work at the summit, will be a good way to judge his capabilities. Today\u2019s speech is especially high stakes. Biden is reeling from a disastrous performance at the presidential debates, and this speech will be his first major public address since then. The public will be watching closely for any flubs. Biden is likely to highlight his foreign policy record \u2013 and his administration\u2019s commitment to strengthening Nato. Donald Trump, meanwhile, has emphasized an \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach and said that he would not defend Nato members if the came under attack. He has also questioned the amount of aid the US has provided to Ukraine in its defense against Russia\u2019s invasion. Mikie Sherrill, a representative of New Jersey is the seventh congressional Democrat to ask Biden to step down. \u201cI realize this is hard, but we have done hard things in pursuit of democracy since the founding of this nation. It is time to do so again,\u201d she wrote in a statement. The White House clarified on Monday that Joe Biden has not seen a neurologist outside of his annual physicals, following a heated exchange between the president\u2019s press secretary and journalists seeking an explanation for why a Parkinson\u2019s disease specialist visited the White House eight times in as many months. In an evening letter the White House physician, Kevin O\u2019Connor, said the specialist, Kevin Cannard, has been a neurology consultant to the White House medical unit since 2012. He said Cannard had visited multiple times a year since then, and that the neurologist was chosen for his breadth of experience and expertise. \u201cSeeing patients at the White House is something that Dr Cannard has been doing for a dozen years,\u201d O\u2019Connor wrote. \u201cDr Cannard was chosen for this responsibility not because he is a movement disorder specialist, but because he is a highly trained and highly regarded neurologist here at Walter Reed and across the Military Health System, with a very wide expertise which makes him flexible to see a variety of patients and problems.\u201d He added that Cannard was the neurologist who had examined Biden for his three annual physicals since becoming president. Biden\u2019s last medical examination in February had not shown \u201cany cerebellar or other central neurological disorder, such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\u2019s or ascending lateral sclerosis, nor are there any signs of cervical myelopathy\u201d, O\u2019Connor wrote. The letter, which O\u2019Connor said he was releasing with the permission of both Biden and Cannard, followed intense speculation about the president\u2019s cognitive powers following last month\u2019s stumbling performance in a debate with Donald Trump in Atlanta, in which he repeatedly appeared confused and lost his train of thought. Later today, Joe Biden will be speaking at the Nato summit in Washington, DC. Dan Sabbagh and Andrew Roth report: World leaders flew into Washington DC on Tuesday for a two-day Nato summit where they are expected to agree to enhanced military support for Ukraine against a backdrop of questions about Joe Biden\u2019s mental sharpness. Britain\u2019s new prime minister, Keir Starmer, and Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, were among those arriving at the US capital amid a warning that Russia could step up missile strikes on Ukraine this week, repeating a barrage that killed at least 38 on Monday. The summit is expected to agree to a fresh package of military aid for Ukraine, including at least four additional Patriot air defence systems and progress on supplying F-16 fighters, to help Kyiv better fend off devastating Russian attacks. Concerns about Biden and his ability to defeat Trump hang over the summit, given Trump\u2019s past scepticism about Nato and uncertainty about whether he would be willing to continue to supply large volumes of military aid. Nato leaders have been emphasising that a record number of members, 23 out of 32, now meet a commitment first agreed 10 years ago to spend 2% of GDP on defence. Trump has repeatedly complained that smaller Nato countries do not \u201cpay their dues\u201d and this year threatened not to defend any country that was \u201cdelinquent\u201d. More recently, allies of Trump have argued that if elected again the Republican would demand a reorientation of Nato where European countries would be asked to increased defence spending further, while the US focuses more on China. Democrats in Washington continued to scramble over the party\u2019s prospects in November as focus remained on Joe Biden\u2019s ability to lead and keep the White House. But no groundswell has formed against the president, and it appeared most Democrats would remain quiet while Biden stayed on the ticket. Here\u2019s what has happened so far today: After a Senate Democrats lunch meeting, Democrats tried to avoid most direct questions about Biden, with some saying they were united in defeating Trump, sidestepping Biden\u2019s role in that. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator John Fetterman both reiterated they were with Biden, but it was far from a universal view. Vermont senator Peter Welch said \u201cwe\u2019ve got a ways to go\u201d to find a consensus. The White House defended against repeated questions about Biden\u2019s health and mental acuity, and the White House\u2019s candor (or lack thereof) on these issues, in a press briefing. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said Biden is committed to serving a full four years again and is physically and mentally able to, according to his medical team. Several questions revolved around Parkinson\u2019s disease, with reporters pressing over why Biden has not been screened for it. Jean-Pierre said his medical team doesn\u2019t believe testing is warranted. House Democrats left a meeting this morning about Biden\u2019s fate downtrodden, with many not giving comment to waiting reporters. Some key players \u2013 like the Congressional Black Caucus and Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez \u2013 stood by Biden. But one representative, Steve Cohen of Tennessee, said that not only is the party not on the same page about Biden, but they are \u201cnot even in the same book\u201d. Biden and House speaker Mike Johnson both confirmed they will meet at some point this week with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy with the Nato summit in town. Coming up today, Biden is expected to speak at Nato, while Trump is expected to hold a rally in Florida, a return to the campaign trail after acting more subdued after Biden\u2019s debate performance. Senate Democrats were tightlipped leaving their weekly lunch, after an hours-long discussion about the viability of Biden\u2019s candidacy. Few wanted to speak to reporters, save for Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who stressed Democrats were firmly united behind the goal of defeating Donald Trump. Of course, the question is whether Biden is the candidate that can do that. Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, one of the president\u2019s most vocal supporters following his debate, believes he is, though he appeared to acknowledge his view was not universally held among his colleagues. \u201cHe\u2019s our guy,\u201d Fetterman told reporters. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer deflected questions about Biden\u2019s ability to win the White House in November, repeating three times: \u201cI\u2019m with Joe.\u201d Just like this morning, several senators dodged reporters, darting to the Senate floor to vote or ducking onto the elevator. Senator Debbie Stabenow, the Michigan Democrat who is retiring at the end of the year, declined repeatedly to say whether some Democrats had called on Biden to exit the race. So far no Democrats have said so publicly. Calling the meeting a \u201cprivate family discussion\u201d she said Biden had been \u201cthe best president Michigan has ever had\u201d but would not say what the best path forward was for the party. \u201cIt\u2019s in his hands,\u201d she said, apparently in reference to the president. A reporter, trying a different tack, asked her about speculation that Michigan\u2019s governor, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer, could be Kamala Harris\u2019s running mate on a very hypothetical Democratic ticket. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be exciting,\u201d she said whimsically. Through the senators\u2019 reticent, clipped commentary, it was clear they were still searching for a consensus. Surrounded by a scrum of reporters, Vermont senator Peter Welch said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a ways to go.\u201d Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said the decision to call in to MSNBC and call donors this week was Biden\u2019s because he wants to talk directly to the American people. \u201cHe\u2019s on fire, he\u2019s ready to go,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wants to get out there.\u201d Biden wants to do more appearances and talk to the press more to prove he can continue to do the work of the presidency, she said. She said Biden is accustomed to being counted out, with people saying several times in past elections that he couldn\u2019t win, pointing to the 2020 election. Fighting past those claims is the \u201cquintessential Joe Biden story,\u201d she said, concluding the press briefing. Did Biden watch the debate himself? Biden said during an ABC interview with George Stephanopoulos last week that he didn\u2019t think he did. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said she had not followed up with Biden on this but intended to. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s seen clips,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting around-the-clock coverage, right, from all of you.\u201d The White House said Joe Biden is committed to serving a full four years if he wins in November. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said a comment that Biden made about how his health was good, \u201cit\u2019s just my brain,\u201d was a joke. \u201cHe was making a lighthearted joke as he was speaking off the cuff,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know the president, he likes to joke a lot. He\u2019s the same guy who says, I know I look 40.\u201d She also has been defending against repeated questions over Biden\u2019s health and neurological exams, particularly as it relates to concerns of Parkinson\u2019s disease that some in the press have raised. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, is defending against calls from some members of Congress for Biden to end his re-election bid or saying they are concerned about his ability to beat Trump in November. She noted the hundreds of members of Congress who had stood beside Biden as the nominee. \u201cWe do want to turn the page. You heard me say this last week. We want to get to the other side of this. We want to continue doing the work, and that\u2019s what the president\u2019s going to do,\u201d she said. A White House press briefing is under way, with the White House confirming that Joe Biden will meet with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. You can stream the press briefing live on YouTube. A new poll has some Democrats fretting over the drag Biden could have on Democrats in close races, an ongoing worry in swing districts about the lower-ticket races that could be in jeopardy if voters defect from Democrats or stay home in November. The poll of Wisconsin voters commissioned by the AARP after the presidential debate shows a shocking gap between Biden\u2019s support and support for Tammy Baldwin, the Democrat running for US Senate there. Baldwin grabbed 50% of voters compared to Republican Eric Hovde\u2019s 45%. But Biden is trailing, with 38% to Trump\u2019s 44%. It\u2019s just one poll \u2013 it\u2019s always good to keep that in mind. But this is the same voters polled on Baldwin and Biden, and the gap has Democrats concerned. Hello from the Ohio clock corridor in the Senate, where we are waiting for Senate Democrats to emerge from their weekly lunch meeting. It\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve all been together in Washington since the president\u2019s disastrous debate performance last month. No Senate Democrats have publicly called on Biden to step down, but given the president\u2019s decades of service in the chamber, their opinion and support is seen as crucial and influential as the president attempts to defuse concerns about his political viability. It comes as new polling suggests Biden may be a drag on vulnerable Democrats. Many Senate Democrats are on the defensive this cycle, defending seats in states Trump won, like Ohio and Montana. With so much at stake, dozens of reporters are gathered outside the room waiting for the lawmakers to emerge. The leaders will speak to reporters afterward. A US navy sailor tried three times, but ultimately was not able, to get access to Joe Biden\u2019s medical records from a military database, CBS News reported today. The attempts occurred in February, and the navy investigated and disciplined the sailor, described as a \u201cjunior enlisted sailor serving in the Navy\u2019s hospital corps\u201d based in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, for the attempted breach. The navy said the president\u2019s records were not accessed at any point in the attempts. One official said the sailor \u201cdid not pull up the right Joe Biden\u201d and that the sailor was looking for the records \u201cout of curiosity\u201d. After the 27 June debate, Donald Trump had kept his commentary on social media. Tonight, he will address an in-person crowd at a Florida rally. We\u2019ll be watching closely for Trump to announce a 2024 running mate, which he needs to do before the Republican national convention next week. Richard Luscombe reports on Trump and the GOP strategy of keeping quiet and letting Democrats fight after the debate: Donald Trump will host a rally in the Miami suburb of Doral on Tuesday night and break a relative \u2013 and uncharacteristic \u2013 silence over the turbulent aftermath of June\u2019s presidential debate that raised questions about Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy. A Trump campaign source and some political opponents say the former president\u2019s strategy has been to sit back and let Democrats tear into each other following Biden\u2019s dismal debate performance, intensifying calls for him to drop out of November\u2019s general election. \u201cWe\u2019re trying something new and shutting up,\u201d an anonymous campaign insider told ABC News last week, a position effectively confirmed by Trump\u2019s decision to largely avoid public appearances since a prearranged rally in Virginia the day after the 27 June debate \u2013 and to limit his posts on his Truth Social platform. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, will meet with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, tomorrow, per a media advisory from Johnson\u2019s office. Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who unsuccessfully challenged Donald Trump in the Republican primary, will release the 97 delegates she won and encourage them to vote for Trump at the Republican National Convention, Politico Playbook reports this afternoon. Haley cast the move as a push for unity among Republicans as they seek to defeat Joe Biden in November. Haley wasn\u2019t invited to attend the RNC, her spokesperson told Playbook, \u201cand she\u2019s fine with that\u201d. Another House Democrat has expressed concern about Biden\u2019s ability to win in November, joining a relatively small list of lawmakers who have spoken out against the president\u2019s candidacy. The Massachusetts representative Lori Trahan said in a statement issued today that, though she believes Biden and House Democrats have delivered \u201cunprecedented progress\u201d for Americans, she has been hearing from fellow Biden voters in her district who have \u201creal concerns\u201d over whether Biden can beat Trump. \u201cI share those concerns,\u201d Trahan said. \u201cWhile President Biden has made clear he feels he is the best candidate to win this election, nothing that has happened over the past 12 days suggests that voters see things the same way,\u201d she said, adding that she will do everything she can to ensure Democrats win the House and beat Trump. US officials announced today that they stopped a Russian \u201cbot farm\u201d that created fake social media accounts to promote pro-Russian ideals and pro-Kremlin stances on the war with Ukraine. The operation used artificial intelligence to help spread the messages, the US government said in a press release today that includes screenshots of the kind of messages the bots were posting, like videos of Vladimir Putin. Fears over foreign and domestic disinformation campaigns, especially those supercharged by AI, have floated over the US presidential election for months. More from Reuters: The alleged operation, according to prosecutors, was organized through a private intelligence organization based in Russia staffed by Russian intelligence officers and a senior employee of the Moscow-based, government-funded news outlet Russia Today, or RT. This private organization had designed a custom, AI-powered platform to create, control and manage hundreds of fake social accounts, which were made to look like real Americans, according to court documents. In total, it created roughly 1,000 accounts on social media platform X. Those profiles have since been banned. For prominent Democrats, public appearances lately involve a barrage of questions on Joe Biden\u2019s fitness for office. The California governor, Gavin Newsom, one of Biden\u2019s most vocal surrogates, answered some of these questions while eating doughnuts at a New Hampshire rest stop, the New York Times reported today. After a TV newsperson asked whether Biden should drop out, \u201cMr. Newsom chewed for a moment, reiterated the next-levelness of the doughnut, then turned to the microphone. \u2018The answer is no,\u2019\u201d the Times reported. After a meeting of Democrats at Democratic National Committee headquarters in DC today, most left without saying much. Despite some calls for Biden to step aside, there has not been a groundswell of opposition \u2013 Biden got some key support from the Congressional Black Caucus and progressive \u201cSquad\u201d representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But there doesn\u2019t seem to be much enthusiasm for Biden right now, either, and little unity in the party behind him. Not only is the party not on the same page about Biden, but they are \u201cnot even in the same book\u201d, the representative Steve Cohen of Tennessee told reporters after the morning meeting. From the Associated Press: Former Sen. Jim Inhofe, a conservative firebrand known for his strong support of defense spending and his denial that human activity is responsible for the bulk of climate change, has died. He was 89. Inhofe, a powerful fixture in Oklahoma politics for over six decades, died Tuesday morning after he had a stroke over the July Fourth holiday, his family said in a statement. Inhofe, who was elected to a fifth Senate term in 2020, stepped down in early 2023. Inhofe frequently criticized the mainstream science that human activity contributed to changes in the Earth\u2019s climate, once calling it \u201cthe greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.\u201d Democrats in the House of Representatives were tight-lipped as they left their caucus-wide meeting at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in DC this morning. Those who spoke to the press expressed support for the president. Others noted that Democrats present at the meeting had aired a range of views on whether or not Joe Biden should continue on as the Democratic party\u2019s presidential nominee. Representative Jim Clyburn told reporters after leaving that he is still \u201criding with Biden\u201d. Progressive squad member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez indicated she had spoken in Biden\u2019s support during the meeting. At the National Conservatism Conference in Washington, Senator Josh Hawley endorsed the idea of Christian nationalism. \u201cSome will say now that I am calling America a Christian nation \u2013 so I am,\u201d said Hawley during remarks at the conference on Monday. \u201cAnd some will say that I am advocating Christian nationalism \u2013 so I do.\u201d Protesters planning to march on the Republican national convention were delivered a blow when a federal judge on Monday ruled that the group could not march through the designated security zone established for the event. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously argued in a lawsuit on behalf of the Coalition to March on the RNC that the group should be allowed to rally within sight and sound of the Fiserv Forum, where the event will be held. The New York Times editorial board has issued a second call for Joe Biden to end his re-election bid \u2013 this one directed at Democratic party leaders, who the board urged to listen to the \u201cvoters who have been telling every pollster in America their concerns for a long time\u201d regarding Biden\u2019s age and prospects in a rematch against Donald Trump. The piece, which decries Biden\u2019s post-debate efforts to assuage voters\u2019 fears about his fitness as insufficient, calls on Democrats from \u201cthe grass roots to the highest levels of the party\u201d to \u201cspeak plainly to Mr. Biden\u201d and encourage him to drop out. Since the 27 June debate, Biden and his allies have denounced the push to end his campaign as an effort cooked up by pundits and party elites. In the piece, the editorial board rebuffed that notion and urged Democrats to \u201cdemonstrate that the party is no longer following him\u201d. Gretchen Whitmer, a rising star in the Democratic party and widely believed to be planning a 2028 presidential run, has repeatedly quashed rumors that she could run in Joe Biden\u2019s place this year. This morning, she reaffirmed her support for Biden and chided Democrats for \u201cclutching your pearls\u201d in response to the president\u2019s dip in the polls in some swing states. House Democrats are trickling out of the Democratic National Committee headquarters where they have been meeting to discuss Biden\u2019s campaign. Most members have refused to speak beyond voicing support for the president and his campaign. The representative Maxine Waters told a group of sweaty reporters \u2013 it\u2019s so hot \u2013 that she was behind Biden. But most are stoic or on their phones to avoid being pelted with questions. A group of progressives just left, saying they would not share any details and ignored questions about whether the party was united. With less than a week to go before the Republican national convention, Donald Trump is poised to pick a running mate. Among the figures who have emerged as likely contenders is Senator JD Vance, the Trump critic-turned Maga Republican whose 2016 memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, launched him into the political spotlight. In a Guardian column today, Jan-Werner M\u00fcller argues that if picked, Vance would pose an \u201cauthoritarian danger\u201d: Vance has perfected what, on the right, tends to substitute for policy ideas these days: trolling the liberals. Mobilizing voters is less about programs, let alone a real legislative record (Vance has none; his initiatives like making English the official language of the US are just virtue signaling for conservative culture warriors). Rather, it\u2019s to generate political energy by deepening people\u2019s sense of shared victimhood. The point for the rightist trolls is not that Democrats have all the wrong goals, but that they are hypocrites who say one thing and do another. Vance faults Trump\u2019s opponents for pontificating about the rule of law, but in practice only caring about power \u2013 an update of the \u201climousine liberal\u201d slogan for an age of rightwing autocracy. Few others would try to impress readers of the New York Times with an invocation of the Nazi legal theorist Carl Schmitt, who, in the 1930s, claimed that liberals were either weaklings or prone to betray their own ideals. Schmitt is an obscure reference to most outside the hallowed halls of Yale Law School, but a signal to cognoscenti that Vance is all in on antiliberalism. House Democrats have wrapped their caucus-wide meeting \u2013 one that almost certainly featured questions about Joe Biden\u2019s future as a candidate. Donald Trump is seeking to distance himself from the rightwing Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025, a lengthy document the group has created as a playbook for the next Republican presidential administration. But Trump\u2019s ties to Project 2025 run deep, and the playbook largely matches his agenda, Rachel Leingang reports: Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to distance himself from Project 2025 after extreme comments from one of its leaders falls flat given the extensive Trump ties and similarities between the project\u2019s policy ideas and the former president\u2019s platform. On Truth Social last week, Trump claimed to \u201cknow nothing about Project 2025\u201d and have \u201cno idea who is behind it\u201d. The disavowal from Trump came after Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, said: \u201cWe are in the process of the second American revolution, which will remain bloodless, if the left allows it to be.\u201d Project 2025 is a Heritage Foundation effort to align the conservative movement behind policies that an incoming rightwing president should undertake. The far-reaching plan, which would upend the way the federal government operates, includes a lengthy manifesto and recruitment of potential staffers for a second Trump administration. Trump\u2019s comments show that an alignment with the project could hurt him with key voters and that he doesn\u2019t appreciate being seen as someone who could be controlled by an outside group. But, in reality, Trump and Project 2025 share the same vision for where the US should go in a conservative presidency. His platform, dubbed Agenda 47, overlaps with Project 2025 on most major policy issues. Project 2025 often includes more details on how some key conservative goals could be carried out, offering the meat for Trumpian policy ideas often delivered as soundbites. In a letter to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, Joe Biden\u2019s doctor Kevin O\u2019Connor explained why \u2013 as the New York Times reported yesterday \u2013 a neurologist who specializes in Parkinson\u2019s disease has regularly visited the White House in the last eight months. According to the letter, the neurologist, Kevin Cannard, regularly holds neurology clinics for active-duty service members at the White House Medical Unit. \u201cSeeing patients at the White House is something Dr Cannard has been doing for a dozen years. Dr Cannard was chosen for this responsibility not because he is a movement disorder specialist, but because he is a highly trained neurologist here at Walter Reed,\u201d wrote O\u2019Connor. In the letter, O\u2019Connor wrote that Biden had not exhibited any signs of a neurological condition such as Parkinson\u2019s during his last annual physical. Good morning, US politics blog readers. Today we\u2019ll be continuing to keep an eye on Congress, where lawmakers are mulling how \u2013 or if \u2013 to deal with the question of whether to call on Joe Biden to halt his re-election campaign after a devastating debate performance that raised questions about his age and ability to win in November. Biden has scored the surprising and weighty endorsement of the progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), who has in the past clashed with Biden over policy. Biden\u2019s meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus also went well for the president, with members of the caucus reportedly presenting unified support for Biden. That kind of institutional support on the Hill will help Biden, but it hasn\u2019t quelled anxieties about his re-election bid \u2013 and more members of Congress could rally around his ouster still. Here\u2019s what else we\u2019re following today: House Democrats are scheduled hold a 9am all-member meeting at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington DC. Donald Trump will hold a rally in Florida this evening. With less than a week to go before the Republican National Convention, Trump is expected to name a running mate any day now. Kamala Harris will speak in Nevada on Tuesday to shore up support for the Biden-Harris ticket in the battleground state."

            "title": "Labour has left farmers facing agriculture budget \u2018cliff edge\u2019, says NFU",
            "date": "2024-07-18T15:29:49Z",
            "content": "Farmers are facing a \u201ccliff edge\u201d as the Labour government refuses to commit to maintaining the agriculture budget for England, the president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union has said. The issue is one of the first pressures Labour is facing over its tight fiscal rules, along with a rebellion on the party\u2019s refusal to remove the two-child benefit cap. Conservative MPs have said they plan to challenge the government on its failure to commit to the agricultural budget, which Labour says it will not comment on until after the spending review later this year. Since the UK left the EU, it is no longer in the European common agricultural policy, which ensured steady payments for farmers directly linked to how much land they managed. Instead, each devolved nation has its own government payments scheme. The previous government committed to spending \u00a32.4bn a year in England on payments for farmers, mostly linked to environmental improvements made on their land, to replace area-based payments similar to those in the EU scheme. However, this assurance ends at the end of the calendar year. Farmers will not hear about whether these payments will continue at current rates until the spending review in the autumn, a spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told the Guardian. This means they will have just a couple of months to plan their finances for the coming year. Government payments are even more important in years with bad weather, such as the severe floods in 2023-24, because they can partially make up for crop and livestock losses. Speaking at the NFU summer reception, its president, Tom Bradshaw, said his members were \u201cbeing kept up at night\u201d by the \u201ccliff edge\u201d that was coming as land-based payments were being phased out without certainty about the wider budget. He said he was working with the Wildlife Trusts and WWF to pressure the government to keep or increase the budget. \u201cWe know that there\u2019s a lot of other environmental organisations that are also arguing or calling for an increased budget,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will work with them and I believe there is a budget, but securing it for the future and in a ringfenced manner, and knowing how much it is, is crucially important.\u201d The NFU announced in 2019 that the farming sector would reach net zero emissions by 2040. But Bradshaw said this target would in all likelihood not be met because of a \u201clost five years\u201d under the Conservative government. \u201cThere has never been a coordinated strategic policy in place for the decarbonisation of food production,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been reliant on the government to meet that 2040 target and we have had a lost five years.\u201d He said reasons for the NFU dropping the target included renewable energy markets not having developed at the speed predicted. Farmers have been blocked from building solar on their land, grid connections have taken years and onshore wind was in effect banned until last week. Greg Smith, the Tory MP for Mid Buckinghamshire, told the Guardian his party would hold Labour\u2019s feet to the fire on the issue. He said: \u201c90% of my constituency is farmed, and our manifesto promised to increase the farming budget. Labour\u2019s barely mentioned farming and it\u2019s of note the king\u2019s speech did not either. \u201cFarming is a long-term business and farmers need to plan ahead so my farming constituents are very concerned that they will not have any certainty on this until the spending review.\u201d Speaking at the reception, the farming minister, Daniel Zeichner, said he was committed to the payment schemes but he did not commit to a budget. He said: \u201cWhen people have asked me about whether we\u2019re going to make the ongoing transition to the environmental land management schemes: absolutely.\u201d He added that \u201cstability in the sector\u201d was a goal of the new government."

            "date": "2024-07-14T06:00:42Z",
            "content": "There are 124 miles of lock-free, navigable waterways, ripe for boat exploration, in Norfolk and Suffolk\u2019s Broads national park \u2013 Britain\u2019s largest protected wetland. Sadly, a much larger four-figure number, in pounds sterling, was what kept popping up on my computer screen when I was searching for a suitable boat on which to spend a long weekend enjoying them. Thankfully, I had a plan B \u2013 or rather, a plan SUP. Standup paddleboarding used to be seen as little more than a fun way to pass an hour or two on holiday. But during the pandemic and lockdowns, sales of inflatable boards soared. Since then companies such as Devon-based manufacturer Red Equipment, iRocker and Aztron have launched a range of compact boards that, once deflated, fold to half the size, making them more transportable \u2013 and making longer adventures even easier. Since I\u2019d bought mine, a multi-day trip had been beckoning. So, after leaving work early on Friday, my partner and I jumped on a train to Norwich carrying our boards and minimal clothes for the weekend on our backs. From there it was a 30-minute (\u00a32) bus ride to Coltishall \u2013 the \u201cgateway to the Broads\u201d. If you don\u2019t have your own board they can be hired from GoPaddle in Horning from \u00a340 a day, with discounts for longer periods. We opted for affordable luxury for our first night, at the Norfolk Mead hotel, before our camping adventure. On the banks of the River Bure, this Georgian country house is also home to an award-winning restaurant where we ate Norfolk-caught sea bass, local cheeses and the regional speciality, crunch rolls (granary style, made from malted wheat grains). We woke to sunny skies and, after breakfast, picked up our pre-ordered packed lunches before going to the hotel\u2019s flower-lined water frontage. There we inflated the boards, packed and secured our bags, and set off. Moss-like stonewort intermingled with streams of ribbongrass swished as we passed over it. Trees provided a tunnelled canopy, and we peered into the huge gardens of waterside houses as we glided by. The Broads take up 0.1% of Britain, but they are home to a quarter of our country\u2019s rarest species. Occasionally, we saw the electric blue flash of a kingfisher, but more common were azure damselflies and the rare Norfolk hawker dragonfly, hitching a lift on our rafts as we navigated between waterlilies. We stopped for a snack at Belaugh, where boaters newly acquainted with their pleasure craft struggled to moor, while we slipped in effortlessly without a sound. Swans, cygnets, moorhens and grebes came to seek shelter between our boards \u2013 we had been accepted as fellow water-dwellers. It was Saturday, yet on leaving Belaugh we had seen only three boats as we twisted through narrow channels of willow and alder, the lapping sound from the dip of our paddles almost hypnotic. As we grew close to Wroxham \u2013 the \u201ccapital of the Broads\u201d \u2013 more paddleboards, pedal boats and canoes joined in what felt like an unofficial motor-free flotilla. At the riverside park we sat with our feet in the water, eating sandwiches and chatting about our route to those curious about our oversized packs. As we paddled away, the scent of food being cooked at the town\u2019s riverside pubs and cafes faded and the waterway widened. At times it felt as though we were alone in a riverine wilderness; at others, it was as though we\u2019d stumbled upon a superhighway of boaters. We stopped to give our arms a rest at Hoveton Great Broad nature trail \u2013 a walking circuit on an island at the broad of the same name, accessible only by water. In the half-hour we strolled there we spotted caterpillars and frogs, attempted to photograph red admiral butterflies and learned, courtesy of the wardens, about the practice of bio-manipulation. Fish are being kept out once they leave the broad naturally, to allow water fleas (which eat algae and thus clean the water) to bounce back in numbers, which will allow plants to grow and mean more fish. The sun was starting to set as we paddled into Salhouse Broad and our campsite. It was just a simple field with some composting toilets, but we had splurged \u00a328 on a camping pod, to avoid carrying a tent \u2013 a shrewd move, as rain began to fall within minutes of our arrival. That night we walked 20 minutes to the Fur and Feather Inn, where \u201cbeer travels metres, not miles\u201d from the onsite brewery. We sat outside admiring the thatched roof, sampling \u201cwherry\u201d amber ale (named after the large wooden sailing barges popular in the 1600s for transporting cargo, now used as luxury day-tripping vessels) before heading indoors to eat bangers and mash. We woke at dawn to a chorus of blackbird, chiffchaff and Canada geese as we packed our bags and hauled the boards back in the water \u2013 on a mission to get breakfast. A low-hanging mist wafted over the water as we went north, passing the edge of Bure marshes to arrive at Horning and a large coffee at the Staithe\u2019n\u2019Willow. There is something magical about being on the water early on a Sunday before motorboaters start their engines. We took advantage of the perfect conditions to start tackling the seven-mile paddle to the station at Acle. Before long, the bankside trees thinned, revealing windmills in various states of restoration. Almost on cue, the wind picked up, turning paddling into a workout. We took a break at the 11th-century remains of St Benet\u2019s Abbey, outside Ludham, before knuckling down to join the confluence with the River Thurne and turning south. Thanks to the rising wind, we went ashore a little early at Acle Bridge, where the pub of the same name welcomed muddy boots (and boards), rewarding our efforts with chips and a pot of tea. Then we deflated the boards, rolled them back into the bags and speed-walked to the station. As the train rocked us into a happily exhausted lull, I checked our receipts. We may not have paddled the full 124 miles, but we had enjoyed what felt like a real adventure \u2013 and one that had been remarkably inexpensive. The trip was supported by Visit Norwich. Rail travel was provided by LNER. Doubles at the Norfolk Mead hotel cost from \u00a3145 B&amp;B. Salhouse Broad offers camping from \u00a315 (for up to four people), and a camping pod for \u00a328 a night. More info from visitthebroads.co.uk. Paddleboarders on the Broads require a licence. When hiring a board the licence is part of the package"

            "date": "2024-07-10T04:00:48Z",
            "content": "European leaders at the Nato summit in Washington are focused on explaining to ordinary American taxpayers that the military alliance is worth the money, as the issue of burden-sharing has become a political football for both parties in the US \u2013 and threatens to become a serious stumbling block for the alliance should a second Trump administration come to power. \u201cThere is a debate in the United States that the US are doing a lot to support Ukraine and Europe is not doing enough. If you look at figures, it\u2019s actually a different picture. Europe is doing more than the United States: the financial support, military support we all have provided so far has been enormous \u2026 We are taking the security and defense seriously,\u201d said Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds, the president of Latvia, during a speech on Tuesday alongside the former CIA director Leon Panetta and the Estonian defense minister, Hanno Pevkur. \u201cIt\u2019s also very important to explain to the American public.\u201d In background briefings, European officials have said they have been concerned with political turmoil in the US and Europe. The US was among countries that pushed back against a multi-year financial pledge for military aid to Ukraine \u2013 in part because of the bitter fight in Congress over the Ukraine supplemental bill. \u201cWe think that this is essential to signal that Europeans are taking a greater burden of their own security,\u201d said another European official ahead of the summit. \u201cAnd it\u2019s an important message to Ukraine, to Russia \u2013 but also for domestic audience. Here in DC, we are aware of the sensitivity of that topic, and I think you can expect a lot of strategic communication on that next week.\u201d European officials are balancing concerns over the growing Russian threat in Ukraine and the political sensitivities that could further divide the alliance. \u201cWe also understand that the ordinary people, in Latvia or the United States or somewhere else, sometimes do care more about economy, social issues, internal security, and we should take those concerns seriously and address them in the same manner that we are addressing the high geopolitical issues,\u201d said Rink\u0113vi\u010ds. Polling has shown that views on Nato are subject to a partisan divide in the US, and that the alliance has become steadily less popular among Republicans in the past year. According to the Pew Research Centre, just 43% of Republicans have a positive view of the alliance, down from 49% who said the same in 2023. European leaders have taken different tacks, with some talking points seemingly tailored toward the Republican candidate as well. \u201cNato is a club, and when you have a club rules, then you respect the rules, and you expect that everybody will also respect the rules,\u201d Pefkur, the Estonian defense minister, said on Tuesday. \u201cSo Trump is a golfer, so when you pay your fee, in the golf club, you can play. Doesn\u2019t matter how big is your wallet. So when you pay that fee, you can go to the golf course and play.\u201d In a speech at the Hudson Institute on Tuesday, the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, said that he supported Nato but that he would press European leaders on fulfilling a pledge to spend 2% of GDP on defense. He also tied national security to US border security, once again reinforcing how Nato policies have become subsumed to domestic US politics. \u201cNato needs to be doing more,\u201d he said. \u201cNot all Nato members have reached their current commitment. It may even need to be closer at a level during the cold war. But if we\u2019re all going to enjoy a future of peace and prosperity, we all need to have skin in the game.\u201d Critics have said that the US is going through a period of isolationism. \u201cOn a tectonic level, our allies should understand that there is a usually isolationist instinct in this country,\u201d said Representative Jim Himes, a senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee. \u201cAnd it emerges from time to time, when economic conditions here are not good,\u201d or after moments of disenchantment like the Iraq war. \u201cWe are in that isolationist moment and it\u2019s not just Donald Trump.\u201d Others describe it as restraint. Trump is not the only one calling for the US to withdraw forces and resources from Europe, leaving Europeans to take on the burden of defending themselves. Several liberal foreign policy analysts have been calling for years for a switch to American restraint when it comes to US military projection, especially in Europe. \u201cIt is in the interest of a transatlantic alliance to shift the burden toward Europe and transition over, a decent period, maybe about a decade, toward European leadership of European defense with the United States moving to a supporting role,\u201d Stephen Wertheim a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and a leading advocate for restraint. Wertheim was one of dozens of foreign policy experts who wrote an open letter published in the Guardian urging Nato leaders not to invite Ukraine to become a member. \u201cIt could also be counterproductive insofar as Russia believes that Ukraine is advancing down this bridge to Nato membership, Russia gains an incentive to prolong the war so that that moment never arrives, so that Ukraine never crosses that bridge on the other side.\u201d"

            "content": "The US will soon announce more than $2.3bn in new security assistance for Ukraine, defense secretary Lloyd Austin said on Tuesday during a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umarov, at the Pentagon. Austin said the latest weapons package would include arms such as anti-tank weapons and air defence interceptors, and would allow accelerated procurement of Nasams (a surface-to-air missile system) and Patriot air defence interceptors. Austin also gave a nod to Ukraine\u2019s aspirations to eventually join Nato, more than two years after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. Referring to next week\u2019s Nato summit in Washington, he said, \u201cWe will take steps to build a bridge to Nato membership for Ukraine.\u201d He did not elaborate. Separately, US secretary of state Antony Blinken and the Ukrainian president\u2019s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, on Tuesday discussed Nato members\u2019 intention to bring Ukraine closer to the alliance, state department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said. A negotiated outcome with Russia, as opposed to an outright Ukrainian military victory, is now seen as the most likely outcome in most European countries, according to a major poll of 15 countries. Support for Ukraine\u2019s cause remains strong across Europe despite battlefield reverses, but European voters increasingly regard arming Ukraine as necessary not to achieve a complete Ukrainian battlefield victory, but instead to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s hand in future negotiations with Russia. Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n urged Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday to consider a ceasefire to accelerate an end to the war with Russia. \u201cA ceasefire connected to a deadline would give a chance to speed up peace talks. I explored this possibility with the president and I am grateful for his honest answers and negotiation,\u201d he said. Zelenskiy, who spoke before Orban, did not respond to those comments. The Ukrainian president has previously said Putin would not stop his military offensive even if his ceasefire demands were met, and US defence secretary Austin has noted that Putin could end the war he had started \u201ctoday if he chose to do that\u201d. Orb\u00e1n is an outspoken critic of western aid to Ukraine. His trip to Kyiv came a day after Hungary took over the rotating EU presidency until the end of the year, to the dismay of many other European politicians, given the country\u2019s frequent clashes with Brussels over domestic rule-of-law issues and foreign policy. Ukraine on Tuesday sentenced a separatist leader, Leonid Pasechnik of the breakaway Luhansk region, to 12 years in prison in absentia for signing a deal with the Kremlin that led to Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion. On 21 February 2022, Pasechnik and the Donetsk separatist leader Denis Pushilin signed a mutual assistance pact with Putin. Two days later, the pair asked Putin for military help and three days later Moscow launched its invasion that has since ravaged Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s air force commander, Mykola Oleshchuk, said on Tuesday the military had carried out a \u201cdestructive strike\u201d on a Russian ammunition depot in Moscow-occupied Crimea on Monday. \u201cOnce again, Ukrainian aircraft \u2018destroyed\u2019 by enemy propaganda continue to successfully perform combat missions,\u201d Oleshchuk said on Telegram, referring to a report by Russia\u2019s defence ministry that five Ukrainian military jets had been destroyed on an airfield in the Poltava region. A court in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don on Tuesday sentenced a 19-year-old man to 12 years in prison for allegedly donating money to Kyiv\u2019s forces. The FSB Security Service said the teen had sent money to help Kyiv\u2019s army buy drones and food for troops, the RIA Novosti news agency reported. It said the defendant was arrested at an airport as he tried to leave Russia. In St Petersburg, activist and documentary film-maker Vsevolod Korolev had his sentence more than doubled to seven years after both and he prosecutors appealed against his original jail term of three years for criticising the Ukraine offensive on social media. Korolev has been in pre-trial detention since July 2022, accused of making \u201cuntrue\u201d statements about massacres of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha. Russian attacks on the central Ukrainian city of Nikopol killed two women aged 61 and 86 on Tuesday and wounded nine other people, the regional governor said. Governor Serhiy Lysak said on the Telegram messenger that the attacks damaged residential housing, educational facilities and a clinic in the city that lies across the Dnipro River from the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant."

Supplies of western anti-aircraft systems have begun flowing faster into Ukraine after an interruption of US supplies for months because of disagreements in the US Congress. Russian forces have overrun two frontline villages in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region, a Ukrainian army sergeant said Monday, after relentless assaults that are part of a Kremlin summer push to overwhelm battlefield defenses there, Associated Press reports. Separately, attacks in Russia\u2019s Kursk region by the Security Service of Ukraine, also known as the SBU, struck a number of substations causing power outages, according to a statement from the General Staff of Ukraine. The claim of responsibility came after Russia said it thwarted a night-time Ukrainian drone attack. \u201cThey pressed non-stop\u201d to capture Vovche and Prohres, the chief sergeant of Ukraine\u2019s 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade, Oleh Chaus, told Radio Svaboda. \u201cThey sent in a large number of troops, which had not previously been used.\u201d Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry claimed in recent days that it had taken control of the villages, but the Ukrainian General Staff made no official comment. Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence agency has claimed it was involved in an ambush that killed fighters from Russia\u2019s Wagner group in the west African nation of Mali, thousands of miles away from the frontline in Ukraine. A Telegram channel linked to the Wagner leadership on Monday admitted the group had suffered heavy losses during fighting in Mali last week. Ukrainian forces are also believed to be active in Sudan, another place where Wagner troops have been heavily involved in fighting, in a further sign that Kyiv\u2019s fight with Moscow has taken on a global dimension, the Guardian\u2019s Shaun Walker reports. French President Emmanuel Macron warned his new Iranian counterpart Massoud Pezeshkian in a phone call on Monday against Iran\u2019s continuing support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said in a statement.

Japan is home to more than 50,000 US troops, but the commander for the US Forces Japan (USFJ) headquartered in Yokota in the western suburbs of Tokyo, has no commanding authority. Instead, instructions come from the United States Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) in Hawaii. The new plans will give the USFJ greater capability while still reporting to INDOPACOM. The command upgrade \u201cwill be the most significant change to the US Forces Japan since its creation and one of the strongest improvements in our military ties with Japan in 70 years,\u201d Austin said. \u201cThese new operational capabilities and responsibilities will advance our collective deterrence.\u201d \u201cWe are standing at a historic turning point as the rules-based, free and open international order is shaken to the core,\u201d Kamikawa said. \u201cNow is a critical phase when our decision today determines our future.\u201d Austin, in his opening remarks, said China is \u201cengaging in coercive behaviour, trying to change the status quo in the East and South China Seas, around Taiwan and throughout the region,\u201d adding that North Korea\u2019s nuclear program and its deepening cooperation with Russia \u201cthreaten regional and global security.\u201d In a joint statement issued after the talks, the ministers said China\u2019s foreign policy \u201cseeks to reshape the international order for its own benefit at the expense of others\u201d and that \u201csuch behaviour is a serious concern to the alliance and the entire international community and represents the greatest strategic challenge in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.\u201d China has been at odds with many countries in the Asia-Pacific for years because of its sweeping maritime claims over the crucial South China Sea. It also claims self-governing Taiwan as its territory, and intends to annex it, by force if necessary. In March, Beijing announced a 7.2% increase in its defence budget, already the world\u2019s second-highest behind the United States, marking a massive military expansion. The ministers said the changes to US command \u2013 set for March to be in line with Japan\u2019s own command updates \u2013 aimed \u201cto facilitate deeper interoperability and cooperation on joint bilateral operations in peacetime and during contingencies\u201d and enhance intelligence coordination, surveillance, reconnaissance and cybersecurity. The new US command in Japan will be led by a three-star general, not the four-star sought by Japan, but Austin said \u201cwe haven\u2019t ruled that out\u201d and will keep negotiating. Japan has long suffered from cybersecurity threats that Washington believes are of grave concern. Lately, Japan\u2019s space agency revealed it suffered a series of cyber-attacks, and though sensitive information related to space and defense was not affected, it has triggered worry and pushed the agency to pursue preventive measures. In a joint statement the ministers reaffirmed the US commitment to \u201cextended deterrence\u201d, which includes atomic weapons \u2013 amid nuclear threats from Russia and China. It\u2019s a shift from Japan\u2019s earlier reluctance to openly discuss the sensitive issue, as the world\u2019s only country to have suffered atomic attacks. Japan has been accelerating its military buildup and has increased joint operations with the US as well as South Korea while trying to strengthen its largely domestic defence industry. Japan and the US have also been accelerating arms industry cooperation after an April agreement between Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, and Biden. The two sides have set up working groups for missile co-production and for the maintenance and repair of US Navy ships and air force aircraft in the region. In Tokyo on Monday, Blinken was due to meet with counterparts from the Quad, a grouping that is viewed warily by China, for talks expected to focus on maritime security and initiatives to build up cyber defences. \u201cWe all know our region and our world are being reshaped. We all understand we face the most confronting circumstances in our region in decades,\u201d Australia\u2019s foreign minister Penny Wong said in opening remarks at the start of the talks. \u201cWe all cherish the region\u2019s peace, stability and prosperity and we all know it is not a given, we all know we can\u2019t take it for granted.\u201d With Associated Press and Reuters"

            "content": "We\u2019ll be closing this blog soon and starting a new one to cover the highly anticipated press conference by the US president, Joe Biden, to close out the Nato summit. Please do join me, L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong, on our new live blog. Here\u2019s a recap of the day\u2019s main developments: The US announced a new security package for Ukraine worth $225m, which includes a Patriot missile battery, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems and missiles, among other items. President Joe Biden told Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u201cwe will stay with you, period\u201d ahead of a bilateral meeting on Thursday. US president, Joe Biden, is scheduled to face journalists at a news conference marking the end of Nato\u2019s 75th anniversary summit at 6.30pm ET. The US president\u2019s press conference, which will include questions from reporters, is certain to be scrutinised for any signs of slip-ups. Ukraine\u2019s president Zelenskiy urged Nato allies to lift restrictions on its use of long-range weapons against targets in Russia. Zelenskiy said doing so would be a \u201cgame-changer\u201d in its war with Moscow, adding: \u201cIf we want to win, if we want to prevail, to save our country and to defend it, we need to lift all the limitations.\u201d Hungary does not want, and will not support, Nato becoming an \u201canti-China\u201d bloc, foreign minister Peter Szijjarto told Hungary\u2019s state television while in Washington DC. Speaking on the sidelines of a Nato summit, Szijjarto also said Ukraine\u2019s admission to the alliance would weaken unity within the group Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said that any possibility of a direct confrontation between Russia and Nato was \u201cworrying\u201d. He added: \u201cAny steps that could lead to this outcome should be consciously avoided.\u201d Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, will fly to Mar-a-Lago on Thursday to meet with Donald Trump, according to two sources with knowledge of the meeting. Orb\u00e1n has enraged his Nato allies by meeting with Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping en route to the alliance\u2019s summit in Washington DC. He has also met with Zelenskiy in Kyiv, and is said to be quietly negotiating his own ceasefire plan without consulting either the Biden administration or other EU countries. Biden has appeared to back Keir Starmer\u2019s ambition for the UK having a closer relationship with the EU as the leaders held their first bilateral talks at the White House on Wednesday evening. The US president called the US and the UK the \u201cbest of allies\u201d as he met the new prime minister in the Oval Office, describing the UK as the \u201cknot\u201d that tied the transatlantic relationship together. France, Germany, Italy and Poland signed a letter of intent to develop ground-launched cruise missiles with a range beyond 500km (310 miles), aiming to fill what they say is a gap in European arsenals exposed by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Speaking on the sidelines of the Nato summit in Washington DC after the signing ceremony, French defence minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu said the new missile was meant to serve as a deterrent. Norway will donate 1bn Norwegian kroner ($92.69m) in support to Ukraine for its air defence, prime minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said at the Nato summit. The donation comes a day after Norway announced it would give six F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine to help it in defence efforts against Russian air attacks. Russia will act to counter the planned US deployment of long-range missiles in Germany, the Kremlin said, as it regarded the Nato military alliance\u2019s actions as a serious threat to Russia\u2019s national security. Germany\u2019s chancellor Olaf Scholz said that France remained a key partner on the international stage as leader Emmanuel Macron struggles to build a coalition government after elections. \u201cFrance will be on the international agenda a big partner, a strong partner of all of us, and especially a partner for Germany,\u201d Scholz said at the Nato summit on Thursday. Romania, Bulgaria and Greece signed a deal to enable swift cross-border movement of troops and weapons to Nato\u2019s eastern flank, Romania\u2019s defence ministry said. The planned harmonised military mobility corridor between the three Nato and EU states was one of two such mobility corridors agreed on the sidelines of the Nato summit in Washington DC. On the face of it, it was a busy Nato summit, not short of outcomes: badly needed air defence systems and fighter jets for Ukraine and a commitment that Kyiv was on an \u201cirreversible path\u201d to membership \u2013 plus a cross-alliance warning to China for its discreet help to Russia as it continues its assault on Ukraine. Yet, behind the activity lurks the cliff-edge of the US election. In the Washington heat, the worry is not so much about Joe Biden\u2019s health, but the Democrats\u2019 ability to defeat Donald Trump in the November election. The reality is that Nato will struggle if the US is sceptical, fitful or unengaged. During the last Trump presidency, Nato survived by hunkering down, making minimal commitments during a period of less geopolitical uncertainty. This time, with a major war continuing on the edge of Europe, a dysfunctional Nato is not obviously an attractive option, but it nevertheless lingers. Read the full report here: Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said that Ukraine\u2019s future \u201cis in Nato\u201d. Stoltenberg\u2019s comments on Thursday at the ongoing Nato summit in Washington DC follow his earlier comments on Wednesday when he said Ukraine\u2019s membership to Nato is not a question of \u201cif, but when\u201d. Here are some images coming through the newswires of the ongoing Nato summit in Washington DC: The US\u2019s plan to station long-range missiles in Germany is a step towards a new cold war confrontation, Russia said on Thursday. Speaking to a state TV reporter on Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: \u201cWe are taking steady steps towards the cold war \u2026 All the attributes of the Cold War with the direct confrontation are returning,\u201d Agence France-Presse reports. Peskov\u2019s comments follow the US\u2019s argument on Wednesday that stationing long-range weapons including Tomahawk cruise missiles in Europe is a form of deterrence. Peskov went on to add that the latest move by the US is giving Russia \u201ca reason to pull together \u2026 [and] fulfill all the goals\u201d of its ongoing military operations in Ukraine. US secretary of state Antony Blinken has released a statement announcing new military assistance for Ukraine. In the statement, which was released amid the ongoing Nato summit in Washington DC, Blinken said: \u2026 the United States is sending Ukraine a significant new package of urgently needed weapons and equipment to support the Ukrainian military as it continues to repel Russia\u2019s assault. This $225m package, which will be provided under Presidential Drawdown Authority, includes: a Patriot missile battery, munitions for National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems; Stinger anti-aircraft missiles; ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems; 155mm and 105mm artillery rounds; Tube-Launched, Optically-Tracked, Wire-Guided missiles and equipment; Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems; small arms ammunition; demolitions munitions and equipment; and other ancillary equipment. The package is the eighth security assistance package that the Joe Biden administration has authorized to Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression. As we reported earlier, Nato\u2019s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg was asked during his joint press conference with Volodymyr Zelenskiy about a report of a foiled Russian plot to assassinate the head of a German arms manufacturer. According to the CNN report, US intelligence discovered earlier this year that the Russian government planned to kill Armin Papperger, the chief executive of Rheinmetall. Rheinmetall has been producing artillery shells and military vehicles for Ukraine. The plot to assassinate Papperger was one of a series of Russian plans to kill defence industry executives across Europe who were supporting Ukraine\u2019s war effort, according to the report. It says that the plan to kill the Rheinmetall CEO was \u201cthe most mature\u201d. According to the report, the US informed Germany of the plan, and German security services were able to foil the plot and protect Papperger. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during a joint press conference with Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, urged his country\u2019s allies to lift all restrictions on Ukraine conducting long-range strikes on targets inside Russian territory. The Ukrainian president said: If we want to win, if we want to prevail, if we want to save our country and to defend it, we need to lift all the limitations. Zelenskiy said he had spoken to Ukraine\u2019s allies and he had \u201cvery good messages\u201d from the UK about this, adding: We need to do very concrete steps. Zelenskiy, asked about Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s plans to meet with Donald Trump, says he hadn\u2019t been aware ahead of time about Orb\u00e1n\u2019s meetings with Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping or Trump. The Ukrainian president says he doesn\u2019t know if Orb\u00e1n will visit Kyiv again, and that \u201cthat\u2019s between us\u201d. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg asked about restrictions placed on Ukraine regarding the use of weapons to hit targets in Russian territory, noting that this is a \u201cwar of aggression\u201d launched by Russia and that Ukraine has the right to self-defence. Nato allies have the right to help and uphold Ukraine\u2019s right of self-defence \u201cwithout becoming party to the conflict\u201d, he says, but he notes that the right of self-defence includes the right to strike legitimate military targets on Russian territory. Stoltenberg notes that allies have reduced the restrictions placed on Ukraine, with countries varying in their restrictions, but that this has enabled Ukraine to strike legitimate military targets on Russian territory. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, answering a reporter\u2019s question, says Ukraine is \u201cvery close\u201d to its goal of joining Nato. The Ukrainian\u2019s president says the next step will be an invitation, and that after that will be membership, adding: I hope we will prevail. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg declines to comment on a report that the US and Germany foiled a Russian plot to assassinate the chief executive of the German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall, which has been producing artillery shells for Ukraine. Stoltenberg says he will not go into that specific report, but says that there is a \u201cpattern\u201d of Russian campaign organised by its security services to conduct \u201chostile actions\u201d against Nato allies. The purpose of this ongoing Russian campaign is to intimidate Nato allies from support Ukraine, Stoltenberg says, adding: What we have seen over the last months is that Nato allies have not been intimidated. He adds that the Russian attempt to intimidate Ukraine\u2019s allies is having the \u201copposite effect\u201d. Volodymyr Zelenskiy speaks about the \u201cirreversibility\u201d of Ukraine\u2019s path towards Nato membership, saying: Every step truly brings us closer to membership. We are doing and will continue to do everything to ensure that the day comes when Ukraine is invited and become a Nato member. The Ukrainian leader says he is \u201cconfident\u201d that his country will achieve this. Volodymyr Zelenskiy begins his remarks by calling on Nato allies to \u201cpreserve our unity\u201d in the face of Russian aggression, so that Vladimir Putin does not \u201csucceed in making the world accept that wars of aggression are normal\u201d. The Ukrainian leader thanks allies for their support and says \u201cconcrete successes\u201d have been achieved within the framework of this Nato summit. Kyiv \u201cappreciates\u201d the decision to give it five additional air defence systems and dozens of other systems, Zelenskiy says, and expects them to be delivered \u201cas soon as possible, so that as many lives as possible can be saved\u201d. Jens Stoltenberg says more than 20 allies and partners have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. The Nato chief says that he and Volodymyr Zelenskiy agreed during a meeting earlier today that \u201cmore funding, more military support, more security agreements and more interoperability constitute a bridge to Nato membership\u201d. \u201cUkraine\u2019s future is in Nato,\u201d Stoltenberg says, adding that he welcomes Kyiv\u2019s progress on reforms and that as it continues \u201cthis important work, we will support you on your irreversible path to Nato membership\u201d. Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, is holding a joint news conference with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Stoltenberg begins by welcoming the Ukrainian leader to the Nato summit, and says allies are \u201ceager\u201d to demonstrate their support to him and his country. Since the last Nato summit, allies have provided Ukraine with \u201cunprecedented support, including tens of billions of euros in military aid\u201d, Stoltenberg says. The Nato chief says that on Wednesday, allies agreed a \u201csubstantial\u201d package for Ukraine, including security assistance and training and a \u201cminimum baseline\u201d of \u20ac40bn in military aid for Ukraine within the next year. Joe Biden has told Volodymyr Zelenskiy that he would be announcing a new security package for Ukraine. \u201cWe will stay with you, period,\u201d the US president told his Ukrainian counterpart ahead of a bilateral meeting. Zelenskiy said he and Biden would discuss how to achieve a just end to the war with Russia, and called for a second peace summit this year. EU countries have complained that Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, is negotiating with the Russian and Chinese leaders, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, as well as Donald Trump without their consent. Orb\u00e1n has also met with Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskiy and is said to be quietly negotiating his own ceasefire plan without consulting either the Biden administration or other EU countries. Hungary currently holds the presidency of the Council of the EU. Orb\u00e1n \u201cwants to be the Trump guy in Europe if Trump wins the election so that then he can be \u2026 the one who can open the White House door for Europe\u201d, a European Union diplomat told the Guardian. Hungary will continue to hold the presidency of the Council of the EU through the end of the year, coinciding with a period when Trump could be president-elect. The diplomat added: So for the last month before the swearing in he can be the European person in Washington making deals for everyone. \u201cThere is a longstanding pattern of Orb\u00e1n working with enemies of the western alliance system,\u201d said Dalibor Rohac, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute thinktank in Washington. \u201cIt certainly does not serve the Hungarian interest or Nato interest.\u201d He might find a receptive audience in Mar-a-Lago but they are far from a consensus on the Republican side [when it comes to Orb\u00e1n]. Yesterday [Senate minority leader Mitch] McConnell delivered a very powerful speech in the Senate where he dismissed the Hungarian PM for his meeting with Putin. The White House has been asked about reports that Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, is set to meet with Donald Trump in Mar-a-Lago today. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard directly from anybody about this meeting, I\u2019ve heard indirectly about it as many of you have,\u201d said Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser. It certainly isn\u2019t coordinated with the Ukrainians. They\u2019ve indicated that they have great misgivings about any effort to negotiate some kind of fake peace with Russia without the Ukrainians being a part of that effort. The Biden administration\u2019s position is nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. So whatever adventurism is being undertaken without Ukraine\u2019s consent or support is not something that\u2019s consistent with our policy. Canada expects to increase its defence spending to the Nato target of 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2032, according to its prime minister, Justin Trudeau. Trudeau, speaking to reporters at the Nato summit, said: We have built in a regular cycle of review in Canada\u2019s defence, including a new defence policy update in 2028. Through that process, we will continue to explore opportunities that will further increase defense spending. Canada, which has an annual defence budget of around C$31bn (\u00a317.6n) has faced mounting pressure to increase its military spending as it continues to fall short of the Nato target. I will shortly be handing over the Nato summit live blog to my US colleagues, but first, here is a summary of the day so far: Ukraine\u2019s top presidential aide on Thursday called for an end to restrictions imposed on the use of allied-supplied weapons against targets deep inside Russia, saying it would be a \u201cgamechanger\u201d in fighting Moscow\u2019s occupation. Andriy Yermak, speaking at a public forum on the final day of the 2024 Nato summit, did not name any specific country\u2019s restrictions but his comment came days after the White House reaffirmed a prohibition on Ukraine conducting strikes deep inside Russia with US-supplied arms. Hungary does not want, and will not support, Nato becoming an \u201canti-China\u201d bloc, foreign minister Peter Szijjarto told Hungary\u2019s state television while in Washington DC on Thursday. Speaking on the sidelines of a Nato summit, Szijjarto also said Ukraine\u2019s admission to the alliance would weaken unity within the group US president, Joe Biden, is expected to announce a new $225m aid package for Ukraine, including an additional Patriot missile system to bolster its air defences, reports the Associated Press (AP). Two US officials said the announcement is expected to be made during Biden\u2019s meeting on Thursday with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The officials spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to provide details of the aid before the public announcement. Biden is scheduled to face journalists at a news conference marking the end of Nato\u2019s 75th anniversary summit at 6.30pm EDT. The US president\u2019s press conference, which will include questions from reporters, is certain to be scrutinised for any signs of slip-ups. Biden, and his Nato counterparts were set on Thursday to hold talks with Asia-Pacific leaders and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy amid concerns about growing support from China and North Korea for the Russian invasion. The flurry of final events at the Nato summit come a day after Nato labeled China a \u201cdecisive enabler\u201d of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. China in turn accused Nato of seeking security at the expense of others and warned the military alliance not to bring the same \u201cchaos\u201d to Asia. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said on Thursday that any possibility of a direct confrontation between Russia and Nato was \u201cworrying\u201d. He added: \u201cAny steps that could lead to this outcome should be consciously avoided.\u201d Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, will fly to Mar-a-Lago on Thursday to meet with Donald Trump, according to two sources with knowledge of the meeting.

Starmer defended Biden\u2019s leadership credentials amid questions about the US president\u2019s cognitive health, after meeting the president for their first bilateral talks. Starmer told the BBC that Biden had been \u201cacross all the detail\u201d. France, Germany, Italy and Poland signed a letter of intent on Thursday to develop ground-launched cruise missiles with a range beyond 500km (310 miles), aiming to fill what they say is a gap in European arsenals exposed by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.

US president, Joe Biden, is expected to announce a new $225m aid package for Ukraine, including an additional Patriot missile system to bolster its air defences, reports the Associated Press (AP). Two US officials said the announcement is expected to be made during Biden\u2019s meeting on Thursday with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The officials spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to provide details of the aid before the public announcement. The Patriot air defence system, the second the US has provided to Ukraine, is one of several Biden announced this week at the Nato summit and is part of a swell of pledges to get weapons to Ukraine to help it fend off Russian attacks. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, defended Joe Biden\u2019s leadership credentials amid questions about the US president\u2019s cognitive health, which have intensified since criticism of his performance in a TV debate against Donald Trump last month. Starmer who met the president for their first bilateral talks at the White House on Wednesday as Nato leaders gathered in Washington DC to discuss the challenges facing the bloc, said Biden had been \u201cacross all the detail\u201d. According to the PA news agency, Starmer told broadcasters their one-to-one discussions had happened \u201cat pace\u201d and Biden seemed \u201con really good form\u201d. \u201cWe were billed for 45 minutes, we went on for the best part of an hour,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was absolutely across all the detail. We were going at pace through a number of issues.\u201d Asked by a reporter whether the president was senile, Starmer told the BBC: No \u2026 he\u2019s shown incredible leadership. If there\u2019s one thing that came out of the council session yesterday it was a clear understanding by everybody here that we\u2019re faced with more threats now than we\u2019ve faced for many years, and that we need the resolve of Nato. President Biden has led through some of the most challenging issues, actually, that we\u2019re facing globally.\u201d Starmer\u2019s latest comments come after the two leaders spoke on the sidelines of the Nato summit as the prime minister seeks to strengthen what he called the \u201cvery special relationship\u201d between the UK and US. Meanwhile, Biden earlier appeared to back Starmer\u2019s push for the UK to forge closer defence ties with Europe, as he called the UK the \u201ctransatlantic knot\u201d. The PA news agency reports that Starmer wants an ambitious new UK-EU security pact to strengthen cooperation and seeks closer work on defence with key allies such as France and Germany. Biden said: \u201cI kind of see you guys as the knot tying the transatlantic alliance together, the closer you are with Europe. We know where you are, you know where we are.\u201d Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, will fly to Mar-a-Lago on Thursday to meet with Donald Trump, according to two sources with knowledge of the meeting. Orb\u00e1n has enraged his Nato allies by meeting with Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping en route to the alliance\u2019s summit in Washington DC. He has also met with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv, and is said to be quietly negotiating his own ceasefire plan without consulting either the Biden administration or other EU countries. The two men will meet at Mar-a-Lago at 7pm, a source close to Trump said. Orban\u2019s 606 Dassault Falcon jet was one of the several international planes that flew into Joint Base Andrews on Tuesday to attend the 2024 Nato summit. As of 10.30am eastern time on Thursday, the Hungarian military plane was still parked in Maryland. Orb\u00e1n did not discuss details of his negotiations with Putin or Xi with the Biden administration. Three sources briefed on the summit preparations said that he did not ask for a bilateral meeting with Joe Biden. EU countries have complained that Orb\u00e1n is negotiating without their consent as Hungary currently holds the presidency of the European Council. Orb\u00e1n and his campaign advisers have fully backed Trump for re-election in November. His foreign minister, P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, told Reuters: \u201cWe see a chance for peace if President Trump is winning. We see a chance for good Hungary-US relationships if President Trump is winning.\u201d You can read the full piece by Flora Garamvolgyi, Andrew Roth and Hugo Lowell here: My colleague in the US, Robert Tait has written about how Joe Biden\u2019s Nato speech later poses a major test for his campaign as calls mount for him to step down. He writes: The press conference, which will include questions from reporters, is certain to be scrutinised minutely for any signs of verbal slip-up or mental frailty resembling those Biden displayed in the debate. The event is the kind of unscripted set piece that Biden\u2019s staff stand accused of shielding him from, and any repeat of the calamitous debate display could turn the steady trickle of public calls for Biden to stand aside into a flood. Some of Biden\u2019s most loyal acolytes at the top of the Democratic party have issued less than full-throated statements of support in recent days. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, who has repeated the mantra \u201cI\u2019m for Joe\u201d throughout the crisis, was reported to have signalled openness to having the president replaced at the top of the presidential ticket. Axios reported that Schumer had been taking close account of the feelings of party donors and fellow senators in the 12 days since Biden\u2019s meltdown in the 27 June debate, when he plunged the viability of his candidacy into doubt by abjectly failing to defend his own policies or counter Trump\u2019s lies. \u201cAs I have made clear repeatedly publicly and privately, I support President Biden and remain committed to ensuring Donald Trump is defeated in November,\u201d Schumer said, in comments that fell short of a ringing endorsement. On Wednesday, Peter Welch of Vermont became the first Democratic senator to publicly tell Biden to step aside. Nine members of the House of Representatives have already done so. \u201cHe saved us from Donald Trump once and wants to do it again. But he needs to reassess whether he is the best candidate to do so. In my view, he is not,\u201d Welch wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece. You can read the full piece here: Here are some images from the Nato summit today, courtesy of the newswires: France, Germany, Italy and Poland signed a letter of intent on Thursday to develop ground-launched cruise missiles with a range beyond 500km (310 miles), aiming to fill what they say is a gap in European arsenals exposed by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Reuters reports that speaking on the sidelines of the Nato summit in Washington DC after the signing ceremony, French defence minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu said the new missile was meant to serve as a deterrent. \u201cThe idea is to open it up as widely as possible,\u201d he told reporters, and suggested the UK\u2019s new Labour government could join. \u201cIt has value, including on a budgetary level, because it obviously also allows the various costs to be amortized.\u201d A first draft of the weapon might be sketched out by the end of the year, he said, with the specifications such as the range to be worked out in more detail later. He was speaking one day after the US and Germany announced they would begin deploying US long-range missiles on German soil in 2026, including the SM-6, Tomahawks and developmental hypersonic weapons. The deployment, condemned by Moscow as a \u201cvery serious threat\u201d to Russian national security, is seen as a stopgap solution until Europe has its own long-range missiles ready, reports Reuters. Germany\u2019s chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Thursday that France remained a key partner on the international stage as leader Emmanuel Macron struggles to build a coalition government after elections, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cFrance will be on the international agenda a big partner, a strong partner of all of us, and especially a partner for Germany,\u201d Scholz said at the Nato summit in Washington DC. Scholz said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d that the second round of voting in France over the weekend had not given the far-right a majority. \u201cIt\u2019s now the task of the politicians to find a solution and to make something out of it,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cI\u2019m quite confident that they will in the end.\u201d The stalemate in France has seen questions raised over whether Macron and France can continue to play a central role in Nato and the EU, reports AFP. \u201cFrance has a strong president who is acting in the international scene,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cI had yesterday a very good exchange with my friend Emmanuel Macron, so I\u2019m not wondering what will happen,\u201d he added. US president, Joe Biden, will hold a solo press conference at the Nato summit on Thursday, his first time facing the press alone since November, reports Reuters. Biden, will take an unspecified number of questions from reporters, in an event expected to last about as long as November\u2019s, which ran to 21 minutes. The press conference is expected to begin at 6.30pm EDT (10.30pm GMT/11.30pm BST). Ukraine\u2019s top presidential aide on Thursday called for an end to restrictions imposed on the use of allied-supplied weapons against targets deep inside Russia, saying it would be a \u201cgamechanger\u201d in fighting Moscow\u2019s occupation, reports Reuters. Andriy Yermak did not name any specific country\u2019s restrictions but his comment came days after the White House reaffirmed a prohibition on Ukraine conducting strikes deep inside Russia with US-supplied arms, following a Russian missile strike on a Kyiv children\u2019s hospital. \u201cThe partners have to take off any restrictions to use weapons not just by Ukrainian territory but have the possibility to answer [Russian attacks] including the territory of Russia,\u201d Yermak told a public forum on the final day of the 2024 Nato summit. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to fight them,\u201d he continued, noting that Russia does not have \u201cany restrictions. The enemy can directly attack to our civilians, children\u2019s hospitals, schools and we have these restrictions.\u201d \u201cIt will be a real gamechanger\u201d if Ukraine\u2019s allies lift all limits on its use of their weapons \u201cand I hope that our partners understand that and agree this decisions as soon as possible,\u201d said Yermak, chief of staff to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. US president Joe Biden\u2019s administration permits Ukraine to use US-supplied arms against targets just inside Russia that are supporting Russian offensive operations in Ukraine, but prohibits their use for strikes deep inside Russian territory. Romania, Bulgaria and Greece signed a deal on Thursday to enable swift cross-border movement of troops and weapons to Nato\u2019s eastern flank, Romania\u2019s defence ministry said. Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has increased the urgency both for Nato and the EU to speed up preparations, including the ability to quickly send reinforcements, in case of a sudden conflict with Moscow. Nato has told its members that too much red tape is hindering troop movements across Europe. Reuters reports that the planned harmonised military mobility corridor between the three Nato and EU states was one of two such mobility corridors agreed on the sidelines of the Nato summit in Washington DC. It aims \u201cto optimise transport corridors to respond to military mobility needs by creating road and rail supply lines between the participating states, reducing peacetime bureaucracy and maximising efficiency in case of emergency situations,\u201d the Romanian ministry said. The three states could also connect their ports in the Aegean and Black seas. Romania and Bulgaria are already a part of a joint effort with Turkey to defuse stray mines in the Black Sea, says Reuters. On Thursday, the Romanian and Bulgarian defence ministers also signed a memorandum to establish a regional special operations command centre which will plan and manage the alliance\u2019s special operations forces in the Black Sea region. US president, Joe Biden, and his Nato counterparts were set on Thursday to hold talks with Asia-Pacific leaders and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy amid concerns about growing support from China and North Korea for the Russian invasion. Later, all eyes will be on Biden as he closes the summit of 32 Nato leaders in Washington DC with a news conference. It will provide a fresh chance for him to prove to watchers that he is capable of serving another four years after a shaky debate performance threw the future of his presidency into doubt. The flurry of final events at the Nato summit come a day after Nato labeled China a \u201cdecisive enabler\u201d of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. China in turn accused Nato of seeking security at the expense of others and warned the military alliance not to bring the same \u201cchaos\u201d to Asia. \u201cWe appreciate the close partnership with your country, and not least because our security is not regional, it is global,\u201d Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said as he welcomed South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol for the last day of the alliance\u2019s summit, reports the Associated Press (AP). \u201cThis is clearly illustrated by the war in Ukraine,\u201d Stoltenberg added. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who is also taking part in the talks, said it was important to draw all partners into a conversation on how to ensure stability, notably as China strengthens its ties with Russia, but also in the Asia-Pacific region. \u201cChina is supporting a Russia in the name of this unlimited friendship. [North] Korea is one of the most important suppliers of raw material to Russia,\u201d he told reporters. He noted that maritime border tensions \u201cin the Indo-Pacific puts a threat to the stability of the whole region.\u201d Zelenskiy will join allied leaders later for a Nato-Ukraine Council, a forum set up a year ago for the 32 allies and Kyiv to meet on an equal footing to share concerns and information. On Wednesday, Nato leaders promised Ukraine that it is on an \u201cirreversible path\u201d to membership, although it can only join sometime after the war, when the allies agree that it has met all the conditions. German chancellor Olaf Scholz praised a plan to allow the deployment of US long-range missiles in his country, saying it fits perfectly into Germany\u2019s own deterrence strategy, reports Reuters. \u201cThis decision has been a long time in the making and comes as no real surprise to anyone involved in security and peace policy,\u201d Scholz told reporters at the Nato summit in Washington DC. \u201cAfter all, it fits in perfectly with the German government\u2019s security strategy,\u201d he added on Thursday. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has met Japan\u2019s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, and South Korea\u2019s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, at the Nato summit today. Ukraine\u2019s top presidential aide said on Thursday that the nation, which has been at war with Russia since 2022, is \u201csatisfied\u201d with the outcome of the Nato summit in Washington DC. Andriy Yermak, the chief of the Ukrainian president\u2019s cabinet, said the \u201cnext step\u201d should be an invitation to Ukraine to join Nato. The Guardian video team have a live feed of the White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and the head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, Andriy Yermak joining world leaders at the Nato summit. You can watch it below, or embedded at the top of this blog. Deputy Russian foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow had anticipated the US-German missile move which he portrayed as being designed to intimidate Russia and which further destabilised regional security and strategic relations, reports Reuters. \u201cThe necessary work on the preparation of balancing countermeasures by the relevant Russian state agencies was started well in advance and is being carried out on a systematic basis,\u201d Ryabkov said in a statement on his ministry\u2019s website. \u201cWithout nerves, without emotions, we will develop a military response, first of all, to this new game,\u201d Interfax news agency quoted him as saying. Russia will act to counter the planned US deployment of long-range missiles in Germany, the Kremlin said on Thursday, as it regarded the Nato military alliance\u2019s actions as a serious threat to Russia\u2019s national security, reports Reuters. The US and Germany announced at a Nato summit in Washington DC on Wednesday that they would begin deploying long-range fire capabilities in Germany in 2026 to demonstrate their commitment to Nato and European defence at a time when Russia is waging war in Ukraine. They said the \u201cepisodic deployments\u201d were in preparation for longer-term stationing that would include SM-6, Tomahawk cruise missiles and hypersonic weapons with a longer range than current capabilities in Europe. Nato also said on Wednesday that a new US air defence base in northern Poland, designed to detect and intercept ballistic missile attacks as part of a broader Nato missile shield, was mission-ready. Reuters reports that when asked at a briefing with Russian news agencies about the outcome of the Nato summit, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: The North Atlantic alliance has once again very clearly confirmed its essence. It is an alliance created in an era of confrontation with the aim of maintaining confrontation.\u201d \u201cTensions on the European continent are escalating\u201d as a result, he added, saying the Kremlin was watching as Nato\u2019s military infrastructure crept closer. \u201cWe see the decisions taken in Nato to create separate logistics hubs in Black Sea cities, the opening of additional facilities in Europe, and we see that in fact Nato\u2019s military infrastructure is constantly and incrementally moving towards our borders,\u201d said Peskov. \u201cThis obliges us to analyse very deeply the decisions taken in the discussion that took place. This is a very serious threat to the national security of our country. All of this will require us to take thoughtful, coordinated, effective responses to deter Nato, to counteract Nato,\u201d he said. Norway will donate 1bn Norwegian kroner ($92.69m) in support to Ukraine for its air defence, prime minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said at the Nato summit in Washington DC on Thursday. The donation comes a day after Norway announced it would give six F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine to help it in defence efforts against Russian air attacks. \u201cThe Ukrainians need more air defence to protect their population from Russian bombs and missiles,\u201d St\u00f8re said in a statement, reports Reuters. On Thursday, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan also played down the influence of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a regional bloc that Moscow and Beijing have promoted as a counterweight to US domination. \u201cWe do not think that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation is an alternative to Nato,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). Turkey has been an SCO dialogue partner since 2012 and Erdo\u011fan, who attended the July summit, has suggested in the past he wanted full membership. AFP reports that before flying to Washington DC on Tuesday, Erdo\u011fan called for more Nato involvement in the war between Israel and Hamas. Erdo\u011fan has already voiced concerns over what he said were Israeli plans to attack Lebanon and on Thursday renewed his warnings about the war spreading. \u201cIsrael\u2019s threats and attempts to spread the conflict must come to an end,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, our region will face the risk of deeper conflicts and even a war.\u201d Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said on Thursday that any possibility of a direct confrontation between Russia and Nato was \u201cworrying\u201d, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported, citing the Turkish state-run Anadolu news agency. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s comments came as Nato leaders met in Washington DC and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was planning \u201cresponse measures\u201d to contain the \u201cvery serious threat\u201d from the alliance. \u201cThe possibility of a direct conflict between Nato and Russia is undoubtedly worrying,\u201d said Erdo\u011fan, who is in Washington DC for the Nato summit. \u201cAny steps that could lead to this outcome should be consciously avoided.\u201d Erdo\u011fan spoke a day after Nato allies announced they had started transferring F-16 jets to Ukraine while stepping up promises to Kyiv on eventual membership in the alliance, at a 75th anniversary summit clouded by political uncertainties in the United States. AFP reports that Nato member Turkey has sought to balance ties between its two Black Sea neighbours Russia and Ukraine since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022. Last year, Erdo\u011fan, whose government is seeking to mediate a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, said Ukraine \u201cundoubtedly\u201d deserved Nato membership when he met Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Hungary does not want, and will not support, Nato becoming an \u201canti-China\u201d bloc, foreign minister Peter Szijjarto told Hungary\u2019s state television while in Washington DC on Thursday. Speaking on the sidelines of a Nato summit, Szijjarto also said Ukraine\u2019s admission to the alliance would weaken unity within the group, reports Reuters. The final day of the Nato summit in Washington DC has begun with a bilateral meeting between Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Christopher Luxon. Nato leaders have been arriving for the final day of the Nato summit in Washington DC. Here, in a nutshell, is what to expect from today: To give some context to comments by China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson today accusing Nato of seeking security at the expense of others and telling the alliance not to bring the same \u201cchaos\u201d to Asia (see 10.45am BST), here is what was said about China at the Nato summit yesterday: Deepening ties between China and Russia are a cause of \u201cdeep concern\u201d, Nato leaders said in a declaration from their summit, accusing Beijing of playing a key role in helping Moscow\u2019s assault on Ukraine. China \u201chas become a decisive enabler of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine through its so-called \u2018no limits\u2019 partnership and its large-scale support for Russia\u2019s defense industrial base\u201d, the declaration said, AFP reported. They urged China to \u201ccease all material and political support to Russia\u2019s war effort\u201d, adding that this \u201cincludes the transfer of dual-use materials, such as weapons components, equipment, and raw materials that serve as inputs for Russia\u2019s defense sector\u201d. China \u201ccannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation\u201d, Nato leaders said. You can also read the Guardian\u2019s report on this story here: Here are some photos from yesterday via the newswires: All eyes will be on US president, Joe Biden, and his press conference at the Nato 75th anniversary event later today as he takes off-script questions from the media, writes Jem Bartholomew in the Guardian\u2019s latest First Things newsletter. You can read it here: Criticism of Keir Starmer\u2019s defence spending plans are \u201cunfair\u201d, the security minister, Dan Jarvis, has said as he defended the UK government\u2019s strategic defence review, reports the PA news agency. The major assessment will be launched next week and will set out a road map to spending 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) on defence. Jarvis on Thursday described the commitment to 2.5% as \u201cabsolutely cast iron\u201d, but no date has been put on when spending will rise to this level. The minister was asked whether there was a \u201cwhiff of hypocrisy\u201d in the UK prime minister urging other Nato countries to honour their official goal of spending 2% of GDP on defence while the UK reviews its own funding. Nato members have an official goal of spending 2% of GDP on defence and 23 members are thought to have reached that level, reports the PA news agency. Jarvis told LBC Radio host Nick Ferrari: I think that would be unfair, Nick, if you don\u2019t mind me saying. The prime minister has made a cast-iron guarantee that we will get to the point where we are spending 2.5% of GDP on our defence capabilities, but we think that these things should be done properly.\u201d He added: Our commitment to 2.5% of GDP is absolutely cast iron, and we will get to the point as quickly as we possibly can, but it needs to be informed by the process of review that will be initiated very shortly.\u201d The Labour party has said it will aim to complete the review in less than a year, but some former military officials have insisted such decisions cannot wait that long. Starmer has refused to guarantee he will meet the flagship commitment within his first term in office. Pressed on the timeline, Jarvis said the government is \u201cnot in the business of cutting corners\u201d. He told Sky News: It\u2019s important that we follow the process and look carefully at the nature of the threat that our country faces, and the resources that will be required to put in place an armed forces that is fit for purpose \u2026 it\u2019s an important process that will take a period of months.\u201d Labour has stressed that decisions on defence spending must comply with the government\u2019s strict fiscal rules on spending and borrowing, with Jarvis saying the strength of the economy is \u201cfundamental\u201d to the process. Shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge said: This morning, the security minister was forced to defend Keir Starmer for calling on Nato members to increase defence spending when the Labour Government have not set a date to reach 2.5% of defence spending by. In a world that is more volatile and dangerous than at any time since the cold war, Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour government had a clear choice to match the Conservatives\u2019 fully funded pledge to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2030. By failing to do so, they\u2019ve created huge uncertainty for our armed forces, at the worst possible time.\u201d Flora Garamvolgyi, Andrew Roth and Jennifer Rankin have written about how the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has enraged most of the Nato alliance by meeting with Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, while shunning Joe Biden, as he seeks to negotiate a Ukraine war settlement: If there has been a spoiler at this week\u2019s carefully curated Nato summit, then it is Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the conservative Hungarian prime minister who has enraged his Nato allies by meeting with Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping en route to Washington DC in what he has called his \u201cpeace mission\u201d. Now on Thursday the Hungarian PM is planning to fly to Mar-a-Lago to meet with Donald Trump, a source close to Orb\u00e1n told the Guardian, as he seeks to negotiate a peace deal without consulting other EU nations or the Biden administration. By contrast, he has effectively shunned Joe Biden at this week\u2019s Nato summit and did not request a bilateral meeting with the US president, according to three sources familiar with the summit preparations. The Hungarian PM has been quietly seeking to negotiate a settlement to the Ukraine war with an eye to a Trump re-election. Trump\u2019s lead in the presidential polls has been bolstered by Biden\u2019s blundering debate performance and questions about his mental acuity and age. Orb\u00e1n, who also met with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv earlier this month, has sought to have Ukraine and Russia sit down to direct negotiations, talks that Zelenskiy has ruled out in the past. You can read more of their report here: The US president, Joe Biden, has shared a picture from his meeting with the UK\u2019s new prime minister, Keir Starmer. In a post on X, Biden wrote: Today, prime minister Starmer and I sat down for our first bilateral meeting since his recent election. As the best of allies, we\u2019re taking on the challenges that matter most to our people\u2019s lives \u2013 from defending transatlantic security to fostering our economic relationship.\u201d Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy will hold a news conference with Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday, reports Reuters. It comes after Zelenskiy met both Republican and Democratic lawmakers at the US Capitol on Wednesday. The Ukrainian leader, keen to cement ties with US lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle in the event that Donald Trump is reelected, met leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives and members of committees involved in defence, spending, diplomacy and national security. Zelenskiy told reporters he invited Mike Johnson, the Republican leader of the US House of Representatives, to visit Kyiv. In a clear warning to Russian president Vladimir Putin, the US on Wednesday said it would start deploying longer range missiles in Germany in 2026, the most potent US weapons to be based on the European continent since the cold war, reports Reuters. A Nato declaration also said the allies would provide at least \u20ac40bn ($43.28bn) in military aid within the next year, although they stopped short of the multi year commitment Stoltenberg had sought. Nato members also pledged to continue to support Ukraine \u201con its irreversible path to full Euro-atlantic integration, including Nato membership\u201d. US president, Joe Biden, who will host an event on support for Ukraine, has argued that Nato is \u201cstronger than it\u2019s ever been\u201d and that Ukraine can and will stop Russian leader Putin \u201cwith our full, collective support.\u201d Also, in case you are catching up on yesterday\u2019s key events from the Nato summit, here is a summary of the top lines via my colleagues on Wednesday\u2019s live blog: Summary from day two of the Nato summit on Wednesday: The first F-16 fighter jets are on their way to Ukraine and will be flying sorties this summer, according to a statement from the Dutch and Danish governments. Dick Schoof, the prime minister of the Netherlands, and Mette Frederiksen, his counterpart from Denmark, said the \u201ctransfer process\u201d of F-16s to Kyiv was under way after months of pilot training and political negotiations. The long-awaited supply of F-16s is part of what Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said would be \u201ca substantial package\u201d of support for Ukraine, which includes the donation of four Patriot air defence systems, Nato-led training for Ukraine\u2019s troops \u2013 and a commitment that Kyiv\u2019s eventual path to Nato membership is \u201cirreversible\u201d. Nato allies also criticised China, with stronger language than used before, for assisting Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, calling it a \u201cdecisive enabler\u201d of the war by supporting Moscow in its \u201cno limits\u201d partnership, and supplying components for military equipment and chemicals for explosives. Keir Starmer, the UK\u2019s prime minister, said his new government will stick with plans to spend at least \u00a33bn every year on military support for Ukraine for \u201cas long as is it takes\u201d in its conflict with Russia. After his first official bilateral talks with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, at the Nato summit in Washington DC, Starmer confirmed the military aid would continue until at least 2030-31. Britain will be \u201cthe leading European nation\u201d in Nato under a Labour government, the new defence secretary, John Healey, pledged \u2013 though spending may have to rise significantly if the UK is to remain ahead of Germany. The US will deploy long-range weapons to Germany in 2026 in an effort to demonstrate its commitment to Nato and European defence, the two countries announced. Joe Biden, the US president, promised to defend Ukraine against the Russian invasion in remarks to Nato leaders. \u201cWe can and will defend every inch of Nato territory and we will do it together,\u201d Biden told Nato leaders as they opened the first work session. Joe Biden has appeared to back Keir Starmer\u2019s ambition for the UK having a closer relationship with the European Union as the leaders held their first bilateral talks at the White House. The US president called the US and the UK the \u201cbest of allies\u201d as he met the prime minister in the Oval Office, describing Britain as the \u201cknot\u201d that tied the transatlantic relationship together. He suggested the closer the UK was with Europe, the tighter the knot would be. \u201cI kind of see you guys as the knot tying the transatlantic alliance together, the closer you are with Europe,\u201d he told Starmer. Biden has long had a close interest in Brexit, repeatedly warning that peace in Northern Ireland must not be jeopardised as a result of complications caused by the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Starmer has used the Nato summit in Washington DC to underline the UK\u2019s commitment to the alliance, as well as to Ukraine, confirming that he will stick with plans to spend at least \u00a33bn every year on military support to Kyiv for \u201cas long as is it takes\u201d in its conflict with Russia. But he is also using the summit to build relationships with European leaders as he tries to seal an EU-UK security pact, and has been joined on the trip by Nick Thomas-Symonds, his minister for European relations. At the bilateral meeting, Starmer congratulated Biden on hosting the 75th anniversary of the summit, hailing \u201ca bigger Nato, a stronger Nato and a Nato with the resolve that we need\u201d. \u201cThe special relationship is so important. It\u2019s forged in difficult circumstances, endured for so long, and stronger now than ever. I\u2019m very pleased to be able to come so early in government to recommit to Nato, to recommit to the special relationship and to discuss these affairs with you.\u201d China accused Nato on Thursday of seeking security at the expense of others and told the alliance not to bring the same \u201cchaos\u201d to Asia, reports the Associated Press (AP). The statement by a foreign ministry spokesperson came a day after Nato labeled China a \u201cdecisive enabler\u201d of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. \u201cNato hyping up China\u2019s responsibility on the Ukraine issue is unreasonable and has sinister motives,\u201d spokesperson Lin Jian said at a daily briefing. He maintained that China has a fair and objective stance on the Ukraine issue. China has broken with the United States and its European allies over the war in Ukraine, refusing to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion. Its trade with Russia has grown since the invasion, at least partially offsetting the impact of western sanctions. Nato, in a communique issued at a summit in Washington DC, said China has become a enabler of the war through its \u201cno-limits partnership\u201d with Russia and its large-scale support for Russia\u2019s defence industrial base. According to the AP, Lin said that China\u2019s trade with Russia is legitimate and reasonable and based on World Trade Organization rules. He said that Nato\u2019s \u201cso-called security\u201d comes at the cost of the security of other countries. China has backed Russia\u2019s contention that Nato expansion posed a threat to Russia. China has expressed concern about Nato\u2019s budding relationships with countries in the region. Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea sent their leaders or deputies to the Nato summit this week. \u201cChina urges Nato to \u2026 stop interfering in China\u2019s internal politics and smearing China\u2019s image and not create chaos in the Asia-Pacific after creating turmoil in Europe,\u201d Lin said. The AP reports that Chinese troops are in Belarus this week for joint drills near the border with Poland, a Nato member. The exercises are the first-ever with Belarus, an ally of Russia. Lin described the joint training as normal military exchange and cooperation that is not directed at any particular country. Welcome to the latest Nato summit blog. It is 10.40am in London, where I\u2019m blogging from, and 5.40am in Washington DC where, later, the leaders will arrive for the final day of the Nato summit. China has accused Nato of seeking security at the expense of others and told the alliance not to bring the same \u201cchaos\u201d to Asia. The Associated Press report that the statement from a foreign ministry spokesperson on Thursday came a day after Nato labelled China a \u201cdecisive enabler\u201d of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. The spokesperson urged Nato to stop interfering in China\u2019s internal politics and smearing China\u2019s image. China has broken with the US and its European allies over the war in Ukraine, refusing to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion. Its trade with Russia has grown since the invasion, at least partially offsetting the impact of western sanctions. More on that in a moment, but first here is how the agenda looks for today: 7.30am EDT/12.30pm BST \u2013 Leaders arrive. 10am EDT/3pm BST \u2013 Meeting of the North Atlantic Council at the level of heads of state and government, Indo-Pacific partners and the EU. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg will give opening remarks. 2pm EDT/7pm BST \u2013 Meeting of the Nato-Ukraine Council at the level of heads of state and government. Again public opening remarks will be given by Stoltenberg. 4.30pm EDT/9.30pm BST \u2013 Stoltenberg will give a press conference to media."

            "content": "Renewable energy investment experts have revealed growing worries the Coalition\u2019s plans to build nuclear reactors in Australia is breeding uncertainty and is already delaying decisions to back major solar and wind projects. The Coalition\u2019s push to build taxpayer-funded nuclear reactors at seven locations while refusing to back improved climate targets could see investors shifting huge sums of cash to other economies where the clean energy transition has bipartisan support. The policy uncertainty is unlikely to be resolved until the result of the next general election is known, which could be as late as May 2025. \u201cSome of Australia\u2019s biggest investors are putting on hold new clean energy investments in this country because of the lack of bipartisan support for the least-cost pathway to net zero emissions,\u201d said Erwin Jackson, the policy director at the Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC). The Coalition\u2019s plans include having so-called small modular reactors (SMRs) operating at sites in South Australia and Western Australia by 2035. On Wednesday, the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE) released a report saying SMRs were unlikely to be available commercially until the late 2030s and a mature market might emerge \u201cduring the mid- to late-2040s\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Since the Coalition\u2019s plans were made public, Jackson said \u201cmore than one\u201d major investor had said they would be holding off on making an investment decision. He said: \u201cInvestors have a duty to deliver the best long-term savings and they\u2019ve assessed the best way to deliver that is investing in a well-planned and fair transition to net zero. If that\u2019s not going to be delivered in Australia they will invest in other jurisdictions with clear, stable, long-term policy.\u201d IGCC periodically asks its members to describe issues that are barriers to investing. Jackson said surveys, carried out before the Coalition confirmed its nuclear hopes, had shown that concerns over \u201cpolicy uncertainty\u201d had fallen in the last two years. Jackson said: \u201cThe real risk is that we return to a situation where the lack of bipartisanship will see investments flow offshore, and Australia misses out on the jobs, training and opportunities from renewable energy.\u201d Marilyn Crestias is the interim chief executive at the Clean Energy Investor Group, whose members have investments in half of all clean energy assets in the country\u2019s east. In recent months, she said the group had seen \u201can increase in concern and commentary [from members] around the potential for policy uncertainty and the negative impacts that would have on investments in Australia\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s important because we see other countries, such as the United States, and in Europe and Asia, being really ambitious and accelerating that ambition,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for Australia to remain competitive to attract that global capital. \u201cWe need to think about the long-term signals [for investors]. They are putting in large amounts of capital on long-lived assets and they need to see those signals over the medium to long term and have certainty around the environment these assets will operate in.\u201d Crestias said steps taken by states and the Albanese government, such as raising climate targets and opening investment schemes for renewables, had created a more favourable environment to invest. \u201cThe right building blocks are being put in place,\u201d she said. \u201cI would urge governments to continue setting ambitious targets.\u201d The ATSE report on SMRs, compiled by academy fellows, said the technology was still in its infancy and no commercial projects existed in the OECD, but it was \u201cpossible that several prototype SMRs may be licensed, commissioned and built in OECD countries by the mid-2030s\u201d. The report said the lowest risk and cheapest option for Australia would be to wait until a mature market exists for SMRs, which would likely be in the mid- to late-2040s."

            "content": "A dissident rebel group has backed down from its threat to disrupt the UN biodiversity summit in Colombia later this year. The Central General Staff (EMC), a guerrilla faction that rejected the country\u2019s 2016 peace agreement, said on Wednesday it would order its militants not to target the Cop16 negotiations that are due to begin in Cali in October. Earlier in July, the EMC released statements online saying the summit \u201cwould fail\u201d, prompting concerns that rebels would attack the conference. The group\u2019s leader, Nestor Gregorio, better known by the nom de guerre Iv\u00e1n Mordisco, said in a video message on X: \u201cWe\u2019ve decided, as a gesture of our will for peace, to order our units not to affect the normal development of the Cop16 that will be held soon in the city of Cali.\u201d On 16 July, the Colombian defence ministry ended a ceasefire with parts of the EMC led by Mordisco, because of rising violence. A series of bombings and shootings in and around Cali have been blamed on the group. About 12,000 soldiers and police are expected to be deployed a month before the summit to ensure the safety of delegates and ministers from around the world. The Colombian government did not comment on the EMC\u2019s announcement. In response to the initial threat of disruption, authorities had issued a statement reassuring prospective attendees. \u201cThe safety and wellbeing of all participants, attendees and collaborators are our top priority. All security guarantees are in places to have a successful and smooth conference. We convey to all participants, delegates, media and stakeholders a message of reassurance,\u201d the statement read. The Colombian government announced late last year that it would host the Cop16 summit, after Turkey dropped out, citing the earthquakes that had devastated parts of the country. Under Gustavo Petro\u2019s presidency, Colombia has positioned itself as an international leader on environmental issues, becoming the first major oil, gas and coal producer to join an alliance calling for a fossil fuel nonproliferation treaty at Cop28 last year. Petro\u2019s government has had success in reducing deforestation, but its progress has been hampered this year by El Ni\u00f1o and tensions with the EMC, which controls large areas of rainforest.

            "date": "2024-07-18T00:00:19Z",
            "content": "Advocacy for the Coalition\u2019s hopes to build nuclear power plants is increasingly coming with large side-orders of misinformation, not just on the speed or costs of nuclear but on renewables. Dr Adi Paterson, the chair of the Nuclear for Australia advocacy group, has taken to attacking the credentials of CSIRO experts while going hyperbolic with his rhetoric. When Paterson told Sky News he thought the agency\u2019s report on the costs of different electricity generation technologies was \u201ca form of fascism\u201d there was not a whisper of disapproval from the surrounding studio panel. Mussolini would be turning in his grave. The definitely-not-fascist GenCost report has found electricity from nuclear would be far more expensive than solar and wind, taking into account the cost of extra transmission lines and technologies to connect, store and rerelease renewable power. Paterson claimed on the Sky news show Outsiders that the GenCost report \u201clooks at one reactor in Finland\u201d. In fact, the report had based the cost of large-scale reactors in Australia on South Korea\u2019s long-running nuclear program \u2013 one of the most successful in the world. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Entrepreneur Dick Smith, a patron of Nuclear for Australia, has also tried to claim CSIRO used a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d for nuclear costs. One leading energy analyst has previously told Temperature Check the opposite was more likely the case. Paterson, a former boss of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, said in any case, he wanted to see Australia consider 5MW micro-reactors (less than the size of a large wind turbine, suggesting Paterson would like to see Australia scattered with tiny nuclear reactors). He then pointed to Bill Gates\u2019 Terrapower company and its project in Wyoming (which has a much higher proposed generation capacity of 345 MW), saying it was currently licensed and \u201cbeing built now\u201d. In fact, as Terrapower\u2019s chief executive told CNBC a couple of months ago, the company has only just submitted its construction permit application to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and hopes to get approval in 2026. They are doing some construction at the site, but none of it relates to the nuclear aspects of the plant. Two days out of five? Paterson has claimed wind turbines only generate electricity \u201ctwo days out of five\u201d or \u201c37% of the time\u201d. Dr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems analyst at UNSW, said this was a \u201cmisleading\u201d characterisation of windfarm performance. McConnell said the 37% figure referred to something called the capacity factor \u2013 that is, how much electricity is generated over a given period relative to a windfarm\u2019s maximum capacity. \u201cIt is equivalent to implying that windfarms run at 100% of capacity two days out of five, and zero capacity three days out of five. This is of course not at all how windfarms or renewable energy generation works,\u201d he said. \u201cThey infrequently run at 100% of capacity. The converse of this is that they are often running just at levels below their full rated output \u2013 which is even more true across the whole fleet.\u201d McConnell points to data showing over the past year windfarms contributed about 12% of the total generation across the national electricity market (everywhere except WA and the NT) and while he said there was \u201ca lot of variability\u201d, there were no days when windfarms failed to generate. He said: \u201cSaying they work \u2018two days out of every five\u2019 is misunderstanding or a misrepresentation of the contribution of wind to the power system.\u201d Free pass for renewables? Conservative economist and contributor to the Australian and the Spectator, Judith Sloan, has penned several pieces in recent weeks favouring nuclear power while making questionable claims about renewables. In the Spectator, Sloan wrote that state governments \u201chave allowed renewable energy companies to avoid the normal approval processes, including environmental assessments\u201d. Firstly, renewables projects are subject to both state and federal environmental assessments. The federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, has assessed and approved more than 50 renewables projects \u2013 often with conditions attached \u2013 under current environmental laws, and rejected one windfarm in north Queensland in May because of potential impacts on nature. (The previous environment minister, Sussan Ley, also rejected a windfarm in 2020.) Marilyne Crestias, interim chief executive at the Clean Energy Investor Group, said it was \u201cinaccurate\u201d to say that projects avoided environmental assessments at state level. \u201cEach state and territory has its own set of laws governing environmental assessments for renewable energy projects. \u201cFor example, in New South Wales, large-scale renewable energy projects must undergo an environmental impact assessment (EIA) under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979. Similarly in Victoria, projects are assessed under the Planning and Environment Act 1987 for their environmental, social and economic impacts. And in Queensland, the Environmental Protection Act 1994 requires environmental impact statements (EIS) for significant projects, including renewable energy developments. These assessments ensure that renewable energy projects are developed responsibly and sustainably.\u201d Talking to Sky, Sloan has said: \u201cOne of the worst aspects of [the renewables rollout] is that these renewable investors have never entered into an undertaking that they will remediate the land.\u201d Crestias said this was a \u201cmisconception\u201d, saying developers typically did have agreements that included remediating the land. \u201cThese agreements often cover the entire lifecycle of the project, from development through decommissioning,\u201d she said. \u201cFor instance, planning permits for windfarms in Victoria require developers to submit a decommissioning and rehabilitation plan before construction begins.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-03T14:09:27Z",
            "content": "Andrei Ratiu was having a decent tournament until he got to Munich and was made to look a dud by Cody Gakpo. The full-back, with his blue hair and ability on the ball, was sent one way then the other and finally left in limbo as the Netherlands\u2019 No 11 crafted the space to crash a pinpoint shot inside the near post and open the scoring in their last-16 tie with Romania. The goal set aside some on-field nerves and the Dutch duly went on to put the Romanians to the sword. Well, eventually anyway. They crafted opening after opening and had 23 shots in total, but only six were on target, and it took until the final 10 minutes for the Oranje to seal the deal with a brace from Donyell Malen. Of those six shots on target, three were from Gakpo, who now sits at the top of the golden boot table alongside Jamal Musiala and Georges Mikautadze with three goals from his four games. Gakpo scored three times during the Qatar World Cup in 2022, too, which means half his goals as an international have come at major tournaments. Ronald Koeman mixed praise with a little joshing when assessing the performance of his forward. \u201cHis starting position is on the left side because he is really dangerous if he comes one against one with the right full-back,\u201d the head coach said. \u201cHe can go inside, outside, he has his qualities, he\u2019s strong. He then got a little bit tired and he chooses to play the nine [position]. Then he\u2019s so tired that we made the change [Gakpo was substituted in the 84th minute]. He\u2019s playing a great level this tournament, maybe the most important player until now. I hope that the rest can come to that level.\u201d In taking on Ratiu, and then later Radu Dragusin as he set up the second goal for Malen, Gakpo showed the qualities his manager was talking about. It was also reflective of what Cesc F\u00e0bregas meant when he described the 25-year-old as a \u201cfunctional\u201d player during the BBC\u2019s coverage. It may have sounded like damning with faint praise, but really the Spaniard was acknowledging Gakpo\u2019s ability to take on instruction and deploy it. F\u00e0bregas also described him as \u201cdangerous\u201d. Gakpo was the Dutch player of the year when he burst on to the international scene in Qatar and within weeks he had signed for Liverpool for \u00a335m. What has followed since has required a period of adjustment, with the player acknowledging the help he has received from his Anfield teammates when he collected his man-of-the-match award in Munich on Wednesday. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t always go how you like, sometimes you have a spell where things don\u2019t go your way,\u201d Gakpo said. \u201cBut I have a great team at Liverpool, great people who are there for you, they kept believing in me and helping me. The last few games of the season we were also good, I played good games. I took that with me and kept working hard and I\u2019m very happy I can be of value in this game tonight.\u201d Gakpo scored twice in the last three games of Liverpool\u2019s season after what, by common consent, had been an underwhelming year to that point. But the underlying numbers added a wrinkle. They showed that Gakpo was becoming more of a goal threat, taking more shots, and almost doubling the number he got on target (he went from 0.74 shots on target per game in his debut half season to 1.31 in 2023-24). These kinds of figures were comparable to his performances in the Eredivisie, suggesting that through instruction and practice he had adjusted to a higher standard of competition. This may be the Gakpo we are seeing now for the Dutch national team. Alongside all his other qualities; his height, his dribbling ability and his strength (as he showed against Dragusin), Gakpo is now becoming a reliable finisher. His first goal of the tournament was a deflection against Poland, albeit from an on-target shot, but his second against Austria was calm, efficient and into the top corner. Only a full-stretch save by Florin Nita and a desperate block by Razvan Marin prevented him from adding to his tally against Romania. In the tournament as a whole, Gakpo has now taken 11 shots and got seven on target. By comparison, the Euros\u2019 leading shot-taker Cristiano Ronaldo (no surprise there), has taken 20 shots and got nine on target. Only Ronaldo, Kai Havertz and Romelu Lukaku have been more threatening with their shot taking than Gakpo and they each play through the middle as their country\u2019s focal point of attack. The nominal No 9 for the Netherlands is Memphis Depay, who is clearly valued by Koeman but has just one (lovely) goal to his name at this tournament, alongside a whole host of misses. Xavi Simons is emerging as a key player for the Dutch at No 10 but does not boast clinical finishing as one of his key strengths. The right side, meanwhile, remains in flux. As Euro 2024 heads into its final stages, the margins will get tighter and the chances will become fewer and far between. To have a chance of winning the tournament you need a player who will take one. Gakpo might just prove to be that man for the Netherlands."

The warning comes amid a government clampdown on the EMC, which is active in the region near Cali where the summit will be held. The Colombian defence ministry said on Tuesday it had ended a ceasefire with parts of the EMC because of ongoing violence. A series of bombings and shootings have been blamed on the group. The Cop16 organising committee said it was working with local and national authorities to ensure a safe environment during the summit, which is due to begin on 21 October.

She said: \u201cWe\u2019ve all watched the recent tweets and other manifestations of armed groups in Colombia. The Colombian government is taking that very seriously. They\u2019re trying to track where this is coming from. There are a lot of conversations going on. I am confident that the Colombians are taking it seriously and that everything is being put in place to make Cop16 a safe and successful event.\u201d The 2016 peace deal between the Colombian government and the country\u2019s biggest guerrilla army, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), formally ended the longest-running war in the western hemisphere, which killed more than 260,000 people and forced 7 million from their homes. Thousands of rebel fighters demobilised but about 1,500 refused to sign up to the deal, and many more are likely to have returned to arms.

            "content": "England\u2019s healthcare regulator has issued a public apology over reforms to its monitoring of tens of thousands of hospitals, care homes, dentists and GPs. The apology from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) came in the wake of care organisations complaining of a \u201chostile\u201d inspection regime and a major new computer system failing to work properly. The government-established watchdog said sorry after the chief executive, Ian Trenholm, abruptly quit at the end of last month midway through reforms that were supposed to improve the assessment of the quality of health and social care providers. The CQC regulates close to 15,000 care homes, 13,000 homecare agencies, 11,500 dentists, 8,600 GPs and 1,200 hospitals as well as community services and supported living facilities. Care England, which represents private care providers, had complained of \u201cCQC\u2019s over-reliance on outdated data, the lack of transparency in their regulatory approach, and vast inconsistencies between assessments\u201d. \u201cI want to start with an apology,\u201d said Kate Terroni, the interim CQC chief executive, in an email circulated on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got things wrong in the implementation of our new regulatory approach. I know that the changes we\u2019ve delivered so far are not what we promised. It\u2019s made things more difficult than they should be.\u201d Providers have been experiencing delays to registration and have been unable to upload information to a new online \u201cprovider portal\u201d system intended to make regulation more efficient. Some have compared the hostility from inspectors \u2013 who give ratings from \u201cinadequate\u201d to \u201coutstanding\u201d \u2013 to that of Ofsted, which inspects schools and had to apologise over its role after the suicide of a headteacher, Ruth Perry. Terroni admitted the regulator \u201cdidn\u2019t listen properly\u201d when care providers and even members of the CQC\u2019s own staff warned of looming problems such as faults with the provider portal. \u201cThough there was significant engagement and co-production of the high-level elements of our approach, we didn\u2019t follow that process into the detail of how we\u2019ll assess providers,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that, for some of you, we\u2019ve lost your trust because of this. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The apology comes two months after the Cabinet Office and the Department of Health and Social Care launched a wide-ranging independent review of the CQC\u2019s effectiveness, chaired by Dr Penny Dash. The National Care Association, which represents independent care home operators, had in February publicly warned that \u201cthe culture in CQC remains hostile at the ground level\u201d and was forcing providers to consider closing. \u201cFor some time now the CQC has not been responsive to the challenges that the sector has faced because of poor inspection methodology,\u201d said Nadra Ahmed, the chair of the NCA, who welcomed the apology. \u201cMany providers have found the process very challenging, intimidating, and staff have been left in tears. A new framework for inspections was unveiled but the online portal to support evidence to be uploaded to the regulator \u2026 has failed to work. Providers have had to spend weeks trying to get online.\u201d Terroni said: \u201cWith my new role comes my commitment to urgently and rapidly improve how we\u2019re using our regulatory approach and to making the changes we need to steer us in the right direction.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-09T10:40:12Z",
            "content": "What if AI isn\u2019t that great? What if we\u2019ve been overstating its potential to a frankly dangerous degree? That\u2019s the concern of leading cancer experts in the NHS, who warn that the health service is obsessing over new tech to the point that it\u2019s putting patient safety at risk. From our story yesterday: In a sharply worded warning, the cancer experts say that \u2018novel solutions\u2019 such as new diagnostic tests have been wrongly hyped as \u2018magic bullets\u2019 for the cancer crisis, but \u2018none address the fundamental issues of cancer as a systems problem\u2019. A \u2018common fallacy\u2019 of NHS leaders is the assumption that new technologies can reverse inequalities, the authors add. The reality is that tools such as AI can create \u2018additional barriers for those with poor digital or health literacy\u2019. \u2018We caution against technocentric approaches without robust evaluation from an equity perspective,\u2019 the paper concludes. Published in the Lancet Oncology journal, the paper instead argues for a back to basics approach to cancer care. Its proposals focus on solutions like getting more staff, redirecting research to less trendy areas including surgery and radiotherapy, and creating a dedicated unit for technology transfer, ensuring that treatments that have already been proven to work are actually made a part of routine care. Against those much-needed improvements, AI can be an appealing distraction. The promise of the technology is that, within a few short years, a radical capability increase will enable AI technology to do jobs in the health service that can\u2019t currently be done, or at least that take up hours of a highly trained specialist\u2019s time. And the fear of the experts is that that promise about the future is distracting from changes needed today. It effectively casts AI as the latest example of \u201cbionic duckweed\u201d, a term coined by Stian Westlake in 2020 to cover the use, deliberately or otherwise, of technology that may or may not arrive in the future to argue against investment in the present. Elon Musk\u2019s Hyperloop is perhaps the most famous example of bionic duckweed, first proposed more than a decade ago explicitly to try and discourage California from going ahead with plans to construct a high-speed rail line. (The term comes from a real instance in the wild, in which the UK government was advised against electrifying railways in 2007 because \u201cwe might have \u2026 trains using hydrogen developed from bionic duckweed in 15 years\u2019 time \u2026 we might have to take the wires down and it would all be wasted\u201d. Seventeen years on, the UK continues to run diesel engines on non-electrified lines.) But the paper\u2019s fears about AI \u2013 and the general technophilia of the health service \u2013 are more than just that it might not arrive. Even if AI does actually start making headway in fighting cancer, without the right groundwork, it may be less useful than it could be. Back to the piece, a quote from the lead author, oncologist Ajay Aggarwal: AI is a workflow tool, but actually, is it going to improve survival? Well, we\u2019ve got limited evidence of that so far. Yes, it\u2019s something that could potentially help the workforce, but you still need people to take a patient\u2019s history, to take blood, to do surgery, to break bad news. Even if AI is as good as we hope it will be, in the short term, that might mean little for healthcare in general. Say AI can meaningfully speed up the work of a radiographer, diagnosing cancer earlier or faster after a scan: that means little if there are bottlenecks in the rest of the health service. In the worst-case scenario, you may even see a sort of AI-enabled denial of service attack, with the tech-powered sections of the workflow overwhelming the rest of the system. In the long term, AI boosters hope, systems will adapt to incorporate the technology well. (Or, if you\u2019re a true believer, then perhaps it\u2019s simply a case of waiting until AI can staff a hospital end-to-end.) But in the short term, it\u2019s important not to assume that just because AI can do some medical tasks, it can help fix a health system in crisis. Digital government Last week we looked at some ideas for what the new government could do around tech, and it\u2019s looking good for at least one of those suggestions. New secretary of state for science, innovation and technology Peter Kyle has been in office for just a few days, but is already hitting my inbox. The DSIT, he says, will: Become the centre for digital expertise and delivery in government, improving how the government and public services interact with citizens. We will act as a leader and partner across government, with industry and the research communities, to boost Britain\u2019s economic performance and power-up our public services to improve the lives and life chances of people through the application of science and technology. Specifically, DSIT will \u201chelp to upskill civil servants so they are better at using digital and AI in their frontline work\u201d. Last week, we called on Labour to \u201ctake AI government seriously\u201d; it looks as if they already are. Digital colleagues On the one hand, look, this is obviously a publicity stunt: Lattice is going to bring an AI employee through all the same processes a human employee goes through when they start a new role. We\u2019ll be adding them into the employee record and integrating them into our HRIS; we\u2019ll be adding them to the org chart so you can see where they fall within a team and department; we will be onboarding the AI employee and ensuring they undergo the training necessary for their role. And we will be assigning goals to this digital worker, to make sure we are holding them accountable to certain standards \u2013 just like we would with any other employee. This is going to be a huge learning moment for us, and for the industry. That\u2019s Sarah Franklin, the chief executive of HR platform Lattice, talking about the company\u2019s plans to take an AI employee through all the same steps as a human one. But if you want a peek at what AI success would look like, it\u2019s not far off this. Businesses are bad at bringing in new technology. If something works well enough, they tend to stick with it for years \u2013 decades, even \u2013 and it\u2019s a huge hurdle to encourage them to switch to a different way of doing things even if the gains seem great. But they\u2019re much better at bringing in new staff. They have to be: staff quit, retire, have children or die. If you can adapt the process of bringing in an AI worker to be more like the latter, and less like the former, you may well end up greatly expanding the pool of businesses who feel like they can deploy AI in their own world.

            "date": "2024-07-29T10:00:16Z",
            "content": "Kamala Harris is staking out health, and especially reproductive rights and affordable healthcare, as a central issue in her historic campaign for the US presidency, experts say. The first ad for the Harris campaign, released on Thursday, prioritized bodily autonomy, safety from gun violence, and affordable healthcare alongside issues like child poverty and the rule of law. Reproductive rights will be \u201cfar and away\u201d the driving focus of Harris\u2019s health-related messages \u2013 and her entire campaign \u2013 as well as prioritization of affordable healthcare and medications, according to Drew Altman, president of KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization. \u201cIf Harris wins this election, I think it would be because of abortion bans and because of Dobbs,\u201d said Greer Donley, associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. \u201cAbortion is a huge issue this election cycle \u2026 and I think it will really help the campaign to capitalize on all of the momentum and all of the rage and anger about abortion bans.\u201d In the wake of the Dobbs decision overturning the right to abortion, the Biden-Harris administration has \u201cdone an extraordinary job on this issue with the tools that they have\u201d, said Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. The administration solidified telehealth access for abortion, allowed veterans affairs hospitals to provide abortion counseling and services, clarified the Hipaa privacy rules to make sure health employees don\u2019t give protected information to law enforcement, and made sure that abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth and other reproductive healthcare are entitled to accommodations under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. \u201cThey did a lot,\u201d Donley said. In other aspects of health, the administration has built on the Affordable Care Act and the Medicaid program to expand coverage and affordability, and began negotiating Medicare drug pricing. \u201cWe have seen a real improvement in the numbers of people who have health insurance, and new resources to make health insurance more affordable,\u201d Corlette said. \u201cI would expect a Harris administration to try to build on and expand the gains in the Affordable Care Act,\u201d also known as Obamacare. Harris\u2019 campaign would probably go on the offense, Altman said, calling out Trump\u2019s policies and proposals to cut immensely popular health programs and contrasting them with gains over the past three years. Her posture probably \u201cwill be characterized much more by attacking Trump on positions she\u2019ll claim he will take on healthcare than by advancing her own healthcare positions\u201d, Altman said. As a senator, Harris was the first to co-sponsor the Medicare for All legislation put forward by the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, and as a presidential candidate in 2020, she unveiled her own version of a similar plan. In her time in Congress, Harris also sponsored a bill to prohibit certain abortion restrictions and she introduced a bill to require public and private health insurers to cover medications that prevent HIV infections. But \u201cI don\u2019t think the past is going to be terribly relevant\u201d, Altman said. As a presidential candidate, Harris needed to rally the base and appeal to undecided voters, he said. \u201cI would expect her to continue the kind of aggressive incrementalism that we\u2019ve seen from the Biden administration.\u201d One of the first healthcare battles facing a Harris administration would be the extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits originally enacted in 2021, now scheduled to expire at the end of 2025, Corlette said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a really important, critical battle, and I expect that she will champion a permanent extension of those \u2013 because that\u2019s just had a huge impact on the affordability of health insurance coverage for a lot of people.\u201d Republicans have proposed capping and cutting Medicaid, a \u201cvery popular\u201d program that covers almost 90 million Americans, Altman said. Some conservative Republican groups have also put forward fundamental changes to Medicare, which Altman calls \u201cpolitically a sacrosanct program\u201d. Trump and Vance have proposed weakening protections for people with pre-existing conditions, which are \u201cimmensely popular\u201d, Altman said, as well as major changes to or even repealing the Affordable Care Act. Republican groups have also revived a focus on tax-preferred health savings accounts, in an effort to make healthcare more consumer-driven. \u201cWhat you\u2019d likely see under a Trump administration is a dismantling of the federal government\u2019s involvement in healthcare,\u201d Corlette said. Yet \u201cone of the biggest pain points for Americans right now is the cost of healthcare \u2013 not just the cost of health insurance, but actually the cost when they go to the hospital or go to the doctor,\u201d she said. On abortion, Trump has proposed leaving the issue to the states \u2013 nearly one-third of which have total abortion bans. \u201cThat is not a position that is consistent with the majority of the American people,\u201d Donley said. \u201cIt\u2019s radical.\u201d Trump\u2019s abortion plank also invokes fetal personhood, which could make abortion, IVF procedures, and miscarriages prosecutable as murder. The concept of fetal personhood, wherein a zygote, embryo or fetus has the same rights as people, is \u201cvery scary. It\u2019s scary as everyone suggests it is, and not just for abortion,\u201d Donley said. While Biden\u2019s administration has made major strides on abortion, \u201cit\u2019s never been an issue that I think he personally has felt comfortable with,\u201d Corlette said. Biden rarely even says the word \u201cabortion\u201d. Harris, on the other hand, has been much more outspoken about reproductive rights. Whoever wins this election could one day nominate new justices to the US supreme court, if some of the older justices were to leave the court. \u201cIf Harris serves eight years, then she has the potential to really change the composition of the supreme court,\u201d Donley said. \u201cThat could be a method to get Dobbs overturned. And obviously that would have implications that are far bigger than abortion.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-04T09:39:35Z",
            "content": "Thousands of patients could face higher out-of-pocket healthcare costs after negotiations broke down between St Vincent\u2019s private hospital network and the private health fund, NIB, for a new funding agreement. On Thursday, St Vincent\u2019s Health Australia gave notice to NIB that it will walk away from its contract within the next 65 business days unless a fairer funding agreement is reached. Patients who use NIB for their private health insurance will likely be required to contribute more to the cost of their care when using a St Vincent\u2019s private hospital if a new funding agreement is not reached before the notice period ends on 3 October. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup St Vincent\u2019s operates 10 private hospitals in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. St Vincent\u2019s CEO, Chris Blake, said \u201cthis is not a decision we take lightly. This is the first time in our 167-year history that St Vincent\u2019s has given notice to a private health fund that we intend to end our agreement.\u201d The country\u2019s largest not-for-profit healthcare provider said it had done its utmost to reach an agreement, but NIB had failed to put a fair offer on the table that recognised the rising costs of providing private hospital care. Blake said inflation had driven up the costs of hospital care including wages, food, energy, personal protective equipment (PPE), IT and maintenance. \u201cFor example, in 2023, St Vincent\u2019s electricity costs were $6.5m. In 2024, we expect them to end up closer to $12m.\u201d In the last 12 months, St Vincent\u2019s had negotiated new agreements with Medibank, HCF and the Alliance group of health funds, which saw both sides give ground, he said. \u201cBut NIB has given us no choice but to make this call.\u201d NIB CEO and managing director, Mark Fitzgibbon, said the company has had \u201ca long partnership with St Vincent\u2019s, is sympathetic to St Vincent\u2019s financial position, and that of other private hospitals, and has made a very fair and reasonable offer to St Vincent\u2019s\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing they have elected to argue their position publicly. But we will continue discussions with them, noting our partnership has several months remaining,\u201d Fitzgibbon said. The peak body for doctors, the Australian Medical Association urged both parties to get back to the negotiating table and reach an agreement for the sake of patients. The AMA\u2019s president, Prof Steve Robson said, \u201cpatients are ultimately the ones who suffer from this sort of situation, as they will likely face higher out-of-pocket costs for treatment at St Vincent\u2019s network of private hospitals after 3 October this year\u201d. \u201cThese disputes undermine the confidence that Australians have in private health insurance arrangements, particularly as we continue to see significant premium increases at a time people are facing significant cost-of-living pressures,\u201d he said. Dr Katharine Bassett, the director of health policy at Catholic Health Australia, of which St Vincent\u2019s is a member, said it was \u201ctotally unacceptable for insurers to put the squeeze on patients and hospitals while increasing their large profit margins and bank balances\u201d. \u201cThis year NIB had one of the highest premium increases at 4.1%, yet in 2022\u201323 only returned 79% of premiums back to patients \u2013 well short of the industry\u2019s 90% gold standard and the lowest of the major insurers,\u201d Bassett said. \u201cToday St Vincent\u2019s is rightly taking a stand against insurer power and greed.\u201d The ACCC consumer watchdog\u2019s latest report on private health insurance suggested the industry\u2019s net profit after tax has more than doubled\u2013 with $2.19bn net profit in 2022-23 up from $1.04bn in 2021\u201322. During the last year alone, Bassett said, 71 private hospital services have closed due to financial difficulties. \u201cOur not-for-profit hospitals are at breaking point, with funding from insurers failing to keep up with the soaring cost of things like food, energy and equipment,\u201d she said. Blake agreed the situation reflected the \u201ccrisis in private healthcare in Australia\u201d. \u201cFor private health care to operate effectively, health funds and hospitals need to work together, and on an even playing field, for the benefit of our members and patients,\u201d Blake said. The CHA is calling for reforms to the annual premium round process and a new funding model called a National Private Price to ensure funding reflects the actual costs incurred by hospitals. The AMA is calling for an independent Private Health System Authority (PHSA) to ensure the sector is appropriately regulated, which Robson said would help solve disputes such as these and ensure patients get value for money."

            "date": "2024-07-18T04:00:24Z",
            "content": "The impact of austerity and Brexit on the UK\u2019s readiness for Covid will be spelt out at noon on Thursday when the statutory public inquiry into the pandemic gives its first verdict on the country\u2019s response. Politicians including David Cameron, George Osborne and Matt Hancock are braced to face criticism about their decision-making and priorities in the years running up to the arrival of Covid in early 2020 sparking a pandemic that claimed at least 230,000 lives across the UK. Senior health officials will also be held accountable for a strategy that focused heavily on pandemic flu. Heather Hallett, the former court of appeal judge chairing the inquiry, is likely to draw conclusions about the lack of transparency over pandemic-planning exercises in the years before Covid, including one into pandemic flu which warned: \u201cThe UK\u2019s current preparedness \u2026 is not sufficient to cope with the extreme demands of a severe pandemic.\u201d Brenda Doherty, a spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, a group representing nearly 7,000 bereaved people, said the report \u2013 the first of at least 10 planned in the next two to three years \u2013 would be \u201ca huge milestone for bereaved families like mine\u201d. Doherty\u2019s mother, Ruth Burke, 82, died from Covid acquired in hospital while awaiting discharge in March 2020 in Northern Ireland. She said: \u201cThe years leading up to [this] have been draining. We know, however, that the inquiry\u2019s recommendations have the potential to save lives in the future, if lessons have been learned from the loss of our loved ones.\u201d Families of people who died with Covid will gather outside the public inquiry hearing rooms in Paddington, west London, on Thursday before joining doctors from the British Medical Association (BMA) and representatives of the Trades Union Congress at the Covid memorial wall across the river from the Houses of Parliament. In her report on module one of the inquiry looking into resilience and preparedness, Lady Hallett will reach conclusions on the government\u2019s handling of the national stockpile of personal protective equipment as well as the UK\u2019s emergency preparedness, resilience and response structures. These were deemed so complex during the summer 2023 evidence hearings that they were repeatedly compared to \u201ca bowl of spaghetti\u201d. A key finding will centre on whether it was reasonable for the government to have focused planning for an influenza, rather than coronavirus, pandemic. Another will be on how little planning was given to the need for, and consequences of, lockdowns. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group is calling for urgent reforms from the Labour government, including the appointment of a secretary of state for resilience and civil emergencies, a standing scientific committee on pandemics, crisis training for ministers and officials and the establishment of a \u201cred team\u201d to challenge pandemic preparations. A spokesperson said: \u201cPlans for a pandemic were fatally inadequate; they were outdated, poorly communicated across the government, disregarded the impact of inequalities and were primarily concerned with pandemic flu. Such pandemic planning as there was did not address inequalities, and nothing was done to mitigate vulnerabilities caused by structural discrimination, institutional racism or health inequalities. Our loved ones, colleagues and communities paid the price for that failure.\u201d In what the former health secretary Matt Hancock called \u201ca flawed doctrine\u201d, the UK had planned for pandemic flu, which has symptomatic transmission, helping people know when to isolate. There were no plans for lockdowns or quarantining. The national risk assessment in 2019 said there was a moderate risk of an emerging respiratory coronavirus infection, but assessed it would kill only 2,000 people. Hallett was also asked to consider why mortality was 2.6 times higher in the most deprived than the least deprived tenth of areas; why mortality was highest in people from the Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Black Caribbean communities; and why rates were higher among people with a self-reported disability or a learning disability. Addressing Hallett during last summer\u2019s hearings, the counsel to the inquiry, Hugo Keith, said: \u201cThe big question for module one is to what extent were those terrible outcomes either foreseen or capable of mitigation? Fundamentally, in relation to significant aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic, we were taken by surprise?\u201d Under cross-examination, Cameron and Osborne, who were prime minister and chancellor respectively from 2010 to 2016, denied austerity was a factor in the response, with Osborne saying that cutting the deficit \u201chad a material and positive effect on the UK\u2019s ability to respond\u201d to Covid. But the BMA told Hallett that \u201cafter six weeks of hearings it is clear that the UK entered the pandemic with critically under-resourced and underfunded health and public health services\u201d. Keith said the inquiry would draw conclusions about \u201cto what degree have our public services, especially those of health and social care, suffered from underinvestment?\u201d Hallett heard evidence the UK had been made more vulnerable by Brexit. Sixteen separate pandemic preparation projects were \u201cstopped\u201d or reduced as a result of officials being diverted to brace for a no-deal Brexit."

A spokesperson for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group, speaking outside the UK Covid-19 Inquiry, said: \u201cWe, the bereaved families, whose experiences speak to the very heart of what went wrong, are relieved to see many of our recommendations reflected in Lady Hallett\u2019s report, in particular those that address the structures required to ensure that the UK is prepared and resilient to face the inevitable future pandemic.\u201d The former health secretaries Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock have been criticised for their failure to better prepare the UK for the pandemic in a damning first report from the Covid inquiry that calls for a major overhaul in how the government prepares for civil emergencies. Hunt, who was the health secretary from 2012-18, and Hancock, who took over until 2021, were named by the chair to the inquiry, Heather Hallett, for failing to rectify flaws in contingency planning ahead of the pandemic, which claimed more than 230,000 lives in the UK. Keir Starmer said the UK Covid-19 Inquiry\u2019s report confirmed that \u201cthe UK was under-prepared for Covid-19\u201d and that policy \u201cfailed UK citizens\u201d. The prime minister said in a statement: \u201cToday\u2019s report confirms what many have always believed - that the UK was under-prepared for Covid-19, and that process, planning and policy across all four nations failed UK citizens.\u201d The human and financial cost and sacrifice of the coronavirus pandemic \u201cwill have been in vain\u201d unless radical change is implemented, Lady Hallett warned. Concluding her statement, she said she expected each organisation responsible for applying her recommendations to set out within six months how it plans to respond. All recommendations must be implemented in order to bring about the changes needed, she said. The chair of the UK Covid-19 public inquiry said that one of the first lines of defence in a pandemic is \u201ccontainment\u201d but a system of test, trace and isolate \u201cdid not exist in the UK when the pandemic struck\u201d. Lady Hallett said: \u201cTo give but one vitally important example: one of the first lines of defence to a pandemic is containment and this requires a system of test, trace and isolate that can be rapidly scaled up to meet the demands of a major outbreak.\u201d The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association \u2013 the hospital doctors\u2019 union \u2013 has said \u201cthe incompetent lack of contingency planning \u2026 [resulted in] countless deaths, the trauma of working in horrific circumstances and lengthy lockdowns\u201d and said it has left an entire generation scarred. In a statement in response to the report, the HCSA president, Dr Naru Narayanan, said: \u201cThis lays bare the dereliction of duty at the top in the years leading up to the worst global healthcare emergency of modern times. Complacency in government left us grossly unprepared in the complete absence of any serious planning for a Covid-style pandemic.\u201d That\u2019s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the UK Covid-19 inquiry live blog. Thank you for following along. Keir Starmer has said the government will \u201ccarefully consider the recommendations\u201d of the first UK Covid-19 Inquiry report. In a written ministerial statement, the prime minister said: The government\u2019s first responsibility is to keep the public safe, and as prime minister I am personally committed to each and every family that lost loved ones, and whose lives were changed forever, that this government will learn the lessons from the Inquiry. This means ensuring that the UK is prepared for a future pandemic, as well as the broadest range of potential risks facing our country. That is a top priority for this government and what everyone should rightly expect from a government working in their service. The government is committed to working with our colleagues in the devolved governments, mayors and local partners as we carefully consider the recommendations in the report, as their efforts are vital to ensuring the resilience of the whole of the United Kingdom. I would like to thank Baroness Hallett and her team for their thorough work on this report. The government will carefully consider all of the findings and recommendations of the report in the context of the government\u2019s overall approach to resilience. In further response from the medical profession, the chairman of the British Medical Association, Professor Philip Banfield, has released a statement which does not hold back on its criticism of the \u201cdisinvestment and disinterest in public health\u201d he says took place under the Tories. \u201cThis report reveals in all its true horror how appallingly under-prepared the governments were for the pandemic, that processes failed us as citizens, and that lives could have been saved. \u201cWe knew that when the pandemic began our healthcare services were already struggling to cope and \u2018running hot\u2019 because of years of neglect and under investment by the Conservative government. \u201cThis report lays bare how, time and time again, ministers were told that we simply did not have enough staff or resources to cope with the predictable huge surge in demand for healthcare that a pandemic would bring. It shows just how many times governments ignored key findings \u2026 \u201cMany intensive care beds were occupied by the most vulnerable among us \u2013 those already navigating long-term illnesses, or those more at risk due to their ethnicity. As the report makes clear, we already had a relatively unhealthy population and widening health inequalities when the pandemic struck, which meant they were the hardest hit. \u201cThis unhealthy population was exacerbated by years of disinvestment and disinterest in public health by the government. The report shows how that disinterest continued, even during the pandemic, when ministers failed to engage with public health specialists and utilise their expertise \u2013 particularly on test and trace options. \u201cA key recommendation in the report is a call for fundamental reform of the way the UK prepares for civil emergencies on the scale of the Covid pandemic and whilst the BMA acknowledges this is the first of many reports and recommendations to come, we hope that change comes soon.\u201d The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association \u2013 the hospital doctors\u2019 union \u2013 has said \u201cthe incompetent lack of contingency planning \u2026 [resulted in] countless deaths, the trauma of working in horrific circumstances and lengthy lockdowns\u201d and said it has left an entire generation scarred. In a statement in response to the report, the HCSA president, Dr Naru Narayanan, said: \u201cThis lays bare the dereliction of duty at the top in the years leading up to the worst global healthcare emergency of modern times. Complacency in government left us grossly unprepared in the complete absence of any serious planning for a Covid-style pandemic. The false economy of underfunding NHS services left them in the worst possible place in the run-up to 2020. \u201cOur hospital doctor members, their colleagues, patients and the wider public were all victims of this incompetent lack of contingency planning and effectively left to fend for themselves when the pandemic hit. Countless deaths, the trauma of working in horrific circumstances and lengthy lockdowns have scarred lives and an entire generation as a result. \u201cThe fact is that the next pandemic is a matter of when, not if. Never again can a government be allowed to neglect its responsibility to plan, stockpile and protect its front-line workers and the wider population. \u201cBaroness Hallett\u2019s recommendations must be implemented in full and without delay. Those responsible must be held to account.\u201d Elkan Abrahamson, head of major inquests and inquiries at Broudie Jackson Canter, who represents the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group of almost 7,000 members, said: We are delighted to see that Baroness Hallett has listened and taken on board most of our recommendations to prevent a disaster like the Covid pandemic ever happening again. However, it is extremely disappointing that the vulnerable were ignored in the recommendations and there were no proposals for dealing with racial inequality, health inequalities or the effects of austerity. We will be taking this up with the government. We will be going back to the chair in the future to ask her to ensure that her crucial recommendations are carried out. Lady Hallett \u201chas not gone far enough\u201d in setting out how the UK can improve inequalities that were laid bare during the pandemic, bereaved families have said. A spokesperson for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group, speaking outside the UK Covid-19 Inquiry on Thursday, said: We, the bereaved families, whose experiences speak to the very heart of what went wrong, are relieved to see many of our recommendations reflected in Lady Hallett\u2019s report, in particular those that address the structures required to ensure that the UK is prepared and resilient to face the inevitable future pandemic. However, while the inquiry has diagnosed much of what undermined our response, Lady Hallett has not gone far enough in setting out how we can challenge, address and improve inequalities and capacity of public services as opposed to just understanding the effects of these failures. We ask for this government to produce a plan to address health inequalities and in its first 100 days conduct a cross-departmental audit into pandemic preparedness. We are also calling for the government to establish a minister for resilience and preparedness. We need somebody with ultimate responsibility for an emergency response who we can hold to account. Meanwhile, the Green Party warned that the UK \u201cis in an even worse position to deal with a pandemic today\u201d than it was four years ago because of the NHS crisis. North Herefordshire MP Ellie Chowns said: Our thoughts today are with the families of the over 230,000 people who have died from Covid-19, the key workers who risked their lives to keep the country going and countless others who had to make terrible sacrifices when Covid-19 first struck. As this report lays bare the awful truth is that many of those deaths, and the subsequent lengthy lockdowns we had to endure to bring cases down, would have been avoided if better preparation had been in place. We simply can never allow these failures to be repeated. The lessons of the \u201csystematic and political failings\u201d in preparing for the coronavirus pandemic must be \u201clearnt swiftly\u201d, the Liberal Democrats said. The party\u2019s health spokesperson Daisy Cooper said: Today\u2019s damning findings confirm in black and white what we unfortunately already knew. Our hearts go out to all those who lost loved ones during the pandemic, yet sadly these findings of systematic and political failings will provide little comfort for thousands of grieving families. Today must be a moment for change. The country was badly let down during the pandemic and this new government must ensure that lessons are learnt swiftly. The Liberal Democrats called for an inquiry in 2020, and we will continue to demand that the full facts are known about every aspect of this catastrophic failure. Keir Starmer said the UK Covid-19 Inquiry\u2019s report confirmed that \u201cthe UK was under-prepared for Covid-19\u201d and that policy \u201cfailed UK citizens\u201d. The prime minister said in a statement: The memories brought about by the inquiry will be very difficult for many people. My heartfelt sympathies go out to all those who lost a loved one during that time. The pandemic showed us that the backbone of Britain is made up of those committing their lives to service - key workers like carers, nurses, paramedics, cleaners and teachers. They put themselves in the eye of the storm, and together with people up and down the country, many of them lost their lives or are still living with the impact of the virus. Today\u2019s report confirms what many have always believed - that the UK was under-prepared for Covid-19, and that process, planning and policy across all four nations failed UK citizens. The safety and security of the country should always be the first priority, and this government is committed to learning the lessons from the inquiry and putting better measures in place to protect and prepare us from the impact of any future pandemic. Key flaws in preparedness highlighted in the report included: The UK being prepared for the wrong pandemic: influenza. When Hancock became health secretary in July 2018 his day one briefing said: \u201cPandemic flu is the government\u2019s highest risk\u201d. The institutions responsible for emergency planning being \u201clabyrinthine in their complexity\u201d. The government\u2019s sole pandemic strategy (for flu) being outdated \u2013 it was from 2011 \u2013 and lacking adaptability. A failure to appreciate the impact of the pandemic and the response to it on ethnic minority communities, and people in poor health and with other vulnerabilities. A failure to learn from earlier civil emergency exercises and disease outbreaks. A \u201cdamaging absence of focus\u201d on systems such as test, trace and isolate that could be scaled up. A lack of adequate leadership in the preceding years, with ministers, untrained in civil contingencies, not being presented with a broad range of scientific opinion. They also failed to sufficiently challenge the advice they got, which in any event was beset by \u201cgroupthink\u201d. The human and financial cost and sacrifice of the coronavirus pandemic \u201cwill have been in vain\u201d unless radical change is implemented, Lady Hallett warned. Concluding her statement, she said she expected each organisation responsible for applying her recommendations to set out within six months how it plans to respond. All recommendations must be implemented in order to bring about the changes needed, Hallett said. \u201cUnless the lessons are learned and fundamental change is implemented the human and financial cost and sacrifice of the Covid-19 pandemic will have been in vain,\u201d she said. \u201cThe harrowing accounts of loss and grief given by the bereaved witnesses and others who suffered during the pandemic serve to remind us why there must be radical reform.\u201d Lady Hallett said that UK citizens were \u201cfailed\u201d. \u201cI have no hesitation in concluding that the processes, planning and policy of the civil contingency structures across the UK failed the citizens of all four nations,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were serious errors on the part of the state and serious flaws in our civil emergency systems. This cannot be allowed to happen again.\u201d The chair of the UK Covid-19 public inquiry said that one of the first lines of defence in a pandemic is \u201ccontainment\u201d but a system of test, trace and isolate \u201cdid not exist in the UK when the pandemic struck\u201d. Lady Hallett said: To give but one vitally important example: one of the first lines of defence to a pandemic is containment and this requires a system of test, trace and isolate that can be rapidly scaled up to meet the demands of a major outbreak. This did not exist in the UK when the Covid- 19 pandemic struck. The UK government\u2019s sole pandemic strategy, from 2011, was outdated and lacked adaptability. It was never in fact properly tested. The UK government neither applied it nor adapted it and the doctrine that underpinned it was ultimately abandoned, as was the 2011 strategy itself. Lady Hallett said there were \u201cfatal strategic flaws underpinning the assessment of the risks faced by the UK. She said: \u201cThe institutions and structures responsible for emergency planning were labyrinthine in their complexity. \u201cThere were fatal strategic flaws underpinning the assessment of the risks faced by the UK, how those risks and their consequences could be managed and prevented from worsening and how the state should respond.\u201d The UK was \u201cdangerously mistaken\u201d to believe that it was one of the best prepared countries in the world to respond to a pandemic, Lady Hallett said. In 2019, it was widely believed in Britain and abroad that the UK was \u201cnot only properly prepared but was one of the best-prepared countries in the world to respond to a pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cThis belief was dangerously mistaken. In reality, the UK was ill-prepared for dealing with the whole-system civil emergency of a pandemic, let alone the coronavirus pandemic that actually struck. Lady Hallett said the UK will face \u201cimmense suffering\u201d if it is not better prepared for the next pandemic. Releasing her first report on pandemic preparedness and resilience in the UK, she said: There will likely be a next time. The expert evidence suggests it is not a question of \u2018if\u2019 another pandemic will strike but \u2018when\u2019. The evidence is overwhelmingly to the effect that another pandemic - potentially one that is even more transmissible and lethal - is likely to occur in the near to medium future. That means that the UK will again face a pandemic that, unless we are better prepared, will bring with it immense suffering and huge financial cost and the most vulnerable in society will suffer the most. Among the recommendations in the report are: The leader or deputy leader of each of the four nations should chair a Cabinet level committee responsible for civil emergency preparedness. A UK-wide pandemic response exercise should run at least every three years and a new UK-wide whole-system civil emergency strategy put in place. External \u201cred teams\u201d should regularly challenge the principles, evidence and advice on emergency plans An independent statutory body to advise the UK government and devolved administrations should be set up and consult with voluntary groups and council-based directors of public health on civil emergency preparedness and response. The findings about the UK\u2019s structures and procedures in place to prepare for and respond to a pandemic are the first from the statutory inquiry into the Covid-19 and are based on six weeks of hearings last summer as well as the disclosure of thousands of documents. The former health secretaries Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock have been criticised for their failure to better prepare the UK for the pandemic in a damning first report from the Covid inquiry that calls for a major overhaul in how the government prepares for civil emergencies. Hunt, who was health secretary from 2012 to 2018 and Hancock who took over until 2021 were both named by the chair to the inquiry, Lady Hallett, for failing to rectify flaws in contingency planning ahead of the pandemic that claimed over 230,000 lives in the UK. The UK government had focused largely on the threat of an influenza outbreak despite the fact that coronaviruses in Asia and the Middle East in the previous years meant \u201canother coronavirus outbreak at a pandemic scale was foreseeable\u201d and to overlook that was \u201ca fundamental error\u201d. \u201cIt was not a black swan event,\u201d said Hallett in a 240-page report that concluded: \u201cthe processes, planning and policy of the civil contingency structures within the UK government and devolved administrations and civil services failed their citizens\u201d. A key finding will centre on whether it was reasonable for the government to have focused planning for an influenza, rather than coronavirus, pandemic. Another will be on how little planning was given to the need for, and consequences of, lockdowns. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group is calling for urgent reforms from the Labour government, including the appointment of a secretary of state for resilience and civil emergencies, a standing scientific committee on pandemics, crisis training for ministers and officials and the establishment of a \u201cred team\u201d to challenge pandemic preparations. A spokesperson said: Plans for a pandemic were fatally inadequate; they were outdated, poorly communicated across the government, disregarded the impact of inequalities and were primarily concerned with pandemic flu. Such pandemic planning as there was did not address inequalities, and nothing was done to mitigate vulnerabilities caused by structural discrimination, institutional racism or health inequalities. Our loved ones, colleagues and communities paid the price for that failure. Prof Smeeth also said that a pandemic treaty with other countries was \u201cessential\u201d. He added: We should find ways to collectively defend our whole planet and commit to sharing data, know-how and resources - such as surveillance tools, protective equipment and vaccines - on a global scale while we can. We don\u2019t know what the next dangerous outbreak will be, what we do know is that it\u2019s going to happen. We need to seize the moment to agree new ways of working, and deeper collaboration so that we are better prepared for the next global disease threat when it arrives. Academics have said it is a question of \u201cwhen not if\u201d another pandemic will hit, so it is hoped that recommendations, if implemented, could put the UK in a better starting place to face a new and unknown disease - known by many as Disease X. One leading expert said that officials should adopt counter terrorism-like approaches to prepare for future pandemic threats. Professor Liam Smeeth, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), told the PA news agency: The key lesson from the first UK Covid Inquiry report is that if the UK waits for the next pandemic to emerge, it will be too late. The fight against pandemics is like counter-terrorism, we must use similar approaches such as gathering and sharing the best intelligence on global disease threats and joining forces to confront outbreaks before they become pandemics. Like terrorists, lethal viruses take no notice of national borders and can strike anywhere at any time. We have to work with global partners to combat this global threat: this means not just improving our planning, surveillance, and ability to respond in the UK, but supporting those on the front line fighting outbreaks around the world. Brenda Doherty, a spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, a group representing nearly 7,000 bereaved people, said the report \u2013 the first of at least 10 planned in the next two to three years \u2013 would be \u201ca huge milestone for bereaved families like mine\u201d. Doherty\u2019s mother, Ruth Burke, 82, died from Covid acquired in hospital while awaiting discharge in March 2020 in Northern Ireland. She said: The years leading up to [this] have been draining. We know, however, that the inquiry\u2019s recommendations have the potential to save lives in the future, if lessons have been learned from the loss of our loved ones. The report is expected to highlight the UK\u2019s focus on preparing for a flu pandemic instead of a coronavirus pandemic. Harriet Hallett may highlight how austerity measures led to public health cut backs, PA reported. She could potentially also comment on preparations surrounding personal protective equipment (PPE) and a government focused on Brexit. Key politicians, scientists and health experts appeared as witnesses during the first module of the inquiry - which is titled Resilience and Preparedness. Former health secretaries Matt Hancock and Jeremy Hunt were put under the spotlight during oral evidence sessions, alongside the former prime minister David Cameron and former levelling up secretary Michael Gove. Good morning and welcome to our live blog following the release of the first report from the long-running UK Covid inquiry. It will be released at noon BST and will deliver an eagerly-awaited verdict on how Brexit and austerity affected the country\u2019s readiness for the pandemic in which more than 200,000 people died in the UK. Politicians including David Cameron, George Osborne and Matt Hancock are braced to face criticism about their decision-making and priorities in the run-up to the outbreak of the disease in early 2020. I\u2019m Tom Ambrose and will be following all the news and reaction. In the meantime you can read our excellent preview article from my colleague, Robert Booth."

            "content": "Pressure on Beijing to take steps to improve Chinese consumer confidence has intensified after news that weak retail spending dragged down the growth rate of the world\u2019s second biggest economy. With falling house prices still acting as a drag on activity, official figures showed the Chinese economy expanding at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter \u2013 much weaker than the 5.1% expected by the financial markets. Annual retail sales growth slowed from 3.2% to 2% in the three months ending in June \u2013 the weakest in 18 months \u2013 and fell slightly in June alone. Lynn Song, the chief China economist at ING bank, said retail sales growth was the lowest since the country emerged from Covid-19 lockdowns and showed the depressed state of consumer confidence remained a big headwind to the economic recovery. \u201cA negative wealth effect from falling property and stock prices, as well as low wage growth amid various industries\u2019 cost cutting is dragging consumption and causing a pivot from big-ticket purchases toward a basic \u2018eat, drink and play\u2019 theme,\u201d Song said. The government in Beijing has set a growth target for 2024 of 5% \u2013 something analysts consider to be a stretch in the absence of tax cuts, spending increases and measures to help the property market. On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded by 0.7% in the three months to June, compared with a downwardly revised 1.5% in the first quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said. To counter soft domestic demand and its property crisis, China has increased infrastructure investment and ploughed funds into hi-tech manufacturing. Strong export growth has partly compensated for the reluctance of consumers to spend. Figures released last week showed China\u2019s exports in June were up 8.6% from a year earlier, while imports shrank by 2.3%. Duncan Wrigley, the chief China+ economist at Pantheon Macro, said: \u201cThe property market is showing tentative signs of bottoming out. New home prices sank 0.67% month on month in June, a trivial improvement from the 0.71% drop in May. Preowned home prices dropped 0.85%, after the 1.00% dive in May. Residential sales value fell 12.2% year on year in June, partly thanks to base effects, after crashing 26.4% in May.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-14T05:00:42Z",
            "content": "The first official report by the UK Covid inquiry is set to expose a catalogue of failures by the last Conservative government and health officials in the run-up to the pandemic. Lady Heather Hallett, the inquiry\u2019s chair, will issue the report on Thursday and make recommendations to ensure that the UK is better prepared for any future outbreak. The British Medical Association (BMA), the doctors\u2019 union, has urged Hallett in her initial findings to reflect the \u201cappalling failure\u201d to supply doctors and other health workers with the required PPE. The inquiry has been told of a catalogue of failings in preparing for a pandemic during years of austerity under the Tories and the Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition. Former health secretaries Matt Hancock and Jeremy Hunt, as well as former prime minister David Cameron, were among those who gave evidence at the inquiry. An expert report for the UK Covid inquiry by the medical historian Claas Kirchhelle found decisions were taken to reduce the \u201cUK preparedness stockpiles\u201d from 2012 onwards. This included surgical masks and FFP3 respirators, which provide maximum protection from airborne infection. Kirchhelle said the government cuts costs by opting to buy some respirators within weeks of a pandemic being declared, rather than hold them in stockpiles. This procurement was known as \u201cjust in time\u201d. \u201cRelying on [just in time] provision of critical PPE would result in substantial savings,\u201d states Kirchhelle\u2019s report. \u201cHowever the approach also created greater vulnerability should supply chains be disrupted.\u201d According to evidence submitted to Hallett\u2019s inquiry, the minutes of a pandemic flu clinical counter-measures meeting in October 2017 recorded: \u201cThe respirator stockpile will need to be replenished in FY [financial year] 2019/20. Suppliers have been engaged to explore options to further prolong the life of the stockpile and minimize re-procurement.\u201d The challenges in urgently securing supplies of PPE during the Covid-19 pandemic were compounded by failures to deliver the equipment that was expected as part of the \u201cjust in time\u201d contracts. By January 2022, the Department of Health and Social Care had spent \u00a312.6bn on PPE, including contracts with companies referred into a \u201cVIP lane\u201d by Tory ministers and officials. The BMA\u2019s submission to the inquiry stated: \u201cThere is no doubt that the provision of PPE to healthcare workers during the pandemic was hopelessly inadequate, and that the task for the inquiry is to determine why this occurred, to ensure that it does not happen again.\u201d The inquiry is also investigating procurement and is likely to make findings on the responsibility and reasons for these diminished PPE stockpiles. Hallett will examine whether the risk of a pandemic with the features of Covid-19 could have been foreseen and planned for. Lawyers representing bereaved families said there was evidence that a \u201chigh-impact newly-emergent\u201d disease could have been predicted. Instead, the UK pandemic preparation focused on an influenza-style pandemic. There were nearly 220,000 deaths involving Covid-19 from March 2020 to March 2023. The bereaved families say that the policy of austerity undermined health services and made it more likely that \u201ceven a moderate pandemic would overrun the system\u201d. They say civil contingency structures were not fit for purpose, and that they were lacking in policy, leadership and oversight. The Department of Health and Social Care has accepted that PPE was in short supply during the pandemic, but asserts that the UK never ran out nationally. In a submission to the inquiry, it stated: \u201cCovid-19 was a huge shock to the entire world. Our resilience as a society was tested \u2026 The department is committed to learning lessons and implementing change where necessary.\u201d The Covid inquiry is split into different investigations. A second report into \u201cdecision-making and political governance\u201d is expected later this year. The inquiry is due to hear evidence from September on the effect of the pandemic on healthcare systems. Susie Flintham, on behalf of the Covid 19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, said: \u2018We have submitted 71 proposed recommendations which we hope to see included in the inquiry\u2019s report. Bereaved families like mine, who fought to bring about this inquiry, know that the value of the inquiry depends on the strength of the recommendations. The years leading up to this moment have been emotionally draining for everyone whose loved ones were tragically let down by an underprepared government, but we know that the inquiry\u2019s recommendations have the potential to save lives in the future, if lessons have been learned from our experiences.\u201d"

            "content": "An employer has been told to pay more than \u00a326,000 to a former worker for deliberately coughing in her face during the Covid pandemic. Kevin Davies \u2013 the father of the Wales rugby player Gareth Davies \u2013 set out to \u201cridicule and intimidate\u201d the woman over her health concerns, a tribunal heard. Davies, 62, mocked the employee of his car sales and property business in the days before lockdown after she expressed her health fears to colleagues. The woman had asked fellow workers at Cawdor Cars to socially distance from her \u2013 as was recommended by officials \u2013 because she suffered from psoriatic arthritis and an autoimmune condition. The employment judge Tobias Vincent Ryan said Davies \u201ccoughed in her direction deliberately and loudly, commenting that she was being ridiculous\u201d. Judge Ryan said Davies set out to \u201cridicule and intimidate\u201d the woman with his \u201cgross behaviour\u201d on 17 March 2020 \u2013 a week before the first lockdown was announced. The hearing was told the woman had worked for Cawdor Cars in Newcastle Emlyn, west Wales, between 2017 and 2020 and earned \u00a311 an hour. The company has six branches across south and west Wales. It also has a property rental section where she worked as a property manager for its portfolio, including hotels and housing developments. Judge Ryan found other members of the firm\u2019s management team overheard the coughing incident, but he said when called to give evidence in the tribunal they came across \u201cdefensively and as not being wholly straightforward\u201d. The tribunal heard the woman complained \u201cvehemently\u201d about the coughing incident and resigned from the business less than three months later. Ryan said: \u201cShe resigned at least in part because she was victimised; this was a major and significant factor in her decision. She felt that she was being eased out partly because of her complaints. She was correct.\u201d The judge ordered that the woman receive a payout of \u00a326,438.84 \u2013 with Cawdor Cars handing her \u00a318,000 in damages for injury to feelings and Davies paying \u00a33,841.94 for unfair dismissal and \u00a34,596.90 in interest. Speaking after the hearing, the woman said she was left a \u201cnervous wreck\u201d after Davies\u2019 \u201chorrendous\u201d conduct. She said: \u201cHe knew of my medical condition. He knew I had no immune protection because of the medication I had to take, and he deliberately coughed in my face. I was shaking. I\u2019m not a silly, fluffy person \u2013 I\u2019ve had to put up with a lot in my life \u2013 but it really got me.\u201d Davies\u2019 son Gareth is nicknamed Gareth Cawdor over his connections to his father\u2019s business.

            "date": "2024-07-31T22:30:27Z",
            "content": "Health problems and brain fog can persist for years in people hospitalised by Covid early in the pandemic, with some patients developing more severe and even new symptoms after 12 months, researchers say. They found that while many people with long Covid improved over time, a substantial proportion still had cognitive problems two to three years later and saw symptoms of depression, anxiety and fatigue worsen rather than subside. The scientists studied long Covid in 475 people who were hospitalised with the virus before vaccines were available, to learn whether brain fog, fatigue and mental health problems persisted or emerged beyond the first year. While the researchers had no information on the participants\u2019 thinking skills before they got Covid, cognitive tests two to three years later showed that on average patients\u2019 IQs were 10 points lower than expected for their age, education and other factors. One in nine showed signs of \u201csevere cognitive deficits\u201d, which equate to an IQ 30 points lower than expected. Questionnaires completed by participants showed that many felt moderate to severe levels of depression (47%), fatigue (40%) and anxiety (27%) two to three years after Covid. Rather than improving over time, the symptoms were on average worse two to three years after infection than at six to 12 months. \u201cWhat we already knew before doing the study was that Covid-19 was associated with a greater risk of cognitive problems, depression and anxiety compared with other respiratory infections,\u201d said Dr Max Taquet, an author on the study from the University of Oxford. \u201cWe found that in our cohort there was a substantial neuropsychiatric burden at two to three years.\u201d More than one in four people in the study changed occupation after catching the virus, often because they could no longer face the cognitive demands of their job. Those who fared worse over the years were often among the sickest six months after infection, but the severity of the original illness did not appear to affect their long-term outcome. Although the proportion of patients reporting depression, anxiety and fatigue rose after six months, cognitive problems appeared to improve. Six months after infection, 44% had objective cognitive deficits compared with 33% at two to three years. The work, published in Lancet Psychiatry, led the authors to stress the importance of diagnosing and managing long Covid symptoms early to reduce the risk of people developing a more complex disorder. According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of people with long Covid continues, to grow with 2 million people in England and Scotland now experiencing symptoms. The brain fog many report is equivalent to a six-point drop in IQ, one recent study found. Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study, said the findings were \u201cprofound and alarming\u201d and warned people not to be complacent in the era of vaccines and milder Covid variants. The risk of long Covid has dropped from about 10% in the first wave of infections to about 2.5% today, but that still amounts to a \u201chuge number of cases\u201d, Altmann said. \u201cThere could not be a more stark warning that Covid-19 is ongoing and can still do awful things to you, so it\u2019s worth staying boosted and avoiding reinfection.\u201d The scientists urge caution over the results, however. Only 19% of the 2,500 people invited on to the study took part, and if those who agreed fared much worse or much better than the wider group, it would skew the results. It is also unclear whether people who developed long Covid later in the pandemic, after vaccination, and without being hospitalised, would experience as severe health problems."

            "date": "2024-07-19T15:56:45Z",
            "content": "The UK is probably less well-equipped to cope with a pandemic than it was before Covid because of deteriorating health inequalities, the crisis in the NHS and pressures in care homes, leading experts have warned. The head of the British Medical Association (BMA) said that the overall situation meant the nation would be \u201cstill massively underprepared\u201d when a new pandemic hit. The first report of the official Covid inquiry, published on Thursday, pointed to major failures in government planning and warned that more must be done to improve preparedness. Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, whose department heads up emergency planning, told the Commons on Friday that while there was more to be done, \u201cprogress had been made\u201d under the Conservatives in improving pandemic measures. But a series of experts say this might be fruitless given the worsening situation in many other relevant areas, including declining public health and increasing inequalities, much of it a function of austerity policies. Sir Michael Marmot, professor of public health at University College London and author of a pair of landmark government-commissioned reports into health inequality, said the impact of Covid confirmed his predictions that such a pandemic \u201cwould expose the underlying inequalities in society and amplify them\u201d. He said: \u201cThe lesson to me is that to prepare for the next pandemic, we need to prepare to improve the health of the population. But the health inequalities have got bigger. We\u2019re in a worse state now.\u201d Between 2010 and 2022, statistics for life expectancy in the UK were static, he said. \u201cOver that 13 years, life expectancy did not improve at all. I don\u2019t know another period in peacetime since 1900 where we\u2019ve gone 13 years without an improvement in life expectancy.\u201d The Association of Directors of Public Health, which represents local public health leaders, echoed Marmot\u2019s words, saying that improvements in preventable illnesses such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes would help mitigate the impact of a new virus. \u201cIt is now well-evidenced that products like alcohol, unhealthy food, gambling products and fossil fuels are a strong contributory factor to these non-communicable diseases,\u201d said Greg Fell, the association\u2019s president. \u201cTherefore, to become more resilient, we must invest in reducing the levels of consumption of these harmful products.\u201d There was also a need to better invest in public health, Fell added, saying that now there were \u201csimply not enough properly trained and resourced staff to carry out our role effectively\u201d. Another major weakness raised was the state of the NHS, with Prof Philip Banfield, the chair of council at the BMA, saying the Covid report made it clear \u201cthat we are still massively underprepared for when \u2013 not if \u2013 the next pandemic hits\u201d. He said: \u201cWe went into the pandemic with a sick population, with huge health inequalities, public health services stripped to the bone and the NHS and social care understaffed and under-resourced. \u201cNone of this has improved since and, in many cases, has got worse; this cannot all be blamed on the pandemic itself.\u201d Dr Tim Cooksley, immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said the impact of a new pandemic during an existing winter crisis would be \u201csimply unimaginable\u201d. He added: \u201cThe conclusion that we are less prepared for a pandemic as we stand today is indisputable. Acute hospital services are collapsing. \u201cThere is insufficient workforce and capacity to meet current demands which leads to patients suffering harm and appalling conditions on a daily basis. There are insufficient critical care beds.\u201d The head of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, Dr Daniele Bryden, warned that the UK still did not have capacity in hospital intensive care units to cope with a future pandemic, despite these having played a key role during Covid. This included an uneven distribution of beds and a lack of staff, she said. \u201cOverall, intensive care capacity is not yet sufficiently robust to weather another challenge.\u201d Martin McKee, professor of public health at the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that while Covid had provided \u201ca wealth of evidence\u201d to assist in areas including airborne transmission and treatments, there was little evidence the UK was better prepared overall than in 2020. \u201cNHS performance is demonstrably worse,\u201d he said. \u201cChild mortality, an indicator of social conditions, is worse than in 2020 and inequalities by level of deprivation and ethnicity have widened.\u201d While Covid also highlighted ways to better protect people in care from a pandemic \u2013 a module of the inquiry on this will report later \u2013 people in the care sector warned that it was not necessarily any better able to cope. Jane Townson, chief executive of the Homecare Association, which represents domiciliary care providers, said: \u201cNothing has changed from before. In fact, arguably things are worse. The sector remains in a very weakened state. \u201cUK workforce numbers have decreased by 70,000 over the last two years. The growth in workforce numbers has come solely from international recruitment.\u201d Mike Padgham, chair of the Independent Care Group, a membership organisation for care home operators, said: \u201cWe are as vulnerable now as we were in 2019. Only this week we heard that social care is understaffed by some 131,000 and that an extra 540,000 social care staff will be needed by 2040 to cope with rising demand. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t speak to me of a sector that is ready for anything the world can throw at it \u2013 it says exactly the opposite.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-18T11:21:50Z",
            "content": "Was the UK prepared for Covid? The statutory public inquiry into the pandemic has given its verdict, revealing the impact of austerity and Brexit on the UK\u2019s response and giving bereaved families a measure of vindication and validation. Here are the main points covered in the first of several reports from the inquiry. Lives could have been saved The pandemic caused \u201cgrief, untold misery and economic turmoil\u201d \u2013 all of which could have been reduced or prevented had the UK been better prepared, the inquiry\u2019s chair, Heather Hallett, concluded. Lives would have been spared \u2013 in particular those of the groups worst affected, including people with physical and learning disabilities, those with pre-existing conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s, heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes, and people living in deprived areas and from some ethnic minority backgrounds. As well as the deaths directly caused by the virus, the pandemic caused human suffering indirectly, including wreaking havoc on the NHS, especially on waiting lists and elective care, and increasing levels of mental illness, loneliness, deprivation and exposure to domestic violence. She described the pandemic as \u201cthe gravest and most multi-layered peacetime emergency\u201d. Not a question of if, but when The evidence is \u201coverwhelmingly to the effect\u201d that there will be another pandemic, and it is \u201cnot a question of \u2018if\u2019 \u2026 but \u2018when\u2019\u201d. The next pandemic may be \u201ceven more transmissible and lethal\u201d, and is likely to occur in the near to medium future. Without \u201cfundamental change\u201d, the effort in curbing the spread of coronavirus and the human, societal and economic cost suffered from it \u201cwill have been in vain\u201d. Lady Hallett wrote: \u201cNever again can a disease be allowed to lead to so many deaths and so much suffering.\u201d Hubris and \u2018groupthink\u2019 Hallett wrote that in 2019, there was widespread belief, in part resulting from \u201cgroupthink\u201d in government, that the UK was \u201cnot only properly prepared, but was one of the best-prepared countries in the world to respond to a pandemic\u201d. Yet, she observed, in 2020 \u201cthe UK lacked resilience\u201d, including widening health inequalities, high levels of heart disease, diabetes, respiratory illness and obesity, and an overstretched health and social care system. She noted that proper preparation for a pandemic \u201ccosts money\u201d and \u201cinvolves preparing for an event that may never happen\u201d \u2013 yet this is \u201cvastly outweighed\u201d by the cost of not doing so. She added that the ability of the health and social care systems to respond was \u201cconstrained by their funding\u201d. There was a \u201cdamaging absence of focus\u201d on useful interventions, in particular a test, trace and isolate system capable of dealing with large numbers of cases. There was a \u201clack of adequate leadership\u201d in rectifying contingency planning, including from the former health secretaries Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock. \u201cAll four nations were slow to implement what were important and necessary preparations for a pandemic,\u201d Hallett wrote, noting that resources were reallocated in 2018 towards contingency planning for a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit rather than implementing recommendations from Exercise Cygnus, the government\u2019s 2016 pandemic readiness exercise. The UK prepared for the wrong pandemic The UK had planned for an influenza pandemic, which had \u201clong been considered, written about and planned for\u201d \u2013 yet Hallett noted that the Covid-19 pandemic was \u201cnot without precedent\u201d, and disputed the idea pushed by some officials that it was an unforeseeable \u201cblack swan event\u201d. This preparation was \u201cinadequate for a global pandemic of the kind that struck\u201d, and although reasonable to prioritise, should not have excluded other potential pathogen outbreaks, which have been increasing in number. The international scientific community considered a coronavirus pandemic \u201ca reasonable bet\u201d before 2020, given there were four large coronavirus outbreaks that nearly became pandemics earlier in the 21st century. The influenza response was contained in the sole government pandemic strategy, from 2011, but it was \u201coutdated and lacked adaptability\u201d, including paying \u201cinsufficient attention to the economic and social consequences\u201d and to understanding which people were most vulnerable. The strategy focused on managing the impact of a milder virus where spread was inevitable rather than preventing disease and death. It was jettisoned almost immediately. There was also too much emphasis on advising citizens and trusting them to take precautionary measures they deemed fit rather than considering \u201cwhich aspects of legal coercion to protect the public may be used\u201d, added Hallett. She concluded: \u201cThe processes, planning and policy of the civil contingency structures within the UK government and devolved administrations and civil services failed their citizens.\u201d Radical government reforms needed Hallett urged a \u201cfundamental reform of the way in which the UK government and the devolved administrations prepare for whole-system civil emergencies\u201d, and condemned the government reviews and changes since the pandemic as \u201cfail[ing] on a number of grounds\u201d. She identified several \u201csignificant flaws\u201d in the UK\u2019s response to the pandemic, including a failure to learn from previous outbreaks of disease and properly assess risk, a lack of a coherent strategy, and too narrow a range of scientific advice given to ministers. She said there had been \u201ca lack of openness\u201d in government, and pandemic-readiness exercises were \u201cnot subject to the level of independent scrutiny required\u201d. She recommended taking responsibility for pandemic planning away from the Department of Health and Social Care and creating a single, independent statutory body responsible for whole-system preparedness and response, drawing on both socioeconomic and scientific expertise. This should simplify the \u201clabyrinthine\u201d civil emergency and resilience systems based on complex \u201cspaghetti diagrams\u201d of institutions, structures and systems, and replace these with a single ministerial committee or cross-departmental group of senior officials with responsibility, accountability and \u201ca clear purpose\u201d in each UK nation. This should be underpinned by a new UK-wide whole-system civil emergency strategy, incorporating lessons learned from three-yearly pandemic-response exercises, taking into account health inequalities, and involving the Treasury to produce an economic strategy to consider short, medium and long-term consequences. She recommended improving risk assessment to take into account a wider range of possibilities and not just one reasonable worst-case scenario, improving data collection, and bringing in more expertise from outside the government. Noting that she agreed with the observation by Hunt, a former health minister, that \u201ccollectively we didn\u2019t put anything like the time and effort and energy\u201d into understanding the dangers of pathogens or challenging the consensus, she said in future ministers and officials \u201cmust immerse themselves in the topic, understand it and ask questions about it\u201d. \u201cThe aim should be to end the culture of consensus in which orthodoxy becomes entrenched,\u201d Hallett wrote, adding that advisers should have the autonomy to express differing opinions. Hallett will monitor closely the implementation of the recommendations in each UK nation, and expects many to be in place within six months to a year."

            "date": "2024-07-25T15:00:24Z",
            "content": "Researchers have raised hopes for delaying dementia after finding that a recently approved shingles vaccine was linked to a substantial reduction in diagnoses of the condition in the six years after receiving the shot. The discovery, based on US medical records, suggests that beyond the health benefits of preventing shingles, a painful and sometimes serious condition in elderly people, the vaccine may also delay the onset of dementia, the UK\u2019s leading cause of death. Dr Maxime Taquet at the University of Oxford, the first author on the study, said the results supported the idea that shingles vaccination may prevent dementia. \u201cIf validated in clinical trials, these findings could have significant implications for older adults, health services, and public health.\u201d Shingles is caused by the herpes zoster virus and can flare up in people who have previously had chickenpox. When a shingles vaccine, Zostavax, was first rolled out in 2006, a number of studies found hints that the risk of dementia seemed to be lower in those who got the shots. The development of a new and more effective shingles vaccine, Shingrix, led to a rapid switch in the US in October 2017, meaning those who were vaccinated before that date received Zostavax, while those vaccinated after tended to have Shingrix. The Oxford team studied the health records of more than 200,000 US citizens vaccinated for shingles, about half of whom received the new vaccine. Over the next six years, the risk of dementia was 17% lower in those who received Shingrix compared with Zostavax. For those who went on to develop dementia, that amounts to an extra 164 days, or nearly six months, lived without the condition. The effect was stronger in women, at 22%, than in men at 13%. The researchers went on to examine dementia rates in people who received other vaccines. Writing in Nature Medicine, they describe how those given Shingrix had a 23 to 27% lower risk of dementia than people who were vaccinated against flu, tetanus, diphtheria or pertussis. One of the authors of the study, Prof John Todd at Oxford, is a consultant to GSK, the manufacturer of Shingrix, but the researchers said the study was conducted without any involvement from the pharma company, who were informed of the work when it was accepted for publication. Last year, the NHS made Shingrix available to people turning 65. \u201cThe expectation is that if this is indeed a causal effect, then we would see a reduction in dementia in the UK once people start taking up the Shingrix vaccine,\u201d said Taquet. There are more than 55 million people globally living with dementia and more than 900,000 in the UK alone. One in three people will develop the condition in their lifetime, and while drugs that appear to slow the disease have recently been approved, there is no cure. The latest study does not prove that Shingrix delays dementia, but Prof Paul Harrison, a senior author on the paper, said more groups were working on the question. If the vaccine does protect against dementia, it is unclear how. One possibility is that the resurgence of virus in shingles drives pathological changes that lead to dementia. Another is that chemicals called adjuvants in the vaccine, which make the immune response to the vaccine more potent, play a role. Also unclear is whether any protection against dementia would be more effective if the vaccine were given to younger people, such as those in their 50s, or whether it would wear off too soon. \u201cIt will be interesting to see if these data become publicised, that more people choose to take [Shingrix] when they\u2019re offered it,\u201d said Harrison. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t recommend that people should start demanding the vaccine just because they think it\u2019ll reduce the risk of dementia.\u201d Andrew Doig, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Manchester, said: \u201cThis is a significant result, comparable in effectiveness to the recent antibody drugs for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Administering the recombinant shingles vaccine could well be a simple and cheap way to lower the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cNow, we need to run a clinical trial of the [new] vaccine, comparing patients who receive the vaccine with those who get a placebo. This is the most reliable way to find out how well the vaccine works. We also need to see how many years the effect might last and whether we should vaccinate people at a younger age. We know that the path to Alzheimer\u2019s disease can start decades before any symptoms are apparent, so the vaccine might be even more effective if given to people in their 40s or 50s.\u201d"

            "content": "More than 4 million vaccine doses have been flown to Pyongyang, raising hopes that North Korea could open up again to UN agencies and NGOs amid reports of a worsening health situation in the authoritarian state. \u201cThe return of essential vaccines marks a significant milestone towards safeguarding children\u2019s health and survival in this country,\u201d Roland Kupka, Unicef\u2019s acting representative for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, said in a statement. The vaccines include those against hepatitis B, polio, measles and tetanus, and were provided by Unicef, the World Health Organization and the vaccine alliance Gavi. Organisers say they are intended for 600,000 children and pregnant women who have missed out on vaccines since the Covid-19 pandemic. They are to be administered as part of a catch-up campaign in September by North Korea\u2019s public health ministry. It follows numerous calls from the US and human rights groups for North Korea, considered one of the poorest countries in the world, to reopen its borders so vital aid can be delivered. Almost all international aid workers had to leave during the Covid pandemic as the country shut its borders and tightened import controls. This diminished medicine and vaccine supplies as well as food imports, increasing malnutrition and leaving many \u2013 including newborns \u2013 vulnerable to deadly diseases such as tuberculosis and measles. Prior to the pandemic, almost half of the population was undernourished and since then several floods and typhoons have hit the country, further jeopardising public health. Earlier this month, the head of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, Qu Dongyu, visited North Korea in a bid to reactivate the agency\u2019s relationship with the country and address food insecurity. \u201cThe reopening of the border and the return of Unicef\u2019s full team to DPR Korea will be critical to ensuring more essential support can be provided in 2024 and programmes can be scaled up as necessary to meet the needs of children and women,\u201d said Kupka. In 2019, Unicef had about 13 international staff in the country. \u201cI\u2019ve got a feeling they\u2019re going to open again to UN agencies and NGOs,\u201d said Nagi Shafik, who previously consulted for the UN on public health in North Korea, a country he described as \u201cfussy about their security\u201d. Shafik said the North Korean government may have used the hiatus to consider how it would like to work with aid providers. It no longer wants to be regarded as a recipient of aid, Shafik said, but as more of a development partner. \u201cThey hate to be reliant on other people,\u201d he said, adding that they were open to ideas and wanted to be engaged on issues including health. North Korea was voted on to WHO\u2019s executive board last year. \u201cThey are more open than people expect,\u201d Shafik said. In the meantime, Kupka urged the North Korean government to facilitate \u201cthe earliest possible return\u201d of humanitarian agency workers."

            "date": "2024-07-12T12:51:10Z",
            "content": "A Covid-style effort is needed to ensure NHS patients are first in line for a new wave of dementia drugs, according to the former head of the UK\u2019s vaccine taskforce. Kate Bingham is calling for the immediate recruitment of large numbers of patients to ensure that, as with Covid vaccines, the UK is a leading player in testing and launching drugs. While two drugs have now been shown to slow cognitive decline in early Alzheimer\u2019s, it remains unclear whether either is effective enough to be made widely available on the NHS, meaning a race is on to achieve this goal. \u201cWe need to have tens of thousands of patients consented and available to go into clinical trials,\u201d said Bingham. \u201cIf you have 50,000 patients at high risk of Alzheimer\u2019s pre-consented we could make that an easy shortcut for companies, which is exactly what we did with vaccines. The government has to embrace working with industry rather than thinking they\u2019re out to nick your wallet.\u201d Experts have expressed frustration that, almost two years after a breakthrough trial, the first Alzheimer\u2019s drugs shown to slow the rate of cognitive decline are yet to be approved in the UK. Bingham, who is a managing partner at SV Health Investors and spearheaded the launch of the Dementia Discovery Fund, said trials of drugs and diagnosis tools needed to be a priority for the new Labour government, given the devastating health consequences and cost of care. \u201cWe\u2019re in an ageing society, where medicine is keeping people alive in good health for longer,\u201d she said. \u201cCancer is no longer a death sentence. You can manage cancer and have good quality of life for years. For dementia we\u2019re not doing that. You\u2019re basically having to pay for 10 years plus of patient [care]. The cost to the families or state is very expensive. I think it\u2019s an economic imperative to invest in this whole area.\u201d The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is considering applications for Eisai and Biogen\u2019s drug lecanemab and Eli Lilly\u2019s donanemab, both of which have been approved for the treatment of early Alzheimer\u2019s in the US. The drugs work by reducing amyloid levels in the brain. Sir Prof John Hardy, of University College London (UCL), who was the first to identify the role of misfolded amyloid in Alzheimer\u2019s 30 years ago, said: \u201cWe now have finally got something that started here in the UK, it would be nice to see it actually helping patients. There is frustration, yes.\u201d Hardy, who is vice-president of Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said patients were already travelling abroad to access the drugs, which are administered by infusion and require patients to be monitored via MRI scans. \u201cI\u2019ve just had two patients phone me up who are flying to New York privately to get the treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good outcome.\u201d However, others warned against the MHRA and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which rules on cost-effectiveness, coming under undue political pressure to rush through the approval of novel drugs, which can have complex risk-benefit profiles. The cognition of Alzheimer\u2019s patients given lecanemab declined by 27% less than those on a placebo treatment after 18 months, an improvement that some argue falls short of being clinically meaningful for an individual patient. This has to be weighed against side-effects that include accelerated brain shrinkage, with those taking the drug losing the equivalent of an extra teaspoon of brain matter over 18 months. Rob Howard, a professor of old age psychiatry at UCL, said: \u201cMy own view is that these drugs can\u2019t possibly be cost-effective for the NHS \u2013 the benefits of treatment are so tiny and the costs of giving them and ensuring patient safety will be high. We\u2019ve been told that there will be no new money for the NHS to pay for these drugs and so we\u2019ll have to cut other services to people with dementia if we are to supply them.\u201d He added: \u201cNobody has explained the worrying accelerated brain volume loss seen with these drugs. Generally brain volume loss is regarded as a bad thing in people with dementia and I am concerned about the potential medium to long-term impact of this.\u201d The case for the drugs could become clearer if patients are found to have maintained a better trajectory beyond the first 18 months in trial results expected to be unveiled at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association conference later this month."

            "date": "2024-07-27T12:00:24Z",
            "content": "Covid is surging across the US, with levels of the virus on track to exceed last summer\u2019s wave nationally and approaching the peak of last winter\u2019s wave in the west, according to wastewater data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Yet vaccination and antiviral uptake, plagued by inequitable access, have remained low, and other precautions like mask-wearing are being met with increasing resistance. \u201cA lot of people right now are getting Covid all over the country,\u201d said Dr Peter Chin-Hong, professor of medicine and infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cThere are still hospitalizations, and there\u2019s still a few hundred deaths every week in the US \u2013 and that\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d The rise is being driven by a trio of variants, called Flirt because of shared mutations, that seem to be more immune-evasive and transmissible. And much of the US has been locked in heatwaves, with many Americans staying indoors to avoid the heat \u2013 which can lead to more spread of the virus. Nationally, emergency room visits for Covid increased by 15.7% in the past week. Rising hospitalization rates are now higher than last summer at this time, although it can be difficult to make comparisons now that significantly fewer hospitals are required to report rates of Covid than in previous years. Deaths are also increasing after reaching the lowest point of the pandemic. Nearly 400 people died in the week ending 12 June, the last week for which full data was available. Covid remains the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States. \u201cAny hospitalization or death could be completely prevented based on the tools that we have,\u201d Chin-Hong said. Yet compared to other surges, \u201cit just feels like a very different time right now\u201d, said David Grabowski, professor of healthcare policy at Harvard Medical School. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare to go into a building and see people masked\u201d \u2013 even in hospitals and nursing homes. The summer surge comes as some federal and state policies have pulled away from efforts that can stop the spread of the virus, experts say. North Carolina recently signed into law restrictions on wearing face masks in public, and officials in New York City and Los Angeles have considered the same. In May, the CDC loosened its guidelines for Covid isolation, recommending patients stay home until they are fever-free for 24 hours and symptoms are resolving \u2013 even if they\u2019re still positive for the virus, during which time they are likely contagious. While the US government once covered the costs of Covid vaccination, those costs shifted to the private market in 2023. A bridge program offering vaccines to uninsured people is ending next month, weeks before the updated booster will be available \u2013 which will likely exacerbate gaps in access to the lifesaving vaccines. Only 22.5% of adults and 14.4% of children are up to date on Covid vaccines \u2013 and the rate is even lower (13.3%) among pregnant people, despite the risks of severe illness, complications and long Covid because of Covid infection during pregnancy. There are also stark contrasts among Americans of color, where inequities in health access continue to affect vaccination rates. While a quarter of white adults are vaccinated, only 15.6% of Indigenous people and 16.2% of Hispanic adults have gotten the latest booster. The disparities are \u201cquite striking\u201d, Chin-Hong said \u2013 and they\u2019re especially worrisome among older people of color, who have been more at risk throughout the pandemic. \u201cThere isn\u2019t as much attention to making sure that all older populations get vaccinated or understand the power of vaccinations to keep people safe.\u201d Vaccination rates are higher among older adults, who have the highest rates of hospitalization rates and death \u2013 but \u201cthose numbers are way too low\u201d, said Grabowski. Less than a third of nursing home residents are up to date on their Covid vaccines. \u201cThose numbers really worry me. It\u2019s not clear that those residents are going to have the protection that they did earlier in the pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cWith nursing homes, I think there\u2019s a lot of fatigue around this issue, and I say that both among the staff and the residents,\u201d said Grabowski, who wrote recently about the changes needed to make nursing homes safer after the pandemic. \u201cI don\u2019t think the vigilance we saw early in the pandemic is there today.\u201d Antivirals like Paxlovid have had a similarly unequal rollout. People of color are significantly less likely to be prescribed Paxlovid compared with white patients \u2013 about 20% to 36% less, according to one study, and 30% to 36%, according to another. Only 15% of patients at high risk of severe illness take Paxlovid, one pre-print study suggests, despite evidence that it helps reduce the worst outcomes, including death, among vulnerable people. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like we\u2019re actually directing resources to the most vulnerable among us, and that\u2019s been really disheartening,\u201d Grabowski said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real red flag.\u201d The CDC recently explained that Covid can surge at any time of the year, including summer, unlike viruses such as the flu and RSV that tend to peak in winter. The agency recommended that everyone above the age of six months receive updated boosters in the fall, and everyone over the age of 65 receive an additional booster at least four months later. Chin-Hong hopes vaccination rates will rise once again this fall when the new boosters are available \u2013 and he hopes public attitudes shift to view Covid vaccines as routine as flu shots. \u201cHopefully, in 2025 we\u2019ll have a combo flu and Covid vaccine,\u201d he said. \u201cThat might make it more palatable for people.\u201d As the virus continues circulating, measures beyond vaccines and treatments will also help control the spread \u2013 particularly in high-risk environments like nursing homes, Grabowski said. \u201cWe need to take other steps, whether it\u2019s testing, personal protective equipment, better air quality,\u201d he said. Yet, change has been slow, and some gains made during the pandemic have now seemed to reverse, Grabowski said. \u201cTo the extent that we had some planning in place earlier in the pandemic, I think today that\u2019s all absent.\u201d"

            "content": "An Asian elephant at Houston zoo in the US has received the first mRNA vaccine against herpes, which is the leading killer of Asian elephants calves in captivity. Tess, a 40-year-old Asian elephant, was injected with the trial vaccine at the Texas zoo in June, after a spate of deaths in juveniles in zoos around the world from the elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV). Dr Paul Ling, who researches herpes in humans at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, developed the elephant mRNA vaccine, which is designed to boost the immunity of young elephants. \u201cWhen elephants are born, they have a tremendous amount of antibodies that they get from their mother,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the female elephant gives birth, she\u2019s probably already had this virus so she gives protective antibodies to her baby, and they last for a certain period of time. Our vaccine is designed to give these young elephants enough immunity that they\u2019ve lost over time.\u201d The mRNA vaccine is similar in design to the Covid-19 vaccines used in humans during the recent pandemic, and aims to prevent serious illness and death from EEHV in young Asian elephants. The virus can cause a lethal hemorrhagic disease in Asian elephants, similar to the effects Ebola has on humans. Researchers believe it is passed among Asian elephants through their trunks. First discovered in 1990 and scientifically described in 1999, the virus is a major driver of Asian elephant deaths in captivity. This month, two juveniles died from the virus at Dublin zoo. Zoos in Chester, Melbourne and Zurich are among those that have lost several baby Asian elephants to the disease. In symptomatic elephants, it has a mortality rate of about 70%. While the virus has been recorded in wild populations and fatalities have been recorded, experts are unsure how much impact it is having on wild Asian elephants or whether a vaccination programme would be practical. There are fewer than 50,000 of the species in the wild and they are threatened with extinction. Habitat loss, poaching and genetic isolation are all considered bigger threats to their survival. A Chester zoo spokesperson said they thought the elephant herpes virus was a threat to the long-term survival of the Asian elephant, adding that reports of fatalities in India, Nepal, Myanmar and Thailand were on the rise. \u201cThe only long-term solution to beating EEHV is to find a safe and effective vaccine, which is most likely to be achieved through zoo-led research,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWhile the global conservation community has made significant steps towards finding a viable vaccine, further work and time is needed before we have the answer we\u2019re all so desperately searching for \u2013 scientific confirmation that the vaccine is effective in preventing EEHV.\u201d Researchers are monitoring the health of Tess, and Houston zoo plans to inoculate more Asian elephants later this year if no side effects are recorded. The mRNA was developed in a partnership between Houston zoo, Baylor College of Medicine and the Dallas-based \u201cde-extinction\u201d company Colossal.

            "content": "Police searching for a motive for the mass stabbings in Southport that left three children dead are increasingly focusing on the state of their suspect\u2019s mental health or potential neurodivergence in the years before the attack, the Guardian understands. A British-born 17-year-old was arrested after a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in the Merseyside seaside town was plunged into horror, with 11 children and two adults stabbed. Five children remain in a critical condition, as do the two adults believed by police to have been wounded as they tried to shield the primary school-age children from the rampage just before midday on Monday. The 17-year-old, arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder, is still in custody as police carry out forensic searches at a house in the village of Banks that he travelled from, and on the taxi in which he travelled to the scene. The criminal investigation by Merseyside police has multiple strands, the motive for attacking such a soft target being a key one. Detectives are looking for and studying any material held by statutory agencies such as educational institutions, health or social services, about the suspect and any concerns raised, for instance about his behaviour, when younger. In the Commons, Yvette Cooper called for police to be given time to carry out the criminal investigation. \u201cThere will be wider questions for other days,\u201d the home secretary said. Police say terrorism is not a motive, but caveat this by saying that is their view \u201cat this stage\u201d. Searches of electronic devices such as phones and laptops linked to the teenage suspect continue, and investigators will gain greater confidence that no terrorist or ideological motive played a part, once those searches are completed. It is understood that nothing supporting any kind of terrorist motive has been found so far. Police are looking for any explanation as to why the suspect targeted the dance class for young girls during the school summer holiday. Merseyside police have said there is no evidence of terrorism and \u201cwe are not looking for anyone else in connection with it [the attacks]\u201d, leaving the community still searching for answers for what could have motivated the teenager to carry out such a callous and ferocious attack. Footage captured from a house in Banks shows a man pacing repeatedly back and forth outside a property that was later cordoned off by police. The man is wearing a green hoodie and a Covid-style face mask. In the village of Banks, in the wake of Monday\u2019s incident, nobody said they really knew the teenager, or recalled ever seeing him there. They did know the older couple, believed to be his parents, who live at the house. Some who knew of the family said they largely kept to themselves, but the local community had previously rallied round with a fundraiser to support them in a charitable appeal. They had moved to Merseyside from south Wales in about 2013, and lived in a house in the centre of the seaside resort, before moving out to Banks, a village in Lancashire about five miles from Southport. Former neighbours in the Cardiff suburb of Thornhill, where the family also lived briefly, said the boy and his brother were \u201cnice enough\u201d and always \u201cbouncing off the walls\u201d. \u201cWe talked over the fence round the back, the kids went to school,\u201d one said. \u201cThey were nice children \u2013 they were boys at the age where they were bouncing off the walls. Always running around screaming and playing football in the garden, that kind of thing. \u201cThey were boisterous boys. I got on really well with them.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 2 August 2024 to remove some comments recalling the suspect as a small child, which we have since been told were based on a misunderstanding; they referred to a different child."

            "date": "2024-07-19T15:00:13Z",
            "content": "A year ago to the day, Judy Deacon got a call to head to the police station. The 80-year-old expected the issue to be that her son, Jesse, had been hospitalised again. But on her way there, she got a phone call from Jesse\u2019s father. He was crying, and as soon as she heard the tears, she knew her son had died, she said. Jesse, 43, was shot and killed by New South Wales police after they were called to his home in a public housing estate in Sydney following a report he was self-harming. Deacon said the year since then had been \u201cnon-stop\u201d as she channelled her grief at Jesse\u2019s death towards action. On Saturday, she will hold a rally in Sydney\u2019s CBD marking a year since Jesse was killed to air her demand that police should no longer be sent as first responders in mental health emergencies and instead it should be a health-led response. \u201cI think about him every day and, when I do, my eyes are wet because I\u2019m not a crying person, but my daughter, his sister, is traumatised beyond belief,\u201d Deacon said. \u201cI refuse to accept the situation until something is done, and that\u2019s when I\u2019ll be able to break down and grieve.\u201d Deacon\u2019s demand for a health-led response is the same that has been recommended in numerous government inquiries and non-government reports, and is starting to come closer to reality in NSW. Last month, the NSW minister for mental health, Rose Jackson, told a forum held at parliament house on the issue that she expected the government to have an understanding of the \u201cpath forward\u201d for a health-led response to mental health incidents by the end of the year. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup It came after a NSW parliamentary inquiry into mental health care across the state, which Deacon contributed to, recommended the government \u201cexplore\u201d sending police as second responders to mental health incidents. It also recommended that the police force improve mandatory mental health training for officers after a string of fatalities involving vulnerable people. There have been a number of recent deaths, including that of 41-year-old Steve Pampalian, who was shot by police the month before Jesse. He was experiencing a psychosis when he ran at police with two knives, and was then shot four times. Two months after Jesse died, 47-year-old Krista Kach was suffering a mental health episode when police fatally hit her with bean bag rounds during a siege in Newcastle last September. Jesse, who had struggled with his mental health most of his life, was holding a knife when officers arrived at his home after reports he was self-harming. One officer tried to use a Taser but it failed, so another officer fired his gun. Deacon\u2019s year since Jesse died has been filled with meeting ministers and officials to advocate for change. One of her next targets is a meeting with the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to push for a nationwide dedicated mental health response team that triple-zero calls can be triaged to. \u201cI want him to really understand that this issue is not going away,\u201d she said. Joining Deacon at the rally on Saturday will be Leesa Topic, the mother of 22-year-old Courtney Topic, who in 2015 was fatally shot by police while suffering a \u201csevere episode of psychosis\u201d. When the coroner released its findings into Courtney\u2019s death in 2018, it said the case had exposed a \u201ccompelling need for change\u201d in the way police responded to people in mental distress, finding police tactics were \u201centirely inappropriate\u201d. Since then, about 52 people experiencing mental health distress had died after interactions with the state\u2019s police during the past five years. Sam Lee, a senior solicitor at the Redfern Legal Centre, said treating incidents of psychological distress as a law and order issue rather than a health one was a major issue. But Lee said it was promising to see the police union come out publicly, shortly after Kach died, agreeing that police should no longer be sent as first responders. Lee said once the government delivered the framework for a health-led response, which was expected by the end of this year, the next big questions were: \u201cWhere\u2019s the budget to implement it? Who\u2019s going to implement it? And what are the timeframes around that?\u201d Jackson told the forum on responses to mental health last month that even with a new response, comprehensive mental health training for police was crucial. \u201cEven if we get this system right, they\u2019re still going to be out in our community interacting with people who may have mental illness, and we expect that they have been adequately trained for that interaction,\u201d she said. Deacon believes had there been a different response to her son\u2019s mental health episode, he would still be alive. She said she hoped to effect change so that no other parent ever has to go through what she has. \u201cNobody deserves to be treated without respect because they have a mental health issue,\u201d she said. \u2022 In Australia, support is available at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636, Lifeline on 13 11 14, and at MensLine on 1300 789 978.

            "date": "2024-07-01T04:00:41Z",
            "content": "Jean Kaseya would hear regularly from his younger brother, an army officer in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, until the day in 2018 when all contact stopped. \u201cSuddenly, we didn\u2019t have any information,\u201d remembers Dr Kaseya, director general of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). It was two years before an acquaintance approached the family to say his brother, Dieudonn\u00e9, was alive, but in jail in the north of the country. Kaseya was able to have him brought back to the capital, Kinshasa. \u201cI went to see him. Honestly, this person deserved to be at a hospital, not to be jailed. \u201cWe managed to bring him to the hospital,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it was late.\u201d Untreated mental health problems had snowballed and Dieudonn\u00e9 had also developed physical issues, including diabetes and kidney disease. \u201cAnd after two months he passed on,\u201d says Kaseya. Dieudonn\u00e9 was 45 years old and had three children. His death had a profound impact on his brother. Mental health care for Africans became a priority for Kaseya, who was appointed to his current role in February 2023. \u201cThis motivation is not anger. It\u2019s mostly I don\u2019t want others to go through the same experience \u2013 how we can stop it, and how we can start to screen people before they get [to the same level as] my brother.\u201d Africa CDC is pushing to integrate mental health care into community health programmes across the continent. In May, it launched a Mental Health Leadership Programme, which will train health professionals at various levels in how to prioritise mental health. Psychiatric drugs are included in the organisation\u2019s list of basic medicines for primary healthcare programmes. Kaseya remembers how expensive it was to deal with his brother\u2019s problems. \u201cWe were paying around $500 per week to take care of him \u2013 for medication, for any kind of support \u2013 because he was admitted to a specialist centre. \u201cAnd I was asking myself what are others doing? If you don\u2019t have money, what can you do?\u201d The World Health Organization estimates there are at least 116 million people in African countries with mental health conditions. But there are very few services, and only 1.4 mental health workers for every 100,000 people. Many people with poor mental health find themselves dismissed from their job \u201cand in countries where you don\u2019t have social insurance, you don\u2019t have insurance, you are left behind. I think this is what\u2019s happening in many countries and this is what happened to my brother,\u201d says Kaseya. The circumstances that led to Dieudonn\u00e9\u2019s imprisonment and downwards spiral remain murky. \u201cI was the firstborn of my father and my mother, and he was the second,\u201d says Kaseya. \u201cWhen we were young, we were like twins. He was the most intelligent one at school level. He was beating me every time.\u201d Dieudonn\u00e9 wanted to be a soldier, in contrast to his older brother\u2019s plans for medical school. \u201cHe said, \u2018you want to save lives when people are sick. Me, I want to save [the] lives of people threatened by war and things like that.\u2019\u201d Dieudonn\u00e9 joined the army after graduating, and progressed through the ranks, sending the family messages about what he was doing \u2013 until that day in 2018. By the time Kaseya found him, he was displaying symptoms of depression and anxiety, and would sometimes run away during conversations, saying \u201cthey are killing people outside\u201d. \u201cI think it was mostly driven by the consequence of what he was experiencing [during] war. And as you know, sometimes soldiers start to use some substances like drugs. It\u2019s a combination of so many factors, you know \u2013 war, drugs and living conditions.\u201d Much of the $500 a week the family spent on Dieudonn\u00e9\u2019s care was for medication. Kaseya said more regional manufacturing of \u201caffordable and quality medicines\u201d \u2013 another key component of the Africa CDC\u2019s work \u2013 could bring prices down. Kaseya has since visited military prisons across the DRC and estimates that at least half of those in detention \u201cdon\u2019t deserve to be there\u201d \u2013 having been incarcerated for drug use, or because of violent behaviour driven by poor mental health. There is a big issue in many African countries, he says, of jailing people inappropriately, citing some national laws that criminalise homosexuality. Those attitudes \u2013 and misogynist ideas that daughters are less valuable than sons \u2013 must also be tackled to improve mental health, he says. \u201cMental health is not just about DNA, it\u2019s about the environment. Anyone can be affected if you are in the environment that is pushing you,\u201d he says. \u2022 In the UK, the charity Mind is available on 0300 123 3393 and Childline on 0800 1111.

            "date": "2024-07-13T13:00:03Z",
            "content": "Football is a game of opinions despite, or perhaps because of, there being so much that is unknown. Why does a manager pick a player or take them off? Why does a team spring forward in one half but retreat in another? Why does someone who misplaced a simple pass just moments before find the top corner in the next? During England\u2019s run to the final the debate over Gareth Southgate and his performance as manager has not stopped for a second. Most opinions, understandably, have been formed by what the eye can see. But what distant observers can never truly know or understand is what Southgate has done best, and that is managing the psychological side of the game. The significance of strong mental preparedness as opposed to that of tactics or physical ability can be debated, but we can certainly look from the outside and see the effects during these Euros. Ollie Watkins\u2019s ability to produce an elite finish after playing 30 minutes of football the entire tournament. Conor Gallagher leading the press with distinction to seal a victory over Slovakia having been substituted at half-time in his previous match. Each and every one of the penalties taken in D\u00fcsseldorf against Switzerland. The list goes on and every item has been key to England\u2019s progress. Professor Dave Collins is a fellow in human performance science at the University of Edinburgh, and director of the consultancy Grey Matters, where he has worked with 80 world and Olympic champions and is advising a number of Premier League footballers on their mental conditioning. He makes the point that, from the outside, no one can speak with authority on precisely what Southgate has done to build preparedness and resilience within his team but that, in general, three ideas are key. \u201cFirstly you need to have a shared mental model,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need the squad to be prepared because you never know what\u2019s going to happen. So, you need to be in a position where \u2018we\u2019re all in this together\u2019, that you are able to handle whatever gets thrown at you from inside the tournament or, frankly, from the media outside. You want to get a mental model so everybody knows: this is what we\u2019re going try and do.\u201d Second, everybody needs to know their role and to accept it. \u201cThere\u2019s a holy trinity when you\u2019re talking about roles and that is: clarity, acceptance and support,\u201d Collins says. \u201cLet\u2019s say Ollie Watkins. Ollie must know what his role is, and be completely happy to accept and fulfil that role. Meanwhile everybody else knows that about Ollie and are going to support Ollie in that role. \u201cThe third thing is that you\u2019ve spent enough time getting people to buy into the plans. That they\u2019re not just shared, they\u2019re accepted. That means the squad is thinking: \u2018No one\u2019s prepared as well as us, we\u2019ve got all these special ideas, we\u2019ve done this visual training, we\u2019ve done this, we\u2019ve done that, we\u2019ve done the other; we\u2019re the best, we\u2019re there.\u2019 What that does is it gives you a sort of protection. If you\u2019re not flying well early, if the media are slagging you off, if people are being rude you can say: \u2018We\u2019re here, we\u2019re all right, we\u2019re confident.\u2019\u201d Although the Football Association will not comment on England\u2019s psychological preparedness, it seems plausible that it has effectively implemented Collins\u2019 three rules. It perhaps even speaks directly to the third that England have travelled to Germany without a psychologist on the staff. The formerly influential Pippa Grange is not part of the setup but the principles she helped establish have now been long embedded, starting at the World Cup in 2018. We know something of the support networks that exist within the squad, from the establishment of a cross-age leadership group (members: Harry Kane, Kyle Walker, Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham) to the decision to break down hierarchies as much as possible within the staff, with everyone dining in mixed groups and encouraged to look out for each other in whichever role they fulfil. There are other aspects to England\u2019s preparedness that may speak more to the preferences of the manager. A stress on the use of outside space, for example, not just so as to be removed from the hurly-burly of a tournament but for the proven benefits to wellbeing from being in nature. Equally, the importance of having time with family and friends is consistently stressed, on designated days when loved ones are invited into camp to socialise, and after each match. The final consideration, then, is the leader themselves; the central conduit of any messaging and, ultimately, the embodiment of the values of a team. From the stream of supportive remarks made by the players during the toughest games (and the absence of anonymous briefing), Southgate clearly commands their respect, so they are more likely to follow his ideas and values. Key to this is Southgate\u2019s authenticity, that he is the man he says he is and proves it by his actions. \u201cGood leaders are not chameleons, they are consistently themselves,\u201d says Collins. \u201cThere is a genuineness to them, but they also recognise that there\u2019s different strokes for different folks and different approaches required for different contexts. Can you imagine Gareth giving the players a dressing down? Can you imagine him also saying: \u2018It\u2019s OK, you\u2019re doing fine\u2019? You can. He\u2019s a good leader because he\u2019s got flexibility, accountability and appropriateness.\u201d In Berlin, Southgate faces the toughest challenge of his life. And while no one can know for sure, experience suggests we can be confident that he and his team will be ready."

            "content": "The government\u2019s plans to introduce the world\u2019s first full smoking ban, halt sales of energy drinks to children and modernise mental health laws are \u201cgamechanging\u201d and will save thousands of lives, health leaders have said. Labour will also impose restrictions on the sale and marketing of vapes to children and launch a crackdown on junk food advertising in a drive to improve the health of future generations. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the whole healthcare system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said: \u201cThe king\u2019s speech has some gamechanging commitments that will improve the nation\u2019s health \u2013 with reforms to the Mental Health Act and legislation to create a smoke-free generation at the top of the list. \u201cOur members will also support the focus on children and young people, with measures to tackle the impact of junk food and high-caffeine energy drinks a welcome starting point.\u201d The tobacco and vapes bill will progressively increase the age at which people can buy tobacco so that future generations will never legally be able to do so. It prevents anyone born after 1 January 2009 from legally smoking, making the UK the first country in the world to ban smoking. Rishi Sunak had vowed to pass the bill when he was prime minister but ditched it from the \u201cwash-up\u201d process, when outgoing governments choose which policies to fast-track and which to drop, after lobbying by the world\u2019s largest tobacco firms, first exposed by the Guardian. The bill also paves the way for changes to the sale and branding of vapes to reduce their appeal to children. Flavours such as bubble gum and candy floss may also face curbs as research shows young people prefer them to flavours such as menthol. Also included are restrictions on packaging and display of products such as nicotine pouches that can draw children into smoking. Trading Standards officials will get more powers to fine retailers who sell vapes and tobacco to under-18s. England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, who has pleaded with MPs to ignore lobbying by tobacco firms and pass the bill, said the move to create a smoke-free country would be \u201ca major step forward in public health\u201d. Cancer Research UK\u2019s executive director of policy, Dr Ian Walker, predicted that the ban would \u201chave a hugely positive impact on the nation\u2019s health\u201d. The president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, Greg Fell, said: \u201cPhasing out smoking will save thousands of lives, help protect the next generation from ever becoming addicted to this lethal product, and do more to narrow the unacceptably large gap in healthy life expectancy between the richest and poorest regions than any other single measure.\u201d The president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, Prof Steve Turner, described the move as \u201ca major milestone\u201d towards the UK having \u201cthe healthiest generation of children in our history\u201d. People detained under the Mental Health Act will be given greater choice and rights under new legislation unveiled as part of the king\u2019s speech. The mental health bill aims to put more power in the hands of patients and put them at the centre of decisions about their care. It amends the 1983 act, which Labour described as \u201cwoefully out of date\u201d, to bring it \u201cinto the 21st century\u201d. The chief executive of the mental health charity Mind, Dr Sarah Hughes, hailed the changes as a \u201conce-in-a-generation opportunity\u201d. However, the chief executive of the charity Sane, Marjorie Wallace, cautioned that the revamp would have to be matched with an increase in funding for staff, inpatient beds and community services. \u201cWhile mental health services are so impoverished and there is limited access to treatments and therapies, the vision for improved rights and individual choice cannot be realised,\u201d Wallace said."

            "content": "Pressure on Beijing to take steps to improve Chinese consumer confidence has intensified after news that weak retail spending dragged down the growth rate of the world\u2019s second biggest economy. With falling house prices still acting as a drag on activity, official figures showed the Chinese economy expanding at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter \u2013 much weaker than the 5.1% expected by the financial markets. Annual retail sales growth slowed from 3.2% to 2% in the three months ending in June \u2013 the weakest in 18 months \u2013 and fell slightly in June alone. Lynn Song, the chief China economist at ING bank, said retail sales growth was the lowest since the country emerged from Covid-19 lockdowns and showed the depressed state of consumer confidence remained a big headwind to the economic recovery. \u201cA negative wealth effect from falling property and stock prices, as well as low wage growth amid various industries\u2019 cost cutting is dragging consumption and causing a pivot from big-ticket purchases toward a basic \u2018eat, drink and play\u2019 theme,\u201d Song said. The government in Beijing has set a growth target for 2024 of 5% \u2013 something analysts consider to be a stretch in the absence of tax cuts, spending increases and measures to help the property market. On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded by 0.7% in the three months to June, compared with a downwardly revised 1.5% in the first quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said. To counter soft domestic demand and its property crisis, China has increased infrastructure investment and ploughed funds into hi-tech manufacturing. Strong export growth has partly compensated for the reluctance of consumers to spend. Figures released last week showed China\u2019s exports in June were up 8.6% from a year earlier, while imports shrank by 2.3%. Duncan Wrigley, the chief China+ economist at Pantheon Macro, said: \u201cThe property market is showing tentative signs of bottoming out. New home prices sank 0.67% month on month in June, a trivial improvement from the 0.71% drop in May. Preowned home prices dropped 0.85%, after the 1.00% dive in May. Residential sales value fell 12.2% year on year in June, partly thanks to base effects, after crashing 26.4% in May.\u201d"

Gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of economic health \u2013 rose 2.8% in three months to June, the commerce department reported on Thursday, ahead of economists\u2019 expectations and up sharply from 1.4% in the first quarter. It comes as the presidential election campaign heightens scrutiny of the US economy. While Joe Biden touted the \u201cstrongest economy in the world\u201d as he announced his withdrawal from the race on Sunday, Donald Trump \u2013 who is running to replace him in the White House \u2013 has accused Biden of weakening the economy.

Despite relatively rosy economic figures, nearly three in five Americans wrongly believe the US is in recession, and the majority blame the Biden administration, according to a Harris poll conducted for the Guardian in May. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve scrambled to bring down inflation from its highest level in a generation, raising interest rates to a two-decade high. They are now considering when to start cutting rates, amid early signs that price growth is falling back towards the Fed\u2019s 2% target. \u201cThis is a perfect report for the Fed,\u201d Olu Sonola, head of economic research at Fitch Ratings, said of Thursday\u2019s GDP numbers. \u201cGrowth during the first half of the year is not too hot, inflation continues to cool and the elusive soft landing scenario looks within reach.\u201d Economists had expected GDP growth of about 2% in the second quarter.

            "date": "2024-07-22T14:47:35Z",
            "content": "When Laura Kudrna bought her home on the Ladywood estate in Birmingham, it brought to an end a 12-year period of renting in which she\u2019d moved 20 times. \u201cI was so excited to be able to stay in a home that I thought I would have for life,\u201d she said. But her new sense of security was shattered when she found out that her property was one of 1,900 dwellings listed for potential demolition in what is thought to be one of Europe\u2019s biggest single-site estate regenerations. The scale of the proposed project is staggering: 6,000 people could have their homes torn down as part of a \u00a32.2bn project in which 1,266 council houses and 567 properties belonging to private homeowners could be repossessed in a mass compulsory purchase order for the area. In their place, 7,500 homes will be built in a high-density housing plan on a 61-hectare (150-acre) site. About 1,000 of these will be designated as affordable council-owned homes, according to a report presented to cabinet. If the numbers involved seem imposing, the strength of feeling in opposition to the plan is more than a match. Residents said they were furious and accused the council of \u201cpsychological economic violence\u201d. The battle lines have been drawn over familiar terrain. Birmingham Council described the initiative as the most significant redevelopment project in a generation, in a city where there is an urgent need to build more housing. The number of people who presented to the council as homeless rose to 600 a week last year. On the other side of the debate, Kudrna, 39, is a member of the Ladywood Unite campaign which is voicing people\u2019s concerns about the project. They say they understand the need to increase the housing stock, but not through the demolition of good homes. She said: \u201cThey appear to be planning to knock down good-quality and new housing for this. It is just so egregious. We are absolutely pro-home building. There\u2019s a lot of great land to build on in Ladywood, like this building is derelict, and this building is derelict,\u201d she said, pointing to vacant land near her home. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they just build on those instead of coming after our homes?\u201d The project will be done in phases over a 15- to 20-year period, and compulsory purchase orders would be used as a last resort, the council said. Homeowners would be entitled to a compensation package and the council was exploring options to help people living on the site buy the new homes, for example through shared equity. The council said it intended to take a \u201cbuild-first approach\u201d, meaning people would not be moved out of their homes until a new property became available on site, and would ensure no one had to leave Ladywood if they did not want to. Some people said they were sceptical this would happen. George Smith, who is retiring from his job as the head of an academy trust when he turns 60 this summer, had planned to spend his free time enjoying life at the home he bought when it was built 30 years ago. It sits on a modern, well-maintained estate, but it falls within the red line of the proposed demolition zone, and is at risk of being flattened. \u201cI own the freehold. I\u2019ve put everything in here, this was a lifelong home. I had no thoughts I would ever need to move and, if I did, it would be on my own terms,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the real injustice of it all, and at the same time the council are being totally incompetent at meeting with us.\u201d The regeneration scheme has been beset by problems for months. At a consultation meeting held by the council last year, nearly 100 residents were unable to get into a community centre packed to capacity, prompting an angry crowd to form outside. \u201cThere has been a horrible lack of community engagement,\u201d said Kudrna. \u201cWe\u2019ve really struggled to get the council to meet us, or give us any information. It\u2019s psychological economic violence, truly.\u201d Marco di Nunzio, an associate professor in urban anthropology at the University of Birmingham, is studying the Ladywood regeneration scheme. \u201cBirmingham is seeing a return to what used to happen in the 60s, taking down entire areas and rebuilding them,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin the UK, there are town-planning laws which allow, if there is a public interest, the local authority to seize assets. \u201cBut is the Ladywood regeneration project in its present form actually in the public interest, if it involves displacing a large number of people to make room for a commercial endeavour, with no firm and binding commitment to deliver social and affordable housing?\u201d Ladywood has a large black and minority ethnic population \u2013 58%, compared with 51% in Birmingham as a whole \u2013 and high levels of poverty and deprivation. It has the highest child poverty level of any constituency in the UK. Di Nunzio said there were real fears people could be priced out of the area and there was a significant psychological impact of the upheaval. \u201cThe opacity of the process, that open-endedness when you\u2019re losing your home is excruciating. There is a huge issue of anxiety, some parts of the community are quite vulnerable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe level of injustice that you might experience, it really affects people\u2019s sense of self.\u201d The Labour government has set out plans to build 1.5m homes in its first term, and cross-party concerns have been raised about the risk of overriding community issues in the process. Ladywood residents said they feared the big push for more homes could put freehold properties at risk of demolition as part of similar schemes to increase housing density. Jayne Francis, the council\u2019s cabinet member for housing and homelessness, said: \u201cWe know that much of the community in Ladywood feels frustrated and uncertain about what the scheme means for them, and we\u2019d like to apologise for any distress caused.\u201d She added that the only decision that had been made was to appoint St Joseph, a subsidiary of the housing company Berkeley Group, as the council\u2019s preferred development partner. \u201cNo other decisions have been made on the regeneration scheme or what homes will or will not be demolished. The regeneration of Ladywood is right at the beginning of the process, with many decisions yet to be made with the community.\u201d Francis said the council was developing a \u201ccommunity and resident charter\u201d to set out its commitment throughout the project, and a second round of engagement workshops had begun. \u201cWe will work hard to rebuild trust with the Ladywood community and to make the most of this exciting opportunity to revitalise an area that was primarily built in the 1960s,\u201d Francis said."

            "date": "2024-07-13T12:00:19Z",
            "content": "For a chancellor targeting a decade in power, Rachel Reeves is in a hurry. After 14 years in the wilderness for Labour, and several centuries of Britain awaiting its first female chancellor, it\u2019s not surprising she is keen to get on with the job. So far, two ideas have predominated: blaming the Conservatives for the worst economic inheritance since the second world war, and laying the foundations for national renewal at breakneck speed. Reeves says there isn\u2019t any time to waste to get Britain on track for the highest sustained levels of growth in the G7. But it is a task that will involve tough trade-offs and challenges, and will come to define Keir Starmer\u2019s government. In the scramble to look busy, ministers have been hurriedly working behind the scenes to reshape the institutions of Whitehall and get the government machine aimed at Reeves\u2019s primary objective. One quick win was the creation of a new council of economic advisers, housed within the Treasury and led by top London School of Economics academics John Van Reenen and Anna Valero. More changes are due in Wednesday\u2019s king\u2019s speech, including the government\u2019s legislative plans for workers\u2019 rights, planning reform, the NHS and Great British Energy, Ed Miliband\u2019s prized low-carbon power company. Sources say we can expect a big announcement on infrastructure, too. The government is keen to show it is committed to getting mega-projects built after the stop-start failures of the Tory years. There is a rush to finalise plans, including the potential abolition of the National Infrastructure Commission, which would be replaced with a new body. Elsewhere, Starmer is setting up \u201cdelivery boards\u201d packed with external experts for his five key \u201cmissions\u201d for government: growth, energy, crime, education and health. The challenge, though, is whether the reforms will succeed in getting Britain\u2019s economy back on track. Successive governments have carried out similar tyre changes on the Whitehall motor, only to end up with the wheels spinning on the road to prosperity. This time Labour is preparing to rely heavily on the private sector, in acknowledgment of tight constraints on the public finances. After the Tories\u2019 Brexit-era \u201cfuck business\u201d approach, there is obvious latent potential to unlock. However, the government ought to be realistic about how far this might go. For decades, the UK has trailed comparable rich nations on business investment \u2013 a fact made worse by the economic vandalism of austerity, Brexit, and the churn of Conservative prime ministers. Figures from Capital Economics show total investment in the UK has shrunk from 26% of GDP in the late 1980s to 18% today \u2013 a bigger decline than the rest of the G7. That suggests Labour is aiming to get from the bottom of the investment league table to the top: the equivalent of Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016, a 5,000-1 dream come true. Bringing about stability will help. The UK now stands as a beacon of relative calm in an increasingly volatile world. There will be further tailwinds as inflation cools, and the Bank of England is likely to cut interest rates soon. Reeves\u2019s new national wealth fund could help encourage investment in some certain parts of the economy, as part of a broader modern industrial strategy \u2013 details of which are said to be in the pipeline. However, Labour\u2019s manifesto implies cuts to public investment as a share of GDP from the current starting point, putting even more weight on the private sector to lead the charge in Britain\u2019s unlikely Leicester-inspired campaign. Unlocking more private capital could require the government to be bolder with its own investment plans. To do so without deviating from Labour\u2019s tax promises, Reeves could use the review of public spending she commissioned last week to pave the way for changes in the government\u2019s fiscal rules. The chancellor is also said to be keen to revamp the Office for Budget Responsibility, including a request for reports on the long-term impact of capital spending decisions. Currently, the Treasury watchdog publishes five-year forecasts. But this fails to capture the benefits from big infrastructure programmes, which can take longer to materialise. Such a change could help strengthen the case for investment. There is ample evidence that this might be a good idea, including from Van Reenen and Valero, who were among the authors of a report earlier this year calling for a temporary boost to public borrowing to drive investment in sustainable technologies and infrastructure. \u201c[It] would prove cost-effective and beneficial to living standards and economic competitiveness by increasing productivity and economic growth,\u201d they wrote. In the early days of Labour\u2019s putative decade in power, this could have the biggest effect on growth."

            "date": "2024-07-10T14:00:02Z",
            "content": "The story of the last known Tulsa race massacre survivors has always been a race against time. A race to preserve and uplift the history of the brutal moment, a race to give the last living survivors the time and platform to tell their story, and most important of all, a race to allow survivors to see a semblance of compensation for the trauma they experienced. The reality of the Oklahoma supreme court\u2019s decision last month to uphold a Tulsa county district court judge\u2019s decision to dismiss their lawsuit is that survivors have likely had their last chances for reparations denied. The reparations conversation around the Tulsa massacre has always been convoluted by an indignant air by the courts and state legislators of \u201cwhy should we have to pay for this\u201d and even more of an: \u201cIsn\u2019t acknowledging it happened enough?\u201d When we consider the estimated 300 Black people who died from the violence and the challenges faced by families in the years after to fight for justice or compensation, acknowledgment \u2013 particularly with just two survivors left \u2013 feels like pennies in comparison. It\u2019s difficult for any descendants to be made whole when parts of their family tree were wiped out so swiftly. But the Tulsa race massacre is a reminder that while there isn\u2019t a magic number that can quantify Black pain, there are real economic reverberations that Black trauma can have across generations. More broadly, today\u2019s generation of Black Americans are experiencing financial pressures. A Pew Research Center report released in February on how Black people view financial success found that 64% of Black adults consider their personal financial situation as only fair or in poor shape. In addition, the report found that about 65% of Black adults surveyed would not be able to sell their assets to cover three months of expenses if they lost their income, while 62% said they would not be able to borrow from family or friends. Financial success for Black people, according to the survey, showed that 67% said being debt-free is essential to how they view financial success. Meanwhile, 49% said that owning a home was an essential part of financial success and 44% said being able to pass down financial assets was essential for them. The fiery loss of businesses and homes at the hands of a white racist mob in 1921 in the Greenwood district, once considered to be the \u201cBlack Wall Street\u201d of America, was not only about loss of life but also loss of Black wealth. Community members today are working to revitalize and reimagine the Greenwood district while honoring its historical significance, but Lessie Benningfield Randle and Viola Fletcher, the last two known remaining survivors of the Tulsa race massacre, have waited decades for compensation. Hughes Van Ellis, another survivor who was part of the lawsuit, died last year at 102. They have lived long lives and gone on to have families. They moved forward with their lives because they had no choice, but they had to live with the memories of those violent nights and what happened to the community they had loved as young girls. Generations of Black Oklahomans lost out on homes and businesses that could\u2019ve been potentially passed on and uplifted those coming behind to a new economic status of prosperity and opportunity. In April, Tulsa city officials released the Tulsa Equality Indicators report, an annual look at inequality in economic opportunity, education, housing, justice, public health and services among Tulsa residents. The 2023 report showed that the median household income of white households was $62,411 compared with $39,779 made by Black households in Tulsa. In addition, 72.4% of south Tulsa residents had household earnings at or above the 200% poverty line while only 42% of north Tulsa residents met that indicator too. When it comes to homeownership, nearly 58% of white people owned their homes in the area while nearly 34% of Black people owned their homes. The intersections of racial trauma and financial trauma in the case of the Tulsa race massacre are not new, but denying survivors accountability or compensation intensifies the pain of this historical incident. Part of healing financial trauma includes understanding where our psychology and emotions around money and wealth comes from, including how we feel when we have money, how we feel when we spend money and more importantly, how we feel when we do not have money or feel like we do not have enough of it. Even the way we think about bills, savings and making large purchases has a psychological component to it. But there\u2019s also the more painful side of financial trauma whether it\u2019s remembering when the lights went out when the electricity bill didn\u2019t get paid, not being able to afford groceries or seeing an eviction notice on the door for unpaid rent or homes being foreclosed. In the case of the Tulsa massacre, it was generations of potential economic opportunity burned to the ground. It was dreams deferred. It was hope vanquished. It was a means of freedom robbed from under generations of Black people. Society today often assumes a multimillion-dollar price point is supposed to be attached to affirming the impact of traumatic incidents. Attempts at reparations and other compensation for Black survivors over the years has taken various shapes. In 1974, survivors of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, where hundreds of Black men had penicillin withheld from them, were part of a class-action lawsuit that led to a $10m settlement and health and medical benefits for them and their families. In 2022, Los Angeles county officials returned Bruce\u2019s Beach to descendants of Willa and Charles Bruce more than 100 years after the Manhattan Beach city council took it through eminent domain. Last summer, the family of Henrietta Lacks settled a federal lawsuit against Thermo Fisher Scientific decades after they took Lacks\u2019s cells without her consent while she was a cancer patient and went on to create HeLa cells that are the backbone of biomedical innovations. The attempt at reparation for Randle, Fletcher and their families\u2019 is about reckoning with the grief that comes with lost economic potential. As the last two known survivors \u2013 both 109 years old \u2013 settle into what will likely be the last years of their life, this is not only about acknowledgment of their pain, but about their hope to leave real dollars for the generations behind them to perhaps rebuild a legacy of business acumen and homeownership that was lost. But wealth, regardless of the actual dollar amount or the physical tangibles acquired from it, is also about economic freedom. Generations of Black people have often had their lack of wealth weaponized against their freedom, independence and their ability to fight back against systemic, structural and institutional racism. The court\u2019s decision to deny the Tulsa massacre survivors a path forward to be compensated for what they experienced compounds their own trauma and why the stakes are often high for Black people when they choose to go to use the court systems. The communal and financial means for Black people to fight injustice in court is no small feat, and in the aftermath of the violence many Black Tulsans tried to get economic relief from insurance companies and other legal avenues to no avail. Black people have often had to rethink what their idea of the American dream looks like and what the most viable path to generational wealth should be. Even as social and cultural movements have tried to disentangle work and US capitalism, the truth is that economic freedom is still an important aspect of this. Having the financial means to stand up to injustice or say no to the status quo of systemic and institutional racism and oppression is an undeniable part of wealth. As we look ahead to what\u2019s next for Randall and Fletcher, all we can hope is that their descendants will have the opportunity in their next lifetimes to be made whole or at the very least experience a partial payment of justice still owed."

            "date": "2024-07-11T07:10:36Z",
            "content": "The City watchdog will trigger the biggest shake-up of London stock market rules in more than 30 years this month, in an attempt to make the UK a more attractive place to list shares. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) confirmed on Thursday it would streamline and loosen rules for listed companies on 29 July, after months of hand-wringing over an exodus of companies from the London Stock Exchange for rival financial hubs. The revamped rules will scrap the UK\u2019s two-tier system of standard and premium listings. The premium listing heaped extra requirements on companies in exchange for a more prestigious label and entry into FTSE-branded indices. Ditching the premium label means companies will no longer have to hold shareholder votes before approving large mergers or takeovers. While current rules have been criticised by some for delaying or increasing the cost of standard deals meant to help companies grow, the change has raised concerns about eroding shareholder democracy. Companies will soon operate under one set of rules, simplifying what some industry bodies have claimed was a \u201ccomplex\u201d and costly listing regime. \u201cOur aim is to encourage a wider range of companies to choose to list, raise capital and grow in the UK, while maintaining high standards of market integrity and consumer protection,\u201d said the FCA\u2019s chief executive, Nikhil Rathi. The changes are a result of recommendations put forward in 2021 by Jonathan Hill, a former EU commissioner for finance. The FCA has already slashed the proportion of shares that must be offered to outside investors from 25% to 10%, and allows companies to issue dual-class shares that give founders more control of listed firms, in response to Lord Hill\u2019s report. Both sets of rules came into force in December 2021. It is also hoped that the latest changes reduce the number of companies leaving or snubbing London for overseas rivals, including the US. \u201cThe need for change is clear and widely acknowledged,\u201d Rathi said. \u201cThe risk otherwise is that our regime falls increasingly out of step with those of other jurisdictions, making it less likely that companies eager to grow choose the UK as a place to list their shares.\u201d The investment platform AJ Bell said the overhaul came with \u201csome serious potential negatives\u201d. \u201cThe government is clearly desperate to bolster UK listings as part of efforts to revitalise the City of London,\u201d said Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell. \u201cThe FCA\u2019s reforms risk diluting the quality of the UK stock market to a house made out of balsa wood. This includes giving shareholders less of a voice on matters like acquisitions, even though they are a company\u2019s owners.\u201d In May, the owner of Paddy Power, Flutter, announced it would switch its primary listing to New York, while the UK chip designer Arm opted to list on Wall Street last August after the government failed to convince it to float in London. The British fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown said in June it would accept a proposed offer from private equity investors, which would leave another hole in the FTSE 100 index."

The review makes good the limited ambition of last week\u2019s pension bill.

It is only very large funds, ideally over \u00a3100bn, that can diversify risk sufficiently to be able to invest more in the full range of productive assets, including those in the UK, to raise returns, boost the economy and lift pensions. Two important targets are identified. First, to explore ways to pool risk and consolidate the multiplicity of fast-growing but often minuscule defined contribution schemes and second, how to turbocharge the glacial consolidation of local government pension funds. That could bring \u00a31tn into productive investment. As important is the further \u00a31.4tn sterilised in closed defined benefit pension schemes. They need a guarantee (or \u201cunderpin\u201d) to persuade trustees to release \u00a3225bn of stagnating surpluses and for another 2,000 very small, closed defined-benefit schemes to agree to be merged into the highly successful Pension Protection Fund. Do all this, and Britain will at last have the investment pools to turn round its decaying stock market \u2013 and trigger an investment boom. \u2022 Will Hutton writes for the Observer and is co-chair of the Purposeful Company"

            "title": "The best long-term plan for Thames Water is to get it back on the stock market",
            "date": "2024-07-11T16:49:25Z",
            "content": "How bad are things at Thames Water? So bad that Ofwat has invented a new tool \u2013 a \u201cturnaround oversight regime\u201d \u2013 to get a grip on the financial and operational mess. The regulator\u2019s manoeuvre is clearly justified. The water company, under its umpteenth new chief executive, has just filed (late) a business plan judged \u201cinadequate\u201d. Its board could not provide formal assurance that statutory obligations on environment performance would be met. And remember, Thames has already been abandoned, in effect, by owners who think the firm is \u201cuninvestable\u201d. So, yes, heightened regulatory scrutiny looks like a minimum requirement until a workable solution is found. But the intriguing part was Ofwat\u2019s thinking on how Thames might eventually emerge from special measures. The company will need to show it can maintain \u201cadequate levels of financial resilience\u201d. This could involve \u201cintroducing a limit on the amount of debt the company can take on, a separation of the business into two or more water companies, or looking to a public listing to secure additional equity\u201d. The last of those \u2013 a return to the stock market \u2013 is the one to focus on. If Ofwat has finally concluded that a privatised water system in England and Wales works better if the companies are listed on the London stock market, give thanks. This column has been banging on (repeatedly) about the virtues of a listing. Why? First, stock market investors would never have tolerated the extreme over-leverage that was imposed on Thames after Macquarie bought the company in 2006. You cannot get away with 80%-plus gearing in the public arena. The three firms that still remain on the market \u2013 Severn Trent, United Utilities (in the north-west) and Pennon (owner of South West Water) \u2013 have never strayed far from regulatory norms of 60%-ish. Second, financial transparency improves on the stock market. You don\u2019t have holding companies in the Cayman Islands, or tax-minimising financing vehicles inserted above the regulated entity. Third, a share price and a six-monthly public reporting cycle provides a warning signal of trouble ahead. Incompetent and failing managements tend to be cleared out earlier. Fourth, a public listing ensures closer proximity to the public: the customers can buy shares if they wish. In the post-Macquarie era, Thames\u2019s ownership consortium has included giant sovereign funds from Abu Dhabi and China, for whom a UK water company is a faraway entry on a spreadsheet. A path back to the stock market for Thames looks far from simple, it should be said. Step one would surely have to involve a debt-for-equity swap to clear the decks and reduce the towering \u00a315.2bn pile of borrowings. The process could happen either voluntarily or be enforced via special administration \u2013 one or the other has probably become more likely after Thursday. Nobody should mourn for Thames\u2019s bondholders, who would take a whack in a financial reconstruction: they have also contributed to the soggy disaster. By way of further demonstration of the relative merits of stock market ownership, look at how the quoted firms emerged from Ofwat\u2019s five-yearly review. The business plans of Severn Trent and Pennon were the only two in the sector to be judged \u201coutstanding\u201d and United Utilities got a middle-of-the-pack \u201cstandard\u201d. Nobody is pretending the trio is faultless. All have had pollution and leakage woes (United notably at Windermere; Pennon with a diarrhoea and vomiting outbreak in Devon) And some of the executive bonuses are inexplicable (think Liv Garfield at Severn). Stock market ownership is not a cure-all. The point, though, is that the evidence of a couple of decades suggest it is easier to get listed companies to respond to regulatory incentives than unlisted ones. In a privatised system designed to reward relative outperformers, and penalise underperformers, that is an important point. Indeed, there is a fair argument that regulators only truly lost control of the whole privatised show after the take-private leveraged buyout boom of 2004-08. The new Labour government should take note. It is dead set against nationalising water companies \u2013 and rightly so. But it would perform a service if it could force more firms back to the stock market."

            "content": "Stock markets in Europe and Asia took a tumble on Thursday as jitters over the future artificial intelligence-driven growth of major tech companies sparked a global sell-off. The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed the day down 0.7%, having been hit by a near 4% decline in the Dutch chipmaker ASML, a 7% drop in Germany\u2019s Infineon Technologies, and a 13.7% fall in Switzerland\u2019s semiconductor company STMicroelectronics. The rout began in the US overnight, where the tech-focused Nasdaq fell 3.6% on Wednesday, marking its biggest single-day decline since 2022. About $1tn (\u00a3776bn) was knocked off the value of the Nasdaq 100, which covers the most valuable firms on the index. The main losers were AI-related companies, including Nvidia, Tesla and the Google-owner Alphabet, whose shares have soared in recent months. Investors have poured money into the sector, to ensure they did not miss out on a potential tech boom in artificial intelligence. The fall has raised concerns about whether excitement over major tech stocks, known as the magnificent seven, has been overblown. Nvidia fell 7%, Alphabet fell 5%, Microsoft dropped 3.5% and Apple lost 3%. Other magnificent seven stocks also fell, including Facebook owner Meta, which dropped 5.6%. Tesla had its worst decline since 2020, dropping 12%. The company\u2019s boss, Elon Musk, had reported a 45% fall in profits and pushed back plans to unveil self-driving robotaxis from August to October, igniting scepticism among investors. Musk has been trying to drum up interest in plans for the robot taxis, artificial intelligence and \u201cgenuinely useful\u201d humanoid robots, as demand for Tesla\u2019s electric cars has cooled. The stock market losses later spread to Asia, where tech-related firms continued their decline. That included Samsung, which fell 2%, Sony, which fell 5%, and tech investor SoftBank, which fell 9.4%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei finished the session down 3%. However, the AJ Bell investment analyst Dan Coatsworth said the sell-off may be a \u201cnecessary correction\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is worth putting last night\u2019s weakness into perspective, given indices were recently trading at record highs and there were big moves in some enormous companies. \u201cWhether this is a necessary correction to remove some froth from the market or something more dramatic will depend on forthcoming earnings from the likes of Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Amazon next week, as well as AI-star Nvidia at the end of August.\u201d Early trading on Wall Street was more subdued on Thursday, with the Nasdaq, Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 indices slightly up, as GDP data showing that the US economy grew faster than expected in the three months to the end of June."

            "content": "The cybersecurity firm Wiz has turned down a $23bn (\u00a318bn) takeover bid from Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, spurning what would have been the tech company\u2019s biggest ever acquisition and seeking a stock market flotation instead. Alphabet had been in talks with Wiz, founded by alumni of Israel\u2019s cyberintelligence unit, as it seeks to catch rivals Microsoft and Amazon in the hyper-competitive cloud services market. Wiz offers a service that scans the data on cloud storage providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure for security risks. The New York-based startup, which has the backing of investors including Sequoia Capital and Thrive Capital, was most recently valued at $12bn. \u201cWhile we are flattered by offers we have received, we have chosen to continue on our path to building Wiz,\u201d the company told employees in an internal email. In a memo the Wiz chief executive, Assaf Rappaport, outlined the next targets of reaching $1bn in annual recurring revenue and an initial public offering. \u201cSaying no to such humbling offers is tough, but with our exceptional team, I feel confident in making that choice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market validation we have experienced following this news only reinforces our goal \u2013 creating a platform that both security and development teams love.\u201d Neither Wiz nor Google had released official statements about the termination of the deal talks by Tuesday morning. There has been scepticism that the deal would pass regulatory scrutiny, as regulators seek to toughen their stance against big tech dealmaking. In December, Adobe abandoned its $20bn takeover of its smaller rival Figma, after European and UK regulators raised concerns that it would eliminate competition in the product design software market. Last month, the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission struck a deal on investigations into the main protagonists in the AI market, including Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia. Wiz, founded in 2020, was valued at $12bn during a funding round in May that drew investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Thrive. Wiz says 40% of Fortune 100 companies are its customers, and that it is making $350m in annual recurring revenue."

            "content": "Falling inflation, football fans and fake tan drove supermarket shopping in recent weeks, when improving consumer confidence and excitement around the men\u2019s Euros tournament were only slightly dampened by wet weather. Sales at supermarkets increased by 2.2% year on year over the four weeks to 7 July, with football fans driving up purchases of beers, crisps and snacks on match days. Grocery price inflation has fallen to 1.6% this month from June\u2019s 2.1%, marking the lowest level since September 2021, according to retail analysts Kantar. That drop coincided with the fastest rise in monthly footfall so far this year, with Britons making 2% more trips to the supermarket than a year earlier. Excitement built as England made it to the Euros final, but were beaten by Spain 2-1 on Sunday night, dashing hopes of an end to 58 years without a major trophy. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: \u201cEngland\u2019s hopes might have been dashed on Sunday, but there was still some cause for celebration in the grocery industry. \u201cFootball fans drove beer sales up by an average of 13% on the days that the England men\u2019s team played, compared with the same day during the previous week.\u201d With most England matches played on \u201cschool nights\u201d, many people opted for no or low-alcohol beer, with sales up by 38% on match days. The soggy summer weather boosted sales of artificial tan by 16%, while cold and flu medicine sales jumped by 35%, and dampened demand for sun cream, with sales down 10% compared with last year, when the UK enjoyed the warmest June on record. During the cost of living crisis consumers have switched to supermarkets\u2019 cheaper own-label items but this trend has now reversed, with sales of branded products rising by 3.6%, outpacing own-label groceries at 2.7%. Before the king\u2019s speech on Wednesday, which will set out the newly elected government\u2019s legislative agenda for grocers and other sectors, McKevitt said: \u201cThe retail landscape looks very different from 2010 when the last Labour government was in power \u2013 and so do our shopping trolleys. \u201cAs diets have evolved, sales of popcorn, peanut butter and chilled vegetarian products, such as sausages and grills, have more than trebled. We\u2019re also more likely to have premium ground and bean coffee in our cups now.\u201d Ocado was the fastest-growing grocer for the fifth month in a row, with sales up by 10.7% over the 12 weeks to 7 July giving it a 1.8% market share. The discounter Lidl posted a 7.8% jump in sales, bringing its share of the market to 8.1%, while fellow budget retailer Aldi\u2019s market share is 10%. Waitrose gained market share for the first time since January 2022, edging 0.1 percentage point higher to 4.5%, as spending at the upmarket grocer increased by 3.3%. Britain\u2019s largest supermarket chain, Tesco, achieved its biggest gain in share since November 2021, taking 27.7% of the market, a 0.7 percentage point increase compared with last year."

            "content": "The fortunes of Australia\u2019s economy \u2013 and political polling of the Albanese government \u2013 may well hinge on the strength of Wednesday\u2019s inflation numbers. Economists expect headline consumer prices in the June quarter will land at an annual rate of 3.8%, accelerating from 3.6% in the prior three months. Core inflation \u2013 known as the trimmed mean \u2013 will be steady at 4%, a Bloomberg survey found. The Reserve Bank\u2019s own forecasts in May of 3.8% for both headline and core inflation for the quarter just ended were both elevated from its predictions early this year. An upside surprise will likely heap pressure on the central bank to lift its cash rate to 4.6% \u2013 a 14th hike in this cycle \u2013 when its board meets next Monday and Tuesday. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Australian Bureau of Statistics will release the inflation data at 11.30 AEST. Should it meet expectations \u2013 or even fall shy \u2013 the calls instead will be for early interest rate cuts to ensure an economy already close to stalling doesn\u2019t sink into recession. The RBA wants to be reassured inflation remains headed towards its preferred 2-3% range, a goal it currently expects will be achieved by the end of 2025. Households and businesses with debt are hoping it won\u2019t take another RBA rate rise to ensure that trajectory is retained. Since the central bank began hoisting rates in May 2022, monthly mortgage repayments have increased about $240 per $100,000 borrowed, according to RateCity. Another quarter-point hike would add about $15 to the load and erode some of the government\u2019s modified stage-three tax cuts delivering families about $240 a month. The investment bank UBS is in the minority, predicting the RBA will hike its cash rate to 4.6% next week. CPI has remained above the bank\u2019s target band for 12 consecutive quarters and the past three months will make it 13, it noted. Governor Michele Bullock said in May the RBA board \u201chas been clear that it has a low tolerance for allowing inflation to return to target more slowly than currently expected\u201d, the bank noted. To do so \u201cwould risk eroding public credibility in our commitment to low and stable inflation\u201d. Even accounting for some stickiness in inflation, Australia would be almost alone among rich nations in considering another rate rise. Only Japan, which in March lifted its key interest rate for the first time in 17 years as that nation\u2019s deflation threat finally ebbed, is still considering raising borrowing costs. Canada and the European Union have started cutting rates and the US may follow in September. That downward shift may give the RBA\u2019s nine-member board additional cause to stay put \u2013 as it has done since last November. Politicians have sought to frame the outcome knowing the possible boost \u2013 or hit \u2013 to the government\u2019s standing may pivot on the ABS readings. An election this side of Christmas would be in prospect if the government viewed the RBA\u2019s job was done. Another rate rise, though, would likely delay any election until next May, when the term ends, as any rate relief hopes dim. \u201cAustralians are in enormous pain because of Labor\u2019s homegrown inflation crisis,\u201d shadow treasurer Angus Taylor said, adding the country was the only one among the top 10 economies to have higher inflation compared with the end of 2023. \u201cAustralians face higher prices, higher interest rates and higher taxes for longer because of Labor\u2019s bad economic management,\u201d Taylor said. Treasurer Jim Chalmers said inflation was \u201cpersistent\u201d in the June quarter but the government remained confident it would resume its moderation from now. \u201cWe expect the big drivers on Wednesday to be things like insurance and rent and petrol, and of course petrol is impacted by the global oil price \u2013 and all this uncertainty we\u2019re seeing in the Middle East,\u201d Chalmers told ABC TV on Tuesday. \u201cNone of those factors are about government spending.\u201d Research out this week from the ANZ senior economist Blair Chapman noted much of this year\u2019s inflation pulse was driven by so-called administered or indexed prices, such as university fees. These were immune from higher interest rates in the near term. \u201cNon-administered and non-indexed inflation has declined notably and is running around levels consistent with the RBA\u2019s target band on a six-month annualised basis,\u201d Chapman said. In the March quarter, such items rose 3.3% year-on-year, down from a peak of 9%. In other words, an RBA rate rise \u201cwould likely slow activity in interest rate-sensitive sectors, slow employment growth and add to unemployment\u201d. More reason to hold fire, then. Unless those CPI numbers light the fuse."

            "date": "2024-07-21T09:50:34Z",
            "content": "Rachel Reeves has indicated that the government could agree above-inflation pay rises for teachers and other public sector workers, saying there is \u201ca cost to not settling\u201d pay negotiations. The chancellor, who did not dispute reports that independent pay review bodies for teachers and NHS staff had advised increases of about 5.5% \u2013 higher than the current 2% inflation rate \u2013 said she would set out full details later in July. While Reeves\u2019s tone will be welcomed by unions, the cost of such rises, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimating that a 5.5% increase across all public sector professions would cost about \u00a310bn, would place huge pressure on the government\u2019s tight fiscal rules. Speaking to BBC One\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Reeves said she was willing to make tough decisions neglected by the last government, saying the pay recommendation for teachers had been sitting unaddressed on the desk of the previous education secretary, Gillian Keegan. \u201cAt the moment, we are looking at these pay review body recommendations, doing the analysis,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cWe will work with public sector workers on that. And later this month we will make announcements around public sector pay when we do that full analysis of the public finances and public spending. \u201cBut we also know that there is a cost to not settling \u2013 a cost of further industrial action, a cost in terms of the challenge that we face in recruiting retaining doctors and nurses and teachers as well. But we\u2019ll do it in a proper way. Make sure that the sums add up.\u201d According to IFS estimates reported in the Sunday Telegraph, paying an extra 5.5% to teachers and nurses would cost \u00a35.5bn, rising to about \u00a310bn if the same increase took place for all public sector staff. Acknowledging that she faced \u201chuge spending pressures\u201d, Reeves also hinted that the government would take account of the independent status of the pay review bodies, rather than often rejecting their recommendations, as sometimes took place under the Conservatives. She said the government would do things \u201cin a proper way\u201d, highlighting the need for greater economic growth to improve the fiscal situation. Jeremy Hunt, the shadow chancellor, told the BBC it was \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d for Reeves to suggest Labour had inherited a particularly terrible economic situation and rejected the idea that the Conservatives had dodged difficult decisions. \u201cYou have interviewed me on many occasions over the years and you can criticise me for many things, but not taking tough and difficult decisions is one thing I don\u2019t think people would level at me,\u201d Hunt said, while not denying that his government received the teachers\u2019 pay review recommendation before the election was called. On Sky\u2019s Trevor Philips on Sunday show, James Murray, a junior Treasury minister, refused to be drawn on what would be done about public sector pay, beyond saying Reeves would \u201cset out our response in the context of the public finances and the public spending inheritance that we have in government\u201d. He added: \u201cI think what\u2019s not helpful for me to do for any worker in the public sector is for me to pre-empt the process that we are going through right now.\u201d Reeves refused to say when or if ministers may abolish the two-child limit on working age benefits, a key driver of child poverty about which Keir Starmer faces a looming backbench rebellion, saying it was impossible without knowing where the \u00a33bn annual cost would come from. \u201cI am going to run our economy with iron discipline, bringing back stability, because we haven\u2019t had stability,\u201d she said. Reeves lambasted what she called the inaction of the previous government, citing the example of Keegan. \u201cThe Conservative former education secretary, she had the pay review body recommendation for teachers on her desk when she was in office. \u201cShe didn\u2019t do anything about it. She didn\u2019t publish it. She didn\u2019t say how she was going to respond to it. They called an election. They didn\u2019t make the tough decisions. They ran away from them.\u201d Similarly, Reeves said, a planning decision on an energy infrastructure project was ignored because the then energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, \u201cwasn\u2019t willing to make those difficult decisions\u201d."

            "date": "2024-07-17T11:52:04Z",
            "content": "Inflation is back down to more normal levels. But at the Bank of England, there are concerns that the battle to keep it close to the 2% target set by the government has yet to be decisively won. Official figures from June show the headline measure remained bang on target for a second month in a row, raising hopes that the worst of the inflationary burst after the exit from Covid lockdowns and the Russian invasion of Ukraine has passed. After the Bank hiked interest rates 14 times, to 5.25% \u2013 the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 to fight inflation, there have been hopes for some time that a return to more normal levels could warrant a cut in official borrowing costs. Having come down from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022, signs of stability in consumer price growth will come as welcome relief to households and businesses. However, the cost of living still remains significantly higher than three years ago, and the Bank is worried that inflation will bump back above its target within months. Of most concern to Threadneedle Street will be signs of stubborn inflationary pressure in the services sector \u2013 one of the key areas the Bank has said it closely monitors when considering whether to sanction a rate cut. The latest figures showed services inflation held steady at 5.7%, a blow for those advocating a cut. The ONS said three main sub-sectors were contributing to the sticky levels of price growth: restaurants and cafes, rents and hotels. Some economists said this could be down to Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour landing in Britain last month, triggering a boom in demand for hotels and other consumer-facing services as Swifties flocked to concert venues across the UK. For stubborn inflation, read: \u201cIt\u2019s me, hi, I\u2019m the problem, it\u2019s me?\u201d The ONS isn\u2019t so sure. The government statisticians logged many of the prices in their dataset before the concerts took place, while its samples were taken from hotels across the country, not just in places where Taylormania had taken hold. There may have been some evidence of Swift\u2019s impact in inflation in hotels, where average price growth rose from 7% in May to 9.8% in June. But cultural services inflation, which would capture ticket prices, dipped from 7.4% to 7.3%. Financial markets are, however, taking a cue that domestic inflationary pressures could prove more persistent than hoped. The chances of the Bank cutting rates at its next policy meeting on 1 August have slipped from about 50% to close to 35%, while the pound strengthened to a one-year high, breaking through $1.30 on the global currency markets. Several members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, including its chief economist, Huw Pill, have warned in the past week that service sector inflation and a tight jobs market could force Threadneedle Street to take a cautious approach. Official figures from the jobs market are due to be published on Thursday, giving the central bank plenty of time to come up with a view before its next meeting. Some economists, however, believe that when it comes to signs of inflation persistence in the service sector, the Bank should shake it off. Goods prices, and in particular durable goods prices, remain firmly in deflation. Producer price inflation \u2013 reflecting factory gate prices, which can act as a guide to future consumer prices \u2013 was also weaker than expected. With concerns that high interest rates are weighing heavily on the economy and households unnecessarily, there will be growing demands for a cut in borrowing costs."

Here\u2019s why the consumer price index (CPI) and other inflation numbers are being more closely watched since the Reserve Bank of Australia started hoisting interest rates in May 2022 and what the results might mean. Why is this data batch so important? The RBA wants inflation back within a 2-3% target range by the end of 2025 and the June quarter data might reveal a stalling of that trajectory. If so, the central bank may decide hiking interest rates is needed to ensure inflation resumes its retreat. After the RBA\u2019s most recent board meeting in June, the bank\u2019s governor, Michele Bullock, said the central bank was \u201cvigilant\u201d in watching for proof that inflation wasn\u2019t receding fast enough. But Australia\u2019s in \u201cquite a complex situation\u201d, Bullock said.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup ABS figures since then, including May\u2019s monthly CPI reading that rose to 4% for the first time in 2024, have helped make things clearer. The jobless rate also nudged up to 4.1% in June, even as the economy added more than 50,000. The ABS only surveys price changes each month for part of the 87 categories of goods and services that make up the basket. That\u2019s why the RBA treats them \u201cwith a bargepole\u201d (as one former senior economist put it), viewing the quarterly numbers as more comprehensive. What\u2019s expected? In May, the RBA forecast June quarter inflation would be 3.8% for both the so-called headline CPI and the trimmed mean. The latter strips away 15% from the top and bottom of the most volatile price movers to approximate \u201ccore\u201d inflation. In the March quarter, CPI and trimmed mean were 3.6% and 4%, respectively. Both have been sinking since scaling three-decade peaks of 7.8% and 6.8% at the end of 2022. Private economists reckon the June quarter CPI will match the RBA\u2019s prediction but the core reading will remain steady at 4%, according to Bloomberg. If that\u2019s the outcome, investors will probably lift the odds of an interest rate rise to 4.6% \u2013 which are now about a one-in-five chance \u2013 when the RBA board meets next week. All four major commercial banks currently expect the next RBA move will be a rate cut. Are governments making the RBA\u2019s job easier or harder? Governments are tending to stoke demand rather than chill it, such as the Albanese government\u2019s stage-three tax cuts that will inject about $23bn into the economy this year, or hefty (extra) energy rebates by Labor counterparts in Queensland and Western Australia. All three have to go to elections within the next 10 months and can\u2019t ignore voters\u2019 pleas for help to deal with cost of living increases. Some of the support, though, will go to (mostly older, mortgage-free) people who need it less. Treasurers and their Treasuries, though, argue the economy would have stalled without these injections. The other half of the RBA\u2019s mandate is to secure full employment and it doesn\u2019t want to send households and businesses to the wall if it can avoid it. The RBA\u2019s models already anticipate a spending jump will follow tax cuts. It also seems to have accepted Treasury arguments rebates serve to \u201cmechanically\u201d lower CPI, and in the process reduce demand in the economy buy cutting CPI-indexed payments such as pensions. \u201cEnergy rebates and rent assistance would lower headline inflation in 2024, though this direct effect would be reversed later in 2025 [should the rebates not be extended],\u201d the RBA said in its June meeting minutes. Economists such as Steven Hamilton are sceptical. \u201cBy lowering prices, the energy rebate increases households\u2019 real incomes, boosting aggregate demand and inflation,\u201d he wrote in the AFR in May. The RBA will update its assessment of budget inflationary effects for its August meeting including, presumably, some early hint of how much of those tax cuts are getting spent. What are central banks overseas doing? Those calling for another interest rate rise argue that Australia was relatively slow to start hiking our cash rate and it hasn\u2019t risen as much as peers abroad. That might be technically true but the RBA\u2019s twin mandate and the fact its inflation target is lower than the US or New Zealand with their 2% or lower goals allows it to be more flexible and patient. There is also proof Australia\u2019s treatment of housing costs has stoked the CPI inflation measure here while moderating it in nations such as the US, Canada and the UK. As it happens, overseas counterparts have lately shifted to cutting rates or will do so soon. Canada lowered its key interest rate in June and July, the European Central Bank cut in June and the US Federal Reserve is widely expected to start reducing rates in September. Falling overseas borrowing costs would take some of the pressure off the RBA to hike again if the Australian dollar strengthens, making imports cheaper. What are wild cards to watch? Core inflation may be the RBA\u2019s primary focus but the central bank won\u2019t ignore what headline CPI numbers do to inflationary expectations of households and businesses alike. Housing makes up about 21.75% of the CPI basket, of which rents account for about six percentage points and the cost of new houses just over eight percentage points. The tight housing market in most capital cities and labour shortages suggest this component of inflation won\u2019t ease much any time soon. Despite heightened media attention, electricity is 2.36% of the basket, with gas accounting for just under 1%. By contrast, transport fuel at almost 3.75%, garners much less attention. Some service price increases will also remain elevated, with insurance costs rising 3% in the June quarter alone, the Commonwealth Bank has noted. That\u2019s down at least from 3.7% in the March quarter, but suggests the sector will continue to be a propellant for price increases. Some food prices are also rebounding. Volatile food and vegetable prices may increase as much as 7% for the quarter, led by lamb, the bank forecasts. Much to chew on, in other words."

            "content": "Time for a recap. Economic storm clouds are gathering over Germany again, after growth fell into reverse and inflation rose. German GDP fell by 0.1% in the second quarter of this year, new economic data shows, putting Europe\u2019s largest economy on the brink of recession. Analysts warned that Germany is the growth laggard of the eurozone, although Latvia (-1.1%), Sweden (-0.8%) and Hungary (-0.2%) all shrank by more. ABN Amro explains: German Q1 GDP undershot expectations, contracting by 0.1% qoq (consensus and our forecast +0.1% qoq) after expanding by 0.2% qoq in Q1 The details will be published late August. For now, Destatis pointed to fixed investment, particularly in transport equipment and buildings as the main drag on GDP growth. Indeed, investment in Germany has been generally weak with the level of investment still lagging 2019 levels by about 4%; this is especially the case for investment in transport equipment such as cars. Furthermore, investment in buildings declined after being a source of strength in the Q1 GDP reading. This is not a surprise given the continued high level of interest rates, which have depressed demand and activity in the construction sector, particularly housing. German inflation, on a harmonised basis, rose to 2.6% this month. The drop in Germany\u2019s GDP took the shine of a solid, unspectacular, growth performance by the wider eurozone, which expanded by 0.3% in April-June. Spain was a bright light, growing by 0.8%, while France expanded by 0.3% \u2013 helped by the sale of a massive cruise ship to Royal Caribbean. Analysts at Nomura say: Euro area Q2 2024 GDP grew by 0.3% q-o-q. Core/periphery divergence continues, worsening even, with Germany contracting and Spain materially outperforming. In other news\u2026. Climate activists have voiced anger after BP beat profit expectations, and hiked its dividend. Drinks company Diageo has been hit by a slump in demand in Latin America, cancelling out a jump in demand for its no-alcohol Guinness 0.0%. Bakery chain Greggs has raised some prices, as it passes on the cost of a higher wage bill. Pfizer has raised its profit guidance, as it shrugged off a drop in revenues from its Covid produces. The number of job openings in the US has fallen slightly. After falling sharply this morning, London\u2019s blue-chip stocks have clawed their way back, mostly. The FTSE 100 share index has ended the day down 18 points, or 0.2%, at 8274 points. Standard Chartered led the risers, after announcing its biggest ever share buyback this morning. But medical device maker Convatec was the top faller, down 5.8%, after missing profit expectations. The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies jumped 0.85%, led by wealth manager St James\u2019s Place (+25%) after it outlined cost-cutting plans. Trouble is mounting in the UK water industry, where Moody\u2019s is threatening to downgrade Southern Water to a \u2018junk\u2019 rating. SW (Finance) I PLC (Southern Water) is currently rated at Baa3 \u2013 the lowest investment-grade rating. Moody\u2019s has now placed its bonds on review for a possible downgrade. Moody\u2019s says: \u201cThe review for downgrade reflects our expectation that Ofwat\u2019s draft determination would, if not materially changed... result in severe Outcome Delivery Incentive (ODI) penalties and total expenditure (totex) allowances below the level needed to fund Southern Water\u2019s investment programme. \u201cTogether with an allowed return that falls significantly short of Southern Water\u2019s actual cost of capital, such under-performance may challenge the company\u2019s ability to raise equity finance to maintain leverage at levels consistent with the current rating.\u201d Southern Water is subject to enforcement monitoring by regulator Ofwat after a record \u00a3126m fine in 2019 over \u201cshocking\u201d failures at the company\u2019s sewage treatment sites that polluted rivers and beaches in southern England. Last week, Moody\u2019s downgraded Thames Water\u2019s credit rating to \u201cjunk\u201d status, adding to pressure on the English water company\u2019s finances. Pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer has lifted its profit forecast after recording its first rise in revenues since the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Pfizer grew its revenues by 2% year-on-year to $13.28bn, despite a drop in revenues from Covid products, as demand for its heart disease drug and its cancer therapy Padcev rise. David Denton, Pfizer\u2019s chief financial officer and executive vice president, says: \u201cThis was Pfizer\u2019s first quarter of topline revenue growth, on a year-over-year basis, since the fourth quarter of 2022 when our COVID revenues peaked. The company now expects annual profit to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, up from a prior profit forecast of $2.15 to $2.35 per share. Pfizer also says it\u2019s on track to cut costs by at least $4bn by the end of the year, through its \u201cCost Realignment Program\u201d. Microsoft has said it is investigating reports of users having problems accessing its services, with some reporting being unable to access email and other functions, PA Media reports. An alert on the technology giant\u2019s service status website said it is looking into a \u201cnetwork infrastructure\u201d issue. According to website status platform DownDetector, users of Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Xbox Live and players of popular video game Minecraft were among those reporting issues. The incident comes less than two weeks after a major IT outage knocked global infrastructure including transport and healthcare services offline because a flawed software update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike affected Microsoft devices. On its service status website, Microsoft said: \u201cWe are investigating reports of issues connecting to Microsoft services globally. \u201cCustomers may experience timeouts connecting to Azure services. We have multiple engineering teams engaged to diagnose and resolve the issue. More details will be provided as soon as possible.\u201d UK auditors BDO and Forvis Mazars have been urged to improve the quality of their audit work. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has today flagged the gap between the Big Four accountancy and BDO and Mazars. In its Annual Review of Audit Quality, the FRC says 74% of audits were categorised as good or requiring limited improvements. The big firms did well, with Deloitte at 94%, EY 76%, KPMG 89% and PwC 76%. But, the audit results for BDO have declined from 69% to 38% year on year, while Forvis Mazars\u2019 results also declined from 56% to 44%. The regulator says: While inspections are based on a risk-based sample, and should not be extrapolated to all of the audits undertaken by both firms, the results do not meet the FRC\u2019s expectations. Given their strategic importance to the audit market, both firms must urgently address the causes of these declines and undertake significant audit quality improvement plans which will be closely monitored by the FRC. Just in: the number of job openings across the US economy has dropped slightly, as its labour market slackens a little. There were 8.184m job opportunies in the US at the end of June, down from 8.23m at the end of May, and 941,000 fewer than a year earlier. The job openings rate held at 4.9 percent in June. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says: Job openings increased in accommodation and food services (+120,000) and in state and local government, excluding education (+94,000). The number of job openings decreased in durable goods manufacturing (-88,000) and in federal government (-62,000) On Wall Street, stocks have made a positive start as trading begins in New York. The S&amp;P 500 share index has risen by 10 points, or 0.2%, to 5,473 points, while the Dow Jones industrial average has gained 0.4%. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite is flat, with cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike losing 7%, as it faces calls for compensation following the IT outage this month that caused millions of computers to crash. Microsoft users have been reporting more problems today, with an outage affecting Azure network infrastructure customers. Microsoft\u2019s share are up 0.4%, though, ahead of its latest financial results tonight. Oil prices have weakened today, weighed down by worries about demand from China, the world\u2019s largest oil importer. Brent crude has dropped by 1.35% to $78.70 per barrel, while US crude is 1.1% lower at $74.87. Joseph Dahrieh, managing principal at brokerage Tickmill, explains: Slower-than-expected economic growth in China as well as declining oil imports have weighed on sentiment. In addition, the planned removal of part of OPEC+\u2019s production cuts could intensify the bearish sentiment. Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, has responded to the CMA\u2019s probe into its partnership with AI firm Anthropic (see earlier post). A Google spokesperson said: \u201cGoogle is committed to building the most open and innovative AI ecosystem in the world. \u201cAnthropic is free to use multiple cloud providers and does, and we don\u2019t demand exclusive tech rights.\u201d Over in the US, home prices have stagnated. US house prices were unchanged in May, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, following a 0.3% rise in April. During May, prices fell by 0.5% in the West North Central division, but gained 0.3% in the New England division. \u201cUS house price movement was flat in May,\u201d said Dr. Anju Vajja, Deputy Director for FHFA\u2019s Division of Research and Statistics, adding: \u201cThe slowdown in U.S. house price appreciation continued in May amid a slight rise in both mortgage rates and housing inventory.\u201d On an annual basis, house prices rose 5.7% compared with May 2023. We also have growth figures from Mexico, which are a little weaker than expected. Mexico\u2019s economy grew by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in April-June, missing forecasts for 0.3% growth. The UK\u2019s Takeover Panel has doled out its harshest penalty for a code breach, after a long investigation into the company which once owned boutique hotel chains Malmaison and Hotel du Vin. The Panel has concluded that ten parties should be \u201ccold-shouldered\u201d, a move which effectively bars them from any takeover-related activity, including buying or selling shares during a live takeover period. The Panel found that several executives of MWB Group Holdings had acquired shares in the company which, when added to the shares held by a pre-existing concert party, meant they controlled more than half its share capital \u2013 which would, if disclosed, force them to make a formal takeover bid. Omar Faruqui, Director General of the Panel, explains: \u201cToday\u2019s ruling concludes the most complex investigation in the Panel\u2019s 56-year history. Ten individuals have been cold-shouldered. They misled MWB Group shareholders and the market through a web of sham transactions and false trails stretching across many jurisdictions. Exposing their deceit and wrong-doing is testament to the skill and determination of the Panel\u2019s enforcement team.\u201d The ruling, which runs to over 100 pages, is online here. The Panel also decided that three members of management, including former MWB CEO Richard Balfour-Lynn, should pay compensation to shareholders, and has rejected an appeal from Balfour-Lynn. It has also publicly censured Andrew Blurton, a joint finance director of MWB at the time of some of the events in question. MWB entered administration in November 2012 and was liquidated on 15 April 2018. The slight increase in German inflation this month (see last post) not only highlights the stickiness of inflation but also suggests that a September rate cut by the European Central Bank is not a done deal, yet, says ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski Another blow for Germany \u2013 its inflation rate has risen. Inflation, on an EU-harmonised basis, rose to 2.6% per year in July, up from 2.5% in June, statistics body Destatis reports. Britain\u2019s competition watchdog has kicked off another probe into the artificial intelligence sector. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is examining whether Alphabet\u2019s partnership with AI start-up Anthropic has created a \u201cmerger situation\u201d, and if so wheter it weakens competition. This is the latest in a series of moves by the CMA. Earlier this month it began a full investigation into Microsoft\u2019s deal with AI startup Inflection, and in April it began seeking views on Amazon\u2019s investment in Anthropic, which is a leading rival to OpenAI. Other regulators also have concerns; in January, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft received inquiries from the US Federal Trade Commission on their investments and partnerships with Anthropic and OpenAI. Getting back to today\u2019s eurozone growth figures, Moody\u2019s Analytics economist Ross Cioffi has warned that the outlook for the region for the rest of this year is \u201cprecarious\u201d. Cioffi explains: Preliminary estimates reported a 0.3% quarter-on-quarter expansion of Eurozone GDP in the second quarter of 2024. Most major economies grew more strongly than we had been expecting, with the notable exception of Germany, which was worse off. Spain\u2019s second quarter was well-rounded, with solid increases in domestic and foreign demand. France gained from both home and abroad, as well, though only to a minor extent with private consumption on the decline, while Italy was bolstered mostly on domestic demand. In Germany, the weak spot was fixed investments. The outlook for the Eurozone economy remains precarious for the rest of the year, with modest growth at best, as prices and interest rates remain high, and weak sentiment keep things cool, before picking up steam next year. A major probe into whether people overpaid on their car loans has been extended by the UK\u2019s financial watchdog. The Financial Conduct Authority now expects to set out the next steps in its review into the past use of discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) in May 2025, having previously aimed to do this by the end of September. The FCA says: We\u2019re working hard to understand how DCAs affected the cost of credit for people borrowing money to buy a vehicle. We\u2019re assessing thousands of records spanning 14 years. The FCA\u2019s investigation centres on the car loans market, and whether commission payments to brokers were too high. Those brokers were able to adjust the interest rates they charged customers, and some received \u201cdiscretionary commission arrangements\u201d, which meant they were paid more if the interest rate was higher. The FCA says today that firms involved in our review have engaged constructively with the regulator, but many have struggled to supply data within the requested time. Another wrinkle is that Barclays Partner Finance has begun judicial review proceedings of the Financial Ombudsman Service\u2019s decision to uphold a complaint relating to its use of a DCA. Thousands of car loan customers who took out loans before 2021 have been complaining to lenders and brokers. The FCA says today it could bring in a redress scheme, so it is asking firms to pause complaint handling until 4 December 2025. Shares in Close Brothers, which has provided motor finance deals, are down around a third since January, when the FCA announced it was investigating the market. JP Morgan is still bullish on the outlook for the UK stock market. In a new research note, its analysts say the backdrop for UK equities is \u201clooking favourable\u201d. They cite attractive valuations, improved political clarity and potentially lower bond yields, which all make dividend yields more attractive again. JP Morgan is maintain its recommendation to remain \u2018overweight\u2019 on UK stocks. They explain: The elections event risk is behind us, and the new government is likely to provide more fiscal credibility and stability, with focus on domestic agenda, homebuilding and the consumer. Broadly, the beneficiaries stand to be Banks, Homebuilders, Real Estate and Utilities, while on the negative side we have Diversified Financials, E&amp;P and Transportation. Within the UK, we have a preference for Domestic over Exporters plays, as GBP is firmer, for UK consumer plays, and for Real Estate and Homebuilders - these typically start performing once the rate cuts begin. In the car world, Tesla is updating the software on more than 1.8 million vehicles in the US to fix a problem that stops unlatched bonnets being detected. Tesla has started rolling out an over-the-air software update to detect the open bonnet and send a notification to customers, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said today. If a bonnet, or hood, was not locked properly, it could fully open while a car is being operated, blocking the driver\u2019s view. The pound is holding firm on the foreign exchanges this morning, unchanged at $1.286 against the US dollar. But, sterling could weaken on Thursday if the Bank of England decides to cut interest rates from their current 16-year high. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, says: \u201cThe Bank of England\u2019s August policy announcement appears on a knife-edge, and one of the tougher rate decisions to predict for some time. We expect the MPC to deliver a 25 basis point cut on Thursday, albeit the vote on rates appears almost too close to call, and could be evenly split between the hawks and doves. On balance, we think that we\u2019ve seen enough progress on inflation for those members that were close to voting for a cut in June to shift their allegiance in favour of the doves. There is, however, a high degree of uncertainty surrounding this view, particularly given the lack of communications from MPC members since the June meeting, in part due to the blackout period surrounding the general election. Currently, the money markets indicate there\u2019s a 59% chance of a rate cut on Thursday. Ryan adds: As this is not yet fully priced in, an immediate rate reduction would likely trigger some downside in the pound, albeit an upbeat set of communications, particularly a sizable upward revision to the GDP forecasts, could limit the extent of any sell-off.\u201d In the UK, the Bank of England has created a new cost benefit analysis panel to provide advice when new rules are proposed for firms and financial market infrastructures. It is chaired by Laurel Powers-Freeling, who is also the chair of Uber UK. Sam Woods, Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation and Chief Executive Officer of the PRA, said: \u201cCost benefit analysis is an essential part of policy development, and I\u2019m delighted that we\u2019ve been able to attract such a strong panel to help ensure that we do the best job we can in this vital area.\u201d Away from Europe, credit rating agency S&amp;P has downgraded Bangladesh\u2019s credit ratings to B+ from BB-, nearly two weeks after the government imposed a curfew to quell deadly student protests. S&amp;P cited a sustained decline in Bangladesh\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, which it says shows there is persistent pressure on the country\u2019s external metrics. Earlier this month, the Bangladeshi government declared a national curfew and announced plans to deploy the army to tackle the country\u2019s worst unrest in a decade, with AFP reporting that at least 105 people have died in the unrest. The protests began this month on university campuses as students demanded an end to a quota system that reserves 30% of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh\u2019s war of independence in 1971. Those protesting have argued that the policy is unfair and discriminatory as young people struggle for jobs during an economic downturn and instead benefits members of the ruling Awami League party, which is led by the Hasina. The drop in German GDP in the last quarter is a worry, says Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets: The trajectory of the German economy remains a concern for Europe, with the manufacturing powerhouse seeing second quarter growth fall back into negative territory (-0.1%). Fortunately, things are more stable for the eurozone as a whole, with the latest GDP figure beating expectations to post a second consecutive 0.3% reading in Q2. Pushpin Singh, senior economist at the CEBR think tank, predicts the eurozone\u2019s growth prospects will improve this year: \u201cFlash estimates from Eurostat indicate that the Eurozone economy grew by 0.3% on the quarter in Q2. This rate was above consensus expectations and matched the corresponding growth rate seen in Q1. The stronger-than-expected growth rate suggests the bloc has turned a corner since the start of the year. Prospects are likely to improve further throughout the year, driven by recent policy loosening by the European Central Bank and expectations for further interest rate cuts down the line. Cebr expects the Eurozone economy to expand by 0.8% in 2024, up from 2023\u2019s growth figure of 0.4%.\u201d The eurozone only grew half as quickly as the US in the last quarter. GDP data last week showed that the US economy grew at a 2.8% annualised rate in the second quarter of 2024, or the equivalent of 0.7% quarterly growth. Today\u2019s eurozone growth report is \u201cmoderate but decent\u201d, says Frederik Engholm, head of Macro &amp; Strategy at Nykredit. Just in: The eurozone grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of this year, a little faster than expected, despite the economic problems in Germany. Statistics body Eurostat has just reported that GDP increased by 0.3% in both the euro area and the EU in the April-June quarter, which matches the growth recorded in the first quarter of this year. Economists had expected growth to slow to 0.2% in Q2, so this is a little better than expected. Ireland (+1.2%) recorded the highest increase compared to the previous quarter, followed by Lithuania (+0.9%) and Spain (+0.8%), while France grew by 0.3% and Italy and Belgium both expanded by 0.2%. The highest declines were recorded in Latvia (-1.1%), Sweden (-0.8%) and Hungary (-0.2%), while Germany\u2019s 0.1% fall in GDP also dragged on growth. The news that Germany\u2019s GDP shrank in April-June (see 9.20am) shows how hard it will be to escape the cyclical and structural headwinds hitting its economy, says Carsten Brzeski, Global Head of Macro at ING. He tells clients this morning that the German economy will continue to hover between hope and despair: With both the US and the Chinese economies losing momentum, along with new trade tensions, there is very little hope for a strong export-driven recovery. Also, weak industrial orders, high inventory levels and precautionary savings are still weighing on the economy. On top of that, the increasing number of insolvencies and individual company announcements of forthcoming job restructurings are still hanging like the Sword of Damocles over the labour market this year. However, despite a weak start to the second half of the year, don\u2019t rule out potential positive surprises. In fact, extremely weak May data could have been exaggerated due to many public holidays and long weekends. Plus, only a small improvement in industrial order books is needed to get industrial production growing again, admittedly from low levels. The highest increase in real wages in more than a decade should also loosen even German consumers\u2019 traditionally very tight wallets eventually. All in all, today\u2019s data once again confirms that Germany is the growth laggard of the eurozone. Caught between cyclical and structural headwinds, there is no easy way out of this long stagnation. Nevertheless, a rebound in the second half of the year is still possible, even though it is highly unlikely that it will be a strong one. Portugal grew by a modest 0.1% in the last quarter, new data shows. Statistics Portugal reports: The contribution of domestic demand to quarter-on-quarter rate of change of GDP became positive in the second quarter, with an increase of investment and a slowdown in private consumption. The contribution of net external demand became negative, with exports of goods and services having a nil rate of change. On an annual basis, Portugal\u2019s economy was 1.5% larger than a year ago. The picture is better in Italy, though, where the economy continues to grow. Italian GDP rose by 0.2% in the April-June quarter, the fourth quarter of growth in a row. Statistics body Istat reports that the services sector grew, while industry, and the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector, dragged on growth. Newsflash: Germany\u2019s economy is back on the brink of recession. Germany\u2019s GDP shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter of this year, new data from statistics body Destatis shows. That\u2019s a blow to Berlin\u2019s government, which has been hit by an ailing train network, the surge in energy prices after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, protests by farmers, weaker demand from China, and a rise in support for far-right politicians. Economists had expected growth of 0.1% in the quarter. The decline in activity was due to a fall in manufacturing and construction investments. Destatis reports that \u201cinvestments in equipment and buildings, adjusted for price, seasonal and calendar effects, in particular decreased\u201d in the last quarter. The drop in GDP in the last quarter follows 0.2% growth in the first quarter of 2024. A technical recession is defined as two quartery contractions in a row. This takes the shine off a decent start to today\u2019s eurozone growth data, with both Spain (+0.8%) and France (+0.3%) beating expectations\u2026.. Here\u2019s our news story on BP\u2019s latest profits: France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno le Maire, has predicted that growth could beat the outgoing government\u2019s forecast this year. He welcomed the better-than-expected 0.3% rise in GDP reported this morning, telling reporters: \u201cWe will probably have growth after all that is better than the 1% forecast in February. \u201cFor two years, France has outperformed; our economic policies work and are giving tangible results.\u201d We flagged earlier that a ship delivery boosted France\u2019s exports in the last quarter. Reuters is now reporting that the vessel in question is the Utopia of the Seas cruise ship, which was delivered to Royal Caribbean. The ship, which cost over \u00a31bn, helped to lift France\u2019s transport equipment exports by +1.8%, and overall exports by 0.6%. The Daily Mail recently took a trip on Utopia of the Seas \u2013 they report it includes five pools, a zip line, an aqua park, a surf simulator, and an on-board train. High street bakery chain Greggs is putting up some of its prices, after its pay bill was pushed up by the rise in the minimum wage this year. Greggs\u2019s CEO Roisin Currie has told the PA news agency that the company has increased the prices of some items on its menu by 5p and 10p in recent weeks, but has kept meal deal prices unchanged. Currie \u2013 who said in March that price rises weren\u2019t planned \u2013 says prices were raised to offset higher pay for its 32,000-strong workforce, having raised salaries earlier this year ahead of the increase in the National Living Wage. She said: \u201cThe biggest inflation cost right now is the increase in the National Living Wage and making sure our employees get the wage increases that are appropriate. \u201cThat puts pressure on the cost increases within the business.\u201d Estate agent Foxtons has reported that this month\u2019s general election has had little impact on customer behaviour or market dynamics. Foxtons says trading in July is in line with expectations, after revenues rose by 11% in the first six months of 2024. Pre-tax profits jumped by almost a quarter, to \u00a37.5m. CEO Guy Gittins says: \u201cThe strong momentum we started the year with has continued, with double-digit revenue and earnings growth and our position as London\u2019s largest Lettings and Sales agency reinforced. \u201cDespite macro headwinds and the election interruption, we continued to outperform the market, delivering strong Sales revenue growth of 28% and market share growth of 30%. Growth was also delivered in Lettings, with a double-digit increase in new business volumes, further bolstered by the acquisitions we made in 2023. Bank CEOs have largely welcomed prime minister Kier Starmer\u2019s government with open arms, cheering the country\u2019s economic trajectory and political stability after years of uncertainty. And the boss of the London-headquartered but emerging markets-focused lender, Standard Chartered, is no exception. Bill Winters told journalists this morning that Labour appeared to be a \u201cserious government\u201d that was supportive of business and ready to tackle fiscal challenges that have dogged the UK economy. He said: The new Labour Government is a serious government and they\u2019ve set out a series of serious statements and platforms, including what the chancellor said yesterday in terms of addressing some of the fiscal challenges that we know are very present in the country. The rhetoric during the election period and in the early days of the government has been supportive of business. I think it\u2019s been tempered by realism about the economic challenges and the fiscal challenges that the UK faces. But I have every confidence that the Chancellor and the rest of the government will pursue their policies in a very thoughtful, open and transparent way. And that\u2019s as much as we could ask. Winters added that he was \u201chappy\u201d to be headquartered in the UK, which he described as having a robust regulatory environment, a \u201cvery stable political environment\u201d and \u201cextraordinarily good rule of law\u201d and corporate governance, adding: \u201cSo there\u2019s certainly nothing that has changed in terms of our views on the attractiveness of the Labour government\u201d. His comments came as the bank raised its earnings outlook, and announced its largest-ever share buyback worth $1.5bn. It sent Standard Chartered\u2019s FTSE 100-listed shares up 5.3% at the start of trading. Shares in drinks giant Diageo have sunk to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, down 8%, after reporting a drop in sales and profits. Diageo, whose brands include Johnnie Walker, Captain Morgan, Guinness, Smirnoff and Baileys, posted a 1.4% drop in reported net sales in the year to the end of June, to $20.3bn. Pre-tax profits dropped to \u00a35.46bn, from \u00a35.64bn a year earlier. CEO Debra Crew told shareholders that the last financial year had been a challenging one for Diageo and the wider industry, due to \u201ccontinued macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility\u201d. Crew added: Fiscal 24 was impacted by materially weaker performance in LAC [the Latin America and Caribbean region]. Excluding LAC, organic net sales grew 1.8%, driven by resilient growth in our Africa, Asia Pacific and Europe regions. This offset the decline in North America, which was attributable to a cautious consumer environment and the impact of lapping inventory replenishment in the prior year. Great Britain was a highlights for Diageo, though \u2013 net sales here grew by 5%, thanks to stronger demand for Guinness \u2013 including the zero-alcohol Guinness 0.0 drink. Diageo\u2019s shares are at a four-year low, hitting levels last seen in March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic forced pubs, bars and restaurants to close. Shares in BP have jumped by 2.6% in early trading, after its profits beat forecasts this morning. It\u2019s the second-highest riser on the FTSE 100 index, after Standard Chartered bank (+4.8%), which announced its largest-ever share buyback programme this morning after a rise in profits. Austria has bucked the trend, though, by reporting no growth in the last quarter: Newsflash: Spain\u2019s economy has also grown faster than expected in the last quarter. Spanish GDP expanded by a pacy 0.8% in Q2, the National Statistics Institute reports, comfortably beating forecasts of 0.5% growth. That matches Spain\u2019s growth in January-March. On an annual basis, Spain\u2019s economy grew 2.9% over the last year. Campaign groups are angered by BP\u2019s latest multi-billion dollar profits. Global Witness has calculated that BP had paid \u201ca staggering\u201d \u00a311.7bn to shareholders since June 2023 \u2013 when the world began a 12-month stint of temperatures 1.5C above the pre-fossil fuel era. After BP reported an underlying profit of $2.76bn this morning, Alice Harrison, head of Fossil Fuel Campaigns at Global Witness, says: \u201cAs the world faces record-breaking heat, most of us are desperate to see urgent action on the climate crisis. Unfortunately, it\u2019s clear that BP couldn\u2019t care less. While millions of us struggle with high temperatures and high bills, BP are raking in billions of profits, paying out massive dividends, and doubling down on dirty new oil and gas projects. Big oil companies like BP know their fossil fuel products are behind more deadly heatwaves, storms, and wildfires around the world, but instead of investing in clean energy, they are continuing to profit from people\u2019s misery. Fossil fuel companies like BP are turning a blind eye to climate breakdown, so now governments must act. Rather than propping up the climate-wrecking fossil fuel industry, we need them to make polluters pay for the damage they have already caused, and steer us towards a cleaner, greener future.\u201d Warm This Winter spokesperson Fiona Waters points out that BP has recently rowed back on some of its green energy plans: \u201cBP\u2019s obscene profits today and the fact they have made \u00a338.4bn since the start of the energy crisis shows they\u2019re not interested in turning off their oil and gas cash cow. They have rolled-back on their green pledges that would mean lower bills, an end to energy price shocks and would also help save the planet.\u201d Chiara Liguori, Oxfam GB\u2019s Senior Climate Justice Policy Advisor, says low-income countries desperately need help to handle the impact of the climate crisis: \u201cIt is inexcusable that BP, one of the world\u2019s most polluting and profitable fossil fuel companies, continues to rake in billions of pounds while low-income countries are in urgent need of funds to tackle the devastating impacts of the climate crisis despite doing the least to cause it. \u201cThe world can no longer afford fossil fuel companies putting short-term profits above people and planet. The costs of inaction are already here with deadly heat waves, wildfires, flooding and drought but it is people living in poverty who are left paying the highest price. On this morning\u2019s growth figures from France, economist Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macroeconomics points out that French food consumption fell in the last quarter, while consumption of gas and electricity, and cars, rose. Philip Jansen, the former chief executive of BT, has been appointed as the new chairman of advertising giant WPP. Jansen, who stood down as chief executive of BT in February after almost five years in the role, will join the board of the FTSE-listed WPP in September and formally take over as chair from January. \u201cPhilip brings a valuable blend of experience, from leading technology and consumer goods companies to transforming large, complex organisations and creating significant value for shareholders,\u201d said Angela Ahrendts, senior independent director at WPP. Jansen, who began his career at Gillette to Ariel maker Procter and Gamble before moving into marketing director roles at Dunlop Slazenger and Telewest, led a BT turnaround strategy that included cutting 55,000 jobs by 2030 and investing \u00a315bn in the nationwide roll out of full fibre broadband and 5G mobile networks. Earlier this month, Jansen, who took home a bumper \u00a33.7m in pay and bonuses in his lat year at the telecoms company, was linked with a private equity backed takeover bid of British pest control firm Rentokil. \u201cTechnology is changing the face of commerce, media and communications, and I am very excited to join a company at the forefront of this change,\u201d said Jansen. Over the first half of this year, though, BP\u2019s profits are lower than a year ago. The oil giant made $5.479bn in January-June, down from $7.552bn in the first six months of 2023. That follows a drop in Q1 \u2013 when earnings shrank to $2.7bn from $5bn a year ago (as we covered in May). In the energy sector, BP has lifted its dividend after beating profit forecasts for the last quarter. BP has reported an underlying profit of $2.756bn for the second quarter of the financial year, up from $2.589bn in the same quarter in 2023, and slightly higher than the $2.723bn it earned in Q1. That beat analyst expectations of $2.6bn. BP said the profit was due to \u201can average\u201d performance in gas marketing and trading, lower refining margins, stronger fuels margins and \u201clower taxation\u201d. It adds: The underlying effective tax rate (ETR)* in the quarter was 33% which reflects the impact of the reassessment of the recognition of deferred tax assets. BP is raising its dividend to eight cents per share, up from 7.27/share. The oil giant has also announced another share buyback, worth $1.75bn, for the last quarter, as it continues to use spare cash to buy back equity. Kate Thomson, BP\u2019s chief financial officer, says: We generated strong operating cash flow in the quarter, which helped reduce net debt to $22.6 billion. Our decision to increase our dividend by 10%, and extend our buyback programme commitment to 4Q 2024, reflects the confidence we have in our performance and outlook for cash generation. We are maintaining a disciplined financial frame and remain committed to growing value and returns for bp. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. It\u2019s eurozone GDP day, when we learn how the countries which share the single currency are faring economically. And the early news is that France\u2019s economic growth was stronger than expected in the second quarter of this year. French GDP expanded by 0.3% in the April-June quarter, new data from statistics body INSEE shows, beating expectations for 0.2% growth. That matches the 0.3% growth recorded across the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy in the first quarter of the year. It suggests France\u2019s economy was stronger than expected this spring \u2013 before Emmanuel Macron stunned Europe by calling snap parliamentary elections last month. INSEE reports that domestic demand \u201cpicked up slightly\u201d, and added to growth. There was also a \u201cslight rebound\u201d in investment (or gross fixed capital formation). Household consumption was stable in the quarter, while foreign trade also made a positive contribution to growth. Exports grew by 0.6%, driven by a rise in transport equipment \u2013 which INSEE attributes to the \u201cdelivery of a new ship\u201d. INSEE has previously predicted that the Olympic Games\u2019 will lift France\u2019s economic growth in the third quarter of this year Economists predict that the wider eurozone also grew in the last quarter, by an estimated 0.2%. We\u2019ll find out if they\u2019re right at 10am, after getting growth figures from Italy, Spain and Germany too.

            "content": "The delivery of the world\u2019s second-largest cruise ship lifted France\u2019s economy in the second quarter, according to official data that also showed Germany heading into a recession. Built in Saint-Nazaire for the cruise ship operator Royal Caribbean, the Utopia of the Seas added \u20ac1bn (\u00a3840m) to French economic output, helping to increase trade growth to 0.6% in the three months to the end of June and gross domestic product to 0.3%. The eurozone grew by 0.3% in the third quarter after a revised rate of 0.3% in the first, prompting many analysts to say that the 20-member euro bloc has turned a corner after flirting with recession in 2023. Spain powered ahead with a 0.8% growth rate in the second quarter, while Italy\u2019s recovery was maintained by a 0.2% rise in GDP. Germany, the largest eurozone economy, slid back into contraction, recording a 0.1% fall in output. Pushpin Singh, a senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research consultancy, said the eurozone growth rate was better than expected by City analysts and \u201csuggests the bloc has turned a corner since the start of the year\u201d. He added: \u201cProspects are likely to improve further throughout the year, driven by recent policy loosening by the European Central Bank and expectations for further interest rate cuts down the line.\u201d Bert Colijn, a senior economist at the Dutch bank ING, was more concerned that German growth would become a significant drag on the eurozone. \u201cGermany remains the weak link in this post-pandemic economy but the rest is not fantastic either. \u201cLeave out Spain and you just have an economy that moves along at a lacklustre growth pace.\u201d France\u2019s economy grew marginally faster than expected and could improve again in the third quarter if the Olympics spur consumer spending, dispelling concerns that deadlock in the French parliament after recent elections would knock the economy off course. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said the economy\u2019s performance in the second quarter and the Paris Games meant growth this year would probably exceed the outgoing government\u2019s 1% forecast. \u201cWe will probably have growth after all that is better than the 1% forecast in February,\u201d Le Maire said. \u201cFor two years, France has outperformed; our economic policies work and are giving tangible results.\u201d He added that the better than expected growth could be positive for the strained budget deficit and France needed to stay focused on reducing spending. Anja Sabine Heimann, an economist at HSBC Germany, said industrial orders were weak and German consumers were reluctant to spend, adding that the risks of a recession were \u201celevated\u201d. The country has suffered almost zero growth over the past two years and avoided a recession only by a whisker. Heimann said many of the ingredients of a slowdown were now in place. \u201cDomestic and foreign industrial orders continue to trend downwards \u2013 highlighting little support from industry in the near-term,\u201d she added. \u201cWith consumer prices nearly one-fifth above 2019 levels, even after recent strong nominal wage growth, German households have not yet recouped their spending power. \u201cConsequently, their spending scope is still somewhat constrained and there is unlikely going to be a large consumer spending spree.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-28T11:00:52Z",
            "content": "Savers are always on the lookout for the best interest rates and the UK seems like a good bet at the moment. In recent months, the pound has climbed in value against the euro and the dollar as economists speculate that UK interest rates will remain at 5.25% for longer than previously expected. While the odds of a cut in borrowing have shortened, with a narrow majority of City analysts expecting a reduction, few outside the Square Mile believe a change is imminent. If anything, Bank officials will send sterling to even greater heights when they signal, as seems likely, that a cut remains some way off. Suren Thiru, economics director of accountancy body the ICAEW, says he still expects the Bank to lower interest rates to 4.75% by the end of the year, but \u201can August rate cut is looking less likely\u201d. Charlie Bean, an economist at the London School of Economics and a former deputy governor of the Bank, says he will be surprised if the cost of borrowing was reduced this week. In March, the Bank\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) said falling inflation and a weak outlook for the economy meant it was on course to lower interest rates. The committee signalled three rate cuts this year and more to come in 2025. Then came figures showing a strong bounce back from last year\u2019s mild recession. According to the latest S&amp;P Global survey of the business sector, manufacturers and services companies are winning new orders and growing in confidence about the outlook for employment and profits. Adding to the sense that the economy was doing fine without lower borrowing costs, official figures for May and June revealed wages growth remained above 5.5% and firms that were laying off workers last year had begun to hire again. The Bank has a mandate from parliament to maintain inflation at about 2% over the longer term. And while the consumer prices index was 2% in May and June, there was concern that wage pressures would reverse the trend. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as fuel and food, is stuck above 3%. Worse, the services inflation figure, which track what businesses charge each, other remains persistently above 5%. Stephen Millard, deputy director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, says: \u201cThe question is whether we are seeing enough evidence to show inflation is going to stay low.\u201d He believes the Bank needs more time to assess the economic situation before beginning to reverse the 14 consecutive rate rises that took place between December 2021 and August last year. Bean says if he was still on the MPC, he would want more evidence that wages were going to fall and that services companies, which have passed on most of their cost increases to customers over the past two years, would stop doing so. The MPC publishes its latest quarterly assessment of the economic outlook on Thursday and is expected to revise upwards its growth forecast for this year and next. A rise from low to moderate growth is welcome news, but is likely to disguise a deteriorating situation in the labour market, which will be characterised by rising unemployment and, about six months from now, falling wages growth. While the overall economy is growing, there are large pockets of industry and the services sector suffering from financial distress, partly as a result of high interest bills. Consumers are also reluctant to spend and businesses are shy of making investment decisions while there is uncertainty about the path of interest rates. Thiru accuses of the Bank of \u201cdithering\u201d when the broad picture shows the UK\u2019s private sector is largely stagnant and desperately in need of lower borrowing costs. The European Central Bank has already cut rates and the US Federal Reserve is poised to follow suit. Thiru is among many analysts who argue that the UK badly needs a boost from lower borrowing costs. \u201cThere is a pressing need to cut rates given the level of stagnation in the economy,\u201d he says. At the last MPC meeting, only two members voted for a cut. With at least four members known to be reluctant to usher in cheaper money, the power falls to governor Andrew Bailey and the other two floating voters. If Bailey joins \u201cthe hawkish four\u201d, judging a further delay necessary, savers will cheer. Those who have accumulated debts will need to wait."

Gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of economic health \u2013 rose 2.8% in three months to June, the commerce department reported on Thursday, ahead of economists\u2019 expectations and up sharply from 1.4% in the first quarter. It comes as the presidential election campaign heightens scrutiny of the US economy. While Joe Biden touted the \u201cstrongest economy in the world\u201d as he announced his withdrawal from the race on Sunday, Donald Trump \u2013 who is running to replace him in the White House \u2013 has accused Biden of weakening the economy. In a statement, Biden said: \u201cWhen I took office, we were in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.

Despite relatively rosy economic figures, nearly three in five Americans wrongly believe the US is in recession, and the majority blame the Biden administration, according to a Harris poll conducted for the Guardian in May. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve scrambled to bring down inflation from its highest level in a generation, raising interest rates to a two-decade high. They are now considering when to start cutting rates, amid early signs that price growth is falling back towards the Fed\u2019s 2% target. \u201cThis is a perfect report for the Fed,\u201d Olu Sonola, head of economic research at Fitch Ratings, said of Thursday\u2019s GDP numbers. \u201cGrowth during the first half of the year is not too hot, inflation continues to cool and the elusive soft landing scenario looks within reach.\u201d Economists had expected GDP growth of about 2% in the second quarter.

            "content": "In season 2 of Sex and the City, Miranda \u2013 one of the main characters having sex in the city \u2013 gets asked out in an elevator. The man who asks her out is a recently divorced dad with an annoying son. Things end poorly. But the episode made Shanae, a 23-year-old Californian and part of the gen Z wave repopularizing the show, feel envious. \u201cI wished I lived in New York during that time,\u201d she told me later. Specifically, when people asked each other out in person. \u201cI guess people just didn\u2019t have social media, so if you saw someone you thought was attractive, you just had to say something,\u201d she says. Much of dating today starts on our phones. In the past decade, online dating has eclipsed other ways of meeting romantic partners. In the US, three in 10 adults have used a dating app, according to the Pew Research Center; in 2022, 45% of Americans who were single and dating used online dating platforms. In the UK, 11% of online adults visited an online dating service in May 2023, according to a report from Ofcom. And yet, like Shanae, many seem to be pining for the pre-dating app era. There have been countless articles, essays and teary viral posts about dating app fatigue. The complaints are legion: there are too many bots, swindlers and harassers; people don\u2019t look like their pictures, can\u2019t carry on a conversation, or ghost you. Users argue that popular profiles are effectively paywalled, and that the abstracting effect of a screen encourages bad behavior and unrealistic expectations \u2013 why waste time getting to know someone who is fine when someone perfect might be mere swipes away? So there\u2019s a growing appetite for alternative modes of dating. Speed dating is making a comeback. The apps themselves are offering opportunities for users to meet IRL. And then, there\u2019s the more extemporaneous way of meeting \u2013 seeing a person you think looks cool and asking them out. But after years of digital courtship, how do people really feel about asking out another human face-to-face? On dating advice forums, some users express discomfort at being asked out in person. Some fret that gen Z has forgotten how to flirt. Others worry about coming off creepy if they approach someone. Even Shanae, who yearns for the more direct, Sex and the City approach, says she would be \u201cweirded out\u201d if someone asked her out in person. \u201cI would probably say no because it\u2019s so uncommon,\u201d she says. The divide seems partly generational. In my informal survey process (texting people and bringing up this topic at parties), I found that millennials were more excited about meeting in person. Claire (a pseudonym) said she asked a guy out about a month ago and that it felt \u201cgreat\u201d. \u201cIt was a delight to go on a date and not be surprised by what somebody looks like or how it feels to physically be in their presence,\u201d she says. She added that she \u201cwill never go back to the apps, no matter how this shakes out\u201d. Christianna, 29, said she\u2019s met the last three people she\u2019s dated in person: one at a house party, another at a concert and another at a queer line dancing event. Several men in their 30s said they barely use the apps and primarily meet people in person. Gen Z, meanwhile, seems more ambivalent about the face-to-face approach, mostly because it\u2019s no longer the norm. Precious, 20, says she would like to be asked out, but agrees that it\u2019s just not common. \u201cI feel like a lot of people have lost the skill to talk to people IRL,\u201d she says. Precious also has concerns about personal safety. \u201cI see a lot of crazy shit on social media,\u201d she says. They also say approaching someone from behind a screen feels less daunting. For the most part, Shanae says, her peers find ways to talk online first: \u201cUsually, when people meet each other, they\u2019ll ask for their Instagram or number. I think Snapchat is a bit outdated now, but that used to be more popular.\u201d Precious says that she has asked out someone in person \u2013 but it was someone she already knew, and who had already expressed interest in her. That our phones have atrophied our social muscles to some degree is no great shock. But Dr Michael Rosenfeld, professor of sociology at Stanford University, says there is a much bigger issue at play. \u201cWe are in a dating recession,\u201d he says. According to Rosenfeld\u2019s data, there are roughly 60 million single adults in the US today, up from 47 million in 2017. Yet, he says, \u201call ways of dating are down\u201d. This includes online dating as well as meeting at bars and restaurants, or through friends or family. He attributes much of this romantic recession to the pandemic, which created new and scary barriers to dating, and stripped away the blitheness and excitement necessary to make dating fun. \u201cWhat could be more damaging to people\u2019s dating and relationship prospects than a fear that any kind of physical intimacy, even just talking to another person face-to-face, could kill you or your grandma?\u201d he says. Rosenfeld is skeptical that people are tired of dating apps specifically. \u201cIn my experience,\u201d he says, \u201csingle people looking for a partner are dissatisfied with all the ways of meeting until the day they find that person who put them into a relationship\u201d. He believes that many people are still recovering from having lost two or three years of dating experience, which has been especially hard on adolescents and young adults. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take them a few years to recover and build up that social experience,\u201d he says. \u201cThey need to be comfortable dating and experiencing.\u201d What is the way out of this dating recession, then? Is it asking people out in person? More apps? Matchmakers? Speed dating? Spells? \u201cI think we have to rely on the friskiness of young people to relight the fire and do what they\u2019re best at,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is to hang out and have fun.\u201d"

The government is filing a classified document with the court, a senior justice department official said on Friday, that will detail additional security concerns about ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok as well as declarations from the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the justice department\u2019s national security division. The department will argue TikTok under Chinese ownership poses a serious national security threat to Americans because of its access to vast personal data of citizens, and will argue China can covertly manipulate information that Americans consume via TikTok. Signed by the US president, Joe Biden, on 24 April, the law gives TikTok and ByteDance until 19 January to separate or face a ban. The White House says it wants to see Chinese-based ownership ended on national security grounds, but not a ban on TikTok. The department is rejecting all of the arguments raised by TikTok \u2013 including that the law violates the first amendment free speech rights of Americans who use the short video app \u2013 saying the law is aimed at addressing national security concerns, not speech, and is aimed at China\u2019s ability to exploit TikTok to access Americans\u2019 sensitive personal information. The government will tell the court that TikTok\u2019s efforts to protect US user data are insufficient. The US court of appeals for the District of Columbia will hold oral arguments on the legal challenge on 16 September, putting the fate of TikTok in the middle of the final weeks of the 2024 presidential election. The Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has joined TikTok and told an interviewer in June he would never support a ban \u2013 despite having signed an executive order threatening to ban it in 2020, when he was president. The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, who is running for president, joined TikTok this week. The law prohibits app stores like Apple and Google from offering TikTok and bars internet hosting services from supporting TikTok unless it is divested by ByteDance. Driven by worries among US lawmakers that China could access data on Americans or spy on them with the app, the measure was passed overwhelmingly in the US Congress. With Reuters"

            "date": "2024-07-28T12:00:54Z",
            "content": "For John Akouri, whose father immigrated from Tripoli, Lebanon, in 1955, there is only one choice for president in November\u2019s election: Donald Trump, despite the Muslim travel ban during his presidency, the felony falsifying business records conviction and the unadulterated drama constantly surrounding him. \u201cAfter almost two decades of wars and watching [the Islamic State] cause devastation in Syria and in Iraq we needed someone to come in and clean things up,\u201d he said of his initial draw to Trump for the 2016 election. \u201cSo, I thought on a foreign policy and national level he was saying the right things. He was a breath of fresh air,\u201d he continued, referencing Trump\u2019s withdrawal of thousands of US troops from Syria in 2019. The former president\u2019s supporters are now looking for more voters like Akouri, increasingly reaching out to Arab Americans in a bid to secure their vote in November\u2019s presidential election. What they are finding is a growing receptiveness, particularly with certain Arab Americans who find appeal in Republicans\u2019 conservatism on social issues such as religion and LGBTQ+ rights \u2013 and despite the GOP\u2019s widespread support for Israel in its war on the Gaza Strip. In June, Akouri was among a group of Michigan Arab American leaders invited to a private gathering of national Republican figures including House speaker Mike Johnson, majority leader Steve Scalise, and the billionaire Lebanese US businessman Massad Boulos. Boulos, whose son, Michael, married Trump\u2019s daughter, Tiffany, in 2022, is leading a new effort to win Trump votes among Arab Americans. \u201cWe plan not only not to vote for [the Democratic candidate] again, as we did in 2020 \u2013 we are now bent on \u2018punishing\u2019 [Democrats for Joe Biden\u2019s] unfettered support of Israel\u2019s genocidal war in Gaza,\u201d said Bishara Bahbah, the founder and national chairman of Arab Americans for Trump. In May, a group of prominent Arab Americans that included Boulos and Bahbah established a political action committee called Arab Americans for a Better America. Bahbah has said that he and other members of the community have been reassured by Boulos, who he describes as Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Arab and Muslim American communities, that a second Trump presidency would \u201cput an immediate end to the war in Gaza\u201d, though he offered no evidence. While Trump has referred to himself as \u201cthe best friend that Israel has ever had\u201d, and in March told Fox News that Israel had to \u201cfinish the problem\u201d, without specifying what that would mean, Bahbah says that he is confident having the former president back in the White House would result in a quick end to the hostilities in Gaza. Those hostilities became a defining issue for Biden before he halted his re-election campaign on 21 July. Trump has also said that \u2013 as president \u2013 he\u2019d ban refugees from Gaza from entering the US. That\u2019s a move with which Bahbah agrees \u2013 but for very different reasons. \u201cIsrael would love to empty historic Palestine from its native Palestinians,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not give Israel the satisfaction of driving out our people from Palestine.\u201d While Arab Americans are often lumped together and viewed as a single voting bloc, that characterization is often rejected by those to whom the term is often apportioned. \u201cArab Americans have common things with the Democrats and common things with Republicans,\u201d said Dr Yahya Basha, a respected physician and leading member of metro Detroit\u2019s Arab American community. \u201cWe have a lot of Middle Eastern Christians, and Muslims,\u201d Basha said. \u201cFor family issues, they lean with Republicans. It\u2019s a very diverse community.\u201d In the 2000 presidential election, which took place before the 9/11 terrorist attacks by al-Qaida in 2001, Republican George Bush won an estimated 45% of the Arab American vote \u2013 and he beat Democratic party candidate Al Gore by a 2 to 1 margin in Dearborn. But the US\u2019s disastrous invasion of Iraq in 2003 changed up those dynamics. In 2020, only about a third of Arab American voters backed Trump nationwide. And Biden reportedly won nearly 70% of the vote in Michigan\u2019s heavily Arab American counties. Michigan is home to about 95,000 registered Chaldean Christian voters, a community of Assyrian Catholics that immigrated from Iraq and which does not always readily identify as Arab. It\u2019s a community that Trump has long courted. Trump lawyer Alina Habba, who scored a coveted spot at the Republican party convention in Milwaukee on Thursday night and spoke of being a \u201cproud first-generation Arab American,\u201d is the daughter of Iraqi Chaldean immigrants. At a campaign rally in 2020, Trump name-checked Michigan\u2019s Chaldeans. And the same year, the former president nominated Hala Jarbou, an Iraq-born Chaldean, to serve as a judge for the western district of Michigan, making Jarbou the first Chaldean American to reach the federal judicial district bench. Despite his overtures to some Arab American groups, in October, Trump suggested that, should he win November\u2019s presidential election, he would introduce \u201cideological screening\u201d for all immigrants. He also said he would expand the controversial Muslim travel ban introduced under his previous administration, which temporarily restricted immigration from seven Muslim-majority states and other countries. For Basha, who immigrated from Syria and today runs a major healthcare facility in Royal Oak, Michigan, the failure of Barack Obama\u2019s White House \u2013 with Biden as vice-president \u2013 to support the Arab Awakenings that roiled the Arab world more than a decade earlier is one reason to now listen to the overtures of Trump\u2019s supporters. Another is that Basha believes the US would drive fear into the west\u2019s enemies under Trump. Without offering evidence, he spoke of how, if Trump were president, he does not believe Russian president Vladimir Putin would have had his military invade Ukraine or become involved in the Syrian civil war as it did with Biden and Obama in the White House, respectively. \u201cIf Putin feared the United States, he would not have done what he did in Syria or Ukraine,\u201d Basha opined. He also said Trump demonstrated strength in Iran when he ordered the January 2020 US drone strike that killed general Qassem Suleimani, the former head of Iran\u2019s Quds Force. Akouri feels that in some ways, Arab Americans have been left out of politics under Biden and his vice-president, Kamala Harris, whom Biden has endorsed to run for the White House in November. Akouri says that when Trump was president, two Arab Americans were chosen to serve in his cabinet \u2013 Mark Esper (former secretary of defense, whose paternal family immigrated from Lebanon) and Alex Azar (ex-secretary of health and human services, whose family also came from Lebanon). Biden, in contrast, has none. Akouri also notes that Biden promised to reopen the Palestinian consulate in Jerusalem several years ago, but so far that hasn\u2019t happened. This year, Michigan Republicans have gone to extra effort to connect with the Arab American community in the state. For instance, during this past Ramadan, leading officials made a three-hour round trip from Grand Rapids to Detroit to be present at an iftar dinner. Arab American leaders say such an effort was unprecedented. \u201cMany of my friends who were solidly blue Democrats are approaching me asking, \u2018How do we support Trump?\u2019\u201d Akouri said. \u201cPeople want change.\u201d"

            "content": "Paul Kiernan struggles to talk about what happened on 10 March 2019. He walked his partner, Joanna Toole, to a taxi, put her bag in the back and kissed her goodbye. He told her he loved her, and asked her to let him know when she landed safely. The message never came. Toole\u2019s flight, Ethiopian Airlines 302, crashed minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa killing all 157 people on board. It was the second fatal disaster involving a Boeing 737 Max jet in less than five months. On 29 October 2018, Lion Air flight 610 crashed minutes after taking off from Jakarta. All 189 people on board died. \u201cFor others, I guess they read it and see it as a business story, or something,\u201d Kiernan said. \u201cBut for us, it\u2019s a very personal thing.\u201d Boeing did what beleaguered companies so often do when they want to repair a battered reputation: ousted its boss, reassured the regulators and attempted to draw a line under the matter. All the while, hundreds of families whose loved ones lost their lives awaited justice. Five years later, and even after this announcement, many feel they are still waiting. The Max disasters seemed to be fading in the public and political arena until this year, when Boeing again came under intense scrutiny after a cabin panel blew off a brand-new 737 Max, minutes after taking off from Portland, Oregon. The incident reignited questions about the aerospace giant\u2019s management, production line and the fundamental safety of its planes. It is \u201cthe luck of God\u201d, according to Kiernan, that a third fatal crash was avoided. As Boeing grappled with another safety crisis and scrambled to reassure alarmed regulators, furious airlines and anxious passengers, the Department of Justice (DoJ) reconsidered a controversial agreement it struck in 2021. The agreement, which was branded a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d by victims\u2019 families, protected Boeing from a criminal conspiracy charge tied to the two Max crashes \u2013 and avoided a trial \u2013 provided the planemaker overhaul its compliance program and pay $2.5bn, including compensation and a criminal fine of $243.6m. \u201cThe families felt like they were completely brushed aside and ignored by the government: the very people they trusted to do the right thing, and hold Boeing to account,\u201d according to Erin Applebaum, attorney at Kreindler &amp; Kreindler, who represents some of those who had loved ones on board the Ethiopian flight, including Kiernan. The justice department signaled it was willing to change course in May, however, when it declared that Boeing had breached the 2021 deal. Its conclusion was welcomed by victims\u2019 families, who demanded that the company be criminally prosecuted, after all. But when officials informed the relatives of their plan late last month, it proved another bitter blow. While Boeing will be charged with fraud, the company was offered a plea agreement by the justice department, again enabling it to avoid trial. Provided the deal is approved by the US district judge Reed O\u2019Connor in Texas, Boeing would have to pay a fine of up to $487.2m, although this may be lowered if the judge takes account of the previous fine; spend \u201cat least\u201d $455m on compliance and safety programs; and work under an independent compliance monitor to scrutinize its actions for three years. \u201cThis sweetheart deal fails to recognize that because of Boeing\u2019s conspiracy, 346 people died,\u201d said Paul Cassell, an attorney representing some of the relatives. \u201cThrough crafty lawyering between Boeing and DoJ, the deadly consequences of Boeing\u2019s crime are being hidden.\u201d Under the agreement, Boeing\u2019s board of directors would also have to meet with the grieving families of those who died. Above all, many of the victims\u2019 relatives want accountability they feel has yet to materialize. Boeing\u2019s public response to January\u2019s panel blowout has only heightened their anger. Kiernan contrasted his struggle to find the words with the \u201cpracticed apology\u201d delivered by Dave Calhoun on Capitol Hill. Before a tense Senate hearing in June, the Boeing CEO turned to relatives of the crash victims and said he was sorry for their \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d losses. \u201cBy the way he\u2019s saying it, you know he doesn\u2019t understand, or that he doesn\u2019t mean it,\u201d said Kiernan. A matter of minutes later, he noted, Calhoun told senators he was \u201cproud of every action\u201d Boeing had taken on safety. In the spring, Brian West, Boeing\u2019s chief financial officer, described how the company had for years prioritized moving planes through factories over getting it done right. \u201cThat\u2019s got to change,\u201d he told a conference. \u201cThe leadership team got it in the immediate aftermath of January 5.\u201d The comment stung Javier de Luis. \u201cI would have thought that they would have \u2018gotten it\u2019 five years ago,\u201d the aerospace engineer told senators in April. His sister, Graziella, was on Ethiopian flight 302. \u201cI was just flabbergasted after I saw that quote,\u201d Javier said. \u201cThe two crashes should have been a notice to clean house, to wipe the slate clean, to figure out how to get back to the company they used to be. It doesn\u2019t seem to have registered five years ago, and honestly, it remains to be seen whether that registers now.\u201d The world \u201cshould not be surprised\u201d by Boeing\u2019s latest crisis, he added. \u201cWe should not be surprised at the door, the mis-drilled holes, the whistleblowers. That is the result of 20 years of focusing on financial performance over safety.\u201d A string of whistleblowers have come forward with allegations of safety and quality issues, and claims they were ignored, marginalized and even threatened for raising the alarm internally. Boeing has insisted some allegations about its 787 Dreamliner and 777 jets are \u201cinaccurate\u201d, and claimed employees have been emboldened in recent months to speak up with safety and quality concerns. Kiernan knows who he trusts. \u201cWhich one do I believe \u2013 all of these whistleblowers that have nothing to gain from any of this, but are stepping out and are saying that there are major problems in the company? Or do I believe this guy [Calhoun] who\u2019s getting paid $33m, a 45% increase in his salary from last year, and that has everything to lose from this thing going wrong? Who is more likely to be lying?\u201d The panel flew off an Alaska Airlines flight in January almost exactly three years after Boeing \u201cpromised to make all of these safety changes\u201d as part of its first agreement with the justice department, Kiernan observed. \u201cAll of those people could have died.\u201d Applebaum, the attorney, could scarcely believe one headline describing the justice department\u2019s \u201cwrenching\u201d decision over whether to prosecute Boeing. \u201cDo you know who has to make a wrenching decision every day? It\u2019s these families \u2013 to make the decision to get out of bed, and keep fighting for the people they lost instead of trying to put things in the past and move on.\u201d While January\u2019s cabin blowout reignited media interest in Boeing, and jolted regulators into action, the relatives have been \u201cbeating this drum\u201d for five long years, Applebaum noted. \u201cDo you know how hard it is to relive the worst day of your life over and over and over? Every time they come to Washington, and every time they come to Texas, and every time they do an interview, they have to relive those days over again. \u201cThey have to hold pictures of the people they lost. I mean, they can\u2019t move on while this is happening. But they\u2019re doing it because it\u2019s so important to them to get justice for their loved ones, and to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen to anybody ever again.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-31T13:00:17Z",
            "content": "Ex-justice department officials and scholars are raising alarms about the US supreme court\u2019s decision to grant absolute immunity to presidents from criminal prosecution for their \u201cofficial acts\u201d, warning it puts them above the law and will embolden Donald Trump\u2019s authoritarian streak should he win the presidency again. The court\u2019s six to three conservative majority decision on 1 July is fueling criticism for its radical enhancement of presidential powers and undercutting parts of the four count federal indictment of Trump over his 2020 election subversion drive. Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 majority opinion in Trump v United States says a president is \u201cabsolutely immune from criminal prosecution for conduct within his exclusive sphere of constitutional authority\u201d, including broadly defined \u201cofficial acts\u201d, but not for \u201cunofficial\u201d criminal acts. Experts say Robert\u2019s expansive view of what constitutes a president\u2019s \u201cofficial acts\u201d, knocks out at least one count of the four federal election subversion charges Trump is facing involving his aggressive prodding of top DoJ officials to endorse his lies that the election was stolen. The ruling is drawing sharp rebukes from DoJ alumni, some of whom are amplifying a stinging dissent by Justice Sonia Sotomayor who wrote that the six-three decision makes presidents \u201ckings\u201d, by creating a \u201claw free zone\u201d. \u201cThe decision will embolden Trump and any other ill-minded president,\u201d Paul Rosenzweig a former federal prosecutor, said. \u201cIt is hard to see how this decision is consistent with our history. \u201cWe had a revolution to get rid of [the] kingly prerogative and the supreme court just reinstituted it. This emboldens any president to indulge his baser instincts. Secure in their ability to avoid criminal responsibility and confident in the supine nature of Congressional impeachment oversight, they will be willing to push to the edge of permissible conduct and beyond.\u201d Other DoJ veterans say the court\u2019s ahistorical ruling will have negative repercussions. The warnings also come after Joe Biden this week called for widespread reforms of the court. \u201cHere they have truly revolutionized the powers of the president to place him above the law \u2013 an idea that had been regarded as anathema to our values until now,\u201d Donald Ayer, the ex-deputy attorney general who served in the George HW Bush administration, said. \u201cIt is almost unbelievable now with Trump as a candidate who has specifically promised to violate the law if he\u2019s elected.\u201d These criticisms are underscored by Roberts\u2019 opinion deeming presidents a \u201cbranch of government \u2026 unlike anyone else\u201d, and stressing the need to ensure that any future president is able to take \u201cbold actions\u201d as an \u201cenergetic, independent executive\u201d. Further, legal experts say the ruling seemed oblivious to Trump\u2019s dangerous threats that if he\u2019s elected again he would seek \u201crevenge\u201d for the federal and state indictments he faces, which Trump has labeled \u201cwitch hunts\u201d, by using the DoJ to prosecute political foes. In June, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform he would \u201cappoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the USA, Joe Biden\u201d. Notably, the decision disallows using evidence from official actions in cases where ex-presidents are prosecuted for strictly private actions. This makes it harder to establish clear motives for some of Trump\u2019s alleged election subversion crimes. Similarly, the court\u2019s slow walking of its ruling until the last day of its term \u2013 after taking about 10 weeks to decide \u2013 failed to provide a distinct line between official and private acts. Now, Tanya Chutkan, the US district court judge, who oversees Trump\u2019s trial on federal election subversion charges that was originally slated to start on 4 March, will have to wrestle with those issues which may wind up again at the supreme court. Scholars and former DoJ officials say the court\u2019s ruling is radical, disregards precedent and opens the door to new abuses by Trump if he wins in November, or other presidents with authoritarian instincts. \u201cOur supreme court is dangerously close to saying Donald Trump\u2019s assault on democracy was legal and constitutional,\u201d said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard government professor and co-author of How Democracies Die. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the most reckless and irresponsible rulings in supreme court history.\u201d Levitsky stressed the ruling comes \u201cat a time when an explicitly authoritarian figure is ahead in the polls. I don\u2019t think of Roberts and the others as authoritarians. But they can\u2019t be that blind to what they\u2019re doing.\u201d In comparison, Levitsky noted that \u201cacross Europe and Latin America there are courts that have set clear limits on the power of authoritarian-leaning governments\u201d, citing Brazilian courts after the defeat of its authoritarian president Jair Bolsonaro. Legal scholars, too, see parts of the ruling as especially worrisome. Daniel Richman, a Columbia law professor and former federal prosecutor, found Roberts\u2019 \u201creference to the president\u2019s power to control criminal investigations and prosecutions particularly troubling, less for its substance but for its timing\u201d. \u201cAlthough since the founding, the president\u2019s power over these matters has been well-established as a formal constitutional matter, the general rule of non-interference has also been well-established and has developed into a strong norm of prosecutorial independence,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile president, Trump certainly eroded those norms to target his enemies and protect his friends. Were he to become president again, I suspect he will rely on Roberts\u2019 language to inflict even greater damage. Certainly his constant talk of \u2018retribution\u2019 seems to promise that.\u201d Such concerns didn\u2019t faze Roberts who chided the three minority justices for adopting \u201ca tone of chilling doom that is wholly disproportionate to what the court actually does today\u201d. Rather than focus on threats posed by Trump\u2019s actions and rhetoric, the Roberts opinion engaged in some tenuous speculation raising the specter that a rogue prosecutor for political reasons might charge an ex-president for \u201cinsufficiently enforcing \u2026 environmental laws\u201d. Trump, who appointed three of the six conservative justices, quickly praised the ruling on his Truth Social platform writing: \u201cI\u2019m proud to be an American.\u201d From a historical perspective, the ruling was blasted by John Dean, the former White House counsel for scandal-tarred Richard Nixon who resigned the presidency in 1974 after the House judiciary committee voted to impeach him for abuse of power and other crimes. Writing in the Atlantic, Dean said the decision \u201cdecriminalizes Nixon\u2019s conduct during the Watergate scandal\u201d and stressed that \u201cNixon\u2019s activities fit right in the sphere that the Court broadly defines as \u2018official\u2019 or \u2018outer perimeter\u2019 behavior.\u201d Looking forward, Sotomayor\u2019s dissent warned the majority ruling \u201cwill have disastrous consequences for the Presidency and for our democracy \u2026 Let the President violate the law, let him exploit the trappings of his office for personal gain, let him use his official power for evil ends.\u201d Ayer too is deeply worried about the fallout from the ruling: \u201cEven more significantly than in the reversal of Roe, the justices here have radically changed the existing law based on their own preferences \u2013 so that the president apparently has no criminal accountability for any exercise of his presidential powers, and it is no longer true that no man is above the law.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-29T15:29:19Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden unveiled a much-anticipated series of sweeping changes to the US supreme court, including the introduction of term limits for justices and a constitutional amendment to remove immunity for crimes committed by a president while in office. The reforms, detailed by the White House on Monday, call for limiting a justice\u2019s term on the court to a maximum of 18 years rather than the current lifetime appointment, as well as a binding, enforceable code of ethics and a constitutional amendment that would in effect reverse a supreme court decision in July granting former presidents broad immunity from prosecution for actions taken while in office, a decision Donald Trump hailed as a \u201cBIG WIN\u201d amid his legal travails. \u201cThis nation was founded on a simple yet profound principle: No one is above the law. Not the president of the United States. Not a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d Biden wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published on Monday morning. The president was expected to officially endorse the changes during remarks on Monday afternoon at the Lyndon B Johnson Presidential Library in Austin, Texas. Biden\u2019s endorsement represents a sharp shift for a president who had until recently resisted calls from within his party to embrace court reform. In the op-ed, Biden described himself as an institutionalist, shaped by his 36 years in the US Senate, where he served as the chair of the judiciary committee which handles supreme court nominations. \u201cI have great respect for our institutions and separation of powers,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cWhat is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public\u2019s confidence in the court\u2019s decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms. We now stand in a breach.\u201d The reforms are unlikely to win approval in the narrowly divided Congress. With fewer than 100 days until the November election, Democrats are hoping to harness outrage among the public about the supreme court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, handing down decisions in recent that eliminated constitutional right to an abortion and greatly reduced the power of executive agencies. \u201cThere is a clear crisis of confidence facing the supreme court as its fairness has been called into question after numerous ethics scandals and decision after decision overturning long-standing precedent,\u201d said Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic nominee for president. \u201cThese popular reforms will help to restore confidence in the court, strengthen our democracy, and ensure no one is above the law.\u201d Public confidence in the court has slipped to historic lows in recent years. According to a 2023 Gallup survey, nearly six in 10 Americans disapproved of the way the supreme court was handling its job. Biden called for a \u201cno one is above the law\u201d amendment to the constitution, which would make clear that no president is entitled to immunity from prosecution by virtue of having served in the White House. Biden also said justices\u2019 terms should be limited to 18 years, under a system where a new justice would be appointed to the supreme court by the serving president every two years. The president also called for stricter, enforceable rules on conduct which would require justices to disclose gifts, refrain from political activity, and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial interest. Last week Justice Elena Kagan called for the court to strengthen the ethics code it introduced in 2023 by adding a way to enforce it. That code was introduced after a spate of scandals involving rightwing justices on the court: Clarence Thomas was found to have accepted vacations and travel from a Republican mega-donor, while Samuel Alito flew on a private jet owned by an influential billionaire on the way to a fishing trip. Though surveys indicate support for term limits and an ethics code, both would require Congressional approval. On Monday, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, called the plan a \u201cdangerous gambit\u201d and declared the proposed measures \u201cdead on arrival\u201d. Meanwhile, the changes would require 60 votes to pass in the Senate, where Democrats hold 51 seats. \u201cPresident Biden\u2019s proposal to radically overhaul the US Supreme Court would tilt the balance of power and erode not only the rule of law, but the American people\u2019s faith in our system of justice,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. He also accused Democrats of attempting to \u201cdelegitimize the supreme court\u201d because they disagree with the decisions handed down by its conservative majority. A constitutional amendment on presidential immunity is even more aspirational, requiring two-thirds support from both chambers of Congress or approval through a convention called by two-thirds of the states, followed by ratification by roughly three-fourths of state legislatures. Groups pushing for reform embraced Biden\u2019s proposal. \u201cAction is critical,\u201d said Maggie Jo Buchanan, the managing director of Demand Justice. \u201cWe look forward to working to enact these, and all needed reforms, as quickly as possible in order to ensure that our courts work to protect the rights and well-being of every person in this country.\u201d"

But the debate is in danger of being dominated by a false dichotomy: between first past the post and proportional representation. This is unhelpful, not least because PR is not going to happen \u2013 not with a Labour government that FPTP has blessed with such a luxurious majority. The choice is not between FPTP and PR. As I learned as a member of the Jenkins committee on electoral reform 25 years ago, there are as many electoral systems as there are apples on a tree. If you want to soften the adverse affects of FPTP, you could go for the alternative vote, where electors choose the candidates in order of preference, with their votes redistributed if their first choice candidate is eliminated. This gets rid of the complexities of tactical voting. More radically, you can choose a system where most MPs are chosen by FPTP, but in addition there is a top-up list for those voters who are left underrepresented by FPTP. The committee, as it happened, went for a variant of the latter with a small number of top-up candidates chosen for individual counties. This had the main virtue of FPTP \u2013 that most governments would probably get a majority or a near majority. It would also have the main virtue of PR \u2013 that voters for parties whose support is evenly spread around the country, such as the Greens, would at last get a fairer share of representatives in parliament.

            "content": "Kamala Harris added her voice on Tuesday to mounting calls for policing reforms following the killing of Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old Black woman who was shot in her home by an Illinois sheriff\u2019s deputy earlier this month. \u201cSonya Massey deserved to be safe,\u201d the vice-president said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cAfter she called the police for help, she was tragically killed in her own home at the hands of a responding officer sworn to protect and serve.\u201d Harris, who is all but certain to lead Democrats into November\u2019s presidential election, said she and her husband, prospective first gentleman Doug Emhoff, \u201csend strength and prayers to Sonya\u2019s family and friends, and we join them in grieving her senseless death\u201d. Harris also said that their thoughts were with \u201ccommunities across our nation whose calls for help are often met with suspicion, distrust and even violence\u201d. On Monday, a 36-minute police body-camera video of the fatal shooting was publicly released. It showed two Sangamon county sheriff\u2019s deputies responding to Massey\u2019s home after midnight on 6 July after she called 911 to report a possible \u201cprowler\u201d at her home in Springfield. Once inside the home, Sean Grayson, a deputy who has since been charged with three counts of first-degree murder, and another deputy spoke with Massey. Spotting a pot of boiling water on Massey\u2019s stove, Grayson ordered her to remove it. But when Massey moved toward the stove, the interaction quickly escalated. As deputies backed away from Massey, she asked: \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d to which one of the deputies replied: \u201cAway from your hot steaming water.\u201d Massey, who has been identified as a paranoid-schizophrenic by her daughter, then said: \u201cAway from the hot steaming water? Oh, I\u2019ll rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\u201d Grayson is heard responding: \u201cYou better fucking not or I swear to God I\u2019ll fucking shoot you in the f**king face.\u201d He then draws his firearm and points it at her, as Massey ducks with her hands up and says: \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the video shows. \u201cDrop the fucking pot!\u201d both deputies yell, before Grayson fires three shots. One deputy says \u201cshots fired\u201d and calls for emergency medical services. \u201cNah, head shot dude, she\u2019s done,\u201d Grayson is heard saying. He has been fired and is currently being held without bond. In her statement, Harris said that \u201cthe disturbing footage released yesterday confirms what we know from the lived experiences of so many \u2013 we have much work to do to ensure that our justice system fully lives up to its name.\u201d On Monday, Joe Biden called on Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a wide-ranging police reform bill that was drafted in 2020 while Harris was senator for California. A year later, the bill passed in Congress but stalled in the Senate. Harris, who is anticipated to make racial justice a part of her presidential-run platform, said she joined with Biden in commending the \u201cswift action\u201d of the Illinois attorney\u2019s office and in calling on Congress to pass the George Floyd policing legislation, \u201ca bill that I coauthored in the Senate\u201d. \u201cIn this moment,\u201d Harris added, \u201cin honor of Sonya\u2019s memory and the memory of so many more whose names we may never know, we must come together to achieve meaningful reforms that advance the safety of all communities.\u201d"

            "content": "Expanding opportunities for working-class children by broadening the school curriculum to include more sport, drama, art and music alongside core academic subjects will be top priorities for the Labour government, the new education secretary says today. In her first newspaper interview since being appointed to the cabinet by Keir Starmer, Bridget Phillipson insists her aim is to \u201cbreak the link between background and success\u201d, and to ensure every child has the same level of opportunity, regardless of their parents\u2019 means. Phillipson, one of several cabinet ministers to have risen to the top of government from working-class families \u2013 in her case via state schools in the north-east \u2013 told the Observer: \u201cI know that in my own life I defied the odds and I want those opportunities for every child. \u201cI want this department to be the department of opportunity for all children regardless of background \u2013 that the family you are born into, the town that you are from, doesn\u2019t determine what you go on to achieve.\u201d She said it was working-class children \u201cwho most need a brilliant education\u201d from the state, because their parents cannot afford to send them to private schools or buy them expensive tuition outside their state schools. Phillipson reiterated Labour\u2019s pledge to remove tax breaks for private schools, so that it could pay for new teachers in the state sector. Her comments come as the government faces growing pressure from its own MPs and charities to show it is prepared to help the very poorest in society by scrapping the controversial two-child limit on state benefits introduced by the Tory government. The policy, which would cost about \u00a31.7bn or 0.14% of total government spending to ditch, according to the Child Poverty Action Group, is blamed for plunging hundreds of thousands of children in larger families into poverty, worsening the class divide. Phillipson, who was appointed last week by Starmer to co-chair a taskforce on child poverty with the work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, refused to commit to ending the two-child limit, but insisted ending child poverty was one of the main reasons she had come into politics. She said all arms of government were directed at addressing child poverty through delivery of policies such as free breakfast clubs in schools, more housing and addressing economic insecurity. Before what could be the first rebellion of Starmer\u2019s premiership this week, when the Scottish National party will trigger a vote on the two-child limit in the Commons, Phillipson refused to guarantee that it would be abolished. But she said the new taskforce would look at the two-child limit and the effect it has had on increasing child poverty as part of its work. \u201cOur review will look at all of the ways that we can make sure that there are fewer children growing up in poverty,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will look at all aspects of policy including education, social security, housing. It will look at all of the drivers.\u201d Last night Rosie Duffield, the Labour MP for Canterbury, increased pressure on Starmer from the backbenches, describing the cap as a \u201cheinous piece of legislation\u201d. Writing in the Sunday Times, she said: \u201cThe Labour party needs to recognise that this is an issue of social cleansing, an anti-feminist and unequal piece of legislation, and scrap it in line with our previous party position since its conception.\u201d The Child Poverty Action Group\u2019s chief executive, Alison Garnham, said: \u201cWith child poverty at a record high, it is welcome that government has committed to a bold and ambitious child poverty strategy. But there will be no way to deliver on that without abolishing the two-child limit, and the longer it remains in place an ever-increasing number of kids will be affected. The next budget is the obvious and necessary moment to scrap the policy and all eyes will be on government to see its next steps towards making life better for the 4.3 million kids living in poverty.\u201d On Friday Phillipson announced a review of the national curriculum, which she believes should be widened to include more emphasis on subjects restricted or cut back by the Tories. \u201cSadly at the moment too many working-class kids are being shut out of opportunities to play sport, to get involved in music and drama and creative subjects, and I believe we can bring that together. That is what parents want and what I want.\u201d Phillipson promised to deliver \u201cthe biggest transformation in education that we have seen for a generation\u201d, with emphasis on the crucial early years of children\u2019s development. In the short term this will mean extending help for children who have difficulties with language, and delivering 3,000 more nursery places in primary schools. The new education secretary admitted Labour\u2019s general election campaign had at times been defensive and cautious because the prize of victory was too big to put at risk. \u201cWe were all terrified about screwing it all up,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause there was such a weight of responsibility.\u201d An Opinium poll for today\u2019s Observer shows a dramatic leap in Keir Starmer\u2019s personal ratings since he became prime minister. When the number of those who disapprove of his performance was subtracted from those who approve, Starmer\u2019s rating stood at +19, compared with \u20131 in the last poll taken before the election. Former prime minister Rishi Sunak has also seen his ratings climb after the Tories\u2019 catastrophic defeat. It is at \u201322 having been as low as \u201338 before the election. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey has enjoyed a lift with his ratings at +8 compared with \u20132 in the final pre-election poll."

            "date": "2024-07-30T14:00:11Z",
            "content": "After losing her son to gun violence, Shaundelle Brooks knew she had to do something big. Brooks\u2019 son, Akilah DaSilva, was killed in a mass shooting at a Nashville Waffle House in 2018 that left four dead and two wounded. His death launched Brooks into advocacy. While still mourning, Brooks fought for gun reform at the Tennessee legislature. Testifying in front of lawmakers, she evoked DaSilva in her demands for more restrictive gun laws. \u201cI realized quickly that I had lost my child, but didn\u2019t want to lose any more children or see another mom go through what I\u2019ve been through,\u201d she said. \u201cI learned to channel my grief into action.\u201d While Brooks felt empowered as an organizer, she also faced real challenges. Lawmakers shut down her proposals. Gun owners harassed her, claiming that if DaSilva had been carrying a gun, he would have been able to protect himself. Brooks would leave the statehouse in tears, heartbroken by the lack of accountability she witnessed. \u201cI thought: \u2018I have to do more than what I\u2019m doing. I have to find ways to get through,\u2019\u201d Brooks said. So in February, Brooks announced her bid for a seat in the Tennessee state House of Representatives. On 1 August, she\u2019ll be vying in the Democratic primary. Propelled by and fed up with what they see as a lack of progress when it comes to addressing America\u2019s epidemic of gun violence, many activists like Brooks, who have felt the effects of gun violence first hand, are embracing a new tactic: running for elected office. For political organizers, this group represents a promising new cohort, whose members, if elected, may finally move the needle on gun reform. \u201cThere is a new wave of activists-turned-candidates, particularly among women and mothers, who are no longer willing to stand by,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cHow can we not think about our kids?\u201d *** Pinpointing the moments that led them to run for office comes easily to these candidates. For Emily Busch, who is running for a US congressional seat in Michigan, it was the November 2021 mass shooting at Oxford high school, where her son was a freshman, that propelled her to action. The event left four dead and seven injured. \u201cMy son ran for his life with 1,700 other kids,\u201d Busch said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that you never ever want to experience, which is why I\u2019m running.\u201d At a school board meeting held shortly after, Busch was appalled that masking received more attention than gun safety. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until the third or fourth person got up to speak that they actually addressed that four children had just been murdered two weeks before,\u201d she recalled. Busch began organizing, urging neighbors and fellow parents to support gun reform legislation like universal background checks and safe storage requirements. She was then asked to run for state representative in a heavily Republican district in 2022 \u2013 but lost. Undeterred, her eyes are now set on Washington, as she readies for the Democratic primary on 6 August. For those who have lost loved ones, championing gun reform has served as a way to carry grief. Rhonda Hart, who is running in Texas\u2019 14th congressional district, \u201cwent full tilt into volunteer and activism\u201d after her daughter, Kimberly Vaughan, was killed. Vaughan was one of 10 people murdered in the 2018 Santa Fe high school shooting. \u201cYou can sit here and be sad 24/7 and twiddle your thumbs, or, for me, I needed to get up and do something,\u201d Hart said. So, in 2019, Hart began working on a bill in her daughter\u2019s name that focused on preventative measures, such as safe storage and gun safety educational programs. The US House passed the Kimberly Vaughan Firearm Safe Storage Act last session, but Hart, a disabled veteran, was surprised by the amount of resistance she faced along the way. Her own congressman, Republican Randy Weber \u2013 now her opponent \u2013 refused to support it, even after she and other advocates traveled to DC to meet with him after the 2022 Uvalde mass shooting. Weber has a record of supporting pro-gun legislation, including bills that would increase police presence at schools and allow gun owners to carry a firearm on school grounds. An enraged Hart knew then and there that if she wanted effective legislation to be passed, she would have to do it herself. \u201cIf anybody has an axe to grind and a story to tell, it\u2019s me,\u201d Hart said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want these people to go uncontested.\u201d *** Brooks says gun violence survivors and their loved ones are in a unique position to convince others of the pressing need for reform. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be more passionate because we\u2019ve experienced it,\u201d she said, emphasizing the growing need for \u201cleaders who understand this issue on a personal level and who can bring authentic, passionate advocacy to the legislative process\u201d. That same vision is driving progressive groups to find more candidates who are willing to run for office on gun violence platforms. Last February, nearly 50 new candidates gathered in Las Vegas with Demand a Seat, an initiative to train gun safety advocates to run for office and work on campaigns offered by advocacy organization Everytown for Gun Safety. At the four-day boot camp, participants received mentorship from veteran politicians, training in the fundamentals of campaign building and guidance in how to effectively elevate a gun safety platform. The program capitalizes on a trend that gun safety advocates have been witnessing for several years. \u201cGun safety is actually good politics now, it\u2019s not just good policy,\u201d said Moms Demand Action\u2019s executive director, Angela Ferrell-Zabala. \u201cFolks [are] choosing to run and win on gun safety.\u201d Since 2021, more than 250 volunteers from Everytown alone have been elected into office, and the organization has a 58%-win rate, said Ferrell-Zabala. And while a decade ago, half of congressional Democrats had A-ratings from the National Rifle Association (NRA), today, that number is zero. Down-ballot races are especially important to this electoral strategy, with almost 95% of the program\u2019s volunteers-turned-candidates running in state and local elections. Participants in the program \u2013 and gun reform candidates more broadly \u2013 share more than their experiences as gun safety advocates and gun violence survivors. They are also connected by gender and parenthood: the cohort is \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d made up of women and mothers, explained Ferrell-Zabala. \u201cWe intentionally aim to empower people who may never have thought they could run for office, like women and mothers \u2013 especially Black and brown survivors of gun violence,\u201d she said. Members of the so-called \u201cmass shooting generation\u201d themselves are also entering races, taking inspiration from young progressives who won seats during the 2022 midterms. Most notable is Florida\u2019s Maxwell Frost, the first member of gen Z to be elected to US Congress after serving as national organizing director for March for Our Lives, the gun control advocacy group founded after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, in 2018. Earlier this year, 19-year-old Navian Scarlett, a vocal gun safety organizer just two years out of high school, ran for school board in Frederick county, Maryland. While she lost her bid in April, Scarlett\u2019s candidacy offered insight into how violence prevention policy is felt by youth on the ground. As an adolescent, she felt the ripples of gun violence on numerous occasions: first when members of her high school basketball team were shot and wounded on campus, and again when shots rang out at a prom after-party that her brother attended. Days after that party, her school ran an active shooter drill that she says traumatized the student body. \u201cI witnessed students having breakdowns. Some of them were curled up with their knees to their chests rocking back and forth and crying,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as effective for students as [school leaders] may have thought.\u201d For her, that disconnect speaks to the importance of having youth voices in the movement. *** In Nashville, Brooks says that when the the race catches up with her, she remembers why she is running in the first place. She\u2019s proposing expanding background checks, striking down laws that allow gun owners carry without permits and elevating red flag laws, something she said could have saved her son. \u201cAkilah could have been here,\u201d she said, explaining that the man who killed him had a mental illness and had previously had his gun taken away. \u201cThe journey has been transformative. It has shown me that from immense loss can come a powerful drive to create a better world.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-17T19:27:25Z",
            "content": "Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law scholar who has advised Joe Biden as the president prepares to back dramatic reforms to the US supreme court, has criticized the court\u2019s ultraconservative justices for acting as a \u201ccenter of self-aggrandizement\u201d threatening the checks and balances on which the US has historically depended. In comments to the Guardian a day after news broke of Biden\u2019s plans to endorse major changes to the country\u2019s most powerful court, the Harvard Law School professor said the justices were out of step with basic constitutional premises. The court had \u201creached the point of assuming ultimate power over our entire legal and political system\u201d. He accused the supermajority of \u201cessentially destroying the framework of checks and balances\u201d that had maintained an uneasy equilibrium \u201cover the course of our history\u201d. On Monday the Washington Post revealed Biden\u2019s intention to support major plans to restrain the supreme court. The ideas reportedly being considered include term limits for justices, an ethics code armed with real teeth, as well as a possible constitutional amendment to overturn the justices\u2019 highly controversial decision to grant Donald Trump broad presidential immunity from criminal prosecution. The Post reported that in preparation for an announcement, expected within weeks, Biden had turned to Tribe as an authority on constitutional law. They discussed Tribe\u2019s blueprint for supreme court reform set out in a Guardian opinion article earlier this month, the newspaper said. Tribe declined on Tuesday to talk about their conversations. But he shared with the Guardian his personal thoughts about what must be done to correct some of the court\u2019s most flagrant abuses. He gave a withering assessment of the hard-right supermajority that controls the court following Trump\u2019s three appointments. The six conservative justices had discarded the judicial self-constraint that the framers of the constitution had intended for the \u201cleast dangerous\u201d branch of government. The court had overturned \u201cdecades of precedent for no better reason than that it now has the votes to do so\u201d. Tribe blamed the supreme court for systematically rolling back the past half-century of progress on voting and human rights. He listed advances that had been laid waste in recent years, including: \u201cReproductive liberty, gender equality, sexual autonomy, racial justice, police abuse and government accountability.\u201d He warned there could be no quick fix for the court\u2019s \u201coutlandish excesses\u201d. But he sketched reforms that, over time, could put the court back on the rails. One of Tribe\u2019s most favored changes appears to fall outside Biden\u2019s plans: enlarging the nine-person court with four extra seats to offset Trump\u2019s \u201cstacking of the court\u201d. Tribe embraced enlarging the court in his role as a member of the commission formed by Biden in 2021 looking into supreme court reform. But he told the Guardian that, speaking only for himself, he would be \u201cloth to urge the president at this point to reverse his deep-rooted opposition to court expansion\u201d. The Harvard professor said that there was growing consensus behind term limits for justices. Presidents should make two appointments to the supreme court in each four-year White House term. New appointments would then serve for 18 years as active justices, followed by lifetime service as a retired judge who could fill in for a recused colleague when required. Such a two-tier system has thrived in lower courts for more than a century. Tribe said the shift to a term-limited system \u2013 which would be prospective only, not affecting the current nine justices \u2013 could be legislated by Congress. \u201cNo other apex court in the world entrusts remotely so much power to so few individuals for so long \u2013 essentially for life,\u201d he said. Biden also appears minded to endorse an enforceable ethics code, to replace the voluntary guidelines which the court adopted last November amid mounting criticism of Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Tribe said he believed such a reform was now urgently needed, as a way to save the court \u201cfrom its own worst tendencies\u201d. The law professor called the present system untenable. With no outside mechanism for enforcing ethical rules, such as disclosure of gifts from rich patrons, the court was in effect \u201cexpected to police itself\u201d. That remained the case even when justices appeared \u201cprone to get away with as much exploitation of their prestigious positions as they can\u201d. Like term limits, an enforceable ethics code would require congressional legislation. Both would be a tough proposition given the present partisan divide and the need for 60 Senate votes under the filibuster. Such reforms would look easy compared with the other major reform being considered by Biden relating to presidential immunity. This would require a constitutional amendment that would have to negotiate the convoluted rules for changing the US constitution (two-thirds support in both chambers of Congress, or two-thirds of the states in a convention, followed by ratification by three-quarters of state legislatures). What was now needed, Tribe said, was a \u201cNo Person Is Above the Law\u201d amendment which would insert language into the constitution making clear that nobody \u2013 including the president \u2013 could claim immunity from criminal prosecution by virtue of their office. Tribe said that he also wanted to see an amendment constraining a president\u2019s pardon power so that a lawless incumbent of the Oval Office could not pardon themselves or anyone else whom they encouraged to commit crimes on their behalf. Taken together, these changes would return to the supreme court the public respect it had lost, Tribe said. They would correct the court\u2019s partisan majority which now acts as though it were \u201call-knowing and essentially infallible, paying virtually no heed to the opinions of its predecessors or of the American people\u201d."

            "content": "The Republican former senator James Inhofe, a climate denier who once brought a snowball to the chamber floor in a stunt attempting to disprove global warming, died on Tuesday at the age of 89. Inhofe resigned as senator for Oklahoma in January 2023, suffering long-term effects of Covid-19. Elected in 1994, his time as the state\u2019s longest-serving senator was notable for his ultra-conservative positions on numerous issues, including calling the climate emergency \u201cthe greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people\u201d. His death was announced on Tuesday in a family statement, which stated the cause was a stroke. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, a Republican ally during Inhofe\u2019s chairing of the Senate\u2019s armed forces and environment committees, was among the first to pay tribute. \u201cThe people he served, a group much larger than the proud residents of the Sooner state, were better for it,\u201d a statement from McConnell\u2019s office said. \u201cJim\u2019s diligent stewardship of massive infrastructure projects transformed life across the heartland. His relentless advocacy for American energy dominance unlocked new prosperity across the country. And his laser focus on growing and modernizing the US military strengthened the security of the entire free world.\u201d As perhaps the most vocal Senate Republican climate denier, he called the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a \u201cGestapo bureaucracy\u201d, opposed efforts by Democrats to cap greenhouse gas emissions, and pursued lucrative tax incentives for domestic oil and gas producers. His widely ridiculed snowball stunt came in 2015, during a rambling speech in which he claimed climate conditions on Earth were the work of a supreme being, and attempted to discredit a Nasa report that found that 2014 was the hottest year recorded globally to date. \u201cMy point is, God\u2019s still up there,\u201d Inhofe said during a 2012 interview during promotion for his book focusing on global warming as \u201ca conspiracy\u201d. \u201cThe arrogance of people to think that we, human beings, would be able to change what He is doing in the climate is, to me, outrageous.\u201d According to Open Secrets, between 1989 and 2022, Inhofe received campaign donations worth almost $4m from energy producers. As chair of the Senate armed services committee, Inhofe was an advocate for a large US military presence on the world stage, and supported sizable defense spending budgets to pay for it. Following the scandal over US service members photographed abusing prisoners at Iraq\u2019s Abu Ghraib prison in 2004, Inhofe said he \u201cwas more outraged at the outrage\u201d than the torture of the inmates. Inhofe was born on 17 November 1934 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a city he served as mayor from 1978 to 1984. He was elected to the state house in 1966, aged 31, and state senate three years later. His career in Washington DC began in 1986 as a US congressman for Oklahoma\u2019s first district, and he won re-election three times before stepping up to the Senate in 1994 when Republican incumbent David Boren became president of the University of Oklahoma. A keen aviator, Inhofe married his wife, Kay, in 1959, and they had four children. A son, Perry, died in a solo airplane crash in 2013. Reuters contributed reporting"

            "date": "2024-07-31T15:00:22Z",
            "content": "Most gardeners love nothing more than the chance to chat about what has worked and what hasn\u2019t in their flowerbeds this year. So the latest callout from the Royal Horticultural Society will be music to their ears; the RHS is asking for information about what flowered for ages, what loved being waterlogged and how plants did on the occasional hot day, so that they can draw up a plan for how to keep gardening alive during the climate crisis. Heatwaves and a drought in 2022 and the wettest ever 18 months between 2023 and 2024 have meant that gardens are either roasting or turning into bogs. Plants that have been a taken-for-granted fixture in flowerbeds for centuries may have to be swapped for new species, or made more resilient to the climate crisis. The RHS has already noticed that Gladiolus and Iris are thriving in the warmer summers, but others, including Hebe and Pittosporum, are being negatively affected by the increasing amount of heavy rainfall, extreme temperatures and unpredictable frosts. Working with the Universities of Sheffield and Reading, the charity is trying to understand what is growing well or struggling, how different gardeners are coping with the climate crisis and which maintenance habits are working and which are not. The research will also build up a picture of which plants are thriving in different parts of the UK, and which are not. The research will help to inform recommendations for how to manage and protect plant diversity across the country. Information will also be used to identify which plants might thrive in the UK in the future. The RHS is already swapping out some plants for others in its own gardens. Heat-loving banana and lotus have flowered at RHS Garden Harlow Carr in Yorkshire, which was not thought to be possible a decade ago. Lagerstroemia, originating from south-east Asia, has been trialled successfully at RHS Garden Wisley in Surrey, which also would not have been likely before the UK\u2019s climate began to change. RHS Garden Hyde Hall near Chelmsford in Essex has managed to grow cacti due to the warming conditions. The plants have overwintered without any protection and have withstood the very wet spring. Hyde Hall are also now able to grow euphorbia mellifera outside in their Australia garden, which normally overwinters indoors in their historic glasshouse. Gardeners are having to duplicate and move some plants from Wisley, which is in one of the drier, hotter parts of the country. Heather and Hepatica plants from the national collections also based at Wisley are being grown at other sites because of vulnerability to drought and the potential for loss. Tim Upson, RHS\u2019s director of gardens and horticulture, said: \u201cIn a garden, plant diversity is everything and our extensive collections provide some insight into what grows well from year to year and from place to place. Tapping into the observations of the UK\u2019s 30 million gardeners, many of whom will have noticed longer-lasting blooms or waterlogged perennials, will help us in better understanding how our gardens need to evolve to ensure they continue to provide the environmental and health and wellbeing benefits we currently enjoy, 10, 20 and 30 years from now.\u201d Gardeners can contribute to the survey, which runs until 15 October, here. \u2022 The picture on this article was changed on 1 August 2024 because an earlier image showed a succulent rather than a cactus."

            "date": "2024-07-08T02:00:23Z",
            "content": "The world has baked for 12 consecutive months in temperatures 1.5C (2.7F) greater than their average before the fossil fuel era, new data shows. Temperatures between July 2023 and June 2024 were the highest on record, scientists found, creating a year-long stretch in which the Earth was 1.64C hotter than in preindustrial times. The findings do not mean world leaders have already failed to honour their promises to stop the planet heating 1.5C by the end of the century \u2013 a target that is measured in decadal averages rather than single years \u2013 but that scorching heat will have exposed more people to violent weather. A sustained rise in temperatures above this level also increases the risk of uncertain but catastrophic tipping points. Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which analysed the data, said the results were not a statistical oddity but a \u201clarge and continuing shift\u201d in the climate. \u201cEven if this specific streak of extremes ends at some point, we are bound to see new records being broken as the climate continues to warm,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is inevitable unless we stop adding greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and the oceans.\u201d Copernicus, a scientific organisation that belongs to the EU\u2019s space programme, uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations to track key climate metrics. It found June 2024 was hotter than any other June on record and was the 12th month in a row with temperatures 1.5C greater than their average between 1850 and 1900. Because temperatures in some months had \u201crelatively small margins\u201d above 1.5C, the scientists said, datasets from other climate agencies may not confirm the 12-month temperature streak. Whether pumped out the chimney of a coal-burning power plant or ejected from the exhaust pipe of a passenger plane, each carbon molecule clogging the Earth\u2019s atmosphere traps heat and warps weather. The hotter the planet gets, the less people and ecosystems can adapt. \u201cThis is not good news at all,\u201d said Aditi Mukherji, a director at research institute CGIAR and co-author of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. \u201cWe know that extreme events increase with every increment of global warming \u2013 and at 1.5C, we witnessed some of the hottest extremes this year.\u201d Some ecosystems are more vulnerable than others. In its latest review of the science, the IPCC found that 1.5C of warming will kill off 70-90% of tropical coral reefs, while warming of 2C will wipe them out almost entirely. A Guardian survey of hundreds of IPCC authors this year found three-quarters expect the planet to heat by at least 2.5C by 2100, with about half of the scientists expecting temperatures above 3C. The increments sound small but can mean the difference between widespread human suffering and \u201csemi-dystopian\u201d futures. Mukherji compared 1C of global heating to a mild fever and 1.5C a medium-to-high grade fever. \u201cNow imagine a human body with [that] temperature for years. Will that person function normally any more?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s currently our Earth system,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is a crisis.\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Gemenne, an IPCC author and director of the Hugo Observatory at the University of Li\u00e8ge, said the climate crisis is not a binary issue. \u201cIt is not 1.5C or death \u2013 every 0.1C matters a great deal because we\u2019re talking about global average temperatures, which translate into massive temperature gaps locally.\u201d Even in a best-case scenario, he said, people need to prepare for a warmer world and \u201cbeef up\u201d response plans. \u201cAdaptation is not an admission that our current efforts are useless.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-09T13:00:29Z",
            "content": "Mark Hertsgaard and Kyle Pope of Covering Climate Now (CCNow) hail the winners of their organization\u2019s annual global climate journalism awards, and here describe some lessons they have taken from the more than 1,250 entries. If you live in France, you can watch global warming happening live on the evening news \u2013 and it\u2019s a hit with viewers The woman behind this landmark innovation is Audrey Cerdan of France Televisions, France\u2019s public broadcaster. As announced on Tuesday, Cerdan is one of three winners of a 2024 journalist of the year award by our organization, Covering Climate Now, which for the past five years has been helping hundreds of newsrooms worldwide cover the climate crisis. At a time when extreme heat is leaving hundreds dead from Mexico to India, when a category 5 hurricane is \u201cflattening\u201d entire islands in the Caribbean, and when US supreme court rulings are granting corporate polluters and their political patrons unprecedented legal protections, Cerdan and 50 additional Covering Climate Now Journalism Award winners are a stirring antidote to climate despair. Their work demonstrates that telling the climate story well helps the public understand not only that the world is on fire, but also how to put the fire out. In March 2023, France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions stopped including a traditional weather report in its 8pm newscast and replaced it with a weather-climate report: in French, a Journal M\u00e9t\u00e9o-Climat. Viewers of the new weather-climate report still saw maps dotted with numbers depicting the day\u2019s high and low temperatures in Paris, Marseilles and other cities in France. The on-camera presenter, Ana\u00efs Baydemir, still told them whether it would rain or shine tomorrow. But now, that basic weather news was communicated in the context of climate change. From the opening seconds of the report, stretching across the bottom of the screen was a row of blue-and-white digits. The digits depicted, to an exactitude of eight decimal points, how much hotter France was now compared to a century ago, before humans\u2019 burning of large amounts of coal, oil and gas began trapping excessive heat in the atmosphere. The night Journal M\u00e9t\u00e9o-Climat premiered, on 13 March 2023, the dashboard registered 1.18749861C above the pre-industrial level. After 37 seconds, the dashboard\u2019s last digit clicked up a notch to 1.18749862C; then, after two minutes and 28 seconds, another notch to 1.18749873C. That was global warming, happening and presented in real time \u2013 an explicit rebuttal of the lie that climate change is somehow a hoax. Within weeks, France Televisions\u2019 ratings for that part of its evening news began climbing, according to the network. Cerdan, who spearheaded the innovation, credits the ratings boost partly to the fact that most of the show\u2019s segments included a viewer\u2019s question about climate change, answered by a scientist. (For example: will France still have four seasons under climate change? Yes, but they will be hotter.) In short, if journalists tell the climate story in a creative way that genuinely helps people make sense of the world around them, people will watch or read that news. Members of frontline communities often tell the climate story best For this year\u2019s awards, CCNow\u2019s judges evaluated more than 1,250 entries from every corner of the globe. The reporting in the places most affected by the climate crisis stood out for its urgency, its compassion, and its commitment to telling personal stories. For example, a second CCNow journalist of the year winner is Tristan Ahtone, a member of the Kiowa Tribe who wrote a blistering expose for Grist about US universities profiting from oil and gas production on stolen Indigenous lands. A third \u201cJournalist of the Year\u201d is Rachel Ramirez, a climate reporter for CNN, whose upbringing in the Northern Marianas Islands informs her reporting on climate change\u2019s disproportionate impact on women and girls and other issues of climate justice. Climate crisis is a crime story The planet didn\u2019t overheat itself. Some of the best climate reporting highlights who the bad guys are, what they\u2019re trying to get away with, and how they can be held accountable. The UK-based Centre for Climate Reporting, in collaboration with the BBC, revealed how Sultan Al Jaber \u2013 the CEO of the United Arab Emirates\u2019 state-run oil company and president of the COP28 UN climate summit \u2013 used the latter role to lobby for oil and gas. Agence France-Presse reported that the global consultant firm McKinsey &amp; Company, which publicly supports climate action, nevertheless used Cop28 to promote its clients\u2019 plans to continue oil and gas production for years to come. There is incredible bravery in some of the best climate reporting Sometimes that bravery means angering sources who then no longer talk to you, or stirring up the trolls on social media. Other times, bravery takes a much more serious form. In June 2022, the British journalist Dom Phillips and Indigenous activist Bruno Pereira were killed in the Vale do Javari, the second-largest indigenous area in Brazil, apparently in retaliation for their journalism exposing the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. In 2023, 16 news outlets around the world, led by the Paris-based network Forbidden Stories, joined together to continue Phillips\u2019s and Pereira\u2019s work. Forbidden Stories\u2019 investigations revealed how illegal industry and organized crime continue to stymie protection of the Amazon, whose health is vital to its Indigenous inhabitants and the world\u2019s climate future. There is good news on the climate beat Solar, wind, storage batteries and other pillars of the green economy are growing by leaps and bounds, as mainstream business media have reported. But less publicized are solutions emerging from the grassroots, including in some of the most climate-vulnerable locations on earth. IndiaSpend, a digital outlet in India, won its award by profiling a frontline community\u2019s ingenious efforts to cope with drought, illustrating how local knowledge and involvement can be key to successful climate change adaptation. Covering Climate Now has long maintained that better news coverage is itself an essential climate solution. Without it, there simply won\u2019t be the mass awareness and public pressure to drive governments, business, and society as a whole to make the rapid, far-reaching changes required to preserve a liveable planet. The 51 winners of 2024 Covering Climate Now Journalism awards are certainly doing their part. We hope their example inspires fellow journalists everywhere to do the same. Mark Hertsgaard is executive director and co-founder of Covering Climate Now, a global journalism collaboration committed to more and better coverage of the climate story, and the Nation magazine\u2019s environment correspondent Kyle Pope is executive director of strategic initiatives and co-founder of Covering Climate Now, and a former editor and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review"

            "date": "2024-07-23T04:00:04Z",
            "content": "The northern hemisphere has had a large number of intense wildfires in the first half of summer, carrying vast amounts of smoke across Eurasia and North America. Research by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (Cams) showed large-scale and intense wildfires had been developing throughout the late spring and summer, with numerous fires burning in Canada, Alaska and eastern Russia. These wildfires are generally caused by long periods of hot and dry conditions in areas of high vegetation, and have resulted in increased carbon and smoke emissions. Smoke has also begun to extend much farther north, reaching across the Arctic Ocean to the high Arctic. Emissions from Russian wildfires in June and July were higher than for the preceding two years, and fires in the region of Amur Oblast led to the estimated release of 17.2 megatonnes of carbon for the two-month period, the highest in 22 years. Canada has also had some of its highest totals on record, with total carbon emissions of 11.1 megatonnes and 13.2 megatonnes for British Columbia and Alberta respectively across June and July. Mark Parrington, a senior scientist at Cams, said: \u201cWe have been closely monitoring boreal fires in Cams over a number of years and noted some particularly extreme wildfire emissions and atmospheric impacts during that time, particularly in Canada, eastern Russia and the Arctic.\u201d Increasing wildfire activity is a major factor in these rising smoke emissions. Guillermo Rein, a professor of fire science in the department of mechanical engineering at Imperial College London, said: \u201cIn recent years the fire season is expanding, starting earlier and lasting longer. But it\u2019s not just the fact the wildfire season is widening, it\u2019s also that the intensity of wildfire season is becoming unprecedented.\u201d According to official Russian figures, the number of wildfires this year has decreased by 30% compared with the previous year, but the area burnt is 50% larger, highlighting the intensity of the wildfires. These increased smoke emissions have led to very high levels of air pollution and can lead to various health complications. \u201cIn the short term, the most obvious complications are to respiratory systems, proving particularly dangerous for people that have underlying conditions like asthma, heart disease and lung disease,\u201d says Dr Marina Romanello, a research fellow at the UCL Institute for Global Health. \u201cHowever, as the incidence of wildfires is increasing, people are being repeatedly exposed to acute levels of wildfire related air pollution, increasing their risk of developing chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease and cancer.\u201d Concentrations of very small harmful particulates in the smoke, known as PM2.5, have been found to be several times higher than the World Health Organization\u2019s recommended 24-hour mean exposure threshold across a widespread region that includes eastern Mongolia, north-eastern China and northern Japan. Romanello said: \u201cPM2.5 particles are \u2026 able to go very deep into the lungs, past the lung-blood barrier, and enter the bloodstream, making these high levels of smoke emissions particularly concerning.\u201d While 2024\u2019s estimated wildfire carbon emissions are very high so far, the season is still well short of the catastrophic 2023 season, when much of North America experienced record high levels of PM2.5. Rein said: \u201cWe don\u2019t think this season is going to break any records but it\u2019s a strange situation where we\u2019ve been seeing the worst in the records for so long that when you see it you think things are OK, when actually it\u2019s still pretty bad.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-21T17:30:11Z",
            "content": "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s legislative plan to green Britain has arrived not a moment too soon. Last week, the government\u2019s advisers warned that only a third of the carbon reductions required by law would be met under existing plans. The Climate Change Committee said that, for the first time since setting itself carbon-reduction targets, the UK is not on track to meet its goal. It is supposed to reduce emissions in 2030 by 68% compared with 1990 levels, to meet net zero by 2050. The UK should, says the committee, now be in a phase of rapid investment and delivery. But the Tories\u2019 turn against net zero policies has meant little progress on the rollout of low-carbon technology. That is why Labour\u2019s king\u2019s speech, which put the environment at the centre of policymaking, was so welcome. Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, won the argument that the urgency of the climate emergency needed a bigger, more interventionist state. Greening the economy solely through market mechanisms has not unleashed its potential. To change this, Labour confirmed bills to set up state-owned Great British Energy; to modernise the crown estate so the seabed is investment-ready for offshore renewables; and to reform planning so that key infrastructure such as grid upgrades don\u2019t get tied up in arguments with local communities. Mr Miliband had promised the kind of expansion in clean energy that the committee says is now required. That means much more solar and wind energy secured by GB Energy \u201cwhich will own, manage and operate clean power projects\u201d. There are some valid doubts about whether its limited budget \u2013 \u00a38.3bn over five years \u2013 will mean GB Energy is just a co-investor in schemes rather than a serious rival to private investors. Without well-funded state intervention, the Common Wealth thinktank points out, the government would end up with the current market model of \u201cuncoordinated [investment], replete with barriers and delays and vulnerable to policy errors\u201d. Mr Miliband won\u2019t deliver a green transition \u2013 and good jobs \u2013 by sticking to the status quo. He also has to meet two challenges. One is electoral: the Green party came second to Labour in dozens of seats and will capitalise on any failure to make good on the party\u2019s climate pledges. The second is that without sufficient action, acts of civil disobedience are likely to spread. To demonstrate its superiority, GB Energy must translate low-cost clean energy generation into lower bills. This means probably adopting a policy like the New Economics Foundation\u2019s \u201cenergy guarantee\u201d to protect essential needs, reduce bills and cut carbon emissions. This scheme seeks to provide energy for free, or at low cost, while applying a premium to higher levels of usage \u2013 which would incentivise investment in energy efficiency and renewables. Political parties can modify perceptions by creating a plausible narrative that alters the way the public construes salient issues. Thoughtful critics say that may not be enough. Helen Thompson, professor of political economy at Cambridge University, remains sceptical of Labour\u2019s raised expectations and about the utility of its goal to fully decarbonise electricity generation by 2030. She argues that without the state spending large sums of money to electrify the country\u2019s heating and transportation systems with green energy, Britain would still be exposed to inflationary oil and gas price shocks. That is an argument \u2013 as Mr Miliband would say \u2013 to go big, not go small, when it comes to the climate emergency."

            "date": "2024-07-30T09:00:04Z",
            "content": "Global emissions of methane, a powerful planet-heating gas, are \u201crising rapidly\u201d at the fastest rate in decades, requiring immediate action to help avert a dangerous escalation in the climate crisis, a new study has warned. Methane emissions are responsible for half of the global heating already experienced, have been climbing significantly since around 2006 and will continue to grow throughout the rest of the 2020s unless new steps are taken to curb this pollution, concludes the new paper. The research is authored by more than a dozen scientists from around the world and published on Tuesday. While the world \u201cquite rightly\u201d has focused on carbon dioxide as the primary driver of rising global temperatures, states the paper published in Frontiers in Science, little has been done to address methane, despite it having 80 times the warming power of CO2 in the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere. \u201cThe growth rate of methane is accelerating, which is worrisome,\u201d said Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at Duke University and lead author of the study. \u201cIt was quite flat until around 20 years ago and just in the last few years we\u2019ve had this huge dump of methane. It\u2019s made the job of tackling anthropogenic warming all the more challenging.\u201d So far in the 2020s, global methane emissions have typically been about 30m tons higher each year than during last decade, with annual records in methane emissions broken in 2021 and again in 2022. While there is no single clear reason for this, scientists point to a number of factors. Methane comes from the drilling and processing of oil, gas and coal, with a boom in fracking causing a rash of new gas projects this century. The gas is also emitted from livestock, primarily through the burps of cows, and increased animal agriculture, as well as to a lesser degree expanding rice production, has contributed. Meanwhile, rising global heat is causing the faster decomposition of organic matter in wetlands, thereby releasing more methane. In 2021, the US and the European Union spearheaded a new initiative, called the Global Methane Pledge, which commits to a collective 30% cut in methane emissions by 2030. This scheme has now expanded to 155 countries yet only 13% of emissions are covered by current policies and only 2% of global climate finance goes towards cutting methane emissions, according to the new paper. \u201cI don\u2019t think that target is necessarily out of reach yet but we have to redouble our efforts to get there,\u201d said Shindell. \u201cCountries are leading with oil and gas regulations, but it\u2019s a challenge to get rules in place, and when it comes to livestock that\u2019s just unpalatable to most governments, they just don\u2019t want to touch it.\u201d But while CO2 can linger in the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years, unless removed, methane is a far shorter-lived threat. If all methane emissions were cut immediately, 90% of accumulated methane would have left the atmosphere within 30 years, providing a swifter way to reduce global heating than focusing just on carbon dioxide. \u201cMethane is the strongest lever we can quickly pull to reduce warming between now and 2050,\u201d said Shindell. \u201cThere\u2019s just such a rapid response to cutting it. We\u2019ve already seen the planet warm so much that if we are to avoid worse impacts we have to reduce methane. Reducing CO2 will protect our grandchildren \u2013 reducing methane will protect us now.\u201d The new paper outlines a number of actions countries should take, including better linking CO2 and methane reduction efforts and identifying the most effective methane cutting projects under certain circumstances. Last week, the White House held a summit on cutting \u201csuper-pollutants\u201d that include methane. The summit outlined measures such as improved monitoring, including the placement of methane sensors on commercial United Airlines aircraft, and a mixture of philanthropic and regulatory programs aimed at getting emissions down. \u201cIt\u2019s been somewhat ignored until now but methane really is at the point of the spear in climate protection,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, who was a climate adviser to Bill Clinton\u2019s White House. \u201cIf we want to limit near-term temperature rises, we need to get methane under control.\u201d"

The latest problem for Labi, whose company has produced Ghana\u2019s first electric bicycle, is trying to persuade the country\u2019s delivery riders to swap their ageing petrol motorcycles for herWahu ebikes. The idea for Wahu, which means \u201chorse\u201d in the Dagbani language of northern Ghana, came to her when she moved to the region\u2019s capital, Tamale, in 2015, and heard neighbours complain about how expensive and unreliable transport was. Looking at ways to overcome this, Labi began buying secondhand push bikes during the pandemic in 2020 and turning them into ebikes by adding conversion kits bought from Amazon. Four years later, the company has now designed and developed its own licensed ebike and technology platform for delivery riders, opened an assembly plant in Ghana\u2019s capital, Accra, and is about to close on an $8m investment round. There are now 300 delivery riders using Wahu ebikes in Accra, as the company looks to take advantage of Africa\u2019s growing \u201clast mile delivery\u201d market \u2013 the final link in the supply chain to customers \u2013 a sector that is set to be worth $2.3bn by 2030. A further 2,000 users are expected to join within the next year. Labi has plans to eventually produce 50,000 Wahu ebikes a year and to introduce them across Africa, making huge carbon reductions in the process. \u201cThe average age of a vehicle in Ghana is 14 years,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know there are going to be a lot of Amazon-type businesses needing last-mile mobility \u2013 do we really want them to be 14-year-old petrol vehicles?\u201d The serene surroundings of the Landmark hotel in London\u2019s Marylebone are a far cry from the hectic roads of central Accra. But Labi, who is in the UK as part of a trade mission to promote investment in Ghana\u2019s small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) sector, talks enthusiastically about how the Wahu model works. Riders buy the bikes under a payment plan of between 18 and 24 months, working out at up to $25 a week. Once on board, they are automatically put on Wahu\u2019s fleet platform, which has partnerships with companies such as Bolt, so they have a consistent pipeline of work. Wahu ebikes are also cheap to run, costing just $13.60 a month to power, compared with $250 for a petrol vehicle. Alongside the physical ebikes, Wahu has also developed a technology platform. This not only tracks the bikes \u2013 no Wahu has been stolen yet \u2013 but measures carbon savings from journeys, which can then be packaged and turned into carbon credits. Its app also gives riders a safety score, with Wahu able to remotely shut down a bike if a user is deemed to be riding too dangerously. Some may see this level of monitoring and control as an overreach by the company, but Labi says the data is essential to making the product affordable. \u201cIt comes back to risk \u2013 things in our [Ghanaian] market are expensive because there\u2019s no data,\u201d she says. \u201cGiving digital footprints opens people up to more affordable rates. That is why we can offer cheaper insurance \u2013 that is why we can offer them payment plans.\u201d Labi was born and brought up in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, by Ghanaian parents who came to the UK for work in the 1970s. However, despite having lived for most of the past 15 years in Ghana, she didn\u2019t visit the country until she was 14. \u201cYou only really got sent to Ghana if you were badly behaved,\u201d she jokes. There was little chance of this happening to Labi. Head girl at Queenswood school in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, she then studied economics at Southampton University, where she began an internship at accounting firm EY and was subsequently hired. She initially envisioned a career in finance for herself, until the global crash of 2008. During this period, she saw colleagues who had invested huge amounts in shares in failed banks lose everything. It proved a defining moment for her. Disillusioned, she visited Ghana for Christmas in 2008 and didn\u2019t return to the UK for another six years. Labi, who describes herself as a serial impact entrepreneur, has since headed several social enterprises across Ghana, enterprises that tackled some of the country\u2019s biggest challenges. This includes a period at Global Mamas, an organisation that provided financial training and business support for more than 300 female-led SMEs in the country. She also founded Sama Sama, a Tamale-based sanitisation social enterprise providing low-income families the opportunity to buy toilets on an affordable payment plan. It operates across eight regions in Ghana and has served more than 100,000 people. Meanwhile, running Wahu Mobility, which she officially launched in 2022 alongside co-founder Toni Heigl, has not come without its own difficulties, which included being heavily pregnant during her initial talks with investors. Labi, who has three children, says that trying to raise funds while expecting was a challenge and made her question whether people would invest. However, she believes the Ghanaian culture is a lot more conducive to helping mothers succeed in business, with family and extended family often willing to look after children. \u201cIf you look at those leading Ghana\u2019s banks, or those heading telecoms companies, many are women who have children,\u201d she adds. Wahu is about to complete on the $8m it has targeted for its first round of funding, with the money to be channelled into delivering more of the bikes at its assembly plant, which opened in February. After a series of prototypes, the company has landed on a bike with front and back suspension so it can withstand Ghana\u2019s potholes, as well as a thumb throttle to ensure quick acceleration at its busy junctions \u2013 something Labi says is essential in the country. It also includes two batteries with a combined range of 87 miles (140km) that can be recharged at home and do not require expensive charging infrastructure. Labi believes that this vehicle design, made with African conditions in mind, could set it apart from the cheaper ebikes being imported into the continent, and prove popular with delivery riders in other African countries. Wahu has already begun trialling ebikes in Lom\u00e9, the capital of neighbouring Togo, and is also targeting Zambia, Senegal, Morocco and Nigeria. It similarly has sights on becoming the first company to develop Ghana\u2019s first four-wheel electric vehicle, with the business set to unveil its first four-wheeler for Africa in the coming months. But whether two-wheelers or four-wheelers, it is clear that Labi thinks the model works, and the benefits for Africa\u2019s environment and economy could be huge too. Problem-solver Labi wants to be front and centre of the solution. \u201cOur strategy is to become the sustainable fleet of Africa,\u201d she says.

            "date": "2024-07-15T20:43:27Z",
            "content": "Emissions of two of the most potent greenhouse gases have substantially increased in China over the last decade, a study has found. Perfluorocarbons are used in the manufacturing processes for flat-panel TVs and semiconductors, or as by-products from aluminium smelting. They are far more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than CO2, and can persist in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere for thousands of years, unlike CO2 which can persist for up to 200 years. A research team led by Minde An at Massachusetts Institute of Technology examined the emissions of two specific perfluorocarbons, tetrafluoromethane and hexafluoroethane, both with atmospheric lifetimes of 50,000 and 10,000 years respectively. By analysing atmospheric observations in nine cities across China from 2011 to 2021, they found that both gases exhibited an increase of 78% in emissions in China and, by 2020, represented 64-66% of global emissions for tetrafluoromethane and hexafluoroethane. However, while levels of fluorocarbon emissions are increasing at an alarming rate, CO2 still accounts for about 76% of total greenhouse gas emissions. The increase in emissions from China was sufficient to account for the global emission increases over that same period, suggesting that China is the dominant driver in tetrafluoromethane and hexafluoroethane release into the atmosphere globally. The emissions were found to mainly originate from the less populated industrial zones in the western regions of China, and are thought to be due to the role of perfluorocarbons in the aluminium industry. China is the world\u2019s largest producer and exporter of aluminium, with the country\u2019s production reaching a record-high output of 41.5m tonnes last year. With the rapid expansion of China\u2019s aluminium and semiconductor industries, these ongoing high levels of fluorocarbon emissions could pose a particular threat to China\u2019s carbon neutrality goal and global climate mitigation. The country is aiming to achieve \u201cpeak carbon\u201d emission by 2030 and become \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d by 2060. The authors suggest that with technological innovation and incorporation of the aluminium industry into the carbon market, or a national carbon trading scheme allowing emitters to buy or sell emission credits, it is possible that these rising levels could be reduced. While being a significant source of CO2 emissions, aluminium production is also essential in the energy transition from fossil fuels to cleaner renewable energy sources by helping produce many low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, electric vehicles and wind turbines. Organisations such as the World Economic Forum argue that the aluminium industry must act now to find a balance between ensuring efficient production alongside mitigating the industry\u2019s negative impacts on the climate."

            "content": "The cybersecurity firm Wiz has turned down a $23bn (\u00a318bn) takeover bid from Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, spurning what would have been the tech company\u2019s biggest ever acquisition and seeking a stock market flotation instead. Alphabet had been in talks with Wiz, founded by alumni of Israel\u2019s cyberintelligence unit, as it seeks to catch rivals Microsoft and Amazon in the hyper-competitive cloud services market. Wiz offers a service that scans the data on cloud storage providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure for security risks. The New York-based startup, which has the backing of investors including Sequoia Capital and Thrive Capital, was most recently valued at $12bn. \u201cWhile we are flattered by offers we have received, we have chosen to continue on our path to building Wiz,\u201d the company told employees in an internal email. In a memo the Wiz chief executive, Assaf Rappaport, outlined the next targets of reaching $1bn in annual recurring revenue and an initial public offering. \u201cSaying no to such humbling offers is tough, but with our exceptional team, I feel confident in making that choice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market validation we have experienced following this news only reinforces our goal \u2013 creating a platform that both security and development teams love.\u201d Neither Wiz nor Google had released official statements about the termination of the deal talks by Tuesday morning. There has been scepticism that the deal would pass regulatory scrutiny, as regulators seek to toughen their stance against big tech dealmaking. In December, Adobe abandoned its $20bn takeover of its smaller rival Figma, after European and UK regulators raised concerns that it would eliminate competition in the product design software market. Last month, the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission struck a deal on investigations into the main protagonists in the AI market, including Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia. Wiz, founded in 2020, was valued at $12bn during a funding round in May that drew investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Thrive. Wiz says 40% of Fortune 100 companies are its customers, and that it is making $350m in annual recurring revenue."

            "content": "Here is a wrap-up of the day\u2019s key events: George Kurtz, the founder and chief executive of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, has said the company is \u201cdeeply sorry for impact that we\u2019ve caused to customers\u201d after a flawed software update prompted a global IT outage. Kurtz told NBC\u2019s Today Show in the US that the problem was down to a bug in a single update. \u201cWe identified this very quickly and remediated the issue,\u201d he said, adding that CrowdStrike was now \u201cworking with each and every customer to make sure that we can bring them back online\u201d. Businesses including banks, airlines, railways, telecommunications companies, TV and radio broadcasters, and supermarkets have been taken offline after blue screen of death error screens were seen on Windows workstations across the globe. Users on the subreddit for the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike reported issues in India, the United States and New Zealand. GP surgeries across England hit by the outage have said the issue \u201cwill have a big effect\u201d. GP practices said they are unable to access patient records or book appointments due to the major global IT outage. Surgeries took to social media to report they cannot access the EMIS Web system. It is understood that NHS hospitals are currently unaffected by the outage. Airports in Germany have also been hit by the outages, causing major delays at the start of school holidays for many regions. Air traffic at Berlin\u2019s BER came to a complete halt in the early morning hours of Friday, according to public broadcaster RBB due to a server breakdown that triggered several emergency systems to kick in. The dollar rose and stock markets fell in jittery trading today, as the global IT outage unnerved investors. The group that runs the London Stock Exchange suffered an outage that affected user access to some of its products, and Refinitiv was down earlier. By around midday in Europe, the company said its services had been restored. China\u2019s flag carrier Air China and other major airlines have not been affected by the global tech outage that disrupted operations in multiple industries on Friday due to the use of different systems, according to state media CGTN. Meanwhile, Wizz Air said it has suspended its fees for airport check-in as its online systems are unavailable due to the IT outage. New York City\u2019s subway system agency, the MTA, said that \u201csome MTA customer information systems are temporarily offline due to a worldwide technical outage\u201d. It added that train and bus service is unaffected. The White House said that it was \u201clooking into\u201d the outage, according to a spokesperson speaking to CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of the incident and are looking into the issue and impacts,\u201d the full statement said. The outage also disrupted the European energy market\u2019s liquidity and affected hedge funds and other traders. Traders were unable to access their computers and contact brokers, although the issues are gradually being resolved. Customers across the UK have faced issues with trying to pay using their cards, with some shops putting up \u201ccash only\u201d signs on their doors. A spokesman for the supermarket Morrisons said there were some \u201cisolated incidents\u201d with payment systems this morning, which have now been resolved. Waitrose said it was taking contactless payments largely as normal, as well as still processing payments by chip and pin and cash. Elon Musk claimed in a post on X that he had \u201cdeleted Crowdstrike from all our systems\u201d. He did not offer any proof for this claim or specify what it entailed. Russian officials said that their country\u2019s vital systems had not suffered outages anywhere near as bad as those in the UK, US, and much of the rest of the world. Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine began in early 2022, Microsoft and other software providers have drawn down their operations in the country. CrowdStrike saw it share value fall precipitously after disclosing that its software update was the source of the debilitating global outage. At midday, CRWD had dropped by 12%. The company\u2019s update interacted negatively with computers running Microsoft Windows. CrowdStrike\u2019s CEO, George Kurtz, issued a statement on the company\u2019s website late on Friday afternoon, in which he apologized once again for the outage and said that CrowdStrike was working to help restore systems. \u201cNothing is more important to me than the trust and confidence that our customers and partners have put into CrowdStrike,\u201d Kurtz said. \u201cAs we resolve this incident, you have my commitment to provide full transparency on how this occurred and steps we\u2019re taking to prevent anything like this from happening again.\u201d With the end of the global IT outage nowhere near in sight, various industries have been affected including travel, health and financial systems. The Guardian\u2019s Julia Kollewe, Kat Lay, Gwyn Topham and Simon Goodley report: Airlines, railways, hospitals, television stations, sports clubs and financial systems were among the sectors hit by the technology glitches, prompting national governments to convene emergency meetings and stock markets to fall. The US\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration shut down operations due to the outage. There were about 110,000 commercial flights scheduled worldwide on Friday. By 6am ET, nearly 1,400 of them had been cancelled, according to reports \u2026 Patients had important hospital appointments cancelled at the last minute in countries including the UK, Germany and Israel \u2013 with the Royal Surrey NHS trust, in the south of England, declaring a critical incident and cancelling radiotherapy appointments scheduled for Friday morning. Doctors\u2019 surgeries in the UK said they were unable to access patient records or book appointments, as they reported via social media that they were unable to access online systems\u2026 For the full story, click here: The Guardian\u2019s voting rights reporter Sam Levine is currently at Milwaukee airport where he has been waiting in line for up to an hour. According to Levine, who is returning from a reporting trip to the Republican national convention earlier this week, several passengers in line have also come from the convention, with some donning Donald Trump memorabilia. Levine also reports: \u201cThe Delta customer service hold music has become the soundtrack to this line.\u201d The global technology outage was the result of a botched software update from the American cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. Founded in 2011, the company has become one of the largest cybersecurity providers for businesses around the world. CrowdStrike\u2019s CEO George Kurtz has apologized for the outage but stated it could be \u201csome time\u201d before the affected systems fully recover. Read an explainer on the company here: Elon Musk claimed in a post on X that he had \u201cdeleted Crowdstrike from all our systems\u201d. He did not offer any proof for this claim or specify what it entailed. The mayor of Portland, Oregon, has issued an emergency declaration as a result of the global IT outage. In a statement on Friday, the office of the Portland mayor, Ted Wheeler, said: Mayor Ted Wheeler issued an Emergency Declaration on July 19, 2024 due to a problem with Microsoft Operating Systems using Crowdstrike Endpoint Protection. The issue is causing computer outages and affecting multiple systems globally, impacting City servers in the City Data Centers as well as employee computers, with impacts to VPN connection and Single Sign On (SSO) to cloud services. City services that rely on Microsoft Operating Systems using Crowdstrike Endpoint Protection, including certain essential City service providers, are impacted by the problem including emergency communications. Blake Montgomery Mexico City Toronto New York City Budapest Hong Kong London Gatwick Milwaukee, site of the Republican National Convention Atlanta Singapore Kuala Lumpur Along with several other court systems across the country including Maryland\u2019s, Manhattan\u2019s court systems have also been hit by the global IT outage: Russian officials said Thursday that their country\u2019s vital systems had not suffered outages anywhere near as bad as those in the UK, US, and much of the rest of the world. Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine began in early 2022, Microsoft and other software providers have drawn down their operations in the country. In retaliation, the Kremlin has gone after them, speeding up the decreases in their operations, their departures, and the isolation of Russian digital systems. Russia\u2019s digital ministry issued a statement that read: The situation once again highlights the significance of foreign software substitution. Mikhail Klimarev of the the Internet Protection Society, a non-governmental organization, told Reuters: CrowdStrike has not provided any services in Russia since February 2022. The American cybersecurity company Crowdstrike saw it share value fall precipitously after disclosing that its software update was the source of the debilitating global outage. At midday, CRWD had dropped by 12%. The company\u2019s update interacted negatively with computers running Microsoft Windows. In an interview with CNBC, Crowdstrike\u2019s CEO said the timeline for fixing the issues \u201ccould be hours, could be a bit longer\u201d and said many customers would need to manually reboot their machines. Microsoft issued guidance saying that some customers had seen success by rebooting their PCs as many as 15 times. Some 143 flights scheduled to depart UK airports on Friday have been cancelled amid the global IT outage, aviation analytics company Cirium said. This equates to 4.6% of scheduled departures, the firm said, while 142 flights due to land in the UK were cancelled. Globally 4,295 flights - or 3.9% of those scheduled - have been cancelled. Around two-thirds of GP practices in Northern Ireland have been impacted by the global IT outage, PA Media has reported. Practices which have been affected are being asked to revert to \u201cestablished paper-based processes where necessary\u201d and are operating on an emergency appointment basis only. Meanwhile, the airline Ryanair said it had been forced to cancel a small number of flights and there has been disruption to vehicle testing services in the Republic of Ireland. New York state regulators urged banks and companies to be on high-alert amid the global tech outage on Friday, saying it is monitoring institutions and market events and working with other state and federal regulators. The New York State Department of Financial Services \u201creminds all regulated entities to be vigilant at this time. Threat actors have been known to launch attacks during periods when IT and security staff are distracted, especially through social engineering,\u201d it said in a statement. The department supervises more than 3,000 financial institutions in New York, including banks and trust companies. A global tech outage is creating challenges for doctors and hospitals in Canada and the government is working to support health infrastructure, the country\u2019s health minister Mark Holland said. \u201cWe are aware of the IT outage and the challenges it is creating for health care professionals and hospitals. We are actively monitoring the situation and working with partners across Canada to support our health infrastructure,\u201d Holland said in a statement. Heathrow airport has said it is \u201cworking hard\u201d to get passengers \u201con their way\u201d following a major global IT outage. \u201cWe continue to work with our airport colleagues to minimise the impact of the global IT outage on passenger journeys. \u201cFlights continue to be operational and passengers are advised to check with their airlines for the latest flight information,\u201d a spokesperson for the airport said. The CrowdStrike outage caused havoc across a swathe of industries spanning the global economy. Airlines, railways, hospitals, television stations, sports clubs and financial systems were among the sectors hit by the technology glitches, prompting national governments to convene emergency meetings and stock markets to fall. Julia Kollewe, Kat Lay, Gwyn Topham and Simon Goodley run through it all in this handy explainer: The PA news agency has reported a statement by Microsoft. A spokesperson for Microsoft said: We are aware of a scenario in which customers experience issues with their machines causing a bug check (blue screen) due to a recent CrowdStrike update. We recommend customers to follow guidance provided by CrowdStrike.\u201d In England, the South East Coast ambulance service has declared a \u201cbusiness continuity incident\u201d and is experiencing \u201cincreased pressure\u201d across its 999 and 111 services due to the global IT outage. A spokesperson for the service said: The majority of our infrastructure is unaffected and we are continuing to respond to patients. However, we do not have access to some external NHS services and have declared a business continuity incident to manage our response.\u201d CrowdStrike\u2019s chief executive has said the cybersecurity firm\u2019s customers \u201cremain fully protected\u201d despite the ongoing global IT outage. In a new statement posted to X, George Kurtz said: Today was not a security or cyber incident. Our customers remain fully protected. We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption. We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on. As noted earlier, the issue has been identified and a fix has been deployed. There was an issue with a Falcon content update for Windows Hosts. For the latest information that we will continuously update, please refer to the CrowdStrike website, my posts on LinkedIn, and my posts on X. I will continue to provide updates to our community and the industry as they become available.\u201d In England, South Central ambulance service said it was experiencing increased demand on its 999 and NHS 111 services due to the global IT issues. In a post on X, it said: As usual, our 999 team will be prioritising patients in a serious or life-threatening condition. Patients not requiring such an immediate response may have to wait longer than usual to be seen by our ambulance team.\u201d The ambulance service added: If you have an urgent, not emergency, medical need rather than call 999 please make use of other local services, such as urgent treatment centres which remain open across our region until late this evening. You can also use 111 online, or call 111, to get advice and help.\u201d Additionally, the London ambulance service (LAS) said it has experienced \u201chuge increases\u201d in the number of calls to its 999 and 111 services. Chief executive of LAS, Daniel Elkeles, said: In fact, by 2pm today, we had received more than 3,000 999 calls and 3,000 calls to our 111 services \u2013 this is a third higher than we would usually receive in a full 24 hour period.\u201d The PA news agency reports that Friday is the busiest day of the year so far for UK air travel with 3,214 departing flights as thousands of families embark on summer holidays at the end of the academic year for many schools. Several US carriers also grounded flights on Friday, including United, American Airlines and Delta. Thousands of airline passengers whose flights have been cancelled due to the global IT outage are being urged to leave crowded airports. More than 40 UK flights have been cancelled and many more were delayed after the technical glitch. Aviation analytics company Cirium said 1,396 flights were cancelled globally on Friday, including 43 UK departures. The UK health secretary, Wes Streeting, has urged people to \u201cbear with\u201d GPs amid a major IT outage that has caused \u201cconsiderable disruption\u201d to appointment bookings and other services. Thousands of GP practices have been affected, with NHS England confirming there has been an issue with the EMIS Web system, which is understood to be used by about 60% of practices in England. According to the PA news agency, about 3,700 GP practices may be affected. People trying to access the NHS app have also encountered problems. In a post on X, Streeting wrote: This is having a particular impact on GP appointments and electronic prescribing. Please bear with your local GPs if they\u2019re grappling with this on top of normal pressures. My department is working closely with colleagues across government.\u201d Industry expert Adam Smith of BCS (the Chartered Institute for IT), warned that it could even take \u201cweeks\u201d for all computers and systems to be fully restored. He told the PA news agency: The fix will have to be applied to many computers around the world. So if computers are getting blue screens and endless loops, it could be more difficult and take days and weeks. Microsoft Windows isn\u2019t the main OS for mission-critical systems, that\u2019s Linux \u2013 and so this could have been much worse.\u201d CrowdStrike had earlier confirmed that Linux and Apple Mac systems had not been affected by the bug (see 11.11am BST). Officials will hold another meeting on Friday to discuss the IT outage, Pat McFadden said, as he indicated UK government services are \u201clargely unaffected now\u201d. The cabinet minister told the BBC: Cobra officials met this morning. I\u2019ve been kept updated about the situation throughout the day, the prime minister has been kept informed. We will have a further meeting later today to make sure we are across the situation. But as far as government services goes, the online services that government provides, these are largely unaffected now, and it\u2019s important that\u2019s the case because a lot of vulnerable people depend on these services.\u201d Asked about the need for back-up systems after GP surgeries were hit, McFadden said: What this incident shows is just how dependent we are on IT systems. And when something like this happens, how fast and how widespread the effects are \u2026 It\u2019s really important, because we\u2019re so reliant on these systems, that the fix is put in place as soon as possible.\u201d The chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster told the BBC: We\u2019ve had a major global IT outage today, causing huge inconvenience around the world, particularly for people travelling, for media organisations and for some parts of the health care system. It\u2019s not a security attack, it\u2019s not a cyber-attack. The cause appears to be a software error in an update. So the cause has been identified and a fix is being put in place. But we\u2019re very conscious that people are still being inconvenienced by this, not just here in the UK, but in many other countries too.\u201d Pressed on what the government can do to help people, he said the \u201cfirst thing we always want to identify is the cause\u201d and then \u201cto make sure that a fix is put in place and that the inconvenience that is being felt comes to an end as soon as possible\u201d. Ryanair urged passengers whose flights have been cancelled to leave the airport. The airline said in a statement: Unfortunately, we\u2019ve been forced to cancel a small number of flights today due to this global third-party IT outage. Affected passengers have been notified and are advised to log into their myRyanair account once systems are back online to see their options. A full list of cancellations is available at http://ryanair.com. If your flight has been cancelled, we kindly request that you leave the airport as the IT outage means we cannot currently assist passengers at the airport. We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused by this global third-party IT outage, and we are working hard to minimise disruption and keep passengers informed.\u201d Emergency phone lines went down in some places and appointments for surgery and radiotherapy had to be cancelled as the IT outage hit health services around the world, writes our global health correspondent Kat Lay. Hospitals and clinics reported returning to paper charts and handwritten prescriptions in order to keep services running, as they became unable to access electronic medical records. In the UK, NHS England said the majority of GP practices were affected because the issue had hit appointment and patient record system EMIS. A spokesperson said there was no known impact on 999 or emergency services, adding: The NHS has long standing measures in place to manage the disruption, including using paper patient records and handwritten prescriptions, and the usual phone systems to contact your GP. Professor Kamila Hawthorne, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said: Outages like this affect our access to important clinical information about our patients, as well as our ability to book tests, make referrals, and inform the most appropriate treatment plan.\u201d A spokesman for the National Pharmacy Association said pharmacies were affected, with disruption to the access of prescriptions from GPs and medicine deliveries. The Royal Surrey Foundation Trust declared a critical incident, saying the IT system used to deliver radiotherapy treatments had been affected. Morning appointments were cancelled, and while they resumed in the afternoon, it said it expected disruption to run into next week. Reproductive healthcare charity Bpas, which provides abortion care, said its phone lines had been disrupted, but that appointments already booked would be unaffected. Some hospitals in Germany and the Netherlands cancelled operations, Others in Israel and the US said they were also having issues, often related to access to electronic medical records. In the US, the emergency 911 lines went down in parts of Alaska, with officials posting alternative phone numbers on social media. There were similar issues reported in other states, including New Hampshire and Ohio. The global IT outages are causing serious problems for the NHS, including GP surgeries, with some forced to turn away patients with routine appointments and see only those classed as an emergency. Family doctor practices are experiencing major disruption because they cannot access patients\u2019 records or refer them on for tests or appointments at their local hospital. \u201cOur members are telling us that today\u2019s outage is causing considerable disruption to GP practice bookings and IT systems,\u201d said Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs. \u201cOutages like this affect our access to important clinical information about our patients, as well as our ability to book tests, make referrals and inform the most appropriate treatment plan.\u201d The outage also disrupted the European energy market\u2019s liquidity and affected hedge funds and other traders. Traders were unable to access their computers and contact brokers, although the issues are gradually being resolved. The outage, which has affected Microsoft Windows devices, meant traders to experienced difficulties logging into their computers, using messenger apps, and sourcing critical data, according to reports from Montel News. Even so, energy companies across Europe say that their operations remain largely unaffected. A representative from the London Stock Exchange Group indicated that the outage temporarily disrupted access to the company\u2019s data and messenger systems, which are widely used by energy market participants. Many LSEG employees were unable to log into their computers, significantly affecting market liquidity. A Netherlands-based trader said that access to brokers was the primary issue, with only one broker operating initially. Futures exchanges EEX and ICE continued to function normally, minimising the overall impact, although EEX warned clients about potential login and trading issues. Among energy brokers, only Tradition was operational during early trading, while others, including GFI, Griffin Markets, Spectron, and BGC, were unavailable. Traded volumes for German power and Dutch TTF gas on ICE Endex and EEX remained stable, though Italian power volumes saw a decline of approximately 15%. A French trader reported significant disruptions at his firm, while a German power trader said his firm\u2019s intraday team had other solutions in place and was not affected. Bloomberg TV reports that \u201csome people had to go home\u201d. Hedge funds have not been able to process certain trades, it said. More on the UK shops that are unable to take card payments because of the global IT outage, reverting to \u201ccash only\u201d. Customers across the UK have faced issues with trying to pay using their cards, with some shops putting up \u201ccash only\u201d signs on their doors. A spokesman for the supermarket Morrisons said there were some \u201cisolated incidents\u201d with payment systems this morning, which have now been resolved and systems are working normally. Waitrose said it was taking contactless payments largely as normal, as well as still processing payments by chip and pin and cash. A spokesman for the supermarket said it had been able to take card payments throughout the day, but had been \u201cbriefly limited on contactless payments\u201d. A shoe shop in Cambridge had taped a handwritten sign to its door, which read: Due to global IT issue, cash only. Sorry for any inconvenience\u201d. Elsewhere, restaurants in Parliament appear to have been affected by the global IT issues. Parliamentary catering services were only accepting cash payments this morning, although cash machines in Westminster were still working. A number of supermarkets, including Iceland and Asda, said they had been unaffected. Airports, health services and businesses across the US have been knocked offline by the Microsoft outage caused by a CrowdStrike software update. Here\u2019s what we know so far about impacts on the US: The Federal Aviation Administration shut down operations due to the outage. There were about 110,000 commercial flights scheduled worldwide on Friday. By 6am ET, nearly 1,400 of them had been cancelled, according to reports. The FAA said that it is \u201cclosely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at US airlines.\u201d It added: \u201cSeveral airlines have requested FAA assistance with ground stops until the issue is resolved.\u201d Long lines were forming at major US airports, as New York, Atlanta, Dallas and Chicago airports were among those facing major delays as airlines struggled to process travelers. NBC news reports departure screens and check-in systems have failed and delays are expected to keep going up. In Alaska, 911 services were affected by the CrowdStrike outage. State troopers wrote: \u201cDue to a nationwide technology-related outage, many 911 and non-emergency call centers are not working correctly across the state of Alaska.\u201d The White House said that it is \u201clooking into\u201d the outage, according to a spokesperson speaking to CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of the incident and are looking into the issue and impacts,\u201d the full statement said. New York City\u2019s subway system agency, the MTA, said that \u201csome MTA customer information systems are temporarily offline due to a worldwide technical outage\u201d. It added that train and bus service is unaffected. You can follow the latest on our US blog here: Travellers have been describing \u201cmayhem\u201d and \u201cchaos\u201d at Edinburgh Airport, as those whose flights have been cancelled are being urged to leave the airport to avoid overcrowding, reports our Scotland correspondent Libby Brooks. Passengers have been posting images of snaking queues and hallways rammed with waiting travellers. The airport is also urging would-be passengers not to travel to the airport without checking the status of their flights first. Scotland\u2019s other airports so far remain largely unaffected, with a small number of airlines moving to manual check ins and some shops are only accepting cash payments. Train services in Scotland are also unaffected at present: Scotrail says: Train services are operating normally, and we are working with industry partners to understand the cause and undertake further checks to all our systems. A few football clubs have warned that their ticketing systems are under pressure, with Celtic FC announcing they are postponing ticket sales, as did Manchester United in England. George Kurtz, the founder and chief executive of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, has said the company is \u201cdeeply sorry for impact that we\u2019ve caused to customers\u201d after a flawed software update prompted a global IT outage. Kurtz told NBC\u2019s Today Show in the US that the problem was down to a bug in a single update. \u201cWe identified this very quickly and remediated the issue,\u201d he said, adding that CrowdStrike was now \u201cworking with each and every customer to make sure that we can bring them back online\u201d. Kurtz said there had been a \u201cnegative interaction\u201d between the update and Microsoft\u2019s operating system, which had then caused computers to crash, sparking the global outage, which remains ongoing. Asked how one faulty update could cause such global chaose, he said: \u201cWe have to go back and see what happened here, our systems are always looking for the latest attacks from adversaries that that are out there.\u201d He made clear that there was no possibilty it was a cyber-attack. However, although the problem had been identified and a fix issued, Kurtz said \u201cit could be some time for some systems\u201d to return to normal, stressing that they would not \u201cjust automatically recover\u201d. Royal Mail is experiencing technical issues across some of its IT systems as part of the outage. The UK postal service operator said its inbound customer service phone lines are not operating at present, and some of the applications that its customer experience and account teams use are not currently available. It said collection, processing and delivery of items across UK is taking place as usual, though there may be some impact on services, while Royal Mail shipping solutions, including click and drop, are working normally for customers to print labels and send items. The National Health Service\u2019s blood donation agency has urged people in Britain to keep their appointments to give blood, saying it had been contacted by members of the public wondering if sessions they were still going ahead amid reports of the IT outage hitting some NHS services. A spokesman said: NHS Blood and Transplant are calling on donors to book and keep appointments to donate blood to boost NHS resilience at this time. There remains a particularly urgent need for O negative blood. Blood donation systems are not affected and we currently have a high number of appointments available at our donor centres in major towns and cities. Today\u2019s global Microsoft IT outage could impact company payroll and the ability for businesses across the nation to pay their employees. Melanie Pizzey, CEO and gounder of the Global Payroll Association, said: We\u2019ve been contacted by numerous clients already today who have been unable to access their payroll software due to the Microsoft outage and others who have been urged to log out with immediate effect. Depending on the length of this outage, it could have very serious implications for businesses across the nation, particularly those who process payroll on a weekly basis. Furthermore, we could see a backlog with regard to processing payrolls for the coming month end which may delay employees from receiving their monthly wage. At best, it will require those managing payroll to work overtime to rectify the issue, but the good news is that it doesn\u2019t seem to be a cyber attack. This means that the sensitive employee details held within payroll should be safe, although we\u2019re seeing many companies understandably take action to minimise such a threat as a precaution. The worldwide IT crisis was discussed by UK government officials who attended a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee, as we reported earlier. The meeting heard there has been no known impact on 999 or emergency services. The prime minister did not attend the Cobra meeting as he was hosting the Ukrainian president at a meeting the Cabinet at the time. A spokesperson for Keir Starmer said they were unaware of the problem having any impact on government services. We are certainly aware of the disruption this has caused to business and to those particiualrly looking to travel today. We are keeping in closely monitoring the situation and making sure the relevant industries can use the support we can provide. The dollar rose and stock markets fell in jittery trading today, as the global IT outage unnerved investors. The group that runs the London Stock Exchange suffered an outage that affected user access to some of its products, and Refinitiv was down earlier. By around midday in Europe, the company said its services had been restored. The pound, which earlier this week hit a one-year high above $1.30, fell by 0.2% today to $1.2921. The FTSE 100 index in London lost 0.5% or 43 points to 8,161, while the German Dax and the French CAC traded down by a similar amount,, and the FTSE MiB in Milan slid by 0.7%. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against six other major currencies, rose by 0.2% to a high of 104.4, and is set for a modest weekly gain after two weeks of losses. An emergency Cobra meeting was held at official-level \u2013 rather than ministers \u2013 this morning to discuss the IT chaos, Downing Street said. A No 10 spokeswoman told reporters: We recognise the impact this is having on services and the Government is working closely with the respective sectors and industries on this issue, which is affecting services not only across the UK but also globally. Officials have met in the Cobra unit on this this morning and of course are updating ministers regularly on this issue. She said she was not aware of plans for a Cobra gathering with ministers present. Asked why Sir Keir Starmer did not chair the meeting of the committee, she said: The Prime Minister\u2019s had bilaterals with President Zelensky and Cabinet this morning, but all ministers including the Prime Minister are being kept informed with the latest. The spokeswoman also said she is not aware of any government business being hit by the outage. Staff at London Stansted Airport handed out bottles of water to people queuing on the hot July day, as a global IT outage caused delays. Carol Murphy, 58, a charity worker, of Ealing in west London, who was queuing inside the terminal building for a Ryanair flight to go on a 10-day holiday to Vienna, said the situation was \u201cnobody\u2019s fault\u201d. They keep coming round and people who\u2019ve got a flight upcoming, they send them forward. I think they\u2019re doing quite well. Student Jack O\u2019Leary, who was queuing for a Ryanair flight to Dublin to go on holiday, said: We\u2019re quite understanding - it\u2019s a global outage and everything\u2019s pretty chaotic.\u201d The 27-year-old, from near Cambridge, added: We\u2019re very much in stasis mode waiting for something to happen and hoping we can get to Dublin today. Some US tourists were forced to pay 6,800 dollars (\u00a35,262) for new flights home from Edinburgh Airport after original plans were cancelled because of IT outages. Stephanie Thompson, heading home to Dallas, Texas, said her family, who were in the UK to attend Wimbledon and the Open Championship in Troon, were unable to reach British Airlines or American Airlines for support. Speaking from Edinburgh Airport, she told the PA news agency: It was supposed to leave at 9.25am and change in Heathrow at 11 and we were supposed to get into Dallas later today. We couldn\u2019t get an answer from anybody. British Airways kept hanging up saying we have too many calls right now. I was on hold with American (Airlines) for about an hour and 10 minutes before I finally hung up. We just paid 6,800 dollars for a one-way trip home, hopefully leaving tonight. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. I just wanted something to get us home. Another US tourist, Debbie, and her family, said their flight to Boston was also cancelled. Rafa de Miguel, El Pa\u00eds\u2019s UK correspondent, posted this video about \u201ccomplete chaos at Ryanair bag drop at Stansted airport\u201d. Guardian readers have been getting in touch to tell us how their travel plans have been affected by this morning\u2019s outage. Saffy Saleem, 29, a doctor travelling to Mallorca on holiday, is waiting for her flight from Stansted Airport, where she describes the scene as \u201cchaotic\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck at Ryanair check-in. There are queues everywhere,\u201d she says. She has been waiting at the gate for nearly an hour. We only managed to get our boarding passes about an hour before the flight, but once they checked in then we made it through security. But there were loads of people who\u2019d already missed their flights. She has been given a handwritten boarding pass and luggage tags. They\u2019re manually checking people in by crossing out who\u2019s in what seat, and then working out where the free seats are, because no one has seat allocations. It\u2019s very old-school and slow. In Budapest, George Burr, 71, who is returning from a holiday with his wife, is currently waiting on a Ryanair plane to Bristol. He says: We didn\u2019t find out about the outage by anybody telling us, but by looking at the Guardian newspaper online. Similarly to Stansted, Burr says that airline staff had adapted check-in procedures on Friday morning: At the check-in, they just had a single sheet of A4 paper, and were just making a note of people\u2019s check-in numbers. It was all done manually. We\u2019ve been sitting on the plane for nearly two hours. The cabin crew have had to manually count everybody. Obviously they\u2019re not used to counting us, so they had to do it three times. We\u2019ve been told we\u2019re waiting for a slot to take off, but nothing\u2019s happened yet. I don\u2019t know what the position is at Bristol airport, whether there\u2019d be issues about us landing or not. There\u2019s no certainty, I guess. Meanwhile in Verona, Emma O\u2019Hara, 30, from Dublin has encountered long queues and delays on her return from holiday in Italy with her friend Aisling. A man [member of airport staff] came and kind of explained the situation, said that it was a European-wide outage, and he was quick to say that it wasn\u2019t just Verona airport.\u201d We\u2019ve been waiting an hour, which I suppose it\u2019s not horrendous in the grand scheme of things, but we don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll board. People are a bit fed up, but no one\u2019s in terrible humour yet. Here\u2019s a video showing the chaos at airports. Microsoft headlines are popping up on Refinitiv, saying the underlying cause of the global outage has been fixed. Microsoft: underlying cause has been fixed Microsoft: aware of an issue with Windows 365 Cloud PCs caused by a recent update to CrowdStrike Falcon sensor software Microsoft: underlying cause has been fixed for Microsoft 365 apps, services Hospitals have been affected by the outage in countries including the UK, Germany and Israel, as reported earlier. Two hospitals in the northern German cities of L\u00fcbeck and Kiel have cancelled elective operations scheduled for Friday, their operator said. In the UK, BBC news health editor Hugh Pym reported: The South African bank Capitec has also been affected. Due to an unexpected issue with an international service provider, we are currently experiencing nationwide service disruptions, it said in an X post, adding that card payments and ATMs are not affected. In replies to users on X it said it was \u201cworking hard to resolve\u201d the issues. China\u2019s flag carrier Air China and other major airlines have not been affected by the global tech outage that disrupted operations in multiple industries on Friday due to the use of different systems, according to state media CGTN. Meanwhile, Wizz Air said it has suspended its fees for airport check-in as its online systems are unavailable due to the IT outage. It said in a statement: During the outage, free airport check-in is available. Therefore, we advise passengers to arrive at the airport at least three hours before their scheduled departure time to allow sufficient time for check-in, security control and airport-specific health and safety procedures. We thank you for your understanding as we deal with the effects of the global IT systems outage. The Wizz Air team is doing everything possible to minimise disruption to our customers. The UK\u2019s science, innovation and technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said government departments \u201care working seamlessly together to understand the nature of today\u2019s outages and respond appropriately and swiftly\u201d. In a statement this morning, Spain\u2019s national airports authority, Aena, said \u201can information systems issue\u201d could cause delays to flights. Owing to an information systems issue, alterations are occurring in Aena\u2019s systems and those of the Spanish airport network, which could bring delays. We\u2019re working to resolve this as soon as possible. In the meantime, we\u2019re operating systems manually. By midday Madrid time, however, it said all Spain\u2019s airports were operating and that flights were going ahead. Aena said: Airports and airlines all over the world have been affected by the same incident. Today\u2019s programming is happening but with certain delays and some airlines are reprogramming their operations. Contingency programmes were activated early this morning and some manual processes were used to maintain operations.\u201d Both departures and arrivals are subject to delays which are decreasing - but there was no standstill at any point. The UK\u2019s transport secretary Louise Haigh posted on X: We are aware of IT failures impacting several transport operators and terminals today, and we\u2019re working at pace with industry and across government on the issue. There are no known security issues at present. Some lines from Australia\u2019s home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil: The Australian government has conducted a National Coordination Mechanism meeting, which I joined earlier this evening. CrowdStrike attended the meeting and we can confirm there is no evidence that this is a cyber-security incident. This is a technical issue, caused by a CrowdStrike update to its customers. They have issued a fix for this, allowing affected companies and organisations to reboot their systems without the problem. The company has informed us that most issues should be resolved through the fix they have provided, but given the size and nature of this incident it may take some time to resolve. Governments are closely engaged at all levels, focused on bringing together the affected parties and ensuring government entities institute the fix as quickly as possible. Here is our main story on the global IT outage: Here is an explainer of what we know so far about. Business and institutions around the world have been been knocked offline after an IT outage. In the UK, GP doctors\u2019 surgeries have said they are unable to access patient records or book appointments. Sky News was off air for few hours but resumed broadcasting, while Britain\u2019s biggest train company warned passengers to expect disruption because of \u201cwidespread IT issues\u201d. Around the world banks, supermarkets and other major institutions reported computer issues disrupting services, with some airlines warning of delays and some airports grounding flights. If you\u2019ve been affected by the outage, we\u2019d like to hear from you. CrowdStrike president George Kurtz said the problem was caused by a \u201cdefect found in a single content update for Windows hosts\u201d. He wrote on X: CrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts. Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted. This is not a security incident or cyberattack. The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed. We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website. We further recommend organizations ensure they\u2019re communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels. Our team is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers. UK and EU holidaymakers who have their flights delayed because of the IT outage are likely to find that they cannot claim compensation from their airline because the problem is out of its control, writes our consumer &amp; Money editor Hilary Osborne. EU rules, adopted by the UK, say that passengers can get compensation of up to \u00a3520 if their flight is cancelled or delayed by more than three hours - but not when the cause is an \u201cextraordinary circumstance.\u201d Airlines are likely to argue that the outage counts as such - and some are already stressing in communications that the problems are not their fault. Passengers who have travel insurance might be able to make a claim on their policy - but it will depend on the terms and conditions of the policy they have bought. Whitehall crisis officials are co-ordinating the response to the major IT outage, cabinet minister Pat McFadden has said. In a post on X, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said: Cobra is the committee tasked with handling matters of national emergency or major disruption. The UK government has been urged to convene a Cobra meeting to respond to the major IT outage hitting airlines, train companies and banks. In the UK, train companies are reporting delays, GP surgeries are unable to book appointments or access patient records and Sky News was knocked off air but is now back on air. Restaurants in parliament appear to be affected too, with catering services only accepting cash payments. The Liberal Democrats demanded ministers co-ordinate an urgent response. The party\u2019s Cabinet Office spokesperson Christine Jardine said: The government must call an urgent Cobra meeting to address the chaos being caused by these IT outages across the country. The public needs to be reassured that the disruption to their travel or their desperately needed GP appointments will be minimised. Getting critical infrastructure up and running again must be priority number one. The National Cyber Security Centre should also be working with small businesses and other organisations to help them deal with the outage. This once again lays bare the need to improve our digital infrastructure and truly modernise our economy in order to prevent the incidents from happening again. Some UK retailers have been forced to switch to cash only because of the global IT outage. Waterstones in Falkirk said on X: Waitrose and Morrisons are also affected, according to shoppers and other reports. Wetherspoons cannot take card payments, according to social media reports. The Israeli health ministry said \u201cthe global malfunction,\u201d has affected 16 hospitals across the country. Patients are not affected, they said, as the hospital has switched to using analogue or other systems without issue. The ministry instructed the Israeli ambulance service, the Magen David Adom, to evacuate patients to hospital facilities unaffected by the malfunctioning computer systems. So far, they said ambulance services have not been affected by the issue, but advised anyone looking to call an ambulance to try an alternate number for the service if problems occur on the standard line. In the Emirates, the Dubai International Airport, a major transit hub, said it has resumed normal operations after a system outage that had affected check-in procedures for some airlines, per Reuters. One passenger with the Indian domestic airline IndiGo vented their frustrations on social media at being stuck in long queues at check in. Stuck at Dubai airport for over an hour now. Check-in servers down, no movement in sight. Frustrating start to travel. Some children have been told to stay off school on the last day of term. Castleford Academy in west Yorkshire said it is closed today. Whitecross Hereford High School in Herefordshire said its school information management system is down due to the tech outage and that parents should phone or email if their child is sick. The IT outage is \u201ccausing disruption in the majority of GP practices\u201d in England but there is currently no known impact on 999 or emergency services, NHS England said. St Peter\u2019s Medical Centre in Brighton, which uses SystmOne rather than Emis, is operating normally, my colleague Charlotte Naughton has pointed out. Birmingham Airport said the majority of flights are operating normally but passengers are facing some delays at check-in. On X, formerly Twitter, the airport posted: The majority of flights are operating as normal. However, some check ins are experiencing delays which are being processed by colleagues. For those that have checked in online previously are unaffected. This is clearly a rapidly evolving situation. Customers should follow the advice from airlines and we will continue to update passengers throughout the day. A spokeswoman for easyJet, the UK\u2019s biggest airline by passenger numbers, advised customers travelling from Spanish airports to arrive three hours before their flight due to the IT outage. She said: EasyJet\u2019s IT systems have not been directly affected by the Microsoft systems issues this morning, however we are aware that some airports\u2019 systems have been impacted across Europe. This has led to some disruption to flights this morning and we expect some further potential impact to flights today. Customers should expect longer than usual airport queues and we are advising customers travelling from Spanish airports to arrive three hours before their flight. We advise customers due to travel with us today to continue to check the latest updates on their flight on easyJet\u2019s Flight Tracker before making their way to the airport. Although outside of our control, we are sorry for any inconvenience caused. Here is more reaction from experts to the massive global IT outage: Shumi Akhtar, associate professor at the University of Sydney, said: Today\u2019s technology outage \u2014 an unprecedented global crisis\u2014 sparked off in the USA, is now ominously rippling across the globe. This sudden, severe disruption halts everyday activities and starkly exposes the fragility of our heavily digitised world. From banking to healthcare, education to government, no sector remains untouched, highlighting an urgent need for a worldwide strategic overhaul of our critical infrastructures. This crisis calls for immediate collaborative action to enhance resilience through robust safeguards and fail-safes, especially in life-critical networks. As a result of this outage, at least three critical sectors could be affected significantly. In the medical industry, a technology outage can result in the loss of access to electronic medical records, critical patient data, and communication systems essential for patient care. This could delay surgeries, medication administration, and emergency responses, potentially endangering lives. In the banking sector, an outage can cripple financial transactions, including ATM withdrawals, online banking, and payment processing. This disruption can lead to significant financial losses for consumers and institutions, and undermine public trust in the financial system For the airline industry, technology outages can ground flights, disrupt ticketing and check-in processes, and affect air traffic control. This can lead to massive delays, financial losses, and compromise passenger safety and security. Each of these scenarios highlights the catastrophic potential of technology failures across critical industries. Prof John McDermid of the Institute for Safe Autonomy at the University of York said: Security software is intended to protect computers from attack, e.g. by malware. and to provide this protection it has a lot of power to control the host PC. Such software is pervasive \u2013 on many if not all machines of a particular type \u2013 so a fault in the security software can bring down many computers at once. This appears to be what is behind the widespread outage of Windows-10 based PCs around the world, with knock-on effects on air travel, banking, etc. We need to be aware that such software can be a common cause of failure for multiple systems at the same time, and we need to design infrastructure to be resilient against such common cause problems, e.g. through use of diversity, that is not relying on a single make of computer system and/or software. Dr Harjinder Lallie, cyber security expert at the University of Warwick, said: The worldwide IT outage experienced this morning is unprecedented in the range and scale of systems it has impacted. Although we cannot speculate on the cause of this outage just yet, it appears that this might be a server error emanating from one server supplier. This IT \u2018catastrophe\u2019 highlights the need for greater resilience, a greater focus on backup systems, and possibly even a need to rethink whether we are using the most resilient operating systems for such critical systems. A traveller at Gatwick Airport queuing for over three-and-a-half hours has described the scene at the travel hub as \u201cbedlam\u201d with staff now handing out water to those stranded, PA reported. Dean Seddon started queuing at 6am to check in for a trip with his social media training company to Miami, Florida, ahead of their scheduled departure at 10am with Norse Atlantic Airways. There are just people everywhere, there must be 400 people in this queue for the check in desk I\u2019m at... it\u2019s just bedlam,\u201d the 42-year-old from Plymouth told the PA news agency. It\u2019s one of those things where you kind of know we\u2019re not going to fly, but you don\u2019t want to leave because you don\u2019t know. [Staff are] doing the best they can but they don\u2019t actually know when it\u2019s going to be fixed, so it is frustrating, but you kind of feel for the staff as well. Seddon said there had been some people getting \u201cagitated\u201d in the queue but overall travellers had remained calm. The UK\u2019s National Pharmacy Association confirmed the IT outage is disrupting community pharmacies. A spokesperson said: We\u2019re aware that due to global IT outages that services in community pharmacies, including the accessing of prescriptions from GPs and medicine deliveries, are disrupted today. We urge patients to be patient whilst visiting their pharmacy. We\u2019re urgently raising this issue with the NHS England. Ilkka Turunen, of the software supply chain management firm Sonatype, explains what\u2019s going on with the Microsoft Windows outage. The widespread outages across the world affecting Microsoft Windows are due to a botched update to a piece of software called CrowdStrike, a well-regarded malware and endpoint protection tool often used by enterprises and many companies across the world. In terms of technical details, the update causes a BSOD loop on any Windows machine essentially making it boot and crash on an infinite loop. Making it worse is the fact that there are a significant number of Windows machines that the update was auto-installed on overnight. There are workarounds that customers of theirs will apply, but it seems to be very manual. It\u2019s definitely a supply chain style incident - what it shows is that one popular vendor botching an update can have a huge impact on its customers and how far a single well-orchestrated update can spread in a single night. It\u2019s not yet clear if the contents were due to malicious reasons, but it shows how quickly targeted attacks on popular vendors could spread. Swiss International Air Lines is also affected. The Hungarian low-cost carrier Wizz Air said it is \u201cfacing extreme technical challenges\u201d and advised \u201ccustomers to arrive at the airport at least 3 hours prior to their flight today.\u201d Airports in Germany have also been hit by the outages, causing major delays at the start of school holidays for many regions. Air traffic at Berlin\u2019s BER came to a complete halt in the early morning hours of Friday, according to public broadcaster RBB due to a server breakdown that triggered several emergency systems to kick in. The daily Tagesspiegel said several in-bound flights could not land in Berlin and had to return to the airport of origin or be redirected. An airport spokesman said he expected takeoffs and landings to resume in the late morning. A reporter for news agency DPA said long queues had formed at Terminal 1, particularly at check-in counters. A spokeswoman for Hamburg\u2019s international airport said that four carriers had been affected by outages: Eurowings, Ryanair, Vueling and Turkish Airlines, requiring tickets and boarding passes to be issued by hand. The larger hubs of Frankfurt and Zurich reported no IT problems of their own but saw disruptions due to the knock-on effect from other facilities. The Schleswig-Holstein university hospital in the north of the country cancelled all planned operations in Kiel and L\u00fcbeck due to the disruptions, according to a statement on its website. Mark Lloyd, business unit manager at IT services firm Axians UK, said: IT outages are being reported across the world due to a rogue CrowdStrike update. So far the outage has affected airports, banks, railways and the media, with Sky News being left unable to broadcast [earlier] this morning. This outage is a stark reminder of how dependent the world is on cloud services. From productivity tools to critical infrastructure, a large chunk of technology runs on cloud platforms. This outage showcases the immense power and reach these services hold. Even the biggest tech giants are not immune to disruptions, and the need for robust redundancy and disaster recovery plans across the board are more critical than ever in this day and age. It\u2019s important to remember in a time of disruption like this, we\u2019re all on the same team, fighting the same bad guys. At this stage, government officials are indicating they are not treating this as a cyber attack from hostile states or criminals, reports Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor. Cyber security expert Dan Card, from BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT, said people \u201cshould remain calm\u201d while businesses respond to the global IT outage, which may have been caused by a \u201cbug to a regular security update\u201d. It looks like a bug to a regular security update, rather than any form of \u2018mega cyber attack\u2019, but this is still causing worldwide challenges and is likely to require a large number of people to take manual remedial steps. Companies should make sure their IT teams are well supported as it could be a difficult and highly stressful weekend for them as they help customers. People often forget the people that are running around fixing things. \u201cThe world grinding to a halt because of a global IT meltdown shows the dark side to technology and that relying on computers doesn\u2019t always make life easier,\u201d says Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at the stockbroker AJ Bell. Countless industries, from airlines and trains to banks and media, face disruption to earnings if they cannot do their job. Workers cannot get from A to B and that will have a knock-on effect for industries across the board if staff aren\u2019t there to perform important functions or systems are offline. The severity of the problem boils down to how long it lasts. A few hours\u2019 disruption is unhelpful but not a catastrophe. Prolonged disruption is another matter, potentially causing damage to companies and economies. There is chatter that cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike ran an update which didn\u2019t work on Microsoft\u2019s operating system and that caused systems to fall over. Given we don\u2019t know the full details, it\u2019s too early for investors to work out the financial or reputational impact to these businesses. Stock markets continued to function as normal despite corporate news feeds and information terminals being impacted by the tech outage. Futures prices imply a small pullback when Wall Street opens later today, but so far investors have not shown any panic. Whether that remains the case as the day goes on is another matter. The global IT outage comes at a time when many people are heading off on their summer holidays. The Dutch airline KLM said on X: Eurowings, which is part of Germany\u2019s Lufthansa group, said: Britain\u2019s Sky News is back on air after an outage lasting several hours, but its presenter said the news channel was operating at minimal capacity and without many of its usual services. Two presenters were reading from paper scripts, with one, Anna Jones, saying they were not yet able to connect to any guests outside the studio to conduct interviews. GP surgeries across England hit by the outage have said the issue \u201cwill have a big effect\u201d. GP practices said they are unable to access patient records or book appointments due to the major global IT outage. Surgeries took to social media to report they cannot access the EMIS Web system. It is understood that NHS hospitals are currently unaffected by the outage. Central Lakes Medical Group in Ambleside wrote on X: We\u2019re impacted by the IT outage. This will have a big effect on us, so apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused, and delays on the phone. Another post by Pocklington Group Practice in the East Riding of Yorkshire said: Due to ongoing Windows issues affecting IT worldwide, the practice is currently unable to function as normal. This may result in appointments needing to be cancelled and rearranged. Updates will follow when available. The Wilmslow Health Centre in Cheshire wrote on X: All practices in the UK using the NHS commissioned GP computer system EMIS are currently without access to their IT systems. This is beyond the control of GP surgeries. Please bear with us until we have our IT systems back online. The Church Lane Surgery in Brighouse, West Yorkshire, posted on X that \u201cour clinical system has not been working since 7am this morning\u201d. The GP practice said: We have no access to patient clinical records so are unable to book appointments or provide information... This is a national problem and is being worked on as a high priority. Solihull Healthcare Partnership in the West Midlands said there is a \u201cnational issue\u201d with EMIS Web, the clinical computer system. Writing on X, it said: Unfortunately there is a national issue with EMIS Web - our clinical computer system. This will affect our ability to book/consult with patients this morning. We will update patients when we can. We apologise for the disruption. A reader wrote to us this morning, saying: I\u2019m currently sat in NHS Chorley Hospital (UK) and can confirm they are having issues and have been told they maybe cancelling appointments. I am an outpatient. Edinburgh Airport said the IT outage is causing longer waiting times. A spokesperson said: An IT system outage means wait times are longer than usual at the airport. This outage is affecting many other businesses, including airports. Work is ongoing to resolve this and our teams are on hand to assist where we can. Passengers are thanked for their patience. Ryanair said its flights are being disrupted by the outage. The airline said in a statement: We\u2019re currently experiencing disruption across the network due to a global third party IT outage which is out of our control. We advise all passengers to arrive at the airport at least three hours before their scheduled departure time. Turkish Airlines said \u201cdue to a global technical issue in our information systems, we are currently experiencing problems with ticketing, check-in, and reservation processes.\u201d Spain reported a \u201ccomputer incident\u201d at all its airports, while Amsterdam and Berlin\u2019s Brandenburg airports are also affected. Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol airport said \u201cthere is currently a global system failure. This disruption also has an impact on flights to and from Schiphol. The impact is now being mapped.\u201d Berlin\u2019s Brandenburg airport said that \u201cdue to a technical fault, there will be delays in check-in.\u201d Airports in India have also been disrupted, according to a passenger. London Northwest Railway and West Midlands Railway said they are also affected by the outage. Businesses including banks, airlines, railways, telecommunications companies, TV and radio broadcasters, and supermarkets have been taken offline after blue screen of death error screens were seen on Windows workstations across the globe. Users on the subreddit for cyber security firm CrowdStrike reported issues in India, the United States and New Zealand. Britain\u2019s biggest train company has warned passengers to expect disruption due to \u201cwidespread IT issues\u201d. Govia Thameslink Railway \u2013 parent company of Southern, Thameslink, Gatwick Express and Great Northern \u2013 issued an alert on its social media channels. The NHS booking system used by doctors in England is offline, medical officials said on X. Sky News in the UK reported being off air this morning, with Sky News sports presenter Jacquie Beltrao posting on X: \u201cWe\u2019re obviously not on air \u2013 we\u2019re trying.\u201d Sky News is still down, according to a message on its website. The London Stock Exchange is also facing technical issues. The government\u2019s borrowing was just over \u00a33bn above the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s (OBR) forecast across the first three months of the financial year, totalling nearly \u00a350bn. Receipts are running slightly behind expectations, while spending has been higher. The EY Item Club forecasting group, which uses the Treasury\u2019s model, thinks higher debt servicing costs means there\u2019s a good chance this underperformance will persist for the rest of the year. Further ahead, the outlook for the public finances depends on how the new government approaches fiscal policy. Peter Arnold, EY UK chief economist, said: The public finances data tends to be prone to revision, so the picture for the start of fiscal year 2024-2025 could look different in a few months\u2019 time. But as things stand, the EY Item Club thinks this underperformance is likely to persist. The OBR\u2019s assumptions for gilt yields and Bank Rate look too low, and this suggests debt servicing costs will prove to be higher than they expect. This is likely to mitigate the reduction in borrowing caused by a significant tightening in fiscal policy. Looking further ahead, the EY Item Club awaits the new chancellor\u2019s first budget with interest. Maintaining the net debt rule will mean that, in the absence of forecast revisions from the OBR, the new government will face a similar need to consolidate to their predecessors. It looks likely that the freeze on most tax allowances will be maintained for at least the next three fiscal years. However, it may prove challenging to turn existing spending totals into department-by-department plans, both in terms of current and capital spending. Lisa Hooker, PwC\u2019s leader of industry for consumer markets, said shoppers were still reluctant to spend despite the fall in inflation to 2%, higher wage increases and lower social security contributions. It appears that the cooler, wetter weather over spring and early summer, combined with longer term uncertainty in the period prior to the general election, has discouraged shoppers from both buying seasonal goods and making longer-term big ticket purchases. Retail sales fell by 0.1% in the second quarter from the first, contributing little to GDGP growth. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said this keeps his forecast for GDP growth in the second quarter at 0.6%, while the Bank of England has forecast 0.5%, \u201cas consumer spending on services fares better while output is supported by business-to-business spending too\u201d. He said: As the weather took a turn for the worse in June so did consumers\u2019 spending. Rainfall was 24% below average in June, compared to 19.7% above in May, but June was much cooler than May relative to the seasonal average. The temperature in June averaged 0.2 degrees below the norm, whereas May was the warmest since at least 1884. That probably explained the drop in sales in June. Retail sales have been enormously volatile this year, as they are bounced around by the weather and measurement problems. That enormous volatility can disguise the underlying trend. Retail volumes were not booming in May and neither are they collapsing now. Year-over-year retail sales volumes growth is steadily, if unspectacularly, trending up as consumers\u2019 real income growth improves, they have to replace items like televisions and clothes, and goods inflation slows relative to services. Charlie Huggins, of the investment firm Wealth Club, said: Retail sales volumes came in weaker than expected in June, following a stronger-than-expected May. This continues the volatility in monthly sales patterns seen since the turn of the year, with strange weather and economic caution playing a role. Consumers weren\u2019t exactly splashing the cash in June - sales in every category, excluding fuel, declined. But we should remember that May sales were especially strong. Sales volumes over the last 3 and 6 months are broadly flat and suggest the consumer is in reasonable health, but not exactly feeling flush. The volatility in monthly retail sales is making it even more difficult than usual to read the economic tea leaves. June was not a great month for the sector. But inflation is moderating, wages are rising and the election is now done and dusted, providing much needed certainty. This means sales could easily bounce back over summer, especially if the weather Gods start being a little more kind. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Retail sales in Great Britain slumped by 1.2% last month, with retailers blaming poor weather and cost of living pressures. Retail sales volumes fell by 1.2% in June from May, following an increase of 2.9% in May, according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists had expected a smaller fall of 0.4%. Sales fell across most sectors, and were down by 2.1% at non-food stores (department, clothing, household, and other non-food stores) while supermarkets and other food stores posted a 1.1% decline. Grant Fitzner, the ONS chief economist, said department stores, clothing shops and furniture stores were the biggest contributors to the fall. Retail sales fell back from May\u2019s recent high point with falls across all main shop types, with the exception of petrol stations. Retailer commentary suggested that both poor weather and economic conditions had an effect, as consumers showed caution with their spending. Separate figures from the ONS showed the government borrowed \u00a314.5bn in June, \u00a33.2bn less than in June last year. It was the lowest June borrowing \u2013 the difference between public sector spending and income \u2013 since 2019. Analysts had pencilled in borrowing of \u00a312bn. The interest payable on central government debt fell by \u00a35.5bn to \u00a37.4bn, largely because the interest payable on index-linked gilts (government bonds) rises and falls with the retail prices index, which has reduced sharply."

            "content": "The Australian government has warned a global IT outage that threw major businesses including airports, banks, supermarkets and media outlets into chaos on Friday could still take \u201csome time to resolve\u201d. The government activated a National Coordination Mechanism meeting of emergency authorities as well as representatives from the major supermarkets, banks, airlines and other key industries on Friday night to respond after Windows workstations were hit by the \u201cblue screen of death\u201d. The home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, said on Friday night the problem, which began about 3.30pm, was caused by a software update linked to the cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike. She said the company had attended the meeting and confirmed it had \u201cissued a fix\u201d, but it could still take \u201csome time to resolve\u201d. The incident was not security related or a cyberattack but a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts, the CrowdStrike chief executive, George Kurtz, said a subsequent statement. . The crowd-sourced website Downdetector has listed Telstra, Microsoft, Google, Foxtel, National Australia Bank, ABC, Uber, ANZ, and Bendigo Bank as suffering outages. But Qantas, Virgin Australia, Jetstar, police across much of the country and the federal and NSW governments were hit, as well as point-of-sale machines at shops, including Coles and Woolworths. Airports Some flight screens at Sydney airport and other airports across the country went blank on Friday before returning at 5.30pm, with flights cancelled across the country and many passengers experiencing delays. Manual check-in was put in place for some airlines in Perth, with reports that people were struggling to get home from Bali. Melbourne airport said in a post on X on Friday evening that Jetstar was \u201cexperiencing a significant outage\u201d while Qantas and Virgin were \u201cslowly processing passengers\u201d. Jetstar\u2019s international arm and the Singaporean carrier Scoot also experienced ongoing issues at Melbourne airport. A Virgin spokesperson said the company was aware of a \u201clarge-scale IT outage impacting multiple airlines and other businesses which is having an impact on our operations\u201d before the situation became stable several hours later. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Banks The Commonwealth Bank confirmed some PayID payment transactions were affected, and ANZ were also having trouble with some transfers. \u201cWe know some customers have been unable to make PayID payments,\u201d a Commonwealth Bank spokesperson said. \u201cIf you are unable to use PayID, you\u2019re still able to make payments between your accounts or pay someone using their BSB and account number.\u201d At Westpac, there was \u201cno impact to any Westpac customer-facing applications\u201d, a spokesperson said. Media outlets Media outlets were also affected, with presenters on the ABC using their phones to read the news after the teleprompters went down and unable to show graphics, such as the weather map. In Melbourne, Nine News journalists were forced to improvise the start of its 4pm bulletin amid problems with their prepared news packages. Sky News had similar problems, with its services reduced at one stage because of the outage. Supermarkets Payment systems in stores were impacted, with customers at some Coles and Woolworths stores not able to tap their cards in-store. One Liquorland employee said they were turning customers away because their system was down. \u201cWe are shut, we are telling all these people to go away.\u201d A Coles spokesperson said on Friday evening that the company was trying to get the system operational again. \u201cWe are working quickly to get our systems back up and running and will provide further updates as we know more,\u201d they said. At Woolworths, \u201call stores across the country except for six are open and trading\u201d, it said in a statement on Friday evening. \u201cIn some cases, customers may find less registers available than normal so we\u2019re grateful for their patience,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cA small number of online orders have been unable to be fulfilled and those customers have been contacted.\u201d Health and emergency services Some internal NSW and Victorian police systems had gone down but the triple-zero service remained operational nationwide. The Australian National Relay Service confirmed it was working to restore services but said it was able to make triple-zero calls. In Victoria, Western Health, which operates several hospitals, said it was impacted and had \u201creverted to the use of paper-based patient records\u201d. In Queensland, several private hospitals including Wesley Hospital and St Andrews Hospital in Brisbane were experiencing problems with their computers. The systems were also down in Uniting Care and Ramsay Health Care, which operates around 20 sites around the state. \u201cWe are assessing the impacts at a local level across our hospitals and health services network to understand which systems are affected and developing contingency plans for patients,\u201d a Ramsay Health spokesperson said. \u201cAt this stage, we do not know how long the outrage will last.\u201d Anthony Albanese said he understood Australians were \u201cconcerned about the outage that is unfolding globally and affecting a wide range of services\u201d. \u201cMy government is working closely with the national cyber security coordinator,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cThere is no impact to critical infrastructure, government services or triple-0 services at this stage.\u201d"

            "content": "The home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, says the company at the centre of the world\u2019s largest ever IT outage has told the federal government it is close to an automatic fix which would allow systems to return online. The global outage on Friday afternoon occurred after the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike updated a widely used cloud-based software product called Falcon. The update to the Falcon software, which interacts with other parts of computer systems and software like Microsoft\u2019s Windows products, caused a malfunction that essentially disabled those systems globally. Microsoft, in a blog post update from its vice-president of operating systems security, David Weston, said it estimated 8.5m Windows devices had been affected around the world. O\u2019Neil posted on social media on Sunday afternoon that a meeting of federal and state governments and the private sector had been told by Crowdstrike that \u201cthat they are now close to rolling out an automatic fix to the issue with their update, as is Microsoft\u201d. The meeting occurred as part of the national coordination mechanism, which was established during the Covid-19 pandemic to draw federal, state and territory governments and agencies together along with the private sector. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup It is the third meeting of the mechanism since the outage. \u201cThis should increase the speed at which systems across the economy are back online,\u201d O\u2019Neil posted on X. \u201cThere has been a huge amount of work over this weekend to get the economy back up and running. \u201cHowever, it will take time until all affected sectors are completely back online. In some cases we may see teething issues for one or two weeks.\u201d On Sunday Crowdstrike said the \u201cissue has been identified and isolated, and a fix has been deployed\u201d, and reiterated that it had not been a cyberattack. It advised customers to check the company\u2019s support portal for software updates. \u201cWe understand the gravity of this situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,\u201d it said. O\u2019Neil said there had been no impact to critical infrastructure or government services caused by the outage. She said supermarkets, like many other sectors, were still experiencing issues, but said the sector stressed during the meeting that there were no food shortages and no need to stockpile. O\u2019Neil also warned again about scammers trying to exploit the outage. \u201cExamples that have been reported include people posed as airlines offering to resolve issues with delayed flights and criminals posing as technical support offering to fix affected technology. \u201cIt is very important that Australians are extremely cautious of any unexpected texts, calls or emails claiming to be assistance with this issue. \u201cYou can help by making sure vulnerable people, including elderly relatives, are being extra cautious at this time.\u201d Australia\u2019s largest business organisation said it could be days before some businesses returned to trading. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry CEO, Andrew McKellar, said smaller businesses may have to wait until Monday to get IT support. \u201cIts timing couldn\u2019t have been worse on a Friday, and in particular, impacting on a Friday afternoon,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s meant for many businesses, they\u2019re going to have to wait until early next week to put in place the fixes that they need to do.\u201d McKellar said it was difficult to say how much the IT outage has cost businesses. He said it would be unlikely businesses would be able to receive compensation for their losses, but that it may depend on their contractual arrangements. \u201cAcross the board there\u2019s been a wide impact, that\u2019s cost a lot of businesses time, money, lost sales \u2026 it\u2019s very hard to put a dollar figure on that,\u201d he said. \u201c[The losses] are material, they are significant, we have to hope most businesses can weather that sort of impact.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-19T18:55:55Z",
            "content": "A global technology outage on Friday grounded flights, disrupted health services, crashed payment systems and blocked access to Microsoft services in what experts believe is one of the largest IT failures in history. The cause of the disruptions originated from a cybersecurity firm called CrowdStrike, which provides software to a wide range of industries. An update to one of CrowdStrike\u2019s pieces of software, Falcon Sensor, malfunctioned, throwing a wrench into computers running Windows, leading to major tech failures around the world, the company said. Here\u2019s what we know about the outage so far. What is CrowdStrike? CrowdStrike is an American cybersecurity firm founded in 2011 and based in Austin, Texas. Since its inception, the company has grown rapidly as it began to offer a range of security services using cloud-based software. It has raised millions in funding from Silicon Valley powerhouses such as Google\u2019s venture capital arm. It employs thousands of workers and services businesses in countries across the globe, boasting on its website that it protects 538 out of the Fortune 1000 companies. The firm has become immensely successful over the past decade, with a market value of around $83bn at market close on Thursday, though its stock price was falling during Friday trading. CrowdStrike\u2019s share value declined dramatically following the outage, dipping as much as 13% early on Friday. While the company\u2019s primary products are intended to block hackers and malware, CrowdStrike has also been hired to investigate major data breaches. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 tasked CrowdStrike with investigating the Russian hack of DNC servers, while Sony Pictures employed the company to look into a 2014 cyberattack linked to North Korea. CrowdStrike\u2019s investigation into the DNC hack also previously played a small but notable role in the first impeachment of Donald Trump and special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump, echoing a widely repudiated conspiracy theory that CrowdStrike was involved in an elaborate cover up on behalf of the DNC, nonsensically suggested the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, look into the company, a piece of the quid pro quo accusations against the US president. How did CrowdStrike cause the global outage? The global outage stems from an update CrowdStrike made to its marquee cybersecurity platform, a cloud-based software product called Falcon. When CrowdStrike pushed an update to the Falcon software, which interacts with other parts of computer systems and software like Microsoft\u2019s Windows products, it caused a malfunction that essentially disabled those systems and their widely used pieces of software the world over. Put bluntly, the software intended to protect against crashes and disruptions in vital computer systems ended up taking them down. CrowdStrike\u2019s CEO, George Kurtz, has apologized for the outage, which the company has stated was due to a faulty piece of code. \u201cThis is not a security incident or cyberattack. The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed,\u201d Kurtz wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website.\u201d Compounding the chaos on Friday, another outage also hit Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud services and caused an additional set of failures. Microsoft has stated that the two outages were unrelated, and that its Azure services were now back online. Kurtz meanwhile told NBC\u2019s Today show that it could be \u201csome time\u201d before systems fully recover from the outage his company caused."

            "date": "2024-07-05T12:36:55Z",
            "content": "The labor market started to ease in June, with 206,000 jobs added to the US economy last month, according to new labor data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The number of new jobs is close to what economists had expected for the month. The figures represent a slight cooling compared to May, when the economy added a revised 218,000 jobs. The unemployment rate in June was 4.1%, a 0.1% increase compared with May and the first time the rate has been above 4% in over two years. Data released earlier this week suggested the labor market was starting to cool. Payroll firm ADP reported that private employers added 150,000 jobs in June, down from 157,000 in May. Job losses also appear to be growing. Executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas reported 48,786 job cuts in June, down from 63,816 cuts in May but still a nearly 20% increase compared with June of last year. The jobs figures, released on the first Friday of every month, have been closely watched by Wall Street, which is eager to see interest rates drop, and in Washington, where the strength of hiring has been one of the few bright spots for the Biden administration, which is struggling with poor polling on its economic policies. Along with inflation figures, which come out later in the month, the Federal Reserve uses jobs figures to determine whether the economy is cooling and ready for interest rates to drop. Last month, officials at the Fed kept rates at a two-decade high of around 5.3%, where it has been for nearly a year. The Fed has been trying to bring inflation down to 2%. In May, inflation sat at 3.4% \u2013 lower than its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but still higher than the Fed\u2019s target rate. Minutes from the Fed\u2019s last meeting were released on Wednesday and showed the central bank was waiting for \u201cadditional favorable data\u201d before making cuts. But in bringing inflation down, the Fed must make sure the labor market is not cooling too much. Earlier this week, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said at an event that the economy has \u201cmade a lot of progress\u201d and has \u201cseen a pretty substantial move toward better balance\u201d in the labor market. \u201cWe want to be more confident that inflation is moving sustainably down. We want to understand that the levels that we\u2019re seeing are a true reading on what is actually happening with underlying inflation,\u201d Powell said. Inflation figures for June will be released on 11 July. The Fed\u2019s next meeting is on 30 and 31 July."

            "content": "Vladimir Putin is \u201cpeddling lies\u201d about the strength of the Russian economy that must be refuted, finance ministers from eight EU member states have said, with growing signs of deterioration in the face of biting sanctions. They say there are signs that the economy is being \u201csovietised\u201d with many hallmarks of the former USSR including expropriation of private assets to fund public spending, a \u201ctotal disregard to the social and economic wellbeing of the population\u201d and reorientation of the economy towards its war in Ukraine. \u201cIf Putin stays on this path, the long-term damage to the Russian economy will be significant,\u201d they wrote in a joint article in the Guardian. It was imperative, they said, that western democracies turned the screw amid fears that if there were a ceasefire in Ukraine tomorrow, Russia would spend the next few years regrouping its weakening economy for a second attack on Europe. \u201cBy re-Sovietising the Russian economy, Putin has put it on a path towards its own decline. Now it is time for the west to up the pressure even more. Supporting Ukraine and undermining Russia\u2019s capacity to wage war at every turn should be the top priority of every democratic country,\u201d they said. \u201cPresident Vladimir Putin and his authoritarian regime are peddling the false narrative that the Russian economy is strong, and that its war machine is unharmed by western sanctions. This is a lie that must be refuted. \u201cIn fact, there are many signs that the Russian war economy is deteriorating. The sanctions and other measures to weaken the Russian economy are effective, but even more can be done. We must continue to increase pressure against Putin\u2019s regime and support Ukraine.\u201d The article was written by the finance ministers of Sweden, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Netherlands and Poland, whose prime minister, Donald Tusk, has previously said Europe is in a \u201cpre-war era\u201d similar to 1938. The ministers urged counterparts across Europe and the US to ensure greater vigilance on circumvention of sanctions. But they are also calling on them to get behind a \u201cswift \u2026 operationalisation\u201d of a G7 June agreement to raise up to \u20ac50bn (\u00a342bn) in loans to Ukraine using windfall profits from Russia\u2019s immobilised assets. On Tuesday, the Kremlin said it would take legal action over what it called the \u201ctheft\u201d of its cash reserves, which were frozen after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The ministers also want sanctions on energy, finance and technology products getting into Russia to be strengthened to close down circumvention routes. Both \u201cborder and source countries\u201d of technology including many in the EU and the US needed to \u201ccontinue working on closing the loopholes\u201d. This week, the UK pledged to help crack down on \u201cphantom fleets\u201d of tankers that are sneaking oil out of Russia and selling it for more than the $60 energy sanctions price cap and further fuelling Russia\u2019s war machine."

            "content": "Local councils will have to adopt mandatory housing targets within months under planning reforms to be unveiled on Wednesday as part of Keir Starmer\u2019s first king\u2019s speech, which the prime minister says will be focused on economic growth. Starmer will introduce a package of more than 35 bills on Wednesday, the first Labour prime minister to do so in 15 years, as he looks to put the economy at the centre of his first year in office. Labour will use the next 12 months to introduce laws on planning reform, devolution and public transport, the prime minister will tell parliament. But with ministers prioritising growth above all other political ambitions, the government will not legislate to reduce the voting age or penalise employers for not training and recruiting British workers. Starmer said before the speech: \u201cNow is the time to take the brakes off Britain. For too long people have been held back, their paths determined by where they came from \u2013 not their talents and hard work. \u201cI am determined to create wealth for people up and down the country. It is the only way our country can progress, and my government is focused on supporting that aspiration. \u201cToday\u2019s new laws will take back control and lay the foundations of real change that this country is crying out for, creating wealth in every community and making people better off \u2013 supporting their ambitions, hopes and dreams.\u201d Starmer will introduce his first king\u2019s speech on Wednesday by unveiling a wide array of measures mostly focused on the economy. At its core will be planning change, with Starmer having pledged that his party would be \u201cbuilders, not blockers\u201d. In its first week in office, Labour overturned the previous government\u2019s de facto ban on onshore windfarms in an effort to boost the construction of clean energy generation. The prime minister will announce the next stage of the party\u2019s plans to liberalise the planning system on Wednesday with a bill designed to reimpose mandatory housing targets on local authorities. Michael Gove, the former housing secretary, relaxed those targets last year amid pressure from Tory backbenchers, allowing councils to ignore them if they were deemed to undermine the character of an area. The government also wants local authorities to work together to identify regional infrastructure needs in an attempt to stop individual authorities blocking plans. Officials have told the Guardian they will begin a consultation on the new targets in the next two weeks, with a view to having them in place by the autumn. Angela Rayner, the housing and local government secretary, will oversee the planning proposals as well as a separate bill on English devolution. Local authorities will be required not only to create local housing plans, but also a local growth plan detailing how they intend to support industry and the wider economy in their areas. Louise Haigh, the transport secretary, will steer bills to renationalise the railways and to allow greater public sector involvement in running local bus networks. Under the railways bill, rail services will return to public ownership once contracts with private-sector controllers expire. The bill will create an arms-length body called Great British Railways to monitor passenger satisfaction with new systems and to introduce changes such as automatic compensation across the whole network. The buses bill will give local leaders greater powers to launch publicly owned bus services. Not all the bills in the package are expected to be economically focused. Starmer is expected to announce a House of Lords reform bill which could set the mandatory retirement age for the upper chamber at 80. He is also set to resurrect the plan of his predecessor, Rishi Sunak, to bring in a phased smoking ban, which was dropped in the last-minute flurry of legislation passed after the election was called. Other long-held Labour policies have not made the cut, including the party\u2019s promise to bring the voting age down to 16. Government insiders said they remained committed to the proposal but that bills to help drive economic growth were the priority this time round. One source suggested that voting age changes could wait until closer to the next election, prompting speculation that the plan may never happen at all."

            "date": "2024-07-26T11:00:49Z",
            "content": "A greener economy could bring millions of jobs to some of the largest countries in Africa, according to a new report. Research by the development agency FSD Africa and the impact advisory firm Shortlist predicts that 3.3 million jobs could be generated across the continent by 2030. Forecasting Green Jobs in Africa predicts that 60% of the roles, mainly in the renewable energy sector, will be skilled or white collar positions that can \u201cspur the growth of the middle class in countries with high-growth sectors\u201d such as renewable energy, e-mobility, construction and manufacturing. The report was based on forecasts from five countries \u2013 the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa \u2013 that the study says will see more than a fifth of the jobs expected from the green transition over the next six years. About 10% of the jobs created will demand university degrees, 30% will be \u201cspecialised\u201d work that requires certification or vocational training, and 20% administrative. Unskilled labour will be more stable, with opportunities for upward mobility, the study predicts. \u201cThis is the first public report that takes seriously the notion that human capital and talent is important as an input to green economic growth, and as a positive outcome \u2013 in the form of millions of new, direct jobs,\u201d says Paul Breloff, CEO of Shortlist. The renewable energy sector will generate about 70% of jobs, and roughly 1.7m will be in solar power. DRC and Ethiopia, with Africa\u2019s largest and second largest hydropower potential \u2013 will see jobs in that sector. Agriculture should employ hundreds of thousands, with more than half of those jobs in climate-smart technology. The researchers call on policymakers, funders and educational institutions to invest in training a workforce in green industries, saying it could \u201ccontribute to the formalisation of African economies, and the inclusion of whole populations in stable systems of remuneration, social security and taxation\u201d. \u201cPolicymakers and funders and workforce developers need to step up to meet this near-term demand with effective training, apprenticeships, and job/skill matching, in hopes of achieving Africa\u2019s green promise,\u201d said Breloff. With its young workforce and vast renewable energy resources, Africa can \u201cleapfrog\u201d into renewables, skipping over the carbon-intensive pathways taken by industrialised countries, but, the report\u2019s authors argue, it will require \u201csupportive policies, infrastructure, and significant financial investments, estimated at over $100bn annually\u201d. African countries have struggled to attract renewable energy investments due to investor perceptions of risk and concerns over commercial viability. The continent receives only 3% of global clean energy funding. To meet climate and energy access development goals, investments need to more than double to over \u00a3155bn a year by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the African Development Bank. \u201cYou need a base level of good skills in the country to get investors comfortable putting their money into green investments \u2013 those jobs de-risk investments, investments flow into or within the country. If finance flows, then projects get to be realised, and will create even more new jobs,\u201d said Kevin Munjal, director of development impact at FSD Africa. Some countries, especially those with oil and gas reserves, continue to push back on calls for Africa, which accounts for less than 4% of global carbon emissions, to elevate carbon reduction goals over domestic priorities, such as fossil fuels for economic growth or domestic energy, when 600 million Africans do not have access to electricity. Munjal says that, while \u201cthere is need to think about a just transition\u201d, green growth provides critical potential for jobs and economic growth. \u201cThere is a significant opportunity here to address what is quickly turning into a demographic crisis,\u201d said Munjal. \u201cAfrica has the youngest, fastest-growing workforce but \u2026 the youth need jobs.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-21T10:09:11Z",
            "content": "I\u2019m due a haircut and in the past week received a message from my barber containing the news that the price will be 10% higher than the last time I went for a trim. If I call in for a coffee on my way to work it will be a similar story. After recent price rises, I can expect to pay the thick end of \u00a34 for a flat white. These are two examples of what Rachel Reeves calls the everyday economy in action, and they tell us something about the challenge facing the chancellor as she seeks to improve the UK\u2019s poor economic performance. It\u2019s not hard to see why a haircut and a cup of coffee are going up in price. Rents are higher, insurance is more expensive and so are fuel and labour. Businesses have a choice: they can either absorb these extra costs themselves or they can try to pass them on to their customers. Many are doing the latter, which is why inflation in the services sector is running at 5.7% while overall inflation is at 2%. This matters. These days, the UK is primarily a service-sector economy. Manufacturing and construction are still important, but services account for about 80% of national output. Prices have risen by about 20% in the past three years and labour shortages have made it harder for employers to resist pressure for higher pay to compensate. Much of the service sector is labour-intensive and, unsurprisingly, workers don\u2019t want to see their living standards eroded. The very nature of the service sector makes productivity improvements hard to chisel out. My haircut takes as long as it did a year ago; the flat white comes in the same-sized cup and tastes the same. As a customer, I am getting the same service but paying more for it. As a nation, output per worker is up by 1.5% in the four years since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic; in the public sector \u2013 where Reeves is contemplating above-inflation pay awards this year \u2013 productivity is 6% lower. Productivity is easy to measure in a car factory but harder to assess in the NHS. If a GP spends five minutes more per patient but by doing so saves lives does that count as productivity loss, because of the extra time spent, or (as it should) a productivity gain? Similarly, a restaurant meal might take as long to produce as it did a year ago but be of a higher quality. If this means the customers have a better time than they did before then that\u2019s a productivity improvement in any meaningful sense of the term. But time-wise, it\u2019s no better. Nor is it impossible to think of ways in which technology has helped to boost service-sector productivity. Checking a fact or referring to a previously written article meant a visit to the cuttings\u2019 library when I started as a journalist many moons ago. Now search engines make the process quicker and simpler. Even so, the fact that the UK is a labour-intensive service-sector economy has made the Bank of England warier about cutting interest rates than it might otherwise have been. A blog on Threadneedle Street\u2019s Bank Underground site by a staff member, Tomas Key, found that trend (underlying) wage growth is currently 6%, double its pre-pandemic level. This raises two questions. The first is whether higher wage growth is merely a response to higher inflation and will come down now that prices are rising less quickly. That appears to be the case. The annual growth in average earnings was 5.1% in the year to May compared with 8.2% in the same month of 2023. The second is whether the Bank can do much to bring down wage growth, short of keeping interest rates at a punitive enough level to cause economic distress. The answer is no, not really. Higher interest rates are a crude tool that work by making businesses too nervous to risk raising prices and by forcing workers to accept below-inflation pay increases through the fear of losing their jobs. So far, the evidence is that the economy has withstood a year of interest rates at 5.25% much better than might have been expected. There was a short, shallow, technical recession in the second half of 2023 but activity is now gently recovering. It would be doing so more quickly were it not for the 14 increases in official borrowing costs between December 2021 and August 2023. All that said, the answer to Britain\u2019s productivity weakness does not lie with the Bank of England. Instead, it will depend on changes to the supply side of the economy. Reeves will chair the first meeting of the Treasury\u2019s new growth mission board on Tuesday. Higher levels of private and public investment would help boost productivity and growth. If manufacturing represented a bigger share of national output that would help too because there is more scope for labour-saving efficiencies in a factory than in a care home. Productivity growth would be faster were Britain\u2019s industrial base bigger. AI has the potential to be an a gamechanger, because it will have an impact on all sectors of the economy and not just manufacturing. Indeed, there is already evidence of that happening. Labour is unsure how to regulate AI but if it wants faster productivity growth then AI is going to be an important part of the mix. Even then, though, it is important to be realistic. Britain is going to remain predominantly a service-sector economy and there are services that do not readily lend themselves to productivity gains. A robot cutting my hair? I don\u2019t think so."

            "date": "2024-07-25T07:19:50Z",
            "content": "On his third day in Washington, Benjamin Netanyahu finally got the attention he so desperately wanted in the US capital. Republicans and their guests in the House chamber stamped their feet and whistled as a joint session was gaveled into order, while the Democrat lawmakers who chose not to boycott someone whom colleagues had called a \u201cwar criminal\u201d looked on in sullen silence. In a 56-minute speech punctuated with 50 rounds of applause, the Israeli prime minister dashed hopes of a quick end to the war in Gaza and dispensed red meat to the Republican faithful, blasting anti-war protest culture and vowing to fight until \u201ctotal victory\u201d. For two days, Netanyahu had mostly been ignored at the Watergate hotel, passed over for the spectacle of a US political cycle averaging a West Wing season finale a week. Joe Biden had dropped out of the presidential race amid rumours of his cognitive decline, endorsing the vice-president, Kamala Harris, weeks before the convention and reinvigorating the Democratic party overnight. A bullet had grazed Donald Trump\u2019s ear in an assassination attempt just 11 days ago, sparking comparisons to the resurrection of Lazarus and Jesus Christ. America has been living decades in just weeks; was there even room on the cable TV schedule for Netanyahu to deliver another incendiary speech? But the House speaker, Mike Johnson, a Republican, had put Netanyahu on the schedule on 24 July and neither the US political tumult nor Biden\u2019s bout of Covid-19, nor a requested international criminal court warrant accusing him of \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d would deter Israel\u2019s prime minister from coming to Washington to make his case before Congress for a record fourth time (once more than Winston Churchill). So when he had his moment, Netanyahu stood up to give a speech filled with verve but absolutely devoid of details: when and how Israel\u2019s war in Gaza would come to an end and the 120 remaining hostages kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October would be brought home. There was a vague reference to a \u201ccivilian administration run by Palestinians who do not seek to destroy Israel\u201d after his \u201ctotal victory\u201d, a \u201cvision for Gaza\u201d that said the strip of land would be \u201cdemilitarised and deradicalised\u201d. But Netanyahu gave no vision of how to get there, besides more of the same, which has already left an estimated 39,000 Palestinians dead on top of the 1,200 Israelis killed by Hamas on 7 October. This was not a speech declaring a ceasefire, a word that was not uttered once by Netanyahu, despite weeks of negotiations with Hamas and the Biden administration\u2019s insistence that a \u201cframework\u201d had already been agreed. Shortly after the speech, a senior administration official conceded there may still be some \u201cvery serious implementation issues that still have to be resolved\u201d. On the streets outside the Capitol, police deployed teargas and pepper spray as protests descended into melees so confused that anti-Netanyahu protesters from different factions ended up clashing angrily with one another. Despite the violence, pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protesters voiced frustration with the Israeli prime minister and a war that had killed thousands with no resolution in sight. Jessica Pliska, a pro-Palestinian protester who carried a sign calling Netanyahu \u201cSatanyahu\u201d, said she drove 11 hours from Michigan to demonstrate against his address. \u201cI feel disappointed in our government. The fact that the person perpetrating these war crimes is invited to our Congress is insidious. \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful that people are boycotting,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it shows a moral imperative among the masses to come out and protest, not only here in the streets but in Congress as well.\u201d Several blocks away, Brad Young, a dual US-Israeli citizen from North Carolina, said he was \u201cvery much in favour of the Israeli right to exist but [I] believe that the government in place right now is corrupt and not acting in the best interests of Israel or of anyone in the region. It\u2019s outrageous that Bibi [Netanyahu] is here and speaking to Congress when he should be focused on sealing the deal and bringing the hostages home.\u201d When he finally took the rostrum on Thursday, Netanyahu quickly waded knee-deep into the American culture wars that have divided the US ahead of the presidential elections. At times it can feel that US politics has become the world\u2019s politics, particularly when foreign leaders curry favour with Donald Trump and parrot his politics before the vote. Netanyahu used his hour to lambast woke culture and the pro-Palestinian protest movement, echoing the Republican talking points of the moment. Somewhere between calling protesters \u201cIran\u2019s useful idiots\u201d and saying those holding signs reading \u201cgays for Gaza\u201d might as well call themselves \u201cchickens for KFC\u201d, the Israeli prime minister brought up the North Carolina frat boys who surrounded the US flag during a pro-Palestinian protest at the campus of Chapel Hill UNC. \u201cUSA! USA! USA!\u201d his backers in the hall chanted, their shouts echoing off the walls. Netanyahu would be at home at a football match or a stump speech, but his remarks in Congress on Wednesday gave little sign that this war is any closer to coming to an end."

            "content": "\u201cThere are decades in which nothing happens, and weeks in which decades happen.\u201d That aphorism, misattributed to Lenin and repeatedly cited by Steve Bannon, might have been coined for the last seven days. A single week in the US has encompassed the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, his acceptance of the Republican presidential nomination at a triumphalist convention, and reports that Joe Biden \u2013 struck down by Covid \u2013 is contemplating quitting his re-election bid amid mounting pressure from senior Democrats. Look back only two weeks further and the political picture encompasses the disastrous debate that began the frenzy over Mr Biden\u2019s candidacy, the supreme court\u2019s momentous ruling on immunity, which transformed the relationship between president and people, and the shocking dismissal of the criminal case against Mr Trump over classified documents. No wonder the mood at the Republican national convention felt more like an election night celebration to some observers. The party feels invincible, drunk on the contrast between the images of a Covid-stricken, stumbling president Biden and his bloodied but death-defying, fist-pumping predecessor. Even as Mr Trump took to the stage in Milwaukee, there were growing reports of senior Democrats making it clear that they didn\u2019t believe Mr Biden can win. His campaign\u2019s insistence on Friday that he was staying in the race failed to staunch calls for him to quit. There has been a spate of reports that he could step down following interventions from key party figures, concerned not only about the White House but also down-ballot races. Replacing Mr Biden would not be a guaranteed fix, still less a quick one. The most likely scenario appears to be that the party would coalesce around his vice-president, Kamala Harris. Democrats hope that, at 59, she could turn the question of age against 78-year-old Mr Trump. But his choice of 39-year-old JD Vance as vice-presidential nominee would make that harder, and it would be hard for Ms Harris to run as the change candidate against a former president when she is in the White House. The bigger stage might allow her to shine and improve her unimpressive poll ratings, but the racist and misogynistic attacks against her would surely intensify. The alternative, an open convention, might seize the spotlight back from the Republicans and create momentum in a reinvigorated Democratic campaign. Yet it could also leave the party without a breakout star, but with Ms Harris and other plausible candidates dented by their attacks on each other. As November approaches, dread grows among Democrats and those who fear a second Trump administration and all that it might bring. Mr Trump has proved astonishingly impervious to scandal and even criminal conviction (only two months ago). Nonetheless, he is strikingly unpopular and victory remains in the hands of a relatively small number of voters in a small number of states. His interminable acceptance speech began with a soothing message of unity but soon veered back into familiar lies, grievances, preposterous claims about his abilities and achievements and invective about an \u201cinvasion\u201d by migrants. For some Democrats, at least, it was not only a reminder of why he must be beaten, but that he still can be. As a candidate, he is not unstoppable. Should he regain power, the supreme court has ensured that he might be. There are still three and a half months to go. His opponents cannot afford to despair; they must use every moment to their advantage."

After a passionate and dramatic debate in the Welsh parliament on Tuesday evening, the government\u2019s counsel general, Mick Antoniw, said the legislation would be introduced before the next Welsh elections in two years\u2019 time. He said: \u201cThe Welsh government will bring forward legislation before 2026 for the disqualification of members and candidates found guilty of deliberate deception through an independent judicial process.\u201d Antoniw said the practical details of how a law to tackle lying would work would need to be worked out and he called for cross-party cooperation. The Plaid Cymru politician Adam Price, who has led the calls for lying by politicians to be outlawed, said: \u201cWhat has been announced is truly historic, globally pioneering. We have a commitment from our government that our democracy will be the first in the world to introduce a general prohibition on deception by politicians. \u201cWe are at the beginning of a global movement. We are going to outlaw political lying.\u201d Price said truth was at the heart of democracy, but there had been a collapse in trust in politicians. He said: \u201cThat is an existential threat. A democracy starts to break down if the electors can\u2019t trust what the elected say. \u201cWe have to innovate, we have to try different things. It\u2019s a small minority of politicians, populist demagogues, that deliberately distort the truth for their own political gain, but they poison the well for everyone. It is never acceptable for politicians to deliberately deceive.\u201d During the debate, the Labour member Alun Davies accused the leader of the Tories in Wales, Andrew RT Davies, of tweeting a \u201cdirect lie\u201d earlier on Tuesday that Labour want to pay illegal immigrants \u00a31,600 a month. He said: \u201cThis takes our politics into the gutter and stops us engaging with each other in real political debate.\u201d Another Labour member, Lee Waters, said: \u201cBoris Johnson lied his way to Downing Street and lied his way out again. Politics in this country has become darker. The public needs to know they can trust what is being said. Lying cannot become the norm.\u201d While several other countries have laws that ban lying in certain circumstances, the Welsh version is set to go further. The co-director of the thinktank Compassion in Politics, Jennifer Nadel, welcomed the announcement. She said: \u201cPublic confidence in politicians is at an all-time low. This move is the beginning of a political reset. Voters want honesty and this means that Wales will become the first country to insist that politicians and candidates are obliged by law to tell the truth. \u201cLying in politics has for too long been normalised. Voters expect and deserve more and now they will have it.\u201d Sam Fowles, a barrister who has been advising Adam Price, said: \u201cTruth-telling is essential to democracy. As voters, we should be entitled to rely on the statements made by our elected representatives. \u201cThis measure will ensure that politicians are held to the same standards as lawyers and doctors who already have enforceable truth-telling obligations. This seems to me to be long overdue.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-07-05T19:08:18Z",
            "content": "Keir Starmer, who has just secured the biggest election victory in the UK this century to become prime minister, is considered reserved by the British public. In marked contrast to his best-known recent predecessor, the joke-telling Boris Johnson, Starmer invests the task of being a political leader with considerable seriousness, reflecting a career in which he was previously a human rights lawyer and, for five years from 2008, Britain\u2019s chief public prosecutor. Making his first speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street on Friday, Starmer said with characteristic understatement that he would be a leader for \u201cstability and moderation\u201d and pledged \u201cchange, national renewal and a return to the politics of public service\u201d. Starmer became the MP for Holborn and St Pancras, just north of central London, in 2015 and leader of the left-leaning Labour party in 2020, a year after its worst election defeat for 85 years. Now he has a 170-strong majority in the House of Commons. He will have to keep an eye on a potentially noisy group of five Reform UK MPs led by Nigel Farage, who will seek to focus on immigration and particularly people crossing the Channel in small boats. The last prime minister, Rishi Sunak, promised to stop the boats without having any means of doing so. There is no easy practical solution. That Starmer has brought the party of Tony Blair back into power so decisively after 14 years out of office is a huge achievement, but negative personal ratings from pollsters such as YouGov reinforce the idea that Starmer\u2019s victory is a reflection of Conservative unpopularity. During the election campaign Starmer more successfully highlighted his relatively humble upbringing than his political agenda. In television appearances and news interviews he would repeatedly refer to his working-class background to counteract the idea he was an elite leftwing London lawyer. So many times had Starmer mentioned that his father was a toolmaker who worked in a factory that on one TV appearance the audience laughed at him when he said it again. In response, Starmer continued with his point, though slightly humourlessly. \u201cIt\u2019s true \u2013 my mum was a nurse \u2013 and we couldn\u2019t make ends meet. Which is not a laughing matter,\u201d he said, emphasising the contrast with Sunak, whose family is worth over \u00a3600m largely through the wealth of his wife, Akshata Murty. Starmer fought a cautious campaign and he rarely misspeaks or provides his opponents with gifts to attack. His most serious misjudgment, particularly surprising given his past work in human rights, came last October, four days after Hamas\u2019s deadly attack on Israel, when he was asked if Jerusalem had the right to besiege Gaza by cutting off power and water to the strip. \u201cI think Israel does have that right,\u201d Starmer replied, though he also emphasised the importance of respecting international law. Starvation, including denial of water and electricity, is generally considered a war crime, but it was nine days before he clarified that he had only meant to say Israel had a \u201cright to self-defence\u201d. Since then, Starmer has become quietly more engaged on the Gaza issue, with his party pressing for a tougher stance on Israel. He met Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the emir of Qatar, a key mediator in the conflict, in early December and has discussed the Middle East crisis with Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser. Critics on the left accuse Starmer of having dropped more radical policies that were a feature of his campaign to become party leader in 2020, which began with a slick campaign video that even emphasised his belief that the Blair-supported invasion of Iraq in 2003 was unlawful."

            "content": "Barack Obama has endorsed Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for US president, meaning the vice-president has now won the backing of all the party\u2019s politically active high-profile figures for her White House bid. The former president had conspicuously withheld his endorsement in the immediate aftermath of Joe Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw from the campaign, and was initially believed to favour an open nominating contest at next month\u2019s Democratic national convention in Chicago. But after Harris earned the backing of Bill and Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, a host of state governors and the most senior Democrats in Congress \u2013 as well as Biden himself \u2013 Obama has added his voice in what amounts to a major boost for the vice-president. The 44th president was joined by wife Michelle, the former first lady, in a phone call with Harris that was filmed and released by her campaign on Friday. In the video, Harris is seen listening to the Obamas on an iPhone in her right hand. \u201cI can\u2019t have this phone call without saying to my girl Kamala: I am proud of you,\u201d Michelle Obama says. \u201cThis is going to be historic.\u201d Barack Obama weighs in: \u201cWe called to say Michelle and I couldn\u2019t be prouder to endorse you and do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office.\u201d Smiling, standing near a vehicle, Harris replies: \u201cOh my goodness. Michelle, Barack, this means so much to me, I am looking forward to doing this with the two of you, Doug and I both. And getting out there, being on the road.\u201d She adds: \u201cBut most of all, I just wanna tell you that the words you have spoken and the friendship that you have given over all these years mean more than I can express. So thank you both! It means so much. And, and we\u2019re gonna have some fun with this too, aren\u2019t we?\u201d The endorsement comes as the Harris campaign, which has made a flying start, launches a \u201cweekend of action\u201d marking 100 days until the election with more than 170,000 volunteers and 2,300 events across battleground states. Obama was the first Black US president and is endorsing a candidate who, if she wins against Donald Trump in November, will become the first woman, first Black woman and first person of south Asian descent to serve as president. Harris has narrowed the gap with Trump in opinion polls, trailing him 48% to 47% among likely voters in a New York Times/ Siena College survey. Trump was leading Biden by six percentage points in this poll after their debate."

            "date": "2024-07-08T20:17:17Z",
            "content": "\u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters, OK \u2026 It\u2019s, like, incredible.\u201d The ruling of the US supreme court in Trump v United States last week establishes that the president has immunity from prosecution for \u201cofficial acts\u201d taken while in office. The term \u201cofficial acts\u201d was not defined in the case, leaving it for lower courts and establishing a precedent that the president broadly cannot be held accountable for breaking the law except under narrow conditions, or by impeachment, which itself only removes him from office without further consequence. \u201cThe court effectively creates a law-free zone around the president, upsetting the status quo that has existed since the Founding,\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a scathing dissent. This new official-acts immunity now \u201clies about like a loaded weapon for any president that wishes to place his own interests, his own political survival, or his own financial gain, above the interests of the nation\u201d. The decision seems to grant nearly limitless power to the office. Any act a president takes in the \u201ccore\u201d functions of the job, such as appointing judges or issuing pardons, have absolute immunity. Any act taken in the \u201cperiphery\u201d of his powers, like directions made to his staff or announcements made through official channels to the public, are presumed to be immune from prosecution, barring the finding of a judge otherwise. Acts taken outside of his official duties are not immune, though again: a judge makes that determination using ill-defined terms. It is roughly equivalent to the \u201cenabling acts\u201d of Nazi Germany. Coupled with the power of pardon \u2013 which allows the president to immunize anyone he or she chooses from federal prosecution without review or challenge from the other branches of government \u2013 the president can instruct subordinates of his or her choosing to act without regard for legal consequences. The idea that the president might declare a political opponent an enemy of the state and have a military sniper kill that person was raised as a hypothetical during oral arguments, and the resulting decision, incredibly, does not categorically rule that act a prosecutable abuse of power. Instead, we\u2019re left in a fuzzy legal space, with judges left to decide what is \u201cpresumptively\u201d immune and what evidence can be allowed to prosecutors after the fact to challenge that presumption. What might have once been an academic or intellectual exercise, the stuff of Tom Clancy novels or Aaron Sorkin scripts, is rapidly resolving into focus as a meaningful real-world problem. As I hear people discussing the ruling \u2013 and random people are discussing it everywhere I go \u2013 that\u2019s the first thing they reach for. But the implications of the ruling and its effect on executive power are farther reaching than this. In some ways we have always been in a fuzzy legal space with regard to executive power. The assassination of a US citizen ordered by the president is not without precedent. Consider that Barack Obama ordered drone strikes on Anwar al-Awlaki, Samir Khan, and 16-year-old Abdulrahman al-Awlaki in Yemen in 2010. The then president did not face prosecution for this action. The question Trump v United States raises is whether he could have before now. How might a rogue president without political or moral constraint use the office for private gain, the punishment of political enemies, or to subvert the interest of justice and the public good? Start by looking at how executive power is exercised. The president has a set of delineated powers. Some require him to act in concert with others \u2013 the president signs treaties, but they must be ratified by the Senate. The president cannot draft a law unilaterally. Judicial appointments, ambassadorial appointments and appointments of cabinet members must be approved by the Senate. But much of executive authority is unilateral. The president can represent the US to foreign countries without constraint. The president commands the military, directs the activities of the CIA and FBI, directs the actions of executive branch employees, classifies or declassifies intelligence, and critically, grants pardons without review. Consider each branch of executive authority, by department, and how a malevolent president might subvert the law. Department of State The constitution\u2019s emoluments clause requires the president to refrain from accepting any gift, payment, or anything of value from a foreign state or its rulers. The state department maintains a protocol gift unit that makes sure the president or other federal employees don\u2019t pocket anything from a foreign government worth more than a nominal amount, currently set at $480. Trump v United States establishes that the president cannot be prosecuted for this crime, even though it is black letter constitutional law. Receiving a gift from a head of state as president is almost certainly an \u201cofficial act\u201d, and if the president decides to steal that gift and deposit it in a bank account, or accepts the deed to a golf course in Dubai or a yacht that never makes port in the United States, there\u2019s nothing that can be done about it, except to see if a federal prosecutor can introduce sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of immunity after the fact. The ruling opens up potential for a foreign government to bribe their way out of state sanctions, an embargo or diplomatic trouble from, say, murdering a journalist working for a US newspaper. Department of the Treasury There are many levers here that a corrupt president can pull, but I\u2019d like to focus on impoundment; the act of withholding money allocated by Congress for a specific function. It was an act of impoundment that led to Trump\u2019s first impeachment and an issue that Steve Bannon repeatedly returns to when discussing executive power. Congress made impoundment a crime in 1974 after the abuses of Richard Nixon. The supreme court\u2019s ruling affirms that the only remedy to this \u201chigh crime\u201d is impeachment. Consider what would happen if the treasury department impounded funds directed toward any other government agency that wasn\u2019t being cooperative. Medicare and Medicaid. HUD. The EPA. A compliant treasury official could simply stop sending the Department of Education funding, which would prevent the issuance of new federally-backed student loans for college. There are other broader avenues for misconduct, however. Consider what would happen if the president instructed the secretary of the treasury to unilaterally withhold payment on bonds issued by the US government to specific creditors, all questions about the full faith and credit clause be damned. Consider how the IRS might target political opponents, a touchstone for conservative critics of the federal government and the investigation of church abuse of exempt tax status. Even the implied threat of regulation of financial instruments like cryptocurrencies can create changes in the market. A self-interested president who had not placed his or her personal investments in a blind trust could engage in wide market manipulation to his or herown benefit through regulatory action taken by treasury officials. And then there\u2019s treasury\u2019s role as the overseer of financial sanctions on entities like Russian oligarchs, Israeli settlers, Chinese government agents and international terror groups. A pliant or compromised president could redirect resources away from enforcement. Again, the legal question becomes one of presumptive immunity, as these areas are in the \u201cperiphery\u201d of the president\u2019s authority. Note that justices ruled that official acts cannot be used in evidence to support the prosecution of a crime committed in the president\u2019s personal capacity, a complication which renders the practical prosecution of crimes of fraud, the use of public office for private gain or market manipulation difficult. Department of Defense Military officers in the US have maintained the armed services as an objectively apolitical institution stretching back to America\u2019s founding. Its general officers have resisted attempts to change that. The approach of Project 2025 is to reduce the number of general officers because it is easier to find people who will place their loyalty \u2013 and their career prospects \u2013 inTrump\u2019s hands. The military has about 1,000 men and women serving in the ranks of generals and admirals. Approximately 40,000 people serve at the rank of 0-5 or higher \u2013 that is a lieutenant colonel in the US army, air force, marines or space force, or a commander in the navy. Promotion of an officer to this rank requires approval by the Senate. But the president can fire an officer more or less at will. This is certainly true for removing general officers from command \u201cin a time of war\u201d. The statute does not define what a time of war means; it does not contain language requiring Congress to declare war. A president intent on launching military action that is illegal or immoral \u2013 calling a Seal Team 6 operator to kill an American overseas, or perhaps someone within the United States \u2013 today can be expected to face a refusal to obey an unlawful order and a report to Congress. But a malevolent president can simply fire any officer who refuses the order, working through the ranks until he finds one willing to obey an illegal order, offering a presidential pardon that would immunize whoever obeys the order from the consequences of a court martial. This logic extends to orders for the military to violate posse comitatus \u2013 the mobilization of military force domestically, a violation of federal law. It could also extend to the use of nuclear arms, with a president serially firing officers who refuse to arm and launch a nuclear weapon. The president\u2019s management of the military is a \u201ccore\u201d function of the president; it is described in article II of the US constitution. Thus, the president likely enjoys absolute immunity from prosecution here. The functions of military intelligence, the CIA and the Department of Justice are separated by a wall of laws meant to protect US citizens from the government\u2019s vast capacity for foreign military surveillance. After discovering abuses within the intelligence community in the Nixon era, Congress established a foreign intelligence surveillance court to review the work of the CIA and ensure that spies were not illegally surveilling US citizens. A president unconcerned with the law could simply walk intelligence gathered from one agency to another, with orders to act on it. Department of Justice Much of the constraint on abuses by the attorney general\u2019s office are a matter of custom, not law. A set of internal policy guidelines governs the conduct of US attorneys. Surprisingly, the supreme court decision last month overturning the Chevron doctrine or the principle of legal deference to agency rule-making, may have done as much harm as Trump v United States in this regard. Justice department rules constraining federal investigators from targeting people for their politics \u2013 or targeting politicians who aren\u2019t voting the right way \u2013 can be challenged on this basis by a politically-motivated appointee. The larger problem involves the new evidence standard for examining misconduct created by the immunity case. Under the ruling, it is improper to even introduce evidence of criminality with regard to \u201cofficial acts\u201d of the president. If the president ordered an FBI official to break the law with an illegal wiretap or search, there is no mechanism for that crime to be unearthed in court if the president invokes this defense. The target may never learn their rights were violated. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 July 2024 to clarify the legal challenges around presumptive immunity."

            "date": "2024-07-24T18:13:15Z",
            "content": "Mexico\u2019s president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has written to his \u201cfriend\u201d Donald Trump warning that any attempt to close the US-Mexico border if he is re-elected would spark a \u201crebellion\u201d on both sides. Trump made the pledge during his speech at the Republican national convention, where he spoke about the \u201cmassive invasion at our southern border that spread misery, crime, poverty, disease and destruction to communities all across our land\u201d. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s letter emphasised the economic integration between the two countries and the damage to \u201cpeople, industry and commerce\u201d that closing the border would bring. California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, together with the six border states in Mexico, \u201crepresent the fourth biggest economy in the world\u201d, while 1 million people and 300,000 vehicles cross the border every day, wrote the Mexican leader popularly known as Amlo. Many of those vehicles carry cargo as part of the USMCA free trade agreement among the US, Mexico and Canada, which L\u00f3pez Obrador defended as making goods cheaper for US consumers and being \u201cthe only way to successfully confront the competition brought by the economic and commercial advance of China\u201d. L\u00f3pez Obrador also asked Trump to bear in mind that almost 40 million Mexicans live in the US, that seven of every 10 agricultural workers in the US are Mexican, and that Mexicans contributed $325bn to the US economy last year. But, he added: \u201cI understand that you are campaigning and that you are not \u2013 as some believe \u2013 obstinate\u201d. The letter is not the first the veteran leftist has sent to Trump, with whom he struck an unlikely friendship on coming to power. While on the campaign trail in 2017, L\u00f3pez Obrador wrote a book called Listen Up, Trump, in which he compared Trump\u2019s comments about Mexicans to the ways Nazis talked about Jews. Yet the two confounded expectations when they overlapped as presidents from 2018 to 2020, developing an outwardly friendly relationship as two plain-speaking nationalists at the head of anti-establishment movements, despite their apparent ideological differences. Behind the belligerent rhetoric, both were happy to have a transactional relationship on issues such as migration, largely staying out of each other\u2019s domestic issues. As Mexican presidents can only serve one six-year term, L\u00f3pez Obrador will leave power on 1 October. Mexico\u2019s incoming president, Claudia Sheinbaum, is a close political ally of L\u00f3pez Obrador and has promised to continue his policies, but is a very different figure. Where L\u00f3pez Obrador is a folksy populist from the southern state of Tabasco, Sheinbaum is a climate scientist from the intellectual circle of Mexico City. If Trump is re-elected as president, Sheinbaum will be his counterpart in Mexico for the duration of his term \u2013 but it seems unlikely she will have the same personal rapport with Trump that L\u00f3pez Obrador did. Aside from promising to close the border, Trump has repeatedly threatened the possibility of military strikes on organised crime groups in Mexican territory if he is re-elected. Speaking on Fox News on Tuesday, Trump said cartels were killing 300,000 people a year with fentanyl \u2013 the true figure of fentanyl deaths in the US is closer to 70,000 \u2013 and that they could \u201ctake out a [Mexican] president in two minutes\u201d if they wanted to. JD Vance, the Republican candidate for vice-president, added that Mexico was at risk of becoming a \u201cnarco-state\u201d if action was not taken. Asked whether the option of military action within the territory of the US\u2019s biggest trading partner was still on the table, Trump responded: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d"

The operation was established in July this year, targeting alleged offenders involved in \u201cviolent crimes including assaulting elderly passengers, intimidating public transport workers or touching women without consent,\u201d according to the statement. Supt Andrew Evans says these crimes have left victims with serious physical and emotional injuries.

As for the Pacific, the bureau\u2019s Access model is forecasting neutral conditions to endure even as four of the seven models it surveys forecast a La Nina will form later in the year. \u201cSince June, the rate and extent of cooling both at the surface and at depth [in the Pacific] have slowed,\u201d BoM said. \u201cCompared with earlier forecasts, the potential for La Ni\u00f1a development is now later in spring.\u201d Let\u2019s see if a La Nina happens. (We\u2019ve not had three La Ninas followed by an El Ni\u00f1o and then another La Nina, at least according to reliable records.) Meanwhile, there\u2019s also a divergence in the Indian Ocean between the bureau and other models. Most are pointing to a negative-phase of the IO dipole by the spring, while BoM\u2019s model leans the other way, with a positive phase likely. Something\u2019s awry. A negative IOD is more likely in concert with a La Nina than a positive one, and would tend to reinforce the wetter-than-average odds for much of Australia for spring into the summer. Weather nerds aren\u2019t the only people wondering what\u2019s going to happen. Farmers and holidaymakers are among those keen to know if conditions might tilt towards damper or drier than usual conditions. Stay tuned for future updates. Avian influenza response continues in Victoria Agriculture Victoria is continuing to respond to the detection of high pathogenicity avian influenza at eight Victorian poultry farms, it said in a statement released today. No new infected properties have been identified in just under one month. Between 120 and 160 staff have been deployed daily to conduct surveillance work, including property visits, phone calls and dead bird collections. Some 5,000 surveillance activities have been completed, and more than 16,300 samples tested, according to the statement. All commercial poultry farms in the area are undergoing a comprehensive surveillance program while Agriculture Victoria staff work with affected properties in decontamination, and disposal of egg and litter. Nearby residents are being texted and called by Agriculture Victoria to confirm the health of poultry on their property, the statement continues. There are movement controls in place near Terang, Meredith and Lethbridge, where permits are required for the movement of birds, poultry products and feed. A housing requirement is also restricting birds on or near infected properties to their enclosures to avoid contact with wild birds. Victoria\u2019s chief veterinary officer, Dr Graeme Cooke, says: We appreciate that in these areas it\u2019s not always easy to have your birds housed and we thank bird owners for their essential support to prevent the spread of this disease, as the risk of the disease remains. I\u2019d also like to acknowledge the poultry industry for their ongoing assistance as we work to eradicate avian influenza from Victoria. It\u2019s already been a huge effort, but we encourage all primary producers to remain vigilant and report any unwell poultry to the VicEmergency Hotline on 1800 226 226. Many thanks for joining me on today\u2019s blog, Rafqa Touma will take you through the rest of our rolling coverage. Take care. The Australian Embassy in Paris is making urgent enquiries with French authorities, following reports an Australian citizen has been assaulted in Paris. Local media reported that an Australian woman in her 20s had allegedly been gang raped, before taking refuge in a restaurant. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement it \u201cstands ready to provide consular assistance.\u201d Queenslanders casting votes earlier on election days, says electoral commission Continuing from our last post, Queensland electoral commissioner Pat Vidgen says, for years, Queenslanders have been shifting to early voting, and that accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic. For these elections, we saw around 45% of all votes cast on election day, which was a significant departure from the 35% turnout we had anticipated \u2013 a figure based on trend data and modelling of voter behaviour in recent elections, both here and in other states. We know this shift in voter behaviour placed additional pressure on our people and our resources on election day, particularly in more populous parts of Queensland \u2013 and subsequently impacted on the voting experience for some electors. Vidgen says the report\u2019s recommendations will be in place for the Queensland state election on 26 October. Voters queued for hours, some denied a vote in 2024 Queensland council elections, report finds Hundreds of thousands of Queenslanders were forced to wait up to three hours to vote in council elections earlier this year and some were denied a vote at all because the electoral commission dramatically underestimated the number of people who would vote on election day, a report has found. An independent review by consultancy Nous Group of the local government elections held on 16 March this year found that the Electoral Commission of Queensland \u201cdid not adequately account for how voting preferences would change from 2020,\u201d when the last council election was held, leading to understaffing. The ECQ forecast that 35% of people would vote on the day. In reality, 46.6% voted,, causing huge lines on election day. About 29% of election day voters waited longer than 30 minutes to vote and 36% of them were dissatisfied with the polling process. The ECQ also aimed to save money on staff to reduce costs to councils, who pay most of the cost of holding elections in Queensland. Staff at a few polling placesreported incidents of voters passing out in queues, the report found. Ballots ran out at 18 polling places, with one polling booth first running out at 10:30 a.m, \u201cbefore twice requiring additional resupply during election day\u201d. The longest period a polling booth had to be shut due to ballot paper shortages was about two hours, the report found. A small subset of voters was unable to vote at all on election day and others abandoned the queues due to long wait times, it found. About 91% of election day polling places saw turnout that exceeded their forecasts. Some saw turnout of more than 200% to 300% of forecasts. The report recommends the ECQ encourage more Queenslanders to use other methods, like pre-polling or voting by mail, to reduce the burden in future elections. An Australian tourist has died in Thailand, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has confirmed. In a statement, Dfat says it is providing consular assistance to the family of an Australian who has died in Thailand. We send our deepest condolences to the family at this difficult time. Owing to our privacy obligations, we are unable to provide further comment. Multiple outlets have reported that the man was allegedly stabbed after an argument at a restaurant. Independent schools requesting support over misuse of AI to alter images of staff and students, inquiry hears Independent Schools Australia says independent schools are already requesting support to deal with instances of the misuse of generative AI to alter images of staff and students to make deepfake pornographic images or to create digital audio fakes of staff with inappropriate sexualised or racist language, a parliamentary committee has heard. Independent Schools Australia says in its submission to the inquiry that the Association of Independent Schools NSW has already fielded several requests related to this misuse of AI. Speaking before the inquiry on legislation aimed at criminalising the spread of deepfake pornographic images, Independent Schools Australia\u2019s director of education policy, Tracey Taylor, says: The way that the apps are changing so rapidly, it\u2019s very easy for them to then manipulate someone else\u2019s speaking, and even the technology is coming to a point where they could even have the video of that person speaking, not just the language itself. She says the legislation needs to be future-proofed as much as possible so new legislation isn\u2019t required six months down the track when the technology advances. I think it won\u2019t just be deep fake sexual imagery \u2026. It\u2019s already happening with political views and things like that, so it\u2019s a huge issue for all of society. More details about shark attack at Port Macquarie beach A man believed to be in his 20s has been taken to hospital with critical injuries after being attacked by a shark, AAP reports. Bystanders used makeshift tourniquets to treat the man\u2019s wounds after he was bitten in the leg at North Shore beach, near Port Macquarie on the NSW mid-north coast. Emergency services were called to the scene at about 11am after reports of a shark attack. The man was taken to Port Macquarie hospital with a leg injury. He was in a critical but stable condition. Beachgoers and a surfer were treating the man when lifeguards arrived from nearby Town beach, Port Macquarie-Hastings lifeguards said in a statement on social media. Nearby beaches will be closed for at least 24 hours. Federal government to award new acreage for offshore petroleum exploration, carbon capture The Albanese government has announced it will award new acreage for offshore petroleum exploration and carbon capture and storage off western and southern Australia. The resources minister Madeleine King says the government is finalising permits for Esso and Beach Energy in the Otway and Sorrell basins \u201cwith any discovered gas to support the domestic east coast market\u201d. She says the government is finalising permits for Chevron, INPEX, Melbana and Woodside Energy on Australia\u2019s west coast. The government is also finalising 10 permits for offshore carbon capture and storage exploration. Climate groups and environment groups reacted quickly to the announcement, with the Wilderness Society describing the release of new petroleum acreage as \u201creckless\u201d and the Climate Council saying \u201cmore gas means more climate pollution harming our kids and more unnatural disasters driving up our costs of living\u201d. Louise Morris from the Australian Marine Conservation Society says some of the permits would be issued despite strong community opposition to seismic testing in areas such as the Otway Basin: These permits for exploration for gas and carbon pollution dumping will impact some of the most important areas for our endangered marine life. She says offshore carbon capture and storage is being used \u201cto prolong the life of the fossil fuel industry\u201d. King said gas \u201csupply challenges could persist into the mid-2030s unless new sources of gas supply are developed\u201d: As ageing coal generation comes offline in coming years, gas will continue to be needed to firm renewable energy generation and as a backup during peak energy use periods. A Sydney man has been chargedwith allegedly trafficking a child from Indonesia, as the Australian Federal Police says it has removed seven potential victims from sexual exploitation. The 43-year-old Arncliffe man is expected to appear before Downing Centre court today after a complex AFP-led investigation in Australia and Indonesia. The man has been charged with one count of trafficking in children, carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years, and was arrested at his Arncliffe home this month. It will be alleged he facilitated the transportation of a 17-year-old from Indonesia to Sydney to engage in sex work. The investigation began in December 2022 after the AFP received intelligence alleging foreign nationals were arriving in Australia and being forced into sexual servitude in breach of their visa conditions. Investigators identified the Arncliffe man as the alleged on-shore facilitator for multiple women who had arrived in Australia and subsequently engaged in sex work. A woman in Jakarta was identified as allegedly helping recruit women to travel to Australia. The Port Macquarie Hastings Lifeguards have shared a statement to social media, following a shark attack at North Shore beach on the NSW mid-north coast today. It said lifeguards responded to a \u201cserious shark attack\u201d around 11am, where \u201csome members of public and a fellow surfer were rendering assistance by using makeshift tourniquets.\u201d Beaches between North Shore and Lighthouse Beach (Tacking Point) are closed and will remain closed for at least 24 hours. \u2018Appalling\u2019: thieves steal first world war memorial honour roll A Sydney council has lashed the \u201cappalling\u201d disappearance of a bronze honour roll commemorating the service of local residents during the first world war. As AAP reports, Ku-ring-gai council \u2013 in the city\u2019s north \u2013 has called in police to investigate the late-night theft from a local park. The 2m-high bronze plate missing from the gate of Turramurra Memorial Park listed the names of 67 residents, including seven who died in battle. The memorial was opened in 1928 by then-NSW governor Dudley de Chair and was funded through community donations, mayor Sam Ngai said: It provided an ongoing and solemn reminder of the service of local residents fighting for our nation on faraway battlefields. It is appalling to think that, nearly 100 years on, the roll has been stolen in the dead of night. Ngai said police were investigating the theft and encouraged any witnesses to come forward. Police have been contacted for comment. IT outage compensation talk inevitable: CrowdStrike Back to the fallout from Friday\u2019s global IT outage, with more from AAP: The outage, which hit an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide, was caused by a logic flaw in a software update sent by cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike to its customers, the company\u2019s Australian president Michael Sentonas told Sky News (which we covered earlier in the blog here). Sentonas conceded it would be hard to avoid affected businesses seeking compensation or litigation. Those conversations have to happen and will happen. That phase will come after we get our customers remediated. While the full cost of the outage is difficult to quantify, some experts have estimated the impact to businesses globally at over $1bn, with Business NSW estimating the bill to top $200m in that state alone. Airline Jetstar was particularly hard hit, with hundreds of cancelled flights leaving thousands of customers stranded. Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said it remains to be seen whether businesses would be able to seek compensation, either from CrowdStrike directly or via some form of government redress scheme. Willox told ABC News: It\u2019s impacted different businesses and different sectors of the economy in wildly different ways, and the reality is we\u2019re going to be seeing the tailpipe of this for weeks to come. A Port Macquarie beach is \u201cclosed until further notice following a serious shark incident today\u201d, according to NSW Shark Smart. The notice comes amid reports of a man suffering a leg injury after a shark attack at North Shore beach on the mid-north coast, New South Wales. A tagged white shark was detected in the area earlier today. More to come. Medical devices at risk under 3G closure, inquiry told Vulnerable people who use emergency medical devices connected to 3G data may slip through the cracks when the ageing mobile network is switched off in coming weeks, AAP reports. It is not known how many 3G-reliant medical devices, such as personal cardiac alarms, need to be upgraded before the network closure, National Rural Health Alliance chief executive Susi Tegen has told a Senate inquiry into the 3G shutdown. Tegen said while the federal government was in touch with a major manufacturer of the devices, the public was largely having to rely on information from private medical companies. Telstra\u2019s written submission to the inquiry acknowledged the challenge of reaching people with medical alarms using 3G sim cards, as they cannot be tracked like phones. The telco has been working with alarm providers, including the aged care sector, to make sure they are upgraded in time. Snowy Monaro mayor Chris Hanna told the hearing that locals endured communications outages during the Black Summer bushfires and experience mobile black spots on long trips between towns. We\u2019ve got a lot of farmers out there who are on tractors and big machinery that have had accidents in the past. Our biggest concern is: will they be able to call triple zero? Fire equipment \u2018failure\u2019 during giant factory blaze Firefighters battling Melbourne\u2019s largest industrial blaze on record have said they had to use broken, dangerous and outdated equipment to fight the flames. As AAP reports, the United Firefighters Union has said equipment needed by firefighters during the Derrimut factory fire on 10 July was unavailable due to being moved to parts of the city to replace other machinery that was out of service. One 20-year-old pumper truck failed to produce foam twice during the response and firefighters were forced to use equipment that was slower to set up. The union said this forced firefighters closer to bulk stores of flammable chemicals and the fire grew rapidly during the time it took to establish these positions. The union\u2019s Victorian secretary Peter Marshall said the equipment issues could be the difference in being able to contain major fires early before they spread or intensify. You cannot put firefighters into a situation where they haven\u2019t got the tools to do the job. We need to have a rolling replacement program, the government needs to intervene in this. Invest in the fire trucks before one of our members gets injured or worse. Nearly a quarter of Fire Rescue Victoria\u2019s fleet were involved in fighting the blaze with one-in-two of the vehicles at the scene past their use-by date. A Fire Rescue Victoria spokesperson said more than three million litres of water and 40,000 litres of foam were needed to stop the blaze. Greens announce plan for Queensland housing developer The Queensland Greens want to set up a state developer to build 100,000 homes by 2030. At a press conference this morning, Griffith MP Max Chandler-Mather and state MP Amy MacMahon estimated the policy would cost $60bn over six years. It\u2019s not the first time the state has led the way out of a housing crisis. State governments built about a quarter of all new dwellings during the period after the second world war. The Queensland Housing Commission developed entire suburbs like Inala, Stafford and Zillmere at the edge of the city during the 40s and 50s. MacMahon said the organisation would be looking at the 99,000 dwellings across the state where she said private developers had development approval but were \u201crefusing to build\u201d. For instance, they could take over the stalled AVJennings Caboolture West proposal for 3500 homes in the city\u2019s north. That\u2019s one potential site, but a public developer would be looking at sites right across Queensland that would be close to transport close to other services. Four charged in alleged \u2018pump and dump\u2019 shares manipulation scheme Four people have been charged following an alleged \u201cpump and dump\u201d scheme to artificially increase the price of Australian shares before dumping them. Syed Yusuf, Larissa Quinlan, Emma Summer, and Kurt Stuart were charged in the Downing Centre local court with conspiracy to commit market rigging and false trading, facing a maximum penalty of 15 years\u2019 prison and a fine of more than $1m for market manipulation. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) alleges that the defendants formed a private group on Telegram to discuss and select penny stocks, before announcing them to a public Telegram group named the \u201cASX Pump and Dump Group\u201d. The group has also been charged with dealing with the proceeds of crime in relation to the money they allegedly obtained from selling the shares. The Asic chair, Joe Longo, said that \u201cmarket manipulation is illegal\u201d: Pump and dump schemes are a form of financial fraud, eroding investor wealth, threatening the integrity of our markets and potentially the Australian economy more broadly. The matter is being prosecuted by the commonwealth director of public prosecutions after a referral from Asic in December 2022. It was adjourned to 30 July in the Downing Centre local court, for a detention application to be made in respect of each of the defendants. Spring shoots as tax cuts start to flow (or will RBA mow them down?) The RBA wants to see employment hold up but not inflation, and getting the interest rates setting that best delivers that outcome will probably only be known in hindsight. For now, there\u2019s some evidence of consumers getting a bit more confident, at least according to the ANZ/RoyMorgan weekly survey. Their gauge rose to a six-month high (with all their main subindices picked up) and even inflation expectations edged slightly lower. The ANZ economists said: Notably, households\u2019 confidence in their current financial situation was the second-highest since early-2023. This suggests households may be starting to see a boost to their incomes from the Stage 3 tax cuts and other cost-of-living relief measures. Those tax cuts are also expected to take the edge off households facing mortgage stress, according to a separate Roy Morgan report. Just as well, as their latest report had those borrowers \u201cat risk\u201d and \u201cextremely at risk\u201d of hitting stress rising in June (although still below peaks earlier in 2024). Michele Levine, Roy Morgan\u2019s CEO, said: The Stage 3 income tax cuts are delivering significant financial relief, and a boost to take home pay, for millions of Australian taxpayers \u2013 including many mortgage holders. We\u2019ll have to see if that relief is enough over the coming months. One factor will be what the RBA does, with a 14th interest rate rise in the current cycle still only an outside chance when its board next meets on 5-6 August. The special envoy for disaster recovery, Labor senator Tony Sheldon, is visiting Cairns to assess recovery projects following Tropical Cyclone Jasper. The cyclone made landfall just north of Port Douglas last December, hitting the coast as a category two cyclone but taking almost five days to move west across Queensland. Many areas recorded more than a metre of rain. Morning frosts forecast for inland Queensland Parts of Queensland will wake up to another frosty morning tomorrow, with morning frost forecast inland south of Emerald. But no frost is expected from Thursday, as temperatures are set to increase and the cold snap will finally break, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Above average temperatures are forecast across the state from Thursday for several days. Two men charged after 10kg of meth allegedly imported from Mexico found in Melbourne storage facility Two men have been charged and 10kg of methylamphetamine allegedly imported from Mexico has been seized amid an investigation into drug importation. A joint operation between Victoria police and the Australian Border Force commenced in July after an illicit substance was detected at the border, with 10kg of methylamphetamine allegedly sent via international freight from Mexico to a storage facility in Richmond. Three search warrants were executed at the facility and residential addresses in St Kilda and Malvern. Around 6kg of MDMA, two gel blaster pistols, a Mercedes-Benz GLC and 11 luxury watches were seized from the St Kilda address. A 43-year-old St Kilda man was charged with importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, remanded to appear at Melbournes magistrates court on 21 October. A 42-year-old man with no fixed place of address was charged with attempting to possess a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, and was bailed to appear before Melbourne magistrates court on 10 November. Both charges carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. A 44-year-old Malvern woman was arrested but released pending further enquiries. The investigation remains ongoing. NDIS worker wage case heads to the Fair Work Commission Unions claim some NDIS workers are being underpaid by as much as $9 an hour and have launched a fight to secure minimum payment rates at the Fair Work Commission, AAP reports. The Australian Services Union, Australian Workers Union, Health Services Union and United Workers Union want providers to stop classifying staff as home care workers instead of social and community services employees. The difference between the two can be up to $9 an hour and it\u2019s estimated up to one in 10 providers underpay their staff, the unions claim. The case kicked off at the Fair Work Commission in Melbourne today as they push for changes to the social, community, home care and disability services industry Award. The federal government is attempting to pass a suite of NDIS reforms aimed at reining in the scheme\u2019s costs, which would reduce the number of eligible new participants and changing funding criteria. The annual cost of the NDIS is expected to pass more than $50bn by 2025-26, higher than the annual cost of Medicare. Advocacy groups want AI legislation to have an additional offence for the threat to distribute Sexual assault victim-survivor advocate groups have said the federal parliament should expand legislation outlawing the creation and spreading of deepfake AI images without consent to cover the threat of spreading such material. Speaking to the parliamentary inquiry examining the Albanese government\u2019s legislation criminalising the spread of AI deepfake pornography, the National Association of Services Against Sexual Violence chair, Nicole Lambert, said the group supports the legislation but wants it to go further, including criminalising the threat of spreading such material, not just after it has been spread: I think that\u2019s been articulated quite clearly here today, how that can be used in terms as a form of coercion and manipulation and perpetuating gendered violence. Advocates appearing before the committee today also said more funding needs to be put into support services, with many people now seeking support from their services after having deepfake AI pornographic images of them distributed online. The committee will later hear from the education sector, the eSafety commissioner, and the Australian federal police. Tasmanian police have launched a search operation after an experienced bushwalker did not make contact with friends as planned following a multi-day hike. The man in his 20s set off for the hike along the Eastern Arthurs Traverse, in the Southwest national park, last Tuesday. He was due to finish the walk over the weekend, police said, but has not made contact with friends as planned and was last heard from on Friday. The Westpac rescue helicopter is being used as part of the search effort. Defence threat warning over critical seafarer shortage Australia\u2019s defence, energy security and supply chains are under threat due to an increasing shortage of seafarers, according to the Maritime workforce position paper. As AAP reports, the paper highlighted the challenges of an ageing workforce, funding shortfalls and a lack of workers with internationally recognised qualifications that allow them to service the nation\u2019s maritime assets. Australia\u2019s maritime workforce dropped by 23% over the last 12 months and the ever-widening gap between demand and supply of trained workers prompted predictions of a \u201cdangerous\u201d shortfall by 2026, the report showed. The paper was commissioned by oil and gas company Inpex with support from the Australian Resources and Energy Employer Association, the Maritime Union of Australia and other organisations. Inpex Australia\u2019s senior vice president of corporate, Bill Townsend, said that \u201cwe\u2019re now seeing the demand for seafarers outstripping supply in circumstances approaching a flashpoint\u201d. He warned the lack of workers would lead to a \u201csevere shortage\u201d of staff able to maintain offshore oil and gas, support wind farms and decommission older technology. The Queensland premier, Steven Miles, has slammed the state opposition for using AI to produce a fake video on TikTok. As we flagged earlier, the video shows the premier dancing to Closer by Ne-Yo, with a caption over the video reading, \u201cPOV: my rent is up $60 a week, my power bill is up 20%, but the Premier made a sandwich on TikTok,\u201d with a disclaimer: \u201cCreator has labelled as AI-generated.\u201d Miles argued the video \u201crepresents a turning point for our democracy\u201d. Until now we\u2019ve known that photos could be doctored or photoshopped. But we\u2019ve been trained to believe what we see in video, and for a political party now to be willing to use AI to make deepfake attack videos, it\u2019s a very dangerous turning point. And that means that Queenslanders between now and October will have to question everything that they see from the LNP and ask themselves, is this real? Or is this a deepfake? He promised that Labor wouldn\u2019t use its own form of AI-generated content for election advertising. AFP member charged and stood down from duty An employee of the Australian federal police has been charged and will face court today. The person has been charged with one count of using a carriage service to menace/harass/offend. The employee has been stood down from duty. The AFP said in a statement: The AFP is committed to transparency. No further comment will be made. Greens senator weighs in on deepfake-AI video of Queensland premier David Shoebridge also weighed in on the deepfake-AI video of Queensland premier Steven Miles dancing, posted by the state opposition to TikTok (you can read more earlier in the blog). Shoebridge told ABC News Breakfast: This one was labelled and clearly said \u2018potential parody\u2019 but imagine if it was a more serious video, imagine if it was, you know, the premier allegedly saying things that he didn\u2019t believe in and that may have been contrary to party platform. What we have introduced in the federal parliament is legislation modelled on the legislation produced in South Korea for their recent election campaign, which would make it unlawful to produce deepfakes of candidates and politicians in the lead-up to an election campaign. You\u2019d probably want exceptions for things like parody, but it shows what a danger it is. Greens senator says Gaza war cemetery with more than 250 Australians badly damaged amid Israeli bombardment Greens senator David Shoebridge spoke with ABC News Breakfast just earlier, amid reports that graves of dozens of Australian soldiers are feared damaged or destroyed as a result of the Israel-Gaza war. Shoebridge said the Gaza War Cemetery at Deir El Belah contains thousands of war graves, including more than 250 Australians, with the majority from World War I. A lot of those graves are Australian light horse graves [and] for over a century it\u2019s been cared for by the Palestinian community there \u2026 It\u2019s very much sacred ground for Australians and many people in the commonwealth. Shoebridge claimed the Greens received reports the cemetery had been badly damaged, but when put to the Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs during budget estimates, they had not heard anything. The Greens conducted their own research and obtained three satellite images from before the invasion and since, showing a \u201clevel of destruction [that] is genuinely horrifying.\u201d And these are war graves, you know? The bodies of Australian soldiers. This is meant to be sacred land and it is quite disturbing. Shoebridge argued that Israel is damaging the grave sites \u201cbecause it feels like it can act with impunity\u201d, calling on Australia, the UK and other countries to challenge this notion. The CrowdStrike president, Michael Sentonas, has spoken with Sky News Australia, following last week\u2019s global outage that saw 8.5m devices affected: On Friday during the outage, thousands of flights were cancelled, broadcasters were forced off air, healthcare appointments disrupted and millions of PCs failed to start after CrowdStrike\u2019s software update inadvertently crippled devices using the Microsoft Windows operating system. Sentonas \u201cdeeply\u201d and \u201cpersonally\u201d apologised for what occurred and said \u201cwe got this very wrong\u201d: We understand the disruption and the distress we caused a lot of people \u2026 The update that we put out, obviously as I said, we got wrong with some logic in that update. We\u2019ve been using that technique for the better part of a decade and in this case, we made that mistake \u2026 He said conversations about losses and compensation \u201chas to happen\u201d but the immediate focus is on remediation. Independent MP responds to teal criticism from Dutton The independent MP for Wentworth, Allegra Spender, has been speaking with ABC RN about what teal MPs have achieved in parliament. During a press conference yesterday, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, accused Climate 200 of being a \u201cfront for Green candidates\u201d and said: They\u2019re not disaffected Liberal candidates, they\u2019re Green candidates \u2026 Can anyone name anything that the teals have achieved since they\u2019re been in parliament? I mean, there\u2019s nothing \u2026 Climate 200 is the fundraising giant that bankrolled the teal independent wave at the last election: Spender responded to those comments from Dutton and said that \u201cthe Greens are very different on so many different things,\u201d and \u201cin a completely different world\u201d to her on certain issues \u2013 such as the economy. I work with the Greens on a bunch of issues, particularly on the environmental issues where there is common ground. But I\u2019m not afraid to disagree with them in other areas \u2026 I\u2019ve come from the real world and in the real world, you have to work with lots of different people. Fellow independent Zoe Daniel had previously said the teal wave was a \u2018media construct\u2019, and Spender was asked to weigh in on this: It is a media construct \u2026 There\u2019s a huge amount of common ground but this is about a different type of politics [and] looking at each issue on its merits. \u2018Tumultuous\u2019 coverage must not worsen post-3G, farmers say Telcos face the ire of rural Australians if the 3G network shutdown goes awry and are being warned they will be held publicly accountable for any fallout, AAP reports. Telstra is due to switch off on 31 August, Optus will close from September, while TPG/Vodafone ceased operation of the ageing network in January. The closures and potential risks are the subject of a Senate inquiry, which is holding public hearings in Cooma, in southern NSW, and Canberra today and tomorrow. Connectivity barriers in rural areas are long-standing and the 3G shutdown must not exacerbate an already \u201ctumultuous\u201d system, the National Farmers\u2019 Federation said in its submission to the inquiry. Many rural Australians are worried about being cut off from health and emergency services, or having their personal medical alarms fail after the shutdown. Last week, the federal government said 102,000 active mobile phones aren\u2019t compatible with 4G, although that\u2019s a sharp decrease from more than 740,000 in March. While the Senate committee isn\u2019t due to report until November it has been urged to hand down its initial recommendations before the 3G shutdown. Alice Springs mayor on merits of curfew, nearly two weeks on The mayor of Alice Springs, Matt Paterson, has spoken with the Today show after a second curfew on the red centre was lifted earlier this month. Asked how the town is going nearly two weeks on, Paterson said: The initial curfew we had regarding [just] the youth about 12 weeks ago made a drastic difference. This one was a little bit different because it was for everyone after some incidents we had. I would say it is a success, but it just comes down to being a little bit more proactive where we get to a point where we don\u2019t need a curfew. [When] we\u2019re bringing thousands of people into Alice Springs for an event we need to be ready and unfortunately on this occasion we were not\u2026 Here\u2019s our story when the curfew was lifted: It seems deepfake content has reached the Queensland election. Last week, the Liberal National Party posted an AI video of Steven Miles on their TikTok account, showing the premier dancing to \u2018Closer\u2019 by Ne-Yo. A caption over the video reads, \u201cPOV: my rent is up $60 a week, my power bill is up 20%, but the Premier made a sandwich on TikTok,\u201d and the video has a disclaimer: \u201cCreator has labelled as AI-generated.\u201d Miles is an avid TikTok user and regularly shares videos of himself chatting to the camera about state government policy, while making a sandwich. In a statement to the ABC, Miles said that it was \u201cappalling and disgusting\u201d the state opposition leader, David Crisafulli, had \u201cstooped to using AI and deep fake videos to attack me.\u201d Mr Crisafulli needs to explain why he thinks this is OK. It\u2019s a test of his character. In a time when misinformation is everywhere, we as politicians have a duty to communicate with our audiences and to voters clearly and honestly. Separately in May, the Australian Electoral Commission said it expected AI-generated misinformation at the next federal election, but warned that it doesn\u2019t have the tools to detect or deter it.

The Australian National Dictionary Centre (ANDC) is looking for new contributions for the national dictionary, with a focus on sport-related words and phrases. A statement says that \u201cfrom skyscraper marks featuring the Sherrin in Aussie Rules, to a cockroach getting sent to the sin bin for a dog shot on a cane toad in rugby league, the language of Australian sport has made a significant contribution to Australian English.\u201d ANDC senior researcher Mark Gwynn added: Many Australian rhyming slang terms come from the world of sport like \u2018Dorothy Dix\u2019 for a six in cricket, \u2018Wally Grout\u2019 for a shout at the bar, \u2018Mal Meninga\u2019 for finger, \u2018meat pie\u2019 for try, and \u2018sausage roll\u2019 for goal. Some people might not realise that common Australian words and expressions such as drongo, home and hosed, sledge, fang it, and no-hoper originate in the sporting world.

AFP union cites challenges in prosecuting alleged deepfake offenders More on that parliamentary committee hearing: there was significant concern globally about the rise of sexually explicit deepfakes, the Australian Federal Police Association said. There were challenges in prosecuting offenders, it said, writing in a submission to the inquiry: With the creation of deepfake child exploitation material increasing, the role of law enforcement and identifying a victim is becoming exponentially more difficult. Police must first determine who the victim is (and whether they are actually a real person). How long do investigators spend trying to find a child who potentially doesn\u2019t even exist or who had their likeness stolen but has ultimately not been abused themselves? Relationships Australia wants the bill to include a definition of consent that aligns with an affirmative consent model, where it had to be expressly given rather than a person simply not saying \u201cno\u201d. The parliamentary committee will report by 8 August. More on this story: Up to seven years\u2019 prison for distributing sexually explicit deepfakes under proposed laws Proposed laws would attach a six-year prison sentence to adults found to have shared \u201cdeepfake\u201d sexually explicit images without consent and a seven-year term would apply if they created and distributed the image, AAP reports. The proposed changes to criminal laws are being considered today by a Senate committee chaired by Labor senator Nita Green. Green said laws were not explicit enough to criminalise deepfakes. The Labor senator said: AI technology can be of enormous benefit, but it has also seen an explosion in the sharing of fake non-consensual images, which can have long-lasting impacts on victims. We know that most deepfakes depict women and girls and that\u2019s why this is an important measure to take to reduce gender-based violence. Rape and sexual assault prevention organisations, legal and criminal experts, the eSafety Commissioner, law enforcement and federal government agencies will give evidence at the hearing into the legislation. A potential first female US president would be a political milestone not just for America but for other democracies like Australia, advocates say, ahead of Kamala Harris\u2019 likely endorsement as candidate in the upcoming election, Australian Associated Press reports. President Joe Biden announced he would not seek re-election after mounting pressure to drop out and endorsed Harris as his successor to run against Donald Trump in the presidential election on 5 November. While Harris would have to be formally nominated at the Democratic Party\u2019s national convention in August, the chief executive of Women for Election Australia, Licia Heath, said the move would be \u201csignificant\u201d for women in politics around the world. Heath said: Compared with Australia and other western democracies, America is the stand out in terms of being a laggard of having women in the top job. America is behind other countries in comparison, and their time is well and truly due. (Harris) being vice-president in this particular term and having taken over from the previous administration puts her in a very strong strategic advantage in terms of any future debate with Trump. A supporter of Julian Assange has posted a picture of the WikiLeaks founder and his wife, Stella, and their children enjoying a trip to the beach at an unspecified location in Australia. The WikiLeaks founder has been keeping a low profile after his dramatic return to a free life in Australia after years in prison in the UK before pleading guilty to a US espionage charge. A member of the group Melbourne 4 Assange posted the picture of the family with the following message: What a beautiful sight this is. A family reunited. They made it. Love is our Resistance #AssangeFree Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. I\u2019m Martin Farrer with the top overnight yarns before Emily Wind takes over. Australia is criminalising disabled children and allegedly keeping them \u201cin cages\u201d in police watch houses, according to the national children\u2019s commissioner. In the latest part of our investigation series In the box, Anne Hollonds calls the situation \u201cabsolutely abominable\u201d. As momentum continued to mount overnight for Kamala Harris to win the Democratic party nomination for this year\u2019s US presidential race, the chief executive of Women for Election Australia said the move would be \u201csignificant\u201d for women in politics around the world\u201d. Licia Heath says the US has been a \u201claggard\u201d in terms of having a female leader compared with other western nations such as Australia. More follows. Australia has recorded its deadliest 12 months on the roads for more than a decade, with 1,310 deaths to 30 June according to the Australian Automobile Association. The shocking figures show that more than one person dies every eight hours in road crashes with the figure up 11.7% on the previous financial year."

            "title": "Was Donald Trump, as president, a king? The US supreme court thinks so | Moira Donegan",
            "date": "2024-07-01T20:26:52Z",
            "content": "Is the president a king? The US supreme court thinks so. On Monday, in its very last ruling of the term, the chief justice, John Roberts, writing for the court\u2019s six conservatives, held in Trump v United States that Donald Trump has \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from criminal prosecution for all acts that can be interpreted as part of the official course of his \u201ccore\u201d duties, and \u201cpresumptive\u201d immunity for all other official acts. The move dramatically extends executive authority, insulates past and future presidents from prosecution for illegal or even treasonous actions they carry out while in office and renders the former president largely criminally immune for his role in the January 6 insurrection. The court said that Trump cannot be charged for some of his \u201cofficial\u201d actions in the lead-up to the insurrection, including his attempts to pressure Mike Pence and his efforts to weaponize the justice department to force some states to reverse their election results. Much of Jack Smith\u2019s criminal case against Trump has thereby been voided. What remains of the January 6 prosecution will now be remanded to a lower court, which will be tasked with determining which charges, if any, can proceed against Trump under the court\u2019s new, unprecedented vision of executive immunity. That trial, if it ever happens, will not take place until long after this November\u2019s elections, and will now likely not be able to address most of Trump\u2019s efforts to assist in either the judicial or violent coup attempts. Richard Nixon\u2019s status as a criminal and crook was once summarized by recounting his ominous declaration: \u201cWell, when the president does it, that means it\u2019s not illegal.\u201d The court has now taken that vulgar absurdity and made it law. It is difficult to overstate the blow this decision will have to the integrity of our democratic system of government, or the depth of its insult to the principles of the separation of powers and the rule of law. In a ruling issued on stark partisan lines, the court\u2019s conservatives elevated the president to a position that no person can hold in a republic: one with a sweeping entitlement to commit criminal acts for the sake of his own vulgar self-interest, without any fear of criminal legal repercussions. Criminal law no longer applies to the president; so long as he occupies the office, he exists in a permanent state of The Purge-like immunity, the ordinary rules of social and civic life suspended for him, able to use the trappings of power to flatter his vanity, reward his friends and punish his enemies as it suits him. This is one of the most consequential and frightening supreme court decisions of our lives. On the verge of an election in which Trump may well be restored to presidential power, the court has officially declared that he cannot be held accountable for abuses of that power in a criminal court. In its holding, the court\u2019s majority made a flimsy distinction between the immunity they are granting to presidents for \u201ccore powers\u201d and \u201cofficial\u201d acts \u2013 terms whose precise meanings they don\u2019t define \u2013 and the criminal liability that Trump and other presidents still have for \u201cunofficial\u201d acts. But these distinctions are likely to collapse if any prosecutor, be it Smith or someone else, actually attempts to use them. That\u2019s because the scope of the presidential office and its powers are so broad that its \u201ccore\u201d powers are difficult to tell from its extraneous ones, and \u201cofficial\u201d and \u201cunofficial\u201d acts by the president are likely to prove ambiguous. The court also declares, needlessly, that conduct undertaken in the pursuit of \u201cofficial\u201d powers cannot be used in prosecutions of \u201cunofficial\u201d acts \u2013 another protection for presidential conduct that will hamstring future prosecutions. The president, meanwhile, also retains the pardon power \u2013 meaning that he is entitled not only to commit crimes, but to secure impunity for his accomplices. In practice, Trump \u2013 and any subsequent president, should we ever get to have one \u2013 is now unaccountable to either legislative checks or criminal law. It is a development that has radically changed the nature of the office. The president is now less like a democratically accountable official than like a little emperor, endowed by the court with an all-encompassing right to wield power as he sees fit, much like the way that divine right used to bless the actions of kings. There is virtually nothing that he is not allowed to do. Preposterously, as if to mock the American public and their historical aspirations to freedom, the court claims that this new state of affairs was mandated by the framers \u2013 the very people who broke with their country and fought a war specifically so as to free themselves from this kind of unaccountable executive power. In her dissent, the justice Sonia Sotomayor listed some of the things that the president can now do without consequence, according to the majority. \u201cOrders the Navy\u2019s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune,\u201d she writes. \u201cOrganizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Take a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune \u2026 The relationship between the president and the people he serves has shifted irrevocably. In every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law.\u201d Sotomayor\u2019s dissent is among the most alarmed and mournful pieces of legal writing I have ever read. She concludes it: \u201cWith fear for our democracy, I dissent.\u201d There will be people who try to tell you that this ruling is not so bad. They will decry the \u201cbed-wetting caucus\u201d, or smugly declare themselves above \u201chysteria\u201d. They will point to the majority\u2019s evident concessions, to the president\u2019s supposed liability for \u201cunofficial\u201d conduct \u2013 as if this false and pretextual possibility of accountability is anything like the real thing. It isn\u2019t; don\u2019t believe them. This decision is a seismic revision of the constitutional order, issued by a court packed with extremist Republicans who are anticipating a Trump victory in November. They know, as well as we do, that Trump aspires to usher in an era of corruption and autocracy. Today\u2019s decision is an invitation for him to do just that.
