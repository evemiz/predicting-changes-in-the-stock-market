            "content": "Five states \u2013 Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kansas and Ohio \u2013 are holding their presidential nominating contests on Tuesday, with Florida holding only a Republican primary. Donald Trump and Joe Biden expect to sail to victory in their respective parties, growing their delegate counts in a march toward this summer\u2019s conventions, where they will officially secure their parties\u2019 nomination. Here are the live results from the five presidential primaries. *** Republican delegates *** Democratic delegates *** Republican results *** Democratic results *** Who\u2019s running Donald Trump The former US president\u2019s campaign to retake the White House and once again grab his party\u2019s nomination got off to a slow start that was widely mocked. But after decisive wins in Iowa and New Hampshire, his campaign has steadily moved into a position of dominance. Trump declined to attend any of the Republican debates, has used his court appearances and many legal woes as a rallying cry to mobilize his base, and has run a surprisingly well-organized campaign. His extremist rhetoric, especially around his plans for a second term and the targeting of his political enemies, has sparked widespread fears over the threat to American democracy that his candidacy represents. His political style during the campaign has not shifted from his previous runs in 2016 and 2020 and, if anything, has become more extreme. Many see this as a result of his political and legal fates becoming entwined, with a return to the Oval Office being seen as Trump\u2019s best chance of nixing his legal problems. Joe Biden Biden is the likely Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election. He announced his campaign for re-election on 25 April 2023, exactly four years after he announced his previous, successful presidential campaign. While approval for the president remains low, hovering just above 40%, political experts say he is the most likely candidate to defeat Trump. Biden has served in politics for more than five decades and is running on a platform that includes abortion rights, gun reform and healthcare. At 81, he is the oldest president in US history. Marianne Williamson Failed 2020 presidential candidate Marianne Williamson dropped out of the race last month before then resurrecting her long-shot campaign after the Michigan primary. Williamson, an author of self-help books, launched her bid with campaign promises to address climate change and student loan debt. She previously worked as \u201cspiritual leader\u201d of a Michigan Unity church. Jason Palmer Jason Palmer is a Democratic candidate who was only on the ballot in American Samoa and some other US territories. He won the primary in America Samoa after donating $500,000 to his own campaign. Palmer is a Baltimore resident who has worked for various businesses and non-profits, often on issues involving technology and education."

            "content": "The 2024 election will see US voters choose the next president and determine which party holds the House and Senate. Voting in the primary elections kicked off in Iowa on 15 January, where Republican voters handed Donald Trump a landslide victory over Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis. In New Hampshire, Trump again beat Haley; meanwhile in the Democratic race, Joe Biden won the primary \u2013 despite his name not being on the ballot. Haley lost to \u201cnone of the candidates\u201d in Nevada\u2019s 7 February primary. Trump was the only major candidate in Republican caucuses on 8 February, taking 99.1% of the vote. Biden won the South Carolina primary, easily sweeping past his opponents. Haley lost to Trump in the Republican primary in her home of South Carolina on 24 February. Biden easily won the Michigan primary on 27 February \u2013 but shed support over Gaza, with 100,000 \u201cuncommitted\u201d votes cast. Trump defeated Haley easily in Michigan, with 68% of the vote. On 5 March, voters in 16 US states and one US territory went to the polls to cast ballots for Super Tuesday. Biden and Trump dominated yet again, all but ending the primary season. Both Biden and Trump won primary elections in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state on 13 March, solidifying a 2020 rematch. States have different rules, but the primary elections determine how many delegates are awarded to each presidential candidate. Those delegates then vote at the Republican and Democratic conventions in the summer to officially choose the party\u2019s nominee. On 5 November, the country will cast its vote for a presidential candidate as well as in other races, such as Senate, House and state-level positions. In a uniquely American fashion, there are ever-changing rules and party maneuvers in both how people vote, and when. After the 2020 election, which culminated in political violence and lengthy court battles, this year\u2019s election is difficult to predict. For now, here\u2019s the schedule of key events to watch."

            "title": "The voting bloc that could decide the US election: Swifties",
            "date": "2024-03-13T15:00:37Z",
            "content": "After weeks of maddening speculation over whom Taylor Swift might support in the 2024 US presidential elections, the venerated pop star finally revealed her endorsement: the right to vote itself. \u201cVote the people who most represent YOU into power,\u201d Swift urged fans in an Instagram story amid Super Tuesday\u2019s primary elections, perhaps the last chance to stop Donald Trump from once again seizing the Republican nomination for president. Although Swift could still endorse a candidate in the months ahead, her \u201cno comment\u201d on who should win on Super Tuesday was a noted refusal to engage in party politics at this stage. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is still jockeying for her endorsement, while Trump has said Swift would be \u201cdisloyal\u201d for backing Biden and rightwingers have suggested that her 18-year career is a \u201cpsy op\u201d \u2013 a ludicrous theory that nearly one in five Americans have said they believe. What is true, though, is that Swift currently possesses unprecedented power: an endorsement from the most beloved singer in the United States could potentially tip the balance in what\u2019s likely to be a close election. A reported billionaire, Swift can reroute economies, trigger congressional action and spur tens of thousands of people to register to vote. While her endorsement is unlikely to sway a voter who is undecided between Trump and Biden \u2013 if such an American exists \u2013 experts believe Swift could convince people who don\u2019t feel energized by Biden to vote for him anyway. But whether Swift will wield that power or instead stay out of the electoral fray remains unclear. Although Swift endorsed Democrats in 2018, she has in recent years increasingly withdrawn from such overt displays of partisanship or making controversial statements. That change that has coincided with her return to the top of the celebrity food chain and, in the process, left some Swifties feeling like their idol could do better. \u201cShe\u2019s at the height of her popularity right now, so I think she\u2019s probably pretty hesitant to do any sort of political activism,\u201d said Jared Quigg, a 22-year-old Indiana journalist who said he listened to Swift every day. \u201cBut because of the influence she has, if she came out and called for a ceasefire in Gaza, I think that \u2026 would put more pressure on the US government, especially if Biden wants her endorsement. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s an exaggeration,\u201d Quigg added. \u201cShe is one of the most popular people in the world.\u201d So are Swifties a voting bloc the parties should be targeting? Usually portrayed as a blur of sequin-wearing women draped in friendship bracelets, Swifties are not quite so homogeneous as they may seem. More than half of Americans identify as Swift fans and 16% say they are \u201cavid fans\u201d, according to a March 2023 Morning Consult poll that was conducted before the launch of Swift\u2019s Eras tour. While the avid fans are mostly white and suburban, 48% are men, contrary to the popular perception that Swift\u2019s music appeals largely to women. If about one in six Americans is a Swiftie, there is simply no way they\u2019ll all agree \u2013 on Swift, or on anything else. However, there is a clear political tilt within Swiftiedom. Swift\u2019s own politics lean to the left, and her listeners follow suit: more than half of her avid fans are Democrats, while 23% are Republicans and another 23% are independents. Swift has long taken a pragmatic approach to politics. She timed her Instagram post endorsing Democrats in the 2018 midterms to hit the internet after the US leg of her Reputation tour concluded, breaking her career-long silence on politics but shielding herself from red-state backlash. Swift then portrayed her next album, Lover, as an embrace of liberalism and love \u2013 including queer love, in the song You Need to Calm Down. By any normal artist\u2019s standard, both Reputation and Lover were wildly successful, but neither album sold quite as well as 2014\u2019s 1989. Notably, neither garnered many Grammy nods; in her 2020 documentary Miss Americana, which tracked Swift\u2019s political awakening, Swift was devastated by the snub to Reputation. Yet, at her (extremely relative) commercial lowest \u2013 and when politics could feed into the personal narrative linked to Lover \u2013 Swift was willing to use her cachet for divisive political causes. In May 2020, when that year\u2019s presidential nomination process was all but sewn up \u2013 much like this year\u2019s Super Tuesday \u2013 Swift took to the platform then known as Twitter to spit at Trump: \u201cAfter stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? \u2018When the looting starts the shooting starts\u2019??? We will vote you out in November.\u201d Today, three original albums and one Ticketmaster-breaking world tour later, Swift has managed to soar past even the stratospheric heights of her 1989 fame, becoming as ubiquitous as gravity and just as untouchable. Yet after endorsing Democrats in 2018 and 2020, including Biden, she only urged fans to \u201cvote\u201d in the 2022 midterm elections, just as she did on Super Tuesday. \u201cI feel like a lot of the things that she has spoken out about are things that are directly benefiting her if they go one way or negatively affecting if they go the other way,\u201d said Jess Simpson, a 21-year-old who is a member of the University of Oregon Taylor Swift Society, which holds Swift-related karaoke and trivia events. \u201cShe claims to be a feminist, but that\u2019s not what that is. It\u2019s not just speaking out about the things that you fall into. It\u2019s about reaching past that.\u201d Ryan Kovatch, who also belongs to the University of Oregon Taylor Swift Society, was frustrated to see the Eras tour visit states that had passed laws attacking the rights of LGBTQ+ children. Swift did give a short, relatively vague speech about those laws and Pride month. \u201cThere have been so many harmful pieces of legislation that have put people in the LGBTQ and queer community at risk,\u201d Swift told a Chicago crowd in June. \u201cIt\u2019s painful for everyone, every ally, every loved one, every person of these communities, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m always posting, \u2018This is when the midterms are, this is when these important key primaries are.\u2019\u201d Meanwhile, far less successful artists, such as Swift\u2019s friend Haley Kiyoko, took a risk by bringing drag queens on stage in Tennessee after the state passed a law banning drag shows. Ariana Grande, whose fame comes closer to Swift\u2019s, has publicly pledged to donate more than $1m to fight bills targeting transgender people. \u201cIt feels like the stakes have gotten higher and she\u2019s backed off pretty starkly,\u201d Kovatch said. \u201cIt is strongly disappointing, as a member of the LGBT community, to see that and see the potential there and watch it be foregone time and time again. \u201cEspecially using the rainbow during the You Need to Calm Down set,\u201d Kovatch added, referring to a song in which Swift struts amid rainbow lights and proclaims her support for LGBTQ+ rights. \u201cWhat is there to lose? You have billions of dollars,\u201d asked Trey Pokorny, a 21-year-old whose drag persona is Treylor Swift and another member of the University of Oregon Taylor Swift Society. \u201cSmall artists \u2013 their careers can be canceled by a tweet. It takes so much more than a tweet to end Taylor Swift.\u201d Swifties have also repeatedly raised eyebrows at Swift\u2019s use of private jets. In 2022, Yard named Swift as the celebrity with the worst CO2 emissions; a Reddit post about the topic on the main subreddit for Taylor Swift fans triggered more than 2,000 comments. \u201cIt\u2019s a little rough to see how many celebrities abuse their power of flying all over the place in their private jets and clogging up the environment,\u201d said 19-year-old Addy Al-Saigh, who said she paid $2,000 to sit in nosebleed seats at the Eras tour. But, she added: \u201cIn the end, I know that there\u2019s not really much I can do about it.\u201d If Swift does endorse Biden, Al-Saigh said she would probably direct her Virginia college\u2019s Swift fan club to get involved in the 2024 elections. \u201cIf she came out and actually did that, I think I would have a reason to also put it up and say, \u2018Go vote for Biden,\u2019 because we\u2019re related to Taylor,\u201d she said. When it came to the 2024 elections, the Swifties who the Guardian spoke to said they were confident any Swift endorsement would ultimately be for Biden \u2013 a move they support. (Or, at least, preferred to the alternative.) But Quigg also cautioned fans to think for themselves. \u201cI generally believe that people should not get their politics from a pop star,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, she\u2019s a songwriter. She\u2019s not a political genius.\u201d He\u2019s not sure fellow fans share that view. He recently saw a post on X declaring: \u201cI definitely believe Taylor could convince Swifties to do a January 6.\u201d \u201cThere is something to that,\u201d Quigg said."

            "date": "2024-03-24T11:00:49Z",
            "content": "As the election battle between Donald Trump and Joe Biden begins, there are growing fears around the health of the US news media which has been struck by job losses, declining circulations, the closure or crippling of well-known brands and rise of new threats such as fake or AI-generated information on social media. Evidence of this state of crisis abounds. Last year, more than 21,400 media jobs were lost, the highest since 2020, when 16,060 cuts were recorded when print was still in the process of being succeeded by digital news distribution. Major names including the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times and Vice have taken serious hits, alongside scores of smaller brands and the total collapse of newcomers such as the Messenger. \u201cWe\u2019ve settled into the final act of the election season, and it\u2019s promising to be the harbinger of all kinds of problems because of the nature of the candidates,\u201d says Robert Thompson at Syracuse University. At the same time, he says, \u201cthe very industry that should be girding up for this is in a total state of crisis\u201d. Readership and income from digital production has been falling overall, and industry downsizing in 2024 appears to be accelerating. Meanwhile, social media is uncoupling as a referral service to news organizations, which hits both readership size and revenue generation. Meta has dropped its news tab from Facebook, Google is more unpredictable, and X has de-prioritized posts that contain outside referrals. Readers are fleeing to mediums in which fresh dangers lurk, even when accounting for the partisan nature of some US news sites. The share of US adults who say they regularly get news from TikTok has more than quadrupled, from 3% in 2020 to 14% in 2023, yet such sites are subject to the threat of viral misinformation \u2013 whether deliberately sown or spread organically. Last week, NBC reported on a seminar in New York that gamed out what could happen if AI-created misinformation disrupts November\u2019s presidential vote. A former Department of Homeland Security official, Miles Taylor, told NBC that it was \u201cjarring\u201d for attendees to see how rapidly such scenarios \u201ccould spiral out of control and really dominate the election cycle\u201d. Nor has an anticipated election year spike in readership \u2013 \u201cthe Trump bump\u201d (in essence the the positive economic effects of selling negativity in the media) \u2013 materialized. Nor may it. Only about a third (35%) of US voters say they are satisfied with the people who will be running for president, according to Pew Research. Alongside that, a decline of regional news outlets has led to what is termed \u201cnews deserts\u201d, which are defined by UNC\u2019s Hussman School of Journalism and Media as \u201ca community, either rural or urban, with limited access to the sort of credible and comprehensive news and information that feeds democracy at the grassroots level\u201d. Last year, the loss of local newspapers accelerated to more than two per week, on average, leaving more than 200 counties local information deserts, with more than half having limited access, according to researchers at Northwestern University\u2019s Medill School of Journalism. Studies contend that without those resources civic engagement declines. According to Northwestern\u2019s Penelope Abernathy, author of a series of studies on the effect of news deserts, the news ecosystem that held together a vast country is under threat. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost in two ways: the small local newspapers that fed up the chain, and the reporters on the larger dailies that were responsible for tying it all together. So you\u2019re left with your cellphone, and the disproportionate amount of misinformation and disinformation that comes in,\u201d she said. Fragmentation and re-fragmentation of audiences, in progress since the 1996 Telecommunications Act, has led to news as a consumer choice, marketed along ideological lines, that has led to increased polarization and confirmation bias: the reward of being told what you already believe. Jonathan Miller, a former chief digital officer at News Corp, told the FT last week: \u201cYou just want to hear what you want to hear.\u201d Correspondingly, just 32% of Americans who say they trust the mass media \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca fair amount\u201d to report the news in a full, fair and accurate way. \u201cAll of this is tied together by changes in the way information is delivered,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cThat changed the way the business runs, of not having a decent business model, and that moved us into the arena of political dichotomies and specialized audiences.\u201d According to Thompson, the overall state of crisis in news information is perfectly illustrated by a significant \u2013 and growing \u2013 part of the population that believe that the 2020 election was rigged. \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at is both a business crisis and a lack of confidence,\u201d Thompson says, as if people are concluding that the news media \u201cdoesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s in control of itself, so why should we believe it?\u201d While there is still plenty of information coming from reliable sources, he adds, \u201cthe number of people for whom that breakdown has occurred is very likely enough to determine who wins this election.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-19T21:17:00Z",
            "content": "Lawyers for Donald Trump urged the US supreme court to find that presidents have absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts they take in office and, therefore, dismiss the federal criminal case against Trump over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The arguments from Trump came in a brief submitted to the court Tuesday before oral arguments on 25 April, when the justices will consider whether and to what extent a former president has absolute immunity from prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts. \u201cThe court should restore the tradition,\u201d Trump\u2019s brief said, \u201cand neutralize one of the greatest threats to the president\u2019s separate power, a bedrock of our republic, in our nation\u2019s history. The court should uphold the president\u2019s immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts.\u201d In the 67-page filing, Trump re-advanced the argument that he enjoyed absolute immunity from prosecution because the conduct charged by the special counsel Jack Smith over his plot to stop the transfer of power fell within the \u201couter perimeter\u201d of his duties as president. The filing contended that all of Trump\u2019s attempts to reverse his 2020 election defeat, from pressuring his vice-president, Mike Pence, to stop the 6 January 2021 certification to organizing fake slates of electors, were protected activity. If the supreme court were to agree with Trump that he enjoyed absolute immunity from prosecution based on his sweeping interpretation of un-reviewable presidential power, the brief argued, it should also dismiss the indictment in its entirety. The arguments from Trump doubled down on positions his lawyers took when they argued before the US district judge Tanya Chutkan, who denied Trump\u2019s attempts to dismiss on immunity grounds last year, and before the US court of appeals for the DC circuit, which also denied his claim. Trump reiterated that presidents can only be prosecuted if they have been convicted in a Senate impeachment trial, pointing to language in the US constitution that a \u201cparty convicted\u201d by the Senate \u201cshall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment\u201d. The argument received a cold reception at the DC circuit, where the three-judge panel assigned to hear the appeal questioned incredulously whether that meant a president could officially order the US Navy\u2019s Seal Team Six to assassinate a political rival and face no repercussions. But Trump\u2019s brief claimed that without the guarantee of absolute immunity, the threat of potential prosecution would prevent future presidents from feeling free to take decisive action without being second-guessed by prosecutors later on. \u201cEvery future president will face de facto blackmail and extortion while in office,\u201d it said. \u201cThe threat of future prosecution and imprisonment would become a political cudgel to influence the most sensitive and controversial presidential decisions.\u201d If the court were to decide that presidential immunity did apply to Trump but on a charge-by-charge approach, Trump\u2019s brief said, it should return the indictment back to the lower courts with instructions to review each alleged illegal action and determine whether it should be struck out. Trump\u2019s lawyers settled on advancing the immunity claim last October in large part because it is what is known as an interlocutory appeal \u2013 an appeal that can be litigated pre-trial \u2013 and one that crucially put the case on hold while it was resolved. Putting the case on hold was important because Trump\u2019s overarching strategy has been to seek delay, ideally even beyond the election, in the hopes that winning a second presidency could enable him to pardon himself or allow him to install a loyal attorney general who would drop the charges. The involvement of the supreme court now means the case remains frozen until the justices issue a ruling. And even if the court rules against Trump, the case may not be ready for trial until late into the summer or beyond. The reason that Trump will not go to trial as soon as the supreme court rules is because Trump is technically entitled to the \u201cdefense preparation time\u201d that he had remaining when he filed his first appeal to the DC circuit on 8 December, which triggered the stay. Trump has 87 days remaining from that period, calculated by finding the difference between the original 4 March trial date and 8 December. The earliest that Trump could go to trial in Washington, as a result, is by adding 87 days to the date of the supreme court\u2019s final decision. With oral arguments set for April, a ruling might not be handed down until May. Alternatively, in the worst-case scenario for the special counsel, the supreme court could wait until the end of its current term in July, which could mean the trial might be delayed until late September at the earliest."

            "content": "I feel a nauseous optimism about the presidential election. I chose the word nauseous over cautious because my stomach is churning at the very possibility Trump could get a second term. But I don\u2019t believe that will happen. The progressive forces in America are overtaking the regressive. I\u2019m not paying attention to polls. It\u2019s way too early to worry about them. Most of the public hasn\u2019t even focused on the upcoming election. Biden gave a powerful State of the Union address \u2013 feisty, bold, energetic and upbeat. He was combative \u2013 taking on Trump with gusto, even besting Republican hecklers like Marjorie Taylor Greene. I\u2019m convinced he\u2019s equipped to win re-election. The broad American public is starting to see just how weird Maga Republicans really are. Republicans comprise only 28% of voting Americans. More than 40% of voters consider themselves independent, unaffiliated with either party. Most of these independents don\u2019t want the unhinged running the government. During the State of the Union, Americans saw Republicans heckle and boo Biden and then sit on their hands when Biden declared that \u201cNo child should go hungry in this country.\u201d Hello? And the official Republican response to Biden\u2019s speech by the Alabama senator Katie Britt was, to say the least, bizarre. Delivered from her kitchen, her rebuttal vacillated from wholesome to horrific. The centerpiece of her attack on Biden\u2019s border policies was a story about a 12-year-old Mexican girl who was sexually trafficked and raped multiple times a day at the hands of cartels before escaping. But the girl was not, in fact, trafficked across the US border; she never sought asylum in America; and her terrifying experience occurred when George W Bush was in the White House. Britt\u2019s oddball performance baffled even fellow rightwingers. \u201cWhat the hell am I watching right now?\u201d a Trump adviser asked Rolling Stone. \u201cOne of our biggest disasters ever,\u201d a Republican strategist told the Daily Beast. The Republican party is so out of touch with American values that it\u2019s putting up outspoken bigots for major offices. Case in point: Mark Robinson, who won the Republican nomination for governor of North Carolina last Tuesday night, has hurled hateful remarks at everyone from Michelle Obama to the survivors of the Parkland school shooting. He\u2019s called homosexuality and transgenderism \u201cfilth\u201d and formerly said he wants to outlaw all abortions. He\u2019s also ridiculed the #MeToo movement, women generally and the climate crisis. Oh, and he has a history of Holocaust denialism and antisemitic remarks. He\u2019s suggested that 9/11 was an \u201cinside job\u201d, that Hollywood and the music industry are run by Satan, and that the billionaire Democratic donor George Soros orchestrated the Boko Haram kidnappings of schoolgirls in 2014. (Robinson denies he is antisemitic, and has said that some of his claims were \u201cpoorly phrased\u201d.) Robinson is hardly the only rather out-there Republican nominee, but he typifies the grotesque values of Maga leaders, including those of the Republican party\u2019s likely presidential candidate. Of course, the reason these bigots and haters are fighting so hard to defeat us is they know progressives are the future of America. Neither their filibusters, nor their gerrymanders, nor their attempts at voter suppression can stop our rise \u2013 nor can their absurd \u201cgreat replacement theory\u201d or their supreme court majority. I\u2019ve been at this game for almost three-quarters of a century. It\u2019s a long game, and America still has a long way to go. But apart from Trump fanatics, the nation is in many ways better and stronger now than it has ever been \u2013 more inclusive, tolerant, diverse, accepting, dynamic. And it will be far better and stronger years from now, because we are rising. Sure, we must do better at organizing, mobilizing and energizing. We need elected lawmakers, along with judges and supreme court justices, who reflect our beliefs and values. The Democratic party must be bolder at countering the power of big corporations and big money, and more aggressive in recruiting and supporting a new generation of progressive leaders in electoral politics. All of us must become a pro-democracy movement \u2013 with all the passion and tenacity that movements require. Even so, I see a new progressive era dawning in America and I don\u2019t believe Trump Republicans can hold back the tide. For one thing, I see the strongest support for unions since the 1960s. Last year, at least 457,000 workers participated in a record 315 strikes in the US \u2013 and won most with contracts providing higher wages and better benefits. Over the past 18 months, graduate student-teachers and research assistants at Berkeley, MIT and Caltech have voted overwhelmingly to unionize. The United Auto Workers has scored signal victories for autoworkers, as has the Teamsters for UPS workers. Hell, even Dartmouth College\u2019s men\u2019s basketball team has voted to unionize. Microsoft just agreed not to oppose unionization efforts. Starbucks \u2013 which has spent the last two and a half years employing union-busting attorneys and refusing to bargain with any of the roughly 400 outlets that have voted to go union \u2013 has just agreed to do the same. Here\u2019s the bottom line: the majority of Americans view today\u2019s record-breaking inequalities of income and wealth as dangerous. They believe government has no business forcing women to give birth or telling consenting adults how to conduct the most intimate aspects of their lives. They want to limit access to guns. They see the climate crisis as an existential threat to the nation and the world. They want to act against systemic racism. They don\u2019t want innocent civilians killed, whether on our streets or in Gaza. They don\u2019t want to give Putin a free hand. They want to protect American democracy from authoritarianism. The giant millennial generation \u2013 a larger cohort than the boomers \u2013 is the most progressive cohort in recent history. They\u2019ve faced an inequitable economic system, a runaway climate crisis, and the herculean costs of trying to have a family \u2013 including everything from unaffordable childcare to wildly unaffordable housing. They\u2019re demanding a more equitable and sustainable society because they desperately need one. Young women have become significantly more progressive over the past decade (even if young men have remained largely unchanged). They\u2019re more likely than ever to support LGBTQ+ rights, gay or lesbian couples as parents, men staying home with children and women serving in the military. And more likely to loathe Donald Trump and any politician who emulates him. Over the next two decades, young women will be moving into positions of greater power and leadership. They now compose a remarkable 60% of college undergraduates. Meanwhile, the United States is projected to become a majority-minority nation within around two decades. This is not to say that just because someone is a person of color means that they believe in all the progressive values I mention above, of course. Yet overall, people of color are deeply concerned about the nation\u2019s widening inequalities. They\u2019re committed to social justice. They want to act against systemic racism, and they want to protect American democracy. Unsurprisingly, these trends have ignited a backlash \u2013 especially among Americans who are older, whiter, straighter, without college degrees, and male. These Americans have become susceptible to an authoritarian strongman peddling conspiracy theories and stoking hatred. Trump Republicans want us to be discouraged. They want us to despair. That\u2019s part of their strategy. They figure that if we\u2019re pessimistic enough, we won\u2019t even fight \u2013 and they\u2019ll win everything. But I believe their backlash is doomed. The Republican party has become a regressive cesspool, headed by increasingly unmoored people who are utterly out of touch with the dominant and emerging values of America. And most Americans are catching on. I don\u2019t mean to be a Pollyanna. We\u2019re in the fight of our lives. It will demand a great deal of our energy, our time, and our courage. But this fight is critical and noble. It will set the course for America and the world for decades. And it is winnable.

            "date": "2024-03-13T03:23:17Z",
            "content": "Both Joe Biden and Donald Trump won primary elections in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state on Tuesday, solidifying a rematch a majority of voters aren\u2019t looking forward to. Both men captured nearly all the votes cast so far in what had become token state primaries, along with the primary for Democrats abroad and the Republican caucus in Hawaii. Biden also won the Northern Mariana Islands primary on Tuesday morning, earning 11 delegates. In Georgia, a nascent effort to register opposition to the Biden administration\u2019s support for the war in Gaza could not be easily expressed with \u201cno preference\u201d protest votes in that state, because the ballot does not provide a way to do so. One woman in Roswell, Georgia, described voting for Representative Dean Phillips, who dropped out of the Democratic contest last week, as a substitute. \u201cI voted a protest vote against the war in Gaza because I think it is horrible what is happening and I\u2019m ashamed of my country right now,\u201d said Robin Hawking, 56, a software developer. She said she is normally a Republican voter. \u201cI\u2019m hoping if enough people vote for not-Biden, he\u2019ll get the message that he\u2019s going to lose this election unless he does a ceasefire.\u201d Uchenna Nwosu, a gynecologist, said her decision was a no-brainer. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that I couldn\u2019t vote for somebody who repealed women\u2019s rights for abortion, for instance, for healthcare,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Trump should be in the race. I mean, that alone is a good reason. He doesn\u2019t stand for anything that I stand for. So that\u2019s it.\u201d Trump ran unopposed in Georgia, though other names still appeared on the ballot, attracting a few voters. Scott Carpenter of Roswell voted for former ambassador Nikki Haley because he hated Trump, he said. He voted for Biden in 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t like Trump. I don\u2019t like Biden. I just wanted a different choice,\u201d he said. Travis Foreman, 46, an attorney in Alpharetta, said he thought Trump was good for America and expressed frustration with the Democratic party. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the party and some of their core beliefs,\u201d Foreman said, adding that he\u2019s voted Democratic and independent during his life. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard for me as a preacher\u2019s kid from south Georgia to just agree with some of their core fundamental beliefs that they want me to. A whole gender ideology, movement \u2013 I just have a problem with it. I don\u2019t mind what anyone chooses to do with their lives and how they live their lives, but don\u2019t try to force me to accept certain things against my own principles. It just came to me that\u2019s the No 1 issue.\u201d Biden won enough delegates in Georgia almost immediately to win the Democratic nomination, which requires 1,968 on the first ballot to win. \u201cFour years ago, I ran for president because I believed we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. Because of the American people, we won that battle, and now I am honored that the broad coalition of voters representing the rich diversity of the Democratic party across the country have put their faith in me once again to lead our party \u2013 and our country \u2013 in a moment when the threat Trump poses is greater than ever,\u201d he said in a statement. Trump was also on track to secure the required 1,215 delegates needed for the Republican nomination."

            "date": "2024-03-28T15:03:35Z",
            "content": "Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor and two-time losing candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, said he would not mount a third-party White House run \u2013 closing another door on No Labels, the non-partisan group seeking to mount a campaign. \u201cI appreciate the encouragement I\u2019ve gotten to pursue a third-party candidacy,\u201d Christie said. \u201cI believe we need a country that once again feels like everyone has a stake in what we\u2019re doing and leadership that strives to bring people together, instead of using anger to divide us. \u201cWhile I believe this is a conversation that needs to be had with the American people, I also believe that if there is not a pathway to win and if my candidacy in any way, shape or form would help Donald Trump become president again, then it is not the way forward.\u201d Founded in 2010, No Labels describes itself as \u201ca national movement of commonsense Americans pushing our leaders together to solve our country\u2019s biggest problems\u201d. Seeking ballot access, it has been rebuffed by possible candidates but nonetheless announced a \u201ccountry over party committee\u201d to select a \u201cunity presidential ticket\u201d. Organisers have also said they will not field a candidate if none suitable can be found. The group suffered a further blow on Wednesday with the death of its chair, Joe Lieberman, the former Democratic and independent senator from Connecticut who was Gore\u2019s running mate in 2000. The Washington Post reported that Christie spent \u201cthe last several weeks\u201d considering a No Labels bid, commissioning polling and working out notional budgets. Unnamed sources told the Post such work resulted in the conclusion that a successful third-party candidate would need to win 20 to 25 states \u2013 an unrealistic prospect. Third-party candidates often operate as spoilers. Famously, in 2000, the Green candidate, Ralph Nader, cost Al Gore dearly in his razor-thin defeat by George W Bush. In 2016, another Green, Jill Stein, took votes from Hillary Clinton in her defeat by Trump. This year, Robert F Kennedy Jr, an independent, threatens to take votes from both Trump and Joe Biden, with observers split as to who stands to lose most. A former US attorney for New Jersey, Christie was governor from 2010 to 2018. Initially popular, he left office with historically low approval ratings after scandals including Bridgegate, in which lanes on the George Washington Bridge, which connects New Jersey with upper Manhattan, were closed as political payback against a Democratic mayor. Christie ran for the Republican nomination in 2016 but dropped out and gave Trump his first major endorsement. The former governor stayed close to Trump throughout his presidency, despite being ejected from transition planning in what he called a \u201chit job\u201d by Jared Kushner \u2013 Trump\u2019s son-in-law, whose father Christie helped put in jail \u2013 and despite contracting Covid-19 from Trump and nearly dying. Having finally split from Trump over the attack on Congress of 6 January 2021, Christie mounted a 2024 campaign meant to stop Trump being nominated again. Failing in that aim, Christie dropped out before the first vote. Until Wednesday, he had consistently refused to rule out a third-party bid."

            "date": "2024-03-09T13:00:32Z",
            "content": "In past years, the first phase of the general election has involved at least one of the presidential nominees introducing themselves to the broader public and presenting their case for taking the country in a new direction. But that has been rendered unnecessary this year: former president Donald Trump and president Joe Biden are very familiar to the American electorate \u2013 and they are broadly unpopular. \u201cI think this is the worst election in my lifetime,\u201d said George Argodale, a Nikki Haley supporter from Gainesville, Virginia. \u201cIt\u2019s just terrible that we don\u2019t have better candidates.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a sad state of affairs for our country that those are the two best candidates that we can come up with,\u201d agreed Peggy Hudson, a primary voter in Charleston, South Carolina. Judith Smith, from Moncks Corner, South Carolina, said of Biden and Trump: \u201cThat\u2019s like choosing between a hedgehog and a porcupine.\u201d As the primary season sputters to an expected ending, following Haley\u2019s withdrawal from the Republican primary on Wednesday, voters\u2019 frustration with their general election options is palpable. According to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s polling averages, Biden\u2019s approval rating now stands at 38.1%, and Trump\u2019s rating rests at a nominally stronger 42.6%, meaning both men are disliked by a majority of Americans. Those low opinions have carried into voters\u2019 views on the general election. A YouGov-University of Massachusetts Amherst poll conducted in January found that 45% of Americans believe a Biden-Trump rematch is bad for the country. Another 26% say the rematch is neither good nor bad, while just 29% view it as good for the nation. It\u2019s not all for the same reason; the many voters lamenting their general election options represent a diverse array of ideological perspectives, ranging from anti-Trump Republicans to progressives outraged over Biden\u2019s response to the war in Gaza. \u201cOn the whole, there\u2019s a lot of ambivalence and disappointment about the prospects of a rematch,\u201d said Jesse Rhodes, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. \u201cThere\u2019s a widespread perception among those individuals that the candidates are too old and that they tend to focus on issues that are issues of yesterday.\u201d Conversations on the campaign trail reflect those commonly held beliefs, as a number of primary voters across multiple states said that they wished they had another option for November. Among anti-Trump Republicans, many of whom voted for Haley in their primaries, the potential re-election of the former president represents a return to the chaos that defined his first term. Echoing concerns shared by most Democrats, they predict that Trump would undermine the foundation of the US government if elected. Vincent DiMaro, an 80-year-old voter in Charleston who voted for Haley in the primary last month, cited Trump\u2019s temperament and Biden\u2019s age of 81 as significant liabilities for the nation\u2019s future (Trump is 77). \u201cI want to see the country survive, and I don\u2019t think it will under Trump,\u201d he said. But, he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think Biden is a particularly good president right now. I can\u2019t be president. I know what my limitations are, and I\u2019m in better shape than Biden.\u201d Argodale voted early in the Virginia primary to cast a ballot for Haley, but he said he would have to support Biden in the general election if Trump won the Republican nomination. \u201cI am on the conservative side of things, and [Haley] is the only viable candidate in my opinion,\u201d he said. \u201c[Trump] is just a terrible human being and doesn\u2019t deserve any votes.\u201d Although Democrats broadly agree with that assessment, some carry concerns about Biden, particularly regarding his age. Hudson acknowledged her politics lean to the left, as she previously worked for the late Democratic senator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina, but she cast a primary ballot for Haley in Charleston because she is \u201cdisgusted\u201d by Trump. Hudson indicated she would support Biden in November, but she lamented the options available to voters in the general election. \u201cNot that Joe Biden has not done a good job. He has done some very good things for this country,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cBut I do think it is time for a new generation of leaders.\u201d An enthusiasm problem The war in Gaza has presented a significant electoral vulnerability for Biden, as the president has faced intense criticism from progressives within his own party over his response to Israel\u2019s airstrike campaign that has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians. Progressive leaders in multiple states have organized campaigns to urge supporters to vote \u201cuncommitted\u201d or \u201cleave it blank\u201d instead of casting a ballot for Biden as a means of protesting his handling of the war. In Michigan, uncommitted won 13% of the vote in last month\u2019s primary, and uncommitted captured 19% of votes in the Minnesota Democratic primary on Tuesday. Hassan Jama, an imam in Minneapolis, Minnesota, campaigned for Biden in 2020 but has joined the uncommitted campaign. When asked about his options for November, he suggested he may vote for a candidate other than Biden or Trump. Voters can cast ballots for the independent presidential candidate, Cornel West, or the Green Party candidate, Jill Stein, both of whom have condemned Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza as \u201cgenocide\u201d, or they could leave the top of the ticket blank. \u201cWe\u2019re not voting for Trump, definitely no,\u201d Jama said. \u201cWe have more than two choices.\u201d Ruth Schultz, a Minnesota primary voter who has organized with MN Families for Palestine, similarly ruled out voting for Trump, but she would not yet commit to supporting Biden in the general election. \u201cI know that I will never vote for Trump. That is a given,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cI want to see President Biden take a stronger stance for peace and how to get a ceasefire and to use all the tools at his disposal in order to do that. I am watching that as a voter in the general election.\u201d The uproar among many left-leaning voters has created an enthusiasm gap between the two political parties that could pose a problem for Biden. Although many people who backed Biden in 2020 express concern about his re-election, Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters remain as fervent as ever. According to the YouGov-UMass poll, 45% of Republicans believe the Biden-Trump rematch is good for the country, but only 21% of Democrats say the same. When speaking to Trump voters on the campaign trail, many are quick to praise him as the best president of their lifetimes, and they display no hesitation about supporting him again this fall. \u201cI\u2019ve been supporting him since he ran [in 2016], came down the escalator [at Trump Tower], ever since that,\u201d said Chris Pennington, a voter from Johns Island, South Carolina. \u201cI think he\u2019s the best one to take on all the problems that we have.\u201d Argodale does not support Trump, but he has seen firsthand how much devotion he can inspire. \u201cIn my social circle, there are Trumpers, so they\u2019re diehard,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he shot somebody on Fifth Avenue, they\u2019d still vote for him.\u201d If Biden wants to win in November, he will have to work to narrow that enthusiasm gap or bring enough reluctant independents into his camp \u2013 or, most likely, do both. Dire predictions The widespread disappointment among voters regarding the Biden-Trump rematch will have sweeping political consequences this fall, but their opinions on the election also offer startling revelations about Americans\u2019 fears for the country\u2019s future. The YouGov-UMass survey included open-ended questions that asked respondents what they believed would happen if the opposing party won the White House. The answers were both dire and specific, Rhodes said, with respondents predicting the end of democracy and a sharp rise in political persecution if their party were to lose. \u201cThe perception that victory by the other candidate would be dangerous and threatening has been rising pretty consistently for some time,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cI think what\u2019s distinctive in this election cycle is just how intense those feelings are and how personal they are.\u201d Biden and Trump have both spoken in severe terms about what would happen if their opponent were to win, and those arguments appear to be sinking in for many voters. Nathan Richter, who voted for Biden in Arlington, Virginia, on Tuesday, was concise when asked about the possibility of Trump\u2019s return to the White House. \u201cPlease, God, no,\u201d he said. \u201cI question our country\u2019s ability to withstand another four years of Trump.\u201d John Schuster said he plans to vote for Biden in November, but he cast a primary ballot for Haley because of his overwhelming concern about a Trump victory. \u201cThere\u2019s no greater imperative in the world than stopping Donald Trump,\u201d Schuster said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be the end of democracy and the world order if he becomes president.\u201d Biden supporters tend to frame the stakes of the election in terms of democracy and political violence, Rhodes noted, while Trump supporters\u2019 concerns are more often shaped around a perceived threat that Democrats pose to American values. Douglas Benton, a Trump supporter from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, warned that the US would become a \u201cthird-world country\u201d if Biden were to win reelection. \u201cOur business is broken,\u201d Benton said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we became the most profitable country on the planet, is through capitalism and democracy and laws. Right now all three of those are gone.\u201d Past elections have proven just how motivating negative emotions can be in turning out voters, which is why Rhodes believes that participation will still be high in November despite the nominees\u2019 unpopularity. \u201cIt\u2019s not an election that is going to inspire people on the basis of positive sentiments,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cBut it is an election that I strongly suspect is going to ultimately mobilize a lot of people because they believe that their vote is important for protecting themselves.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino contributed reporting from Moncks Corner, South Carolina, and the Guardian\u2019s Rachel Leingang contributed reporting from Minneapolis, Minnesota"

            "date": "2024-03-17T19:57:54Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s coming up to 10pm in Ukraine, and the Ukraine blog is closing. Here\u2019s a summary of today\u2019s key events: Exit polls show Vladimir Putin winning a huge majority in Russia\u2019s presidential election which had only one possible result. Polls suggest 71-year-old Putin has won the election with nearly 88% of the vote, and will overtake Joseph Stalin to become Russia\u2019s longest-serving leader for more than 200 years. Putin was standing for the six-year term against three candidates from parties who have not criticised his rule nor his invasion of Ukraine. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Putin was \u201cimitating\u201d yet another election, adding that Russian leader would stop at nothing to rule forever and his election has no legitimacy. Britain, Poland, German and the US have criticised the election process as neither free nor fair. The British Foreign Office minister David Cameron said the elections had been held illegally in Ukrainian territory and offered \u201ca lack of choice for voters and no independent monitoring\u201d. The Polish Foreign Office said that voting took place in conditions of extreme repression. The German Foreign Ministry described the process as a pseudo-election and the White House said the elections were \u201cobviously not free, nor fair\u201d. Nationwide turnout was 74.22% at 6pm when polls closed, officials said, surpassing the 67.5% seen in 2018. At least 74 people were arrested across Russia in connection with the election, according to OVD-Info. Despite tight controls, there have been several dozen cases of vandalism at polling stations. Anti-Putin protests took place outside polling stations as Russian citizens lined up to vote at Russian embassies around the world. A Russian missile attack on the Black Sea port of Mykolaiv earlier today killed a man and wounded eight people. That\u2019s it from me, Donna Ferguson. It\u2019s been a privilege for me to write the blog today. Thanks for following along. If you want to continue following news on the Russian presidential elections, go to https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia Foreign Office minister David Cameron has spoken out about the election: The polls have closed in Russia, following the illegal holding of elections on Ukrainian territory, a lack of choice for voters and no independent OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) monitoring. This is not what free and fair elections look like.\u201d The Russian missile attack on the Black Sea port of Mykolaiv earlier today killed a man and wounded eight people, Ukrainian officials have said. Ukraine\u2019s ministry of internal affairs shared images of damaged houses, wrecked or burnt-out cars, including one with a pair of abandoned shoes and other damaged items strewn on the ground alongside its open driver\u2019s door, and rescue workers helping people leave the scene and dousing a blackened car. \u201cPolice found an injured girl with shrapnel wounds who was given first aid on the spot and taken to hospital,\u201d the ministry said on its Telegram channel of the aftermath in Mykolaiv. There was a record turnout at today\u2019s presidential elections in Russia, according to Russian election officials. Nationwide turnout was 74.22% at 6pm when polls closed, officials said, surpassing 2018 levels of 67.5%. Here\u2019s President Zelenskiy\u2019s reaction to the exit polls in full: These days, the Russian dictator imitates another \u201celections.\u201d Everyone in the world understands that this person, like many others throughout history, has become sick with power and will stop at nothing to rule forever. There is no evil he would not do to maintain his personal power. And no one in the world would have been safeguarded from this. I am grateful to every state, leader, and international organization that has and will continue to call these things by their proper names. Everything Russia does in Ukraine\u2019s occupied territories is a crime. There should be a fair response to everything the Russian murderers did in this war to secure Putin\u2019s eternal rule. Only one thing scares him the most: accountability. This imitation of \u201celections\u201d has no legitimacy and cannot have any. This person must end up on the dock in The Hague. This is what we must ensure. Anyone in the world who values life and decency.\u201d He addressed his people in Ukrainian in a video posted on X: The exit poll result means Putin, a former KGB lieutenant colonel who first rose to power in 1999, will overtake Joseph Stalin and become Russia\u2019s longest-serving leader for more than 200 years. The Polish Ministry has also reacted to the exit polls: From 15 to 17 March 2024, so-called presidential elections took place in Russia. The voting took place in conditions of extreme repression against society, making it impossible to make a free, democratic choice.\u201d The British Foreign Office has commented on the elections: By illegally holding elections on Ukrainian territory, Russia demonstrates that it is not interested in finding a path to peace. The UK will continue to provide humanitarian, economic and military aid to Ukrainians defending their democracy.\u201d Germany\u2019s Foreign Ministry also commented: The pseudo-election in Russia is neither free nor fair, the result will surprise nobody. Putin\u2019s rule is authoritarian, he relies on censorship, repression &amp; violence. The \u201celection\u201d in the occupied territories of Ukraine are null and void &amp; another breach of international law.\u201d It\u2019s worth remembering that voting for the presidential election also took place for the first time in the four Ukrainian regions Russia partly controls and has claimed since 2022. Voting also took place in Crimea, which Moscow took from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv regards the election on occupied territory as illegal and void. Speaking about the anti-Putin protests that have taken place outside Russian embassies today, Ruslan Shaveddinov of Navalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation said: We showed ourselves, all of Russia and the whole world that Putin is not Russia that Putin has seized power in Russia. Our victory is that we, the people, defeated fear, we defeated solitude \u2013 many people saw they were not alone.\u201d \u201cPutin\u2019s task is now to imprint his worldview indelibly into the minds of the Russian political establishment\u201d to ensure a like-minded successor, according to Nikolas Gvosdev, director of the National Security Program at the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute. For a U.S. administration that hoped Putin\u2019s Ukraine adventure would be wrapped up by now with a decisive setback to Moscow\u2019s interests, the election is a reminder that Putin expects that there will be many more rounds in the geopolitical boxing ring.\u201d The nationwide turnout for the elections surpassed 2018 levels of 67.5%, Reuters reports. There was no independent tally of how many of Russia\u2019s 114 million voters took part in the opposition demonstrations, but tens of thousands of police and security officials were out in force. At least 74 people were arrested on Sunday across Russia, according to OVD-Info, a group that monitors crackdowns on dissent. Reuters journalists report seeing an increase in the flow of voters, especially younger people, at noon at polling stations in Moscow, St Petersburg and Ekaterinburg, with queues of several hundred people and even thousands. This is significant because supporters of Putin\u2019s most prominent opponent Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic prison last month, had called on Russians to come out at a \u201cNoon against Putin\u201d protest to show their dissent against a leader they cast as a corrupt autocrat. Some of the voters who turned up at noon said they were protesting, though Reuters reports there were few outward signs to distinguish them from ordinary voters. The poll suggesting Putin won the election means the 71-year-old, who has been in power for more than two decades, now has another six-year term in office. Commenting on the exit poll, President Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address that \u201cthe Russian dictator is simulating another election,\u201d and that Putin was \u201csick for power and is doing everything to rule forever\u201d. He added: There is no legitimacy in this imitation of elections and there cannot be. This person should be on trial in The Hague. That\u2019s what we have to ensure.\u201d The US has also cast doubt on the exit poll result. The White House said the elections in Russian were \u201cobviously not free, nor fair\u201d given how Putin has imprisoned his opponents and prevented others from running against him. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said there is no legitimacy in Russia\u2019s \u201cimitation of elections\u201d. He said he thinks Putin seeks to rule forever. Exit polls show Vladimir Putin winning a huge majority in Russia\u2019s presidential election which had only one possible result. An exit poll by the Russian Public Opinion Research Centre suggests 87.97% of people voted for the incumbent, with 24.4% of the precincts counted. Another exit poll by pollster FOM showed Putin won 87.8%. First official results indicated the polls were accurate. Putin was standing against three candidates from parties who have not criticised his rule nor his invasion of Ukraine. Reuters reporters have been out interviewing Russian voters in Latvia. Earlier today, about 100 anti-Putin protestors gathered in front of the polling station at the Russian embassy in Riga. Vladimir, a permanent resident in Latvia who gave only his first name, said he came to cast a blank ballot. \u201cI don\u2019t want war, I don\u2019t want things like in Ukraine,\u201d he added. Andrei, a 28-year-old voting in the Russian election for the first time, said he would vote against Putin even though the result of the election is \u201cprobably obvious\u201d, as he felt it was a way he could oppose the war. Kirill Martynov, editor in chief of Novaya Gazeta Europe, an independent Russian media outlet founded in Riga in April 2022 after the introduction of wartime censorship in Russia, said he planned to oppose this elections by spoiling the ballot. Older Russian citizens were more reticient with reporters. Some elderly voters interviewed outside the polling station merely said it was their civic duty to vote, but did not reveal which candidate they would support. Latvian police and border guards were checking voters\u2019 documents outside the polling station. The Latvian State Police chief, Armands Ruks, said the controls were to ensure Russian citizens taking part in the voting did not break the law. By noon, 351 people were checked at the entrance of the Russian embassy in Riga and 14 were found with expired residency permits, the State Police told local media. One voter said she was afraid to speak to the media or give her name for fear her residence permit in Latvia might not be extended. The Russian embassy condemned cases of confiscation of Latvian identity documents from Russian voters, with some citizens now required to appear at the migration service to receive an order to leave. In Moscow, dozens of brave Russians have been flocking to Alexei Navalny\u2019s grave today to symbolically \u2018cast their vote\u2019 for the dead late opposition politician, TV footage showed. Navalny was buried at the Borisovo cemetery in southern Moscow on 1 March. Video footage posted on social media by the Novaya Gazeta Europe news outlet and other media showed dozens of Navalny supporters at his grave. They had placed various tributes, with phrases such as \u201cWe choose you\u201d written on them, Reuters reports. Official voting slips which had been amended to include Navalny\u2019s name on the list of candidates with a tick next to it were also visible. Supporters were shown placing flowers on Navalny\u2019s grave, which was already piled high with flowers. More than 8 million people have voted online in Russia\u2019s presidential election, an election commission official said on Sunday. Voting has been taking place over the past three days and involves 114 million voters. At least a thousand anti-Kremlin Russian emigres queued for hours outside the Russian embassy in Armenia, Reuters reports. A queue stretching more than one kilometre long snaked through the streets around the large embassy complex in central Yerevan, where voting was being held. All those who spoke to Reuters said they had come to register their opposition to Vladimir Putin and his policies. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the president will be elected without us,\u201d said Kirill, a Russian living in Armenia who did not give his surname. \u201cI came personally to show that I disagree and to show that there are many of us. It seems to me that if the authorities see that there are many of us who disagree, then at least life in Russia may be a little easier for people and maybe some changes will occur.\u201d Armenia, which allows Russians to stay without a visa, became one of the most popular refuges for Russians opposed to the Kremlin as political repression and conscription ramped up after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Yerevan authorities said in 2023 that over 100,000 Russians had moved to the mountainous South Caucasus country of about 3 million people. Many of those Russians, who are typically young, anti-war and opposed to President Vladimir Putin, showed up to cast their votes today. Allies of Alexei Navalny, the opposition leader who died in an Arctic penal colony last month, had asked his supporters in Russia and abroad to come to the polls at midday on Sunday in a show of strength. They recommended supporters either spoil their ballots, or to vote for one of the three nominal opposition candidates permitted to run. One Russian who gave her name as Alina said she had come with her husband without hope of her vote affecting the election\u2019s outcome, but to show how many people shared her views. \u201cThe voting is not the most important thing here,\u201d she said. Many of those queueing to vote said that they hope one day to return to their homeland in future, even as Putin is set to receive another six-year term in office. \u201cI dream of returning to Russia,\u201d said Olga Mutovina, a journalist from the Siberian city of Irkutsk. \u201cI dream of a Russia where there will be independent courts, where the press will work freely, where people will not be imprisoned for their opinions.\u201d Reuters reports that not all of the Russians who came to vote appeared to be opponents. In London, one man queuing to vote was spotted wearing a top that read \u2018Jesus is my saviour. Putin is my president\u2019. Others at the embassy spoke of their desire to make their voices heard by casting their vote, even if it does not affect the results of the election. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been heard for past 30 years. Nobody listened to us. We moved, we emigrated, and even here, far away from Russia, we feel the consequences of not us not being heard,\u201d voter Natalia Cherednikova said in London. \u201cThis year is so important just to be there for ourselves, even though we all (are) ...fatalistic in terms of the meaning of it and that nobody really cares. It\u2019s just for ourselves that we\u2019ve been here. We have voted. We showed up.\u201d Russian\u2019s foreign military spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has tried to suggest that Russian citizens did not participate in the anti-Putin protests that have been taking place outside Russian embassies around the world. She questioned if all those voting at foreign embassies were opponents of Putin and accused Western media of disseminating propaganda about the events. \u201cRussian citizens did not come to the rallies and performances that unfriendly regimes and their paid information services are trying to present,\u201d Zakharova said. \u201cThey came to cast their vote. Who they voted for and how they voted is their free choice. But the fact that they rejected the appeals of the marginalised is obvious to everyone.\u201d The protesters represent a small fraction of Russia\u2019s 114 million voters and are unlikely to have any impact on the final outcome. Ukraine has now said that at least six people were wounded in the Russian missile attack on the Black Sea port city of Mykolaiv earlier today, Reuters reports. \u201cPolice found an injured girl with shrapnel wounds who was given first aid on the spot and taken to hospital,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s ministry of internal affairs said on its Telegram channel, detailing the aftermath of a rocket hitting Mykolaiv. It shared images of damaged houses, wrecked or burnt-out cars, including one with a pair of abandoned shoes and other damaged items strewn on the ground alongside its open driver\u2019s door, and rescue workers assisting people away from the scene and dousing a blackened car with water. \u201cAs a result of the attack, houses, vehicles and infrastructure were damaged,\u201d the ministry said. Separately, the Ukrainian military said Russian air attacks had damaged agricultural enterprises and destroyed several industrial buildings in Odesa. Mykolaiv\u2019s regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said on Telegram that there had been two strikes on Mykolaiv coming from the same direction as the strike on Odesa. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. Ukraine\u2019s air force said Russia launched 16 drones and seven missiles, and that 14 drones were destroyed over the Odesa region. Protests have been taking place all day long in many cities in Europe next to queues of Russian voters waiting to vote in the presidential elections at their local Russian embassy. In Montenegro, one woman held a sign calling Putin a killer. A man outside the Russian embassy in Riga, Latvia, held up a placard equating overthrowing Putin to ending the war. In Paris, a man held a sign comparing Putin to Hitler. Russian nationals living in the UK have been spoiling their presidential election ballots in protest against Putin extending his leadership. The Russian Democratic Society (RDS) \u2013 described as a community of Russian immigrants in the UK \u2013 organised a Noon Against Putin demonstration outside the Russian Embassy in London. On its Facebook event, the group said: \u201cProtesters can express their protest by voting against Putin or by spoiling the ballot by checking two candidates, thus rendering it invalid but not subject to falsification.\u201d Aleksandra Kallenberg spoke to Sky News outside the Russian embassy in London and told the outlet she had spoiled her ballot by ticking three candidates besides Mr Putin. \u201cIt is important, because I see my people, I see my nation, I see how many people are actually against the regime, against Putin, because our propaganda really tries to show that no-one is actually against (him) \u2026 and I see how many people are actually here today and that\u2019s very inspiring,\u201d Ms Kallenberg told the broadcaster. Dmitrii Moskovskii, also at the London protest, told Sky News that the death of Mr Navalny had triggered a backlash against Mr Putin\u2019s regime. He said: \u201cMany, many people inside Russia and outside of it have been saying to me that after Navalny\u2019s death, they\u2019ve really realised that this regime is crossing the line, that this regime is no more legitimate and cannot, do not, have a right to exist anymore.\u201d The crowd outside the embassy chanted \u201cRussia without Putin, Putin is a killer\u201d. Outside Russian embassies around the world, Russian citizens queuing up to vote in the Russian presidential elections have been protesting again Putin\u2019s rule. In Moldova, a woman holding a placard depicting Adolf Hitler, Putin and Joseph Stalin protests in front of the Russian Embassy in Chisinau. As voters queue outside the Russian embassy in Berlin, a woman holds a placard suggesting Putin is a monster. A woman holds a placard calling for \u2018Russian without Putin\u2019 at a protest against the re-election of Putin opposite the Russian Embassy in London. As we wait for the exit polls from Russia, here\u2019s a roundup of the latest news today: Vladimir Putin is poised to tighten his grip on power with an expected landslide victory in the ongoing presidential election. While an emphatic win is expected, opponents of Putin have staged a symbolic noon protest at polling stations with further demonstrations outside Russian embassies around the world. At least 74 people have been arrested across Russia on Sunday in connection with the ongoing presidential election, according to OVD-Info. Despite tight controls, there have been several dozen cases of vandalism at polling stations. The turnout at Russia\u2019s presidential election has surpassed 2018 levels in the final hours before the polls close. According to the TASS news agency, 67.54% of eligible voters had cast their ballots as of Sunday morning, eclipsing the 67.5% turnout seen six years ago. Vladimir Putin fears going to war with Nato nations, according to Estonia prime minister Kaja Kallas. Kallas told the BBC that while Putin is well able to \u201csow fear\u201d, nation leaders should remember that he too has concerns. Russian proposals for peace are all centred around continued Ukrainian subjugation, Czech president Petr Pavel has claimed. Pavel told Czech Radio on Saturday that the Kremlin\u2019s proposals to date have all been a \u201cdiktat\u201d. British defence secretary Grant Shapps was forced to abandon a trip to Ukraine\u2019s southern city of Odesa because of a Russian missile threat. As he flew to Poland last week, Shapps was notified that a convoy carrying both the Ukrainian president and Greek prime minister had narrowly avoided a Russian missile strike. At least five people have been injured after Russian forces attacked the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv. The region\u2019s governor, Vitalii Kim, has said that the injuries of the victims are not critical. Ukraine\u2019s GDP rose by 3.6% during the first two months of this year, according to the country\u2019s economy minister. Yulia Svyrydenko said on Sunday that this was driven by \u201cseveral factors\u201d, including investment demand and agricultural exports. Long-range attack drones have hit 12 Russian oil refineries during the war so far, according to a Ukrainian intelligence source. The Russian defence ministry has so far confirmed a total of 35 Ukrainian drone incursions across various regions. Russian arms exports fell by 53% between the periods 2014-2018 and 2019-2023, according to new research by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The upshot was that Russia dropped from second to third place in the global arms export rankings. Only 12 countries received major Russian arms in 2023, compared to 31 in 2019. Vladimir Putin is \u201cafraid\u201d of going to war with Nato nations, the prime minister of Estonia has claimed. In an interview with the BBC reported by Ukrinform, Kaja Kallas urged nation leaders to also think about \u201cwhat Putin is afraid of\u201d. \u201cHe has been threatening with nuclear war for quite some time. But it has been only words. He has been very good at sow fear within our societies and listening, what we are afraid of,\u201d said Kallas. \u201cWe also have to think what Putin is afraid of. And he is actually afraid of going to war with Nato countries. He doesn\u2019t want that. And we, of course, don\u2019t want it either,\u201d she added. More than 70 people have been arrested across Russia on Sunday in connection with the ongoing presidential election in the country. OVD-Info, a group that monitors crackdowns on dissent, has reported that 74 arrests have been made nationwide. Protestors descended upon polling stations in Moscow, St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg at noon to make their feelings known over Vladimir Putin\u2019s ongoing control of the Kremlin. Reuters has reported that, despite tight controls, there have been several dozen cases of vandalism at polling stations. A woman was arrested in St. Petersburg after she threw a firebomb at a polling station entrance, and several others were detained across the country for throwing green antiseptic or ink into ballot boxes. Dmitry Medvedev, a deputy head of the Russian Security Council chaired by Putin, called for toughening the punishment for those who vandalize polling stations, arguing they should face treason charges for attempting to derail the vote amid the fighting in Ukraine. Putin looks set for a landslide victory after facing no credible rivals and overseeing a clamping down on political dissent. A new six-year term would enable him to take over Josef Stalin and become Russia\u2019s longest-serving leader for more than 200 years. Russian forces have attacked the southern city of Mykolaiv twice with missiles earlier today. The Kyiv Independent has reported that at least five people are wounded as a result of the attacks, which saw missiles hit the city one after another at around 2pm local time. Regional governor Vitalii Kim has said that the injuries of the victims are not critical. According to the governor, Russia carried out the attack from the same place as its previous strike against Odesa on 15 March. Twenty 21 people were killed in that attack, Moscow\u2019s deadliest in weeks. Ukrainian shelling in the Russian region of Belgorod has killed one man alongside injuring 11 others, the regional governor has said. Belgorod is one of a number of regions affected by Ukrainian drone incursions overnight. On Sunday morning the Russian defence ministry reported that some 35 incursions had taken place, including in the Kursk and Rostov regions which also border Ukraine. The number of casualties has been confirmed by the regional governor for Belgorod, Vyacheslav Gladkov, who said earlier on Sunday that a 16-year-old girl was killed in a separate shelling incident in the region. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. Outside Russian embassies around the world, protests are being staged against the re-election of Putin. UK France Latvia Finland AFP reports that Moldovan police have detained a man after two firebombs were said to have been thrown at the Russian embassy in the capital city of Chisinau: Media in Moldova, which borders Ukraine, reported that the embassy, where voting was underway for Russia\u2019s presidential election, was attacked with Molotov cocktails. There were no injuries. \u201cA man threw two containers of flammable substances over the fence of the Russian embassy in Chisinau,\u201d police said in a statement. The 54-year-old Moldovan \u2013 who said he also has Russian citizenship \u2013 was \u201cimmediately detained\u201d and being held for questioning, police said. \u201cHe justified his action by some dissatisfaction he has with the actions of the Russian authorities,\u201d police added. Moldova this week protested Moscow\u2019s decision to open several polling stations in separatist Transnistria during the Russian presidential election. The country of 2.6 million situated between Ukraine and Romania wanted the vote to be organised only at the Russian embassy in Chisinau. Although Vladimir Putin will, once again, to win the Russian presidential election, opponents have today staged a protest against the inevitability of his ongoing grip over the Kremlin. Supporters of the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny gathered at polling stations within Russia and beyond at midday local time for the so-called \u201cNoon against Putin\u201d protest. Many of them planned to spoil their ballot papers, to vote for one of the three opposition candidates, or to write in Navalny\u2019s name. Reports said thousands of people had taken part in the peaceful protests. Navalny\u2019s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, participated in a protest outside the Russian embassy in Berlin, Germany, alongside others queuing to cast their votes. Vladimir Putin is poised to tighten his grip on power on Sunday with an expected landscape victory in the ongoing presidential election. Opponents staged a symbolic noon protest at polling stations, while the three-day vote has been hit by Ukrainian bombardments and a series of incursions into Russian territory by anti-Putin sabotage groups. British defence secretary Grant Shapps was forced to abandon a trip to Ukraine\u2019s southern city of Odesa because of a Russian missile threat. As he flew to Poland last week, Shapps was notified that a convoy carrying both the Ukrainian president and Greek prime minister had narrowly avoided a Russian missile strike.

According to the TASS news agency, 67.54% of eligible voters had cast their ballots as of Sunday morning, eclipsing the 67.5% turnout seen in 2018. Long-range attack drones have hit 12 Russian oil refineries during the war so far, according to a Ukrainian intelligence source. The Russian defence ministry has so far confirmed a total of 35 Ukrainian drone incursions across various regions. Long-range Ukrainian attack drones have hit 12 Russian oil refineries during the war so far, a Ukrainian intelligence source told Reuters on Sunday. Officials in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar said drones, launched by the SBU domestic security service, had attacked the Slavyansk oil refinery overnight. On Sunday morning the Russian defence ministry confirmed a total of 35 Ukrainian drone incursions, including four in the Moscow region and two in the neighbouring Kaluga and Yaroslavl regions. More Ukrainian drones attacked the Belgorod, Kursk and Rostov regions bordering Ukraine, as well as the southern Krasnodar region. Investment demand and agricultural exports are two of \u201cseveral factors\u201d which have driven an increase in Ukraine\u2019s GDP seen during the first two months of this year. According to Reuters, economy minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on Sunday that Ukraine\u2019s GDP rose 3.6% during this period. \u201cThis was driven by several factors, including investment demand, favourable weather conditions for construction works, agricultural exports, (and) the operation of the Ukrainian sea corridor,\u201d Svyrydenko said on Facebook, citing preliminary data. She said the expansion of production capacity in the mining industry and stability in the energy sector were additional factors. \u201cThanks to the positive performance of key sectors of the economy, we expect sustainable growth for the entire first quarter,\u201d she added. Ukraine\u2019s GDP rose 3.5% in January, having grown by 5% in 2023 after a 28.8% fall in the previous year. The turnout at Russia\u2019s presidential election is approaching 70% with hours remaining until the polls close. At 67.54% as of Sunday morning, the number of eligible voters casting their ballots has surpassed 2018 levels according to the TASS news agency. Turnout in 2018 was 67.5%; the highest ever turnout in a modern Russian presidential election was in June 1991, when turnout reached 74.7%. The ongoing election, which has been hit by Ukrainian bombardments and a series of incursions into Russian territory by anti-Putin sabotage groups, will end in a landslide victory for Vladimir Putin who is running virtually unopposed. British defence secretary Grant Shapps was forced to abandon a trip to Ukraine\u2019s southern city of Odesa because of a Russian missile threat. As he flew to Poland from RAF Northolt last week, Shapps was notified that an armoured convoy carrying both the Ukrainian president and Greek prime minister narrowly avoided a Russian missile strike while visiting the port city on 6 March. Shapps arrived in Kyiv the following day for talks with president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on 7 March, after which the planned onward journey to Odesa was called off.

The self-titled independent state of South Ossetia has discussed becoming part of Russia, the Russian news agency RIA has claimed. South Ossetia broke away from Georgian rule in a war in 1991-92. In 2008, Russia recognised as independent both this state and the separate breakaway region of Abkhazia. This came after Russian troops repelled a Georgian attempt to retake South Ossetia in a five-day war in 2008. According to a report by Reuters, RIA cited the head of South Ossetia\u2019s parliament as confirming on Sunday that discussions over becoming part of Russia have taken place. The two regions make up a fifth of Georgia\u2019s territory. \u201cWe are discussing all these issues in close coordination with Russia, taking into account our bilateral relations and treaties,\u201d Alan Alborov, the chairman of South Ossetia\u2019s parliament, has been quoted as saying by RIA. \u201cWhen we come to this idea together with the Russian Federation (about joining the Russian Federation), we will do it.\u201d Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine reveals a man \u2018cut off from political and military realities\u2019, whose obsession with supposed western plotting and a return to a pre-Soviet imperial Russia drives his quest to be all-conquering. An expected landslide for Putin in the ongoing election has been made possible by the lack of credible rivals and huge levels of spending on propaganda, vote-fixing in occupied Ukraine, and unopposed nationwide campaigning. Read more here: Here are some of the latest images of Belgorod coming in via news agency wires: Russian proposals for peace have been a \u2018diktat\u2019, the president of the Czech Republic has claimed. It is impossible to imagine Russia and Ukraine negotiating a peace agreement because Russia\u2019s proposals are all centred around continued Ukrainian subjugation, according to Czech president Petr Pavel. The Kyiv Independent has reported comments made by Pavel to Czech Radio on Saturday, in which he claimed that \u201call Russian proposals so far have been in fact a diktat\u201d. \u201cThe Kremlin has presented its list of conditions that it as an aggressor has no right to put forward.\u201d Ukraine has maintained throughout that the peace talks should be held on the basis of its 10-step peace formula, which includes a full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. Russia has rejected this proposal. Russia\u2019s response to Emmanuel Macron\u2019s request for a ceasefire in Ukraine during the Olympic games has been to ask France to stop supplying weapons to the country. The French president made the request in an interview from Paris on Saturday, with Reuters reporting that Macron said a ceasefire is \u201cwhat has always happened\u201d. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova responded to this request by urging the French president to cease weapon supplies, the TASS news agency reported. Zakharova also said Macron should have proposed the same ceasefire to the sides of the conflict in the Middle East. Critics of Vladimir Putin and his Kremlin regime have called for massive protests at Russian polling stations on Sunday, the final day of a presidential election that is guaranteed to cement his hardline rule. The three-day vote has already been hit by Ukrainian bombardments and a series of incursions into Russian territory by anti-Putin sabotage groups. Read more here: Welcome to our live coverage on Ukraine. It is just after 10.30am in Kyiv and 11.30am in Moscow. Here are the headlines: Russia accused Ukraine of using \u201cterrorist activities\u201d to try to disrupt its presidential election and former president Dmitry Medvedev decried as \u201ctraitors\u201d the scattered protesters who started fires at voting booths and poured dye into ballot boxes. A Ukrainian drone dropped an explosive close to a polling station in the annexed Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine, Russian state news agency Tass said. No injuries or damage were reported and Reuters could not independently verify the incident. The Slavyansk oil refinery in Russia\u2019s Krasnodar region caught on fire on Sunday after a Ukrainian drone attack and one person died from a suspected heart attack, local officials said. Videos online showed explosions and fire, along with the sound of drones approaching the site. On Sunday morning, the Russian defence ministry reported 35 Ukrainian drone incursions, including four in the Moscow region and two in the neighbouring Kaluga and Yaroslavl regions. More Ukrainian drones attacked in the Belgorod, Kursk and Rostov regions bordering Ukraine, and in the southern Krasnodar region, the defence ministry said. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, praised the Ukrainian military for its new \u201clong-range capability\u201d, in a statement posted on Saturday night. \u201cWhat our own drones are capable of is a true Ukrainian long-range capability. Ukraine will now always have a strike force in the sky,\u201d he said on social media. Zelenskiy\u2019s comments followed Ukrainian drones striking two Rosneft oil refineries in Russia\u2019s Samara region, leaving one facility on fire on Saturday, the region\u2019s governor said. The Volga river region\u2019s Syzran refinery was on fire, Dmitry Azarov said on Telegram. Officials also confirmed an attack on the Novokubyshev refinery. Numerous other attacks during the past week have caused major damage to Russian oil refineries. Attacks continued on Russia\u2019s Belgorod oblast, with the Russian ministry of defence claiming air defence shot down 15 rockets. A man and a woman were killed in Belgorod oblast on Saturday, and another person was killed by Ukrainian shelling in the Russian city of Grayvoron, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on the Telegram messaging app. The fresh bombardments on Saturday prompted authorities to close schools and shopping centres. Five people were wounded when a Ukrainian drone hit a car in the village of Glotovo, two kilometres (1.25 miles) from the Ukrainian border, Gladkov said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told state media Vladimir Putin was being \u201cconstantly briefed\u201d by his military leaders on the situation at the border. Putin is all but certain of victory in the election after dissent has been crushed. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Saturday that Ukrainian \u201creconnaissance groups\u201d had attempted an incursion from Ukraine\u2019s Sumy region. That followed an armed incursion claimed by Ukraine-based Russian opponents of the Kremlin on Tuesday in the Belgorod and Kursk regions. Russia\u2019s defence ministry claimed its security forces killed 30 fighters. In contrast, the Russian Volunteer Corps \u2013 one of the groups that claimed to have crossed the border on Tuesday \u2013 released a video saying it had captured 25 Russian soldiers. Resistance forces set off an explosion near a polling station in Russian-occupied Skadovsk in the Kherson oblast, injuring five Russian soldiers, the national resistance centre of Ukraine said. The explosion forced Russian administration in Skadovsk to cancel voting at polling stations and allow it only at places of residence, the centre said. There had been 11 attempts to set fire to polling stations in Russia, along with 19 cases of ballot boxes being spoiled with greenery and paint, Nexta reported. Russian authorities have proposed eight-year prison sentences for those involved. The death toll in the Russian attack on civilian infrastructure in Odesa rose to 21 after an injured emergency worker died in hospital. The ballistic missile attack blasted homes in the southern city on Friday, followed by a second missile that targeted first responders, officials said. It was Moscow\u2019s deadliest attack in weeks and caused the British defence secretary, Grant Shapps, to abandon a trip because of a Russian missile threat. More than 50 people were still in hospital, Odesa deputy mayor Svitlana Bedreha said on Saturday, according to Ukrainian state media. Russian shelling killed a 51-year-old man in the Donetsk oblast and injured another, regional governor Vadym Filashkin said. Russians shelled the Donetsk oblast about 11,000 times this week, Filashkin said. There has been a record growth in the number of Russian men ages 31 to 59 with disabilities, the UK defence ministry said in its daily intelligence briefing. \u201cThe increase in the number of men with disabilities was most likely due to the growth in military invalids,\u201d the UK defence ministry said. \u201cThis is almost certainly the case. A significant majority of the over 355,000 casualties that the Russian armed forces have suffered as a result of the conflict in Ukraine have been wounded personnel.\u201d"

Donald Trump and Joe Biden expect to sail to victory in their respective parties, growing their delegate counts in a march toward this summer\u2019s conventions, where they will officially secure their parties\u2019 nomination. Here are the live results from the five presidential primaries. *** Republican delegates *** Democratic delegates *** Republican results *** Democratic results *** Who\u2019s running Donald Trump The former US president\u2019s campaign to retake the White House and once again grab his party\u2019s nomination got off to a slow start that was widely mocked. But after decisive wins in Iowa and New Hampshire, his campaign has steadily moved into a position of dominance. Trump declined to attend any of the Republican debates, has used his court appearances and many legal woes as a rallying cry to mobilize his base, and has run a surprisingly well-organized campaign. His extremist rhetoric, especially around his plans for a second term and the targeting of his political enemies, has sparked widespread fears over the threat to American democracy that his candidacy represents.

Many see this as a result of his political and legal fates becoming entwined, with a return to the Oval Office being seen as Trump\u2019s best chance of nixing his legal problems. Joe Biden Biden is the likely Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election. He announced his campaign for re-election on 25 April 2023, exactly four years after he announced his previous, successful presidential campaign. While approval for the president remains low, hovering just above 40%, political experts say he is the most likely candidate to defeat Trump. Biden has served in politics for more than five decades and is running on a platform that includes abortion rights, gun reform and healthcare. At 81, he is the oldest president in US history. Marianne Williamson Failed 2020 presidential candidate Marianne Williamson dropped out of the race last month before then resurrecting her long-shot campaign after the Michigan primary.

            "content": "Sixteen states and one territory will choose their presidential candidate in contests known as Super Tuesday, when more than a third of delegates will be assigned to determine the Republican presidential nominee. Past results and opinion polls suggest that, by Tuesday night, Donald Trump will have in effect wrapped up the Republican nomination against Nikki Haley, his sole remaining challenger, far before July\u2019s Republican national convention in Milwaukee. On the Democratic side, President Joe Biden has swept aside token challenges by Congressman Dean Phillips of Minnesota and the self-help author Marianne Williamson and is cruising to the nomination. The lopsided contests and lack of suspense are making Super Tuesday, one of the most celebrated rituals of the American election season, one of the least surprising. *** Republican delegates In the Republican primary, 874 of 2,429 total delegates will be up for grabs on Super Tuesday, and the winning candidate will ultimately need 1,215 delegates to capture the nomination. *** Democratic delegates In the Democratic contest, 1,421 delegates, representing roughly a third of all delegates, will be up for grabs on Super Tuesday, and Biden will need 1,968 delegates to officially win the nomination. *** Republican results *** Republicans running Donald Trump The former US president\u2019s campaign to retake the White House and once again grab his party\u2019s nomination got off to a slow start that was widely mocked. But after decisive wins in Iowa and New Hampshire, his campaign has steadily moved into a position of dominance. Trump declined to attend any of the Republican debates, has used his court appearances and many legal woes as a rallying cry to mobilize his base, and has run a surprisingly well-organized campaign. His extremist rhetoric, especially around his plans for a second term and the targeting of his political enemies, has sparked widespread fears over the threat to American democracy that his candidacy represents. His political style during the campaign has not shifted from his previous runs in 2016 and 2020 and, if anything, has become more extreme. Many see this as a result of his political and legal fates becoming entwined, with a return to the Oval Office being seen as Trump\u2019s best chance of nixing his legal problems. Nikki Haley The former South Carolina governor and ex-US ambassador to the United Nations under Trump has mostly hewed a fine line between being an alternative to Trump, while not outraging his base with too much direct criticism. That paid off to some extent as Haley shone in debates and rose past her competitors for the No 2 slot in the Republican race. But after losing by sizable margins in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, Haley\u2019s chances have dwindled. Ryan Binkley Binkley, a Texas businessman, has now dropped out but is still on the ballot. Binkley was a long-shot candidate who is also a pastor at Create church. The self-proclaimed far-right fiscal conservative criticized both Democrats and Republicans for not being able to balance the federal budget, and said he would focus on health costs, immigration reform and a national volunteer movement. *** Democratic results *** Democrats running Joe Biden Biden is the likely Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election.

            "date": "2024-03-18T18:30:25Z",
            "content": "Western nations have widely condemned Russia\u2019s presidential election, in which Vladimir Putin claimed a landslide victory that will keep him in power until at least 2030 amid a crackdown on dissent and opposition. \u201cThese Russian elections starkly underline the depth of repression under President Putin\u2019s regime, which seeks to silence any opposition to his illegal war,\u201d said the British foreign secretary, David Cameron, as EU foreign ministers met to approve new sanctions against 30 individuals and organisations in response to the death of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. \u201cPutin removes his political opponents, controls the media, and then crowns himself the winner. This is not democracy,\u201d Cameron said. In Washington, the state department spokesperson Vedant Patel denounced the election as \u201cundemocratic\u201d and said the US would not congratulate Putin. \u201cThis was an incredibly undemocratic process,\u201d Patel told reporters, detailing the jailing and disqualification of opponents and Navalny\u2019s death in an Arctic penal colony. \u201cHe is likely to remain the president of Russia, but that does not excuse him of his autocracy,\u201d Patel said. Calling Russia a dictatorship, a German government spokesperson said the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, would not congratulate Putin on his re-election in a vote viewed by Berlin as \u201cpredetermined\u201d. The official tally from the three-day election was a 87.28% share of the vote for Putin, which the Kremlin on Monday portrayed as a dominant victory, saying the results showed that the people had consolidated around the Russian president. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters: \u201cThis is the most eloquent confirmation of the level of support from the population of the country for its president, and its consolidation around him.\u201d In a victory speech on Sunday, Putin dismissed western criticism of the election as unfair and undemocratic, telling his supporters it was \u201cexpected\u201d. He also for the first time addressed Navalny\u2019s death, which he called a \u201csad event\u201d. At a concert on Moscow\u2019s Red Square on Monday evening to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the annexation of Crimea, Putin basked in his election win, singing the national anthem with a crowd waving Russian flags. \u201cHand in hand, we will move forward and this will make us stronger ... Long live Russia,\u201d Putin said. Putin\u2019s swift seizure of Crimea in March 2014 is seen as the beginning of 10 years of military action against Ukraine and a cornerstone of Putin\u2019s reimagined Russia. Putin told the crowd that Crimea was the \u201cpride of Russia\u201d and that the Black Sea peninsula had \u201ccome back to its native harbour\u201d when Moscow annexed the region. He attended the concert alongside the three loyalist presidential candidates who ran against him. The Russian president usually speaks at the annual celebration that marks the Crimea annexation, a speech that was preceded on Monday by patriotic songs performed by pro-Putin singers. Several independent Russian outlets reported that state employees and students had been ordered to attend the celebrations. Russia has a long history of state employees being coerced to attend pro-government rallies. Together with the crowd, Putin sang the Russian national anthem before leaving the stage. Putin\u2019s vote share, which equates to 76 million votes and is by far the biggest in post-Soviet Russian history, follows an election described as a mockery by an independent monitor group. The independent Russian election watchdog Golos said it had found unprecedented levels of fraud in the presidential elections. \u201cNever before have we seen a presidential [election] campaign that fell so far short of constitutional standards,\u201d said Golos, whose co-director is now in jail in Russia. \u201cThe elections failed to fulfil their main function: to reflect the real mood of citizens, and they did not allow [citizens] to independently and freely make decisions about the future of their country,\u201d it added. While shunned by the west, there were congratulations for Putin from the leaders of China and North Korea, two countries that have propped up Moscow in its fighting in Ukraine. Iran\u2019s president, Ebrahim Raisi, hailed Putin\u2019s \u201cdecisive victory\u201d, the state news agency IRNA reported. Russia has deployed Iran-made drones against Ukrainian cities. Putin also received messages from India and the United Arab Emirates, two traditional western allies that Moscow has successfully courted since the start of the war in Ukraine more than two years ago. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, offered his \u201cwarm congratulations\u201d to Putin, adding that he looked forward to developing their \u201cspecial\u201d relationship. Russia is India\u2019s biggest arms supplier."

            "title": "California election results: Adam Schiff and Republican Steve Garvey advance to November Senate race",
            "date": "2024-03-07T02:50:17Z",
            "content": "Adam Schiff, the centrist Democratic congressman, is poised to be the next US senator from California after securing enough votes to advance to the November election. He will face off with Republican Steve Garvey, a former professional baseball player, who also performed well in the non-partisan primary on Tuesday. Schiff, a pro-Israel Democrat, was quickly called a winner by the Associated Press, and Garvey secured his spot in the general election about an hour after polls closed. The two progressive Democratic candidates were trailing far behind, with the Orange county congresswoman Katie Porter in third place and the Bay Area congresswoman Barbara Lee in the fourth spot. Garvey stands little chance of winning in the general election; the last time a Republican won a statewide seat in California was in 2006. Facing off in the runoff with an inexperienced Republican candidate in a majority-Democratic state would probably see Schiff cruise to victory in November. The primary broke records as the most expensive Senate race in California. Schiff\u2019s campaign is widely seen as having engineered Garvey\u2019s strong primary performance by spending millions of dollars to air ads attacking Garvey, the former first baseman for the LA Dodgers and an inexperienced Republican candidate, thus elevating his name recognition among Republican voters in a way the Garvey campaign itself was not able to afford. Schiff\u2019s strategy appeared to be effective at boxing out his two Democratic progressive competitors. Neither Porter nor Lee are expected to return to Congress next year, after choosing to compete in the Senate race rather than run for re-election in their House districts. Lee, a longtime progressive, had called for a ceasefire in Gaza in October 2023. Porter broke with the Biden administration in December to call for a \u201cbilateral ceasefire\u201d. Schiff, in contrast, has shown continuing support for Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza and has refused to call for a ceasefire, a position that has sparked protests by some young progressive California Democrats. Polls showed Porter, a nationally prominent consumer advocate known for grilling CEOs with the help of her trademark whiteboard, would have been a strong competitor against Schiff in a two-Democrat race. In early polls, Porter had been coming in second after Schiff, with Lee trailing behind, until growing support for Garvey pushed Porter into third place. Porter denounced the Schiff campaign\u2019s ads targeting Garvey in early February, writing Schiff was \u201cplaying cynical, anti-democratic political games to avoid a competitive election in November\u201d and that \u201cvoters deserve better\u201d. Garvey has done minimal campaigning for the seat and gave a lackluster performance in campaign debates. He has struggled to answer policy questions from journalists. When asked about homelessness and his lack of specific ideas, he said: \u201cOnce we get through the primary, I\u2019ll start a deeper dive into the [issues].\u201d In addition to his baseball career, he also starred in weight-loss infomercials and is reportedly estranged from several of his adult children. Schiff was the frontrunner throughout the California Senate primary, thanks to his fundraising prowess, and a public profile burnished by his prominent roles in the first impeachment of Donald Trump and the investigation of the January 6 insurrection. In all, at least $65.3m was spent on advertisements in the Senate primary battle, a record-breaking amount more than the last three Senate races combined, Politico reported, citing data from AdImpact, a political ad-tracking service. Porter\u2019s campaign was also targeted in the race\u2019s last month by $10m in attack ads from a Super Pac funded by the cryptocurrency industry. The Pac celebrated Porter\u2019s defeat in a statement on Tuesday night. In a speech after the race was called for Schiff, Porter told supporters: \u201cWe had the establishment running scared \u2013 withstanding three-to-one in TV spending and an onslaught of billionaires who spent millions peddling lies and our opponent spending more to boost the Republican than promoting his own campaign.\u201d Schiff struggled to deliver his victory speech as protesters interrupted throughout his remarks, shouting: \u201cCeasefire now!\u201d In a statement after polls closed, Lee quoted her \u201cmentor and friend\u201d Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman in Congress, who said: \u201cYou don\u2019t make progress by standing on the sidelines whimpering and complaining. You make progress by implementing ideas.\u201d She added: \u201cOur campaign has always been about giving a voice to people who don\u2019t feel heard in Washington \u2013 and I\u2019m exceptionally proud of the grassroots, multi-ethnic, cross-generational coalition this campaign built across California.\u201d The California Senate seat became available after Dianne Feinstein, the longest-serving woman in the US Senate, died in September. Laphonza Butler, a Democratic strategist and former labor leader, was appointed her replacement, but did not run for a full term. By November, California will not have a female senator for the first time in 30 years. In early results in California, it was too close to call the outcome for Proposition 1, a mental health funding ballot measure proposed by Governor Gavin Newsom to \u201cprioritise getting people off the streets, out of tents and into treatment\u201d. The measure had a very slight edge as of Wednesday morning, with half the votes still to be counted. Prop 1 is supported by healthcare companies, construction workers and the prison guards union and opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union and disability rights advocates, who argue it would fund locked-door psychiatric institutions and involuntary treatment and take money from community programs. On Wednesday evening, Los Angeles district attorney George Gasc\u00f3n, one of the most prominent progressive prosecutors in the US, advanced to a runoff in his re-election, surviving a primary race that pit him against 11 challengers. Overseeing the largest local prosecutor\u2019s office in the country, Gasc\u00f3n was first elected in 2020 on a platform of reducing mass incarceration and holding police accountable for misconduct and unjust killings. In the years since, he has weathered fierce backlash from police groups and others pushing for a return to more punitive policies. To win the primary outright in California, Gasc\u00f3n needed to get a 50%-plus-one vote. Anything less triggers a runoff race between the top two candidates in November regardless of party. Nathan Hochman, a former GOP attorney general candidate and federal prosecutor, was close behind Gasc\u00f3n in early returns. Many of Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s 11 challengers, including Hochman, have pledged to undo his reform agenda."

            "date": "2024-03-30T21:19:11Z",
            "content": "The Conservatives are on course for their worst election result, winning fewer than 100 seats, according to a new poll. The seat-by-seat analysis gives the Tories 98 constituencies compared with Labour\u2019s 468, giving Sir Keir Starmer a 286-seat majority, the Sunday Times has reported. The 15,000-person poll, conducted by agency Survation on behalf of Best for Britain, gives Labour a 45% vote share with a 19-point lead over the Conservatives. Rishi Sunak\u2019s party is on track to win 98 seats with none in Scotland or Wales, according to the research. It also suggests the prime minister is at risk of losing his own constituency, the new Richmond &amp; Northallerton seat in North Yorkshire, to Labour with his lead less than 2.5 percentage points. The analysis forecasts that Reform UK will come second in seven seats and achieve an overall vote share of 8.5%, just behind the Liberal Democrats on 10.4% The poll also suggests the Scottish National Party would pick up 41 seats, the Liberal Democrats 22 and Plaid Cymru two. Naomi Smith, Best for Britain\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWith the polling showing swathes of voters turning their backs on the Tories, it\u2019s clear that this will be a change election.\u201d In 2019 the Conservatives had 365 seats, Labour 203, the SNP 48, the Lib Dems 11 and Plaid four. The findings come after Labour sources said the party\u2019s overall financial position remained strong despite membership subscriptions falling off because donations were healthy and unions were expected to give very substantial backing to the election effort. Labour has suffered more than a 23,000 fall in membership over the past two months after controversies over its policy on Gaza and its U-turn on green investment, according to figures released to its National Executive Committee (NEC). The party\u2019s general secretary, David Evans, revealed that membership, which had stood at 390,000 in January, had plummeted to 366,604 at the latest count, with more than 11,700 of these being in arrears. Labour membership reached a peak at the end of 2019 when it hit more than 532,000. Luke Akehurst, a member of the NEC, said: \u201cParty membership is still at historically high levels. Labour only had 150,000 members at the end of its last period in office [in 2010],\u201d he said. \u201cThe state of the opinion polls suggest there is no correlation between membership and electoral popularity.\u201d"

            "title": "Senegal heads to the polls overshadowed by deadly protests",
            "date": "2024-03-23T08:00:15Z",
            "content": "Senegal heads to the polls on Sunday after weeks of chaos, violence and uncertainty prompted fears that democracy had been fatally undermined in one of west Africa\u2019s most stable countries. Analysts say the presidential election is the most wide open in Senegal since it secured independence from France more than 60 years ago. Voting day comes only seven weeks after the president, Macky Sall, abruptly cancelled the election, compromising Senegal\u2019s reputation as one of Africa\u2019s model democracies. Faced with protests that have left four people dead and hundreds in jail, Sall was forced to backtrack on what critics believe was an attempt to cling on to power. Experts say the contest is likely to be a straight fight between Amadou Ba, the man Sall has picked as his replacement, and Bassirou Diomaye Faye, a leading opposition candidate who was released from prison only a few days ago. Olayinka Ajala, a senior lecturer in politics and international relations at Leeds Beckett University, believes Ba might shade it, largely because he has the apparatus of the state behind him. \u201cBut really, it\u2019s too close to call,\u201d said Ajala. However, Pat Thaker, the editorial director at Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), believes Faye has the highest chance of winning, mainly because he has been anointed by the charismatic Ousmane Sonko, also just released from jail, but who cannot contest the election after being barred from standing. Sonko and his brand of anti-establishment, anti-corruption politics have cultivated a sizeable following in Senegal, one of the few African countries not to have suffered a coup since securing independence in 1960. However, as the countdown to voting nears, Ba has come out fighting, telling his supporters last week that the \u201cbandits\u201d will not win. Although most expect the election will signal an end to Senegal\u2019s recent violence, some experts have warned of the potential for fresh tensions on Sunday, particularly if Ba prevails. Neither, though, is likely to win in a landslide, with the result anticipated to go to a runoff. The race has been described as \u201cthe most open\u201d of the 12 presidential votes held under universal suffrage since Senegal gained independence from France, said Sidy Diop, the deputy editor of the country\u2019s daily newspaper, Le Soleil. Whoever wins will be tasked with steering Senegal out of its recent troubles along with managing revenues from recently discovered oil and gas reserves. The finding of more than 1bn barrels of oil and 900bn cubic metres of gas has prompted hopes of future riches, a significant prospect in a country where the UN World Food Programme says 39% of people live in poverty. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has bolstered such hopes, predicting 8.8% economic growth this year because of the expected start of oil and gas production \u2013 more than double last year\u2019s figure. Senegal\u2019s massive youth population will play a key role in determining Sall\u2019s successor. According to Unicef, the average age in Senegal is 22 years, demographics that strongly favour Faye and Sonko. The latter\u2019s passionate youth following has been built on his attacks on elites and the former colonial ruler France. Nearly a third of young people in the country are out of work, and many have set their sights on getting to Europe or America to try to improve their prospects. Seven million Senegalese are due to vote on Sunday, with 18 men and one woman on the ballot. Although the only female presidential candidate has little chance of winning, activists say the presence of Anta Babacar Ngom, a 40-year-old business executive, is helping to advance long-running campaigns to achieve gender equality in the country."

It was a fluent and at times bullish performance, notably in the way he offered full-throated support for Rayner, his deputy, and his one-word answer of \u201cyes\u201d when asked whether Labour would fully implement their workers\u2019 rights agenda. In part, this is the inevitable process of a leader growing into the job. But, of course, it does also feel easier when your party is polling about 20 points ahead of your main opponents. Starmer made it plain that even though this was not the campaign launch for a May general election he had hoped for, Labour would treat the local and mayoral polls as a dress rehearsal for the big event. His speech to Labour activists gathered at a technology institute would have needed minimal tweaks to have become a general election stump address, with its rousing-if-woolly cries of \u201cnational renewal\u201d coupled with warnings that the fiscal and political path ahead will be difficult. Up for grabs on 2 May are a total of 10 mayoralties, as well as more than 2,600 English council seats, and police and crime commissioner posts in England and Wales. Much as will be the case in the general election, one of the bigger hurdles that Labour faces is a fairly general assumption they will sweep the board, something that is being met by a vigorous pushback from Starmer\u2019s team. Hundreds of new Labour councillors are largely a given. What will perhaps be more crucial to perceptions of political momentum for Starmer are the mayoral races, notably in London, the West Midlands and Tees Valley. In the former, barring one of the worst collective mishaps in UK polling history, Sadiq Khan will win a third term against the Conservative candidate, Susan Hall. The West Midlands and Tees Valley mayoralties are held by two Conservatives, Andy Street and Ben Houchen respectively, and while Labour repeatedly insists it will be extremely tough to beat either, it is no coincidence that Starmer and Rayner travelled to Street\u2019s patch for their launch event, where they were joined by the Labour candidate, Richard Parker. Local elections are notoriously difficult to predict, and the spectrum of within-possibility outcomes ranges from Street and Houchen being easily returned, with relief for Sunak, to the notion raised by one analyst of the Conservatives losing all 10 mayoral races. This latter outcome is less likely \u2013 Starmer\u2019s team have noisily dismissed it \u2013 but were it to happen, the Conservative sharks would soon be circling again around the prime minister, prompting renewed speculation about a leadership challenge or even a summer election to see that off. Long or short, the election buildup has its obvious perils for Labour, which remains somewhat bruised by its convoluted ditching of the pledge to spend \u00a328bn a year on green investment, finally confirmed in February. But even here, confidence is returning, with Starmer joining Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for energy security and net zero, on a visit earlier this week to Holyhead in north Wales, where the Labour leader talked up plans for floating offshore windfarms as a \u201cgamechanger\u201d for clean energy. The stage is set, and the canvassers will soon start knocking on doors and delivering leaflets. This is not the main event, but that is imminent, and both sides know it all too well."

            "title": "Iran election: turnout sinks to record low as polls close",
            "date": "2024-03-02T00:27:39Z",
            "content": "Polling closed in Iran\u2019s parliamentary elections on Friday night, with officials claiming the nationwide turnout was a record low of 40.6%. After 10 hours of voting, turnout had stood at only 27%, and in Tehran it was just 12% after eight hours, before the polls were unexpectedly kept open for an extra two hours. Officials had predicted the eventual figure would be above the 42.5% recorded the last time parliamentary seats were contested, in 2020, but it fell short of that figure. The total number of participants was 24,861,542, they said, after a late surge in voting made possible by keeping the polls open for longer. The Iranian regime had placed great store in boosting turnout above the 2020 figure, a historic low, since it believes a strong show of political engagement would ward off claims it has run out of legitimacy, or is unable to deliver on the basic requirements of the Iranian people for economic progress and personal freedom. Social media outlets opposed to the regime showed \u2013 albeit inconclusively \u2013 near empty polling stations, but a spokesperson for the Guardian Council, the body that vets candidates, said earlier there were no problems with the election and turnout would reach 2020 levels. The authorities announced they had extended polling hours due to rising numbers going to the polls, but opposition groups said it was a panic measure. Turnout in elections in 2016 was 62%. It is a foregone conclusion that the increasingly factionalised hardliners will tighten their grip on the parliament and on the Assembly of Experts, an 88-strong body charged with appointing the next supreme leader when the incumbent, Ali Khamenei, dies. Many reformists were disqualified from standing, making the election a sham in the eyes of many voters who already believe the country is not run by politicians but by branches of the security services and the army. The reformist movement has been in steady decline for years and was damaged by the previous president, Hassan Rouhani, since they backed him in the elections even though he was not a reformist. He proved unable to deliver change during his two four-year terms, one of which was marred by the Covid outbreak that claimed thousands of Iranian lives. As many as 10 million people are eligible to vote in Tehran province, and turnout is likely to be lowest there. Balochistan province has been hit by floods and is also likely to have a low turnout. Rouhani has been succeeded as president by Ebrahim Raisi, a hardliner and former judge close to the supreme leader who has edged the country towards a more pro-Russian and anti-western stance. Internal phone surveys conducted 24 hours before the poll showed three-quarters of the population did not intend to vote and only 16% were definitely planning to do so. Three-quarters of those surveyed said they would not be voting due to opposition to the Islamic Republic or to the lack of free and fair elections. A challenge for the regime in the days ahead will surround whether to publish accurate turnout results if they show only about a third of the country voted, and two-thirds rejected the regime by staying at home. Concern was aired on social media that invalid votes would be counted as part of the turnout. Official government news agencies started to delete previously published turnout figures for specific provinces as the figures failed to climb through the day. In an attempt to quell the boycott movement, police officers in West Azerbaijan province announced the identification and arrest of 50 \u201cvirtual page operators\u201d that had acted \u201cto disturb the public\u2019s mind and call for non-participation in the elections\u201d. In a sign of the continuing oppression that leaves millions of voters alienated, the regime used election day to announce an Iranian court had sentenced the Grammy winner Shervin Hajipour to nearly four years in prison. His song Baraye became an anthem of the \u201cwomen, life, freedom\u201d protests in 2022, with versions played at concerts by Coldplay. He has also been ordered to write music critical of the US. Hajipour has been handed eight months in prison for \u201cpropaganda against the establishment\u201d and three years for \u201cencouraging and provoking the public to riot to disrupt national security\u201d. Hajipour will serve only the longer of the two prison sentences. \u2022 This article was amended on 1 March 2024. A previous version incorrectly described Hassan Rouhani and Ebrahim Raisi as, respectively, the former and current prime ministers of Iran."

            "date": "2024-03-15T15:02:21Z",
            "content": "Voters in Russia headed to the polls across the country\u2019s 11 time zones on Friday in a three-day presidential election that is all but certain to extend Vladimir Putin\u2019s 24-year rule until at least 2030. The longtime Russian leader is facing no meaningful opposition after the Russian authorities barred two candidates who had voiced their opposition to the war in Ukraine from running. Three other politicians running in the election do not directly question Putin\u2019s authority and their participation is meant to add a facade of legitimacy to the race. The first presidential election since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began not without incident. Local authorities in at least five regions, including Russian-annexed Crimea, reported cases involving voters spilling green antiseptic dye into ballot boxes and incidents of arson at polling stations. Russia\u2019s electoral commission reported that it had faced more than 10,500 cyber-attacks, and a key government website used for online voting was unavailable in some Russian regions for much of the day. In angry comments on Friday, Putin lashed out at Kyiv for an ongoing raid along the Russian border that he called an attempt to \u201cdisrupt the voting process [and] intimidate people in at least those areas which border Ukraine\u201d. The start of the voting came hours after one of the deadliest Russian strikes yet on the Ukrainian port city of Odesa, which killed at least 20 people when two rockets fired from Crimea struck a residential area. The Kremlin wants to show that it can successfully stage elections despite the war. Putin has won previous elections by a landslide but independent election watchdogs say they were marred by widespread fraud. Before these elections, the state-backed Vtsiom polling agency predicted Russians would give Putin 82% of the vote, his highest ever return, on a turnout of 71%. By Friday afternoon, Russia\u2019s electoral commission said turnout had already exceed 25%, including more than 2.6m ballots cast online. Putin was among those who voted online on Friday, the Kremlin said. Russia\u2019s best-known opposition politician, Alexei Navalny, died suddenly in an Arctic penal colony last month and other prominent Kremlin critics are exiled or in jail. Navalny\u2019s widow, Yulia, who has blamed Putin for her husband\u2019s death, urged her supporters to protest against Putin, 71, by voting en masse at noon local time on Sunday, forming large crowds and overwhelming polling stations. The polling protest has been labelled \u201cNoon Against Putin\u201d and the plan was endorsed by Navalny before he died. Navalny\u2019s team suggested spoiling the ballot paper, writing \u201cAlexei Navalny\u201d across the voting slip, or voting for one of the three candidates standing against Putin. Russian prosecutors on Thursday threatened any voters who take part in the Noon Against Putin action with five years in prison, though it remains unclear how authorities plan to crack down on the protest given that they would have no legal grounds to disperse participants. A number of Russians took more direct action to undermine the vote. In several incidents caught on video on Friday, Russians walked up to urns carrying ballots and poured in a green antiseptic dye before being detained by police. In Kogalym, western Siberia, a woman set a small fire inside a polling station. Video showed the fire creeping toward a ballot box before a poll worker leapt over the fire to intervene. Another video showed a voting booth in flames at a polling station in Moscow. Ella Pamfilova, Russia\u2019s longtime election commissioner, said those who spoiled the ballots were \u201cbastards\u201d and called for their arrests. Investigators in the southern Rostov region announced the detention of a 62-year-old man on charges of obstruction of voting rights, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Footage from St Petersburg showed a woman throwing a molotov cocktail at a polling station. According to the Fontanka news outlet, the woman was arrested and could be tried on terrorism charges. To bolster turnout, the Kremlin has rolled out a series of new tools to help its \u201cget out the vote\u201d campaign, including a three-day voting period and electronic voting in 29 regions including Moscow. These are on top of familiar efforts by the heads of state-run enterprises to entice or force thousands of workers to the polls. In the Siberian city of Omsk, young voters were given a free ticket for a ferris wheel ride at a local amusement park, the Moscow Times reported. Elsewhere, Russian voters were offered the chance to win iPhones and hairstyling devices produced by the British household appliance firm Dyson for sending in polling station selfies. And at a polling station in the oil-rich city of Tyumen, voters could get a picture with a cardboard cutout of the conservative Kremlin-friendly US presenter Tucker Carlson, who travelled to Russia last month to interview Putin. Under constitutional reforms he orchestrated in 2020, Putin is eligible to seek two more six-year terms after his term expires next year, potentially allowing him to remain in power until 2036. If he remains in power until then, his tenure will surpass even that of Joseph Stalin, who ruled the Soviet Union for 29 years, making Putin the country\u2019s longest-serving leader since the Russian empire. Earlier this week Moscow opened polling stations in the four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine that it annexed in September 2022. The Ukrainian foreign ministry described the voting held in the four territories as illegal. Before the elections, three pro-Ukrainian battalions made up of recruits from Russia launched a series of incursions into southern Russia, while Ukraine has stepped up drone strikes on oil refineries deep inside Russia in an effort to damage the country\u2019s economy."

            "content": "A first-of-its-kind training exercise involving more than 20,000 soldiers from 13 countries has launched across northern Norway, Sweden and Finland as the region prepares to become a fully Nato territory within days. The joint defence exercise, which runs until 14 March, was previously known as Cold Response and held in northern Norway, a founding Nato member, every other year. In recognition of Finland\u2019s recent membership of the western military alliance, and with Sweden expected to join imminently, this year it is being designated Nordic Response for the first time. The training exercise across air, land and sea \u2013 which will also include soldiers from the UK, US, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Canada \u2013 will incorporate a cross-border operations exercise in the Arctic Circle. The Norwegian military said the exercise was intended to demonstrate \u201ca unique level of cooperation and interoperability as they cross borders on land, sea and air\u201d. Nordic Response is part of an ongoing series of Nato exercises, Steadfast Defender, involving 90,000 soldiers. It is also closely aligned with the UK-led naval exercise Joint Warrior, which ran between Scotland, Norway and Iceland last week. The latest exercise, which started on Sunday, will involve more than 50 submarines, frigates, corvettes, aircraft carriers and amphibious vessels at sea, over 100 combat, maritime surveillance and transport aircraft, and thousands of soldiers on the ground using artillery systems, tanks and tracked vehicles. Most of the activity will be centred on northern Troms county and the west of Finnmark county in Norway, but there will also be maritime activity along the coast of the north of the country and exercises across borders in northern Finland and Sweden. The newly elected Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, the Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re, and the Swedish crown princess Victoria are all scheduled to visit. The Swedish government is anxiously awaiting the final signoff from Hungary to finally complete its Nato membership. It had been hoped the process could have been finished off last week, but having only been signed by the speaker of Hungary\u2019s parliament on Sunday it still needs to be signed by the president before the documentation can go to Washington. Last Monday, Hungary\u2019s parliament approved the historically neutral country\u2019s membership, nearly two years after it submitted its application. Finland became a member in April last year. The Norwegian military said Nordic Response was aimed at strengthening Nordic cooperation and in turn bolstering the alliance\u2019s ability to defend the region. All relevant countries, including Russia, had been informed of the exercise, it said. \u201cWith Finland and soon Sweden as allied neighbours, the exercise contributes to closer Nordic integration within the framework of Nato,\u201d the Norwegian military said in a statement. \u201cThe exercise also strengthens operational total defence cooperation in the Nordic countries, which results in better cooperation in peace, crisis and conflict. Closer operational cooperation in the Nordic region strengthens Nato\u2019s ability to defend the Nordic region.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-30T00:00:27Z",
            "content": "Schools in England are closing down legitimate debate about the Israel-Gaza conflict because teachers feel ill-equipped and are concerned about political impartiality, the government\u2019s independent adviser on social cohesion has said. Dame Sara Khan said that if schools continued to shut down debate they risked \u201cfuelling further anger, hate and polarisation\u201d. She said the conflict, which has prompted huge demonstrations by hundreds of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters across London and elsewhere, has had a marked impact on schools, where pupils want to talk about events in Gaza. Days after the publication of her review into threats to social cohesion, Khan repeated her assertion that teachers were avoiding addressing controversial issues because of fears of being targeted by campaigns of intimidation and harassment. She also said teachers felt there was too little guidance on teaching controversial issues in personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) lessons and were worried about a lack of support from the Department for Education (DfE) when difficulties arose. Her review \u2013 which highlights the case of a religious studies teacher at Batley grammar school in West Yorkshire who was forced into hiding after accusations of blasphemy \u2013 recommends a cohesion and conflict unit be set up to support teachers who find themselves being threatened. The unit would also provide training resources to support schools on controversial topics. The war in Gaza has caused a number of incidents in schools. In one case, Barclay primary school in Leyton, east London, sought help from the Metropolitan police to investigate threats to the school and abuse of staff after its decision to ban political symbols, including the Palestinian flag. Although many teachers are reluctant to speak out, one secondary school teacher, who did not want to be named, told the Guardian their school was one of the few that had agreed to hold assemblies on the issue and offer a weekly safe space for discussion about the conflict. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky. Generally, management are terrified and teachers are terrified to discuss it. The biggest problem is the kind of silence around it in the vast majority of schools,\u201d they said. Another teacher in an inner-city school, who also wished to remain anonymous, said it was a \u201cmassive failing\u201d on the part of schools. \u201cFrom the word go, we were told this was a political issue and we can\u2019t discuss it. If we\u2019re not talking about it, it does not mean that the kids are not interested. They know what\u2019s going on. They are going online where there\u2019s no control over what they are seeing.\u201d Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, agreed members were nervous about having discussions around such difficult subjects in class. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sensitive issue. As a union we\u2019ve been very clear we absolutely condemned the attack by Hamas and the taking of hostages, but what\u2019s unfolded since is a real humanitarian disaster and young people want to talk about it. \u201cSchools are the best place for young people to talk about difficult subjects but I think there is a nervousness among the profession.\u201d The NEU has been criticised over a motion to be discussed at its annual conference which expresses support for the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign (PSC) and brands Israel\u2019s government \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cguilty of apartheid policies\u201d. The motion, to be debated by delegates at the gathering in Bournemouth next week, calls on the executive to \u201cpublish and circulate educational resources that members can use to increase understanding of Palestine and Israel\u201d. It also says Israel\u2019s government is the main driver of the conflict and calls on the UK government to stop \u201cbeing an enabler of Israel\u2019s apartheid policies\u201d, while an amendment says all attempts to clamp down on the right to protest and discuss the issue must be opposed. Khan said: \u201cThere is no doubt that the conflict has had a direct impact on schools. There is a desire among some pupils to talk about what is happening in Israel-Palestine yet many teachers feel ill-equipped to talk about the conflict while also being conscious that they are expected to uphold their legal duty to remain impartial. \u201cIn the absence of resources to facilitate such discussions in an educational setting \u2013 which are needed especially when a great deal of propaganda and disinformation exists online \u2013 some schools are closing down any legitimate dialogue which can have a potential effect of further fuelling anger, hate and polarisation.\u201d A Newham council spokesperson said: \u201cOur approach as a council is to provide listening spaces for school leaders to discuss the significant impact this has had on their children, families and teams. Colleagues from within our teams meet regularly with colleagues from across the council, and community partners, to continue to assess the impact this is having on our communities \u2013 including schools.\u201d Glenn Bezalel, the deputy head (academic) at the City of London school, who wrote a book called Teaching Classroom Controversies to help schools navigate complex teaching issues in the age of fake news and alternative facts, said: \u201cTeachers are very fearful in this censorious climate, and one in which cancel culture is something they are particularly concerned about, where if I have a discussion in the classroom, who knows if that evening I\u2019m going to be all over X. \u201cMy sense is that most teachers would say: \u2018I\u2019ve got a curriculum to teach, I\u2019ve got exams coming up. Let\u2019s just leave it. It\u2019s not worth the hassle.\u2019 But there are good reasons why schools should be the right place to be teaching these kinds of things. If we\u2019re not doing it in schools, where else are our pupils going to get their information from. God help us if it\u2019s social media.\u201d Bezalel also said it was a vital part of helping students develop their own critical thinking, and learn the importance of kindness and respect in discussions about controversial issues. \u201cThe classroom is the best place to model this.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cTeaching children a range of viewpoints is vital, but we have been clear this must be done in line with our impartiality guidance. We know navigating these issues can be challenging, which is why we provide teachers with extensive advice and resources through our Educate Against Hate website. This includes practical advice on promoting cohesion and challenging radical views, as well as providing quality-assured materials for use in the classroom.\u201d"

It acquired the Fractl:2 system, which its Australian developers say has the precision to shoot down a drone travelling at 100km/h and can be operated remotely. Drones have become an increasing threat in modern warfare and have been widely deployed in the Ukraine conflict, as well as being used by Houthi rebels to attack international shipping in the Red Sea.

The laser system, which has been developed by Melbourne-based AIM Defence, replaces the need for ammunition. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Australian government paid $4.9m for the prototype from AIM Defence, which says it has performed more than 200 drone defeats both indoors and outdoors. According to sources, AIM Defence is investing in expanding manufacturing facilities in Melbourne. The prototype technology is expected to be \u201cin the hands\u201d of ADF operators by mid-2024. The company, co-founded by the laser scientist Jae Daniel and the technology entrepreneur Jessica Glenn, was this year selected to take part in an international counter-drone exercise by the Canadian defence department.

Sean O\u2019Byrne, a professor of aerospace engineering at the Australian National University, said he was not aware of any similar technology being deployed to date, though there were a number of companies worldwide that were interested in the space. While O\u2019Byrne has not yet seen AIM Defence\u2019s technology, he said that as far as the sector went, direct energy is a \u201chorizon technology\u201d in the sense that it was quite new in terms of deployment. \u201cIt\u2019s an old technology in terms of the idea, but the systems have not been powerful enough and there are various technical challenges in adaptive optics to focus on a moving target,\u201d he said. \u201cThe target might be moving up, down, left, right, towards you or away from you. \u201cYou have to have an optical system that can focus and there are challenges technologically with that and also challenges with delivering enough power to the spot of focus very fast. Building a portable platform that can do all of those things is challenging.\u201d Guardian Australia is awaiting comment from the Australian defence force."

            "date": "2024-03-22T12:59:43Z",
            "content": "The UK environment secretary, Steve Barclay, has come under scrutiny for failing to declare a potential conflict of interest over a proposed waste incineration plant in his constituency. Barclay has been a vocal opponent of the waste-to-energy plant in Wisbech, which is due to be one of Europe\u2019s biggest such incinerators. The most recent register of ministers\u2019 interests shows Barclay has not declared the plant project in Cambridgeshire as a potential conflict of interest, even though it must be approved by the Environment Agency, which he oversees. The BBC reported on Thursday night that officials at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs had raised concerns over the potential conflict of interest, even raising it with the ethics team at the Cabinet Office. The department now says Barclay has recused himself over the approval decision, but Labour has raised questions over whether he has communicated with officials at the Environment Agency about it. Steve Reed, the shadow environment secretary, said on Friday: \u201cIt is shocking that the secretary of state may have abused his position as environment secretary to prop up his constituency vote. The public rightly expect ministers to serve the British people, and not themselves. The environment secretary needs to immediately address these concerns.\u201d A spokesperson for the environment department said: \u201cThe secretary of state is recused from the decision. No decision has been taken. Mark Spencer is the minister responsible and would take any decision on this issue.\u201d The German energy company MVV Environment is planning to build the incinerator as a way to turn non-recyclable waste into energy. The plant would be able to burn more than 600,000 tonnes of waste a year and generate up to 50MW of power. Barclay has long been an opponent of the plan, calling it \u201cterrible news for our area\u201d. Despite his opposition, his cabinet colleague Claire Coutinho approved the scheme last month in her role as energy secretary. But it must also get the go-ahead from the Environment Agency. Following Coutinho\u2019s decision, Barclay said: \u201cAs both a member of parliament and a resident living just outside Wisbech I remain strongly opposed to this proposal and will continue to do everything possible to fight it.\u201d The BBC reported that officials at the environment department had written to the government\u2019s propriety and ethics unit over the issue, and that officials from that unit had discussed the matter with Barclay. Reed wrote to Barclay on Friday morning asking for details of any communication between the environment secretary and his officials about the scheme, as well as demanding to know when he had recused himself from the overall decision. No 10 on Friday refused to say when Barclay had recused himself. A spokesperson for the prime minister said: \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon that ministers to balance their work as a constituency MP with their roles of ministers and there are established processes which support that.\u201d They added: \u201cWe never provide a running commentary on those processes.\u201d"

            "content": "Germany\u2019s defence minister has said that one of the generals on a military conference call on Ukraine that was intercepted by Russia may have broken security protocol by using a non-secure line to dial in. Boris Pistorius said the 38-minute phone call held over the platform WebEx that was subsequently leaked by Kremlin-controlled TV, had not been intercepted by an individual Russian spy but was most likely the result of a random sweep of insecure data on the sidelines of the Singapore airshow. One of the participants dialled in from his hotel room, and either his mobile phone or an insecure connection in his hotel provided the vulnerability, Pistorius said. Speaking to journalists in Berlin on Tuesday morning, Pistorius said that disciplinary measures were being looked into, as the participant had contravened rigid security guidelines by not using a secure, authorised connection. He said Germany was taking technical and organisational steps to ensure a similar incident was not repeated. Amid widespread criticism towards Germany as well as sheer embarrassment over the call in which information about military tactics of Germany and its European and US allies were revealed \u2013 including that Britain and the UK had \u201ctroops on the ground\u201d \u2013 Pistorius said he had spoken to many of his counterparts on Monday, and they had expressed \u201cno sense of annoyance towards Germany\u201d, and \u201creassured me that trust in Germany is uninterrupted\u201d. He said there had been unanimity among Germany\u2019s partners, that \u201cwe won\u2019t let ourselves be divided by this Russian attack\u201d.

Pistorius called the interception part of a \u201cperfidious game\u201d Russia was playing against western allies, accusing it of trying to \u201cdrive a wedge\u201d between European and US allies, and added: \u201c[We] will not allow Putin to get on our nerves.\u201d He refused to discuss the contents of the phone call, insisting that to do so would be \u201cletting Putin set the agenda\u201d. Led by Lt Gen Ingo Gerhartz, the head of the German air force, or Luftwaffe, the meeting, which took place a fortnight ago, was in preparation for a briefing with Pistorius. It focused on Taurus missiles, and touched on the refusal by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to donate the weapons to Ukraine, over his fears that their 500km range meant they could be used to target Russia, thus making Germany a party to the war. As part of the conversation, the participants discussed how Britain was working closely with Ukraine in deploying Storm Shadow missiles, and suggested Britain had troops in Ukraine. At the meeting, a transcript of which has been seen by the Guardian, the German officers concluded that use of the missiles in the near future would only be viable if German soldiers were involved on Ukrainian territory. The alternative, to train Ukrainian soldiers, in order to avoid putting German soldiers on Ukrainian terrain, was a possibility but would take months of preparation, they said. They also discussed potential targets the Taurus could reach, including the strategically-vital Kerch Bridge, connecting mainland Russia and Russian-occupied Crimea. Russia has interpreted the conversation as a direct German plan to attack Russia, saying the intentions indicate the will for a full-blown war. Pistorius insisted that the communication system of Germany\u2019s defence ministry had \u201cnot been compromised\u201d. Amid criticism that WebEx is unsafe, he said that for certain conversations up to a specific level of security the platform was used, but not the version open to the public, rather one with an additional level of security, using Bundeswehr-controlled servers, and not foreign ones. Pistorius said events like the Singapore airshow, which attracted high-ranking military personnel from across Europe, were notorious for attracting espionage and seen as the equivalent of a \u201claid out banquet\u201d for Russian intelligence services. According to his information, the two-day event had been riddled with \u201cextensive espionage operations\u201d carried out by Russian intelligence. He said the German WebEx conference had been a \u201clucky hit\u201d by spies working \u201cwithin the framework of a comprehensive strategy\u201d. IT experts were in the process of forensically investigating the equipment used by the participants, Pistorius said, and the process of disciplinary action was being looked into. However, he resisted calls to sack anyone involved. As long as \u201cno serious\u201d conclusions came out of the investigation, he said he would \u201cnot let any of my best officers become the victims of Putin\u2019s games\u201d."

            "content": "Lawyers for Mike Lynch tried to highlight differences between UK and US accounting standards as they defended the British businessman against allegations he orchestrated a \u201cmassive\u201d years-long fraud. Lynch, who founded and led Autonomy, a UK software firm, is fighting to avoid prison after federal prosecutors in the US charged him with 16 counts of wire fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy. His criminal trial started in San Francisco on Monday. Autonomy was bought by Hewlett-Packard in an $11.1bn (\u00a38.72bn) takeover in 2011, which quickly unraveled after HP wrote down the value of its purchase by $8.8bn and alleged \u201cserious accounting improprieties\u201d and misrepresentations at Autonomy. Lynch, who was indicted by a federal grand jury in November 2018 and extradited to the US in May 2023, has pleaded not guilty. As the US government started building its case against Lynch this week, it summoned Ganesh Vaidyanathan, a former accounting director at Autonomy in the US, as its first witness. Questioned by prosecutors, Vaidyanathan testified about potential accounting issues he first raised inside the company in 2010. He said he had seen a disconnect between what Autonomy told investors about its business, and the reality. During cross-examination, Brian Heberlig, an attorney for Lynch, noted that Interwoven, where Vaidyanathan had previously worked, was a San Jose, California-based company which \u2013 in line with the US norm \u2013 had used financial reporting standards known as generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. In 2009, Interwoven, a US company, was acquired by Autonomy, a UK firm listed on the London stock market. Vaidyanathan stayed on to work at Autonomy, which used different accounting standards known as international financial reporting standards, or IFRS. Heberlig, Lynch\u2019s attorney, suggested that Vaidyanathan \u2013 who had raised concerns about issues he identified within Autonomy \u2013 was not as familiar with IFRS, the financial reporting framework it used, as he was with GAAP. The government has claimed that Autonomy used so-called \u201cround trip\u201d arrangements with customers, whereby it paid them money effectively so they could pay it money back, to inflate its revenues. Using a hypothetical example of a firm paying a customer $110 so that it paid $100 back, on Monday the assistant US attorney Adam Reeves said: \u201cAdd a few zeroes, and that is what Autonomy was doing.\u201d Heberlig questioned Vaidyanathan about the specific IFRS principles that determined whether two deals between companies were sufficiently linked. \u201cYou yourself are not familiar with what those standards are,\u201d said Heberlig. \u201cNo,\u201d replied Vaidyanathan. The government later called another witness, the former Autonomy finance worker Reena Prasad. Questioning of Vaidyanathan is due to resume on Wednesday."

            "content": "Hunt\u2019s opening remarks Jeremy Hunt says the UK economy has dealt with the financial crisis, the pandemic and energy crisis caused by war in Europe. He acknowledges that interest rates \u201cremain high as we bring down inflation\u201d, but adds: \u201cWe can now help families not just with cost of living support but with permanent cuts in taxation.\u201d He calls it a \u201cbudget for long term growth\u201d. Peter Walker, deputy political editor: Anyone who had forgotten this is an election year will have been reminded after Hunt launched into an overtly political opening section, which criticised Labour\u2019s supposed spending plans before he set out even one of his own. National insurance Hunt confirms that the national insurance contribution rate will be cut from 10% to 8% of pay from April. This comes on top of a 2p cut in the autumn statement in November, which reduced the rate from 12% to 10%. It is estimated that the 2p cut to national insurance would be worth about \u00a3450 a year for someone on a \u00a335,000 full-time salary. PW: This is the worst-kept fiscal secret in Westminster, as briefed and reported more or less everywhere. It will be popular with Tory MPs \u2013 but the same ruse was tried in the autumn statement, and did not shift the polls at all. Hunt says the \u201clong-term ambition\u201d is to cut it further when possible. Growth Hunt says the economy is expected to grow by 0.8% this year and 1.9% in 2025. That is slightly stronger than the 0.7% and 1.4% growth rate expected by the Office for Budget Responsibility at the time of the autumn statement in November. Growth is then forecast to be 2% in 2026 before dipping to 1.8% and 1.7% in 2027 and 2028. PW: For all that successive fiscal statements have been billed as a \u201cbudget for growth\u201d, even these forecasts are fairly anaemic, and unlikely to instil new hope in Tory MPs facing electoral defeat. This is the big, and perhaps insurmountable, challenge the government faces. Inflation Inflation is expected to fall below the government\u2019s 2% target in \u201cjust a few months\u2019 time\u201d, Hunt says, down from 4% in January. \u201cNearly a whole year earlier than forecast in the autumn statement,\u201d he adds. The Bank of England\u2019s long-term target is to keep inflation at a \u201clow and stable\u201d 2%. The figure is down sharply from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022, as food and energy prices have eased. PW: Inflation is something of a rare political safe zone for Hunt and Sunak, given it looks like the only one of the PM\u2019s five pledges to be met. Falling inflation is also something that you don\u2019t need a focus group to realise it will be welcomed by voters, whoever gets the credit. Government borrowing Hunt says underlying debt, which excludes Bank of England debt, will be 91.7% of GDP in 2024-25 according to the OBR, then 92.8%, 93.2%, 93.2% before falling to 92.9% in 2028-29. \u201cWe continue to have the second lowest level of government debt in the G7, lower than Japan, France or the US,\u201d he adds. Hunt says borrowing falls from 4.2% of GDP in 2023-24, to 3.1%, 2.7%, 2.3%, 1.6% and 1.2% in 2028-29. \u201cBy the end of the forecast, borrowing is at its lowest level of GDP since 2001,\u201d he adds. PW: Election looming, anyone? Hunt\u2019s section on borrowing and debt is launched with an attack not just on Labour but also the Liberal Democrats. It is not a coincidence that Hunt faces a very strong Lib Dem challenge to keep his Surrey constituency. Public services The chancellor has kept a 1% increase in day-to-day public spending above inflation, despite speculation it would be cut to just 0.75%. Military spending will rise to 2.5% of GDP \u201cas soon as economic conditions allow\u201d, Hunt says. It is now at 2% of GDP. PW: In talking about public services, Hunt faces the problem experienced by Rishi Sunak at every prime minister\u2019s questions \u2013 he has to argue they are performing well, when more or less every voter in the UK disagrees. Arguing that the solution is not about money but \u201ca more productive state\u201d might cheer some Tory MPs and thinktanks, but is always easier to say than deliver. NHS Hunt announces a \u201clandmark public sector productivity plan\u201d will be published today, including cutting form filling by doctors using AI, digitising hospital processes and improving the NHS app. He adds: \u201cWe need a more productive state, not a bigger state.\u201d \u201cI want this groundbreaking agreement with the NHS to be a model for all our public services\u201d including education, the police, courts and public government, Hunt says. In the next spending review, the Treasury will prioritise applications for money from departments that show potential savings for the public purse in the long term. PW: The idea of a \u201cpaperless\u201d NHS is also by no means new, although it seems Hunt is pledging some extra money to make it more efficient. Child benefit Hunt announces a consultation on child benefit rules, to apply it to collective household incomes rather than for individuals from April 2026. He says the threshold will be for a high income tax charge on the benefit will be raised from \u00a350,000 to \u00a360,000. The top of a taper to withdraw the benefit will be raised to \u00a380,000 from \u00a360,000 at the moment. The household support fund, introduced by the government in 2021 to help families struggling with the cost of living, has been extended by six months. PW: This is another tweak that will help higher earners, but Hunt will know from fellow Tory MPs \u2013 and probably from some constituents \u2013 that the thresholds for child benefit, which used to be universal, can cause some angst, as well as confusion. Childcare Hunt says rates paid to nurseries to fund free childcare hours for parents of children aged more than nine months will continue for the next two years. The payments have become worth less to nurseries in recent years as inflation has risen sharply, cutting into childcare providers\u2019 budgets. Hunt says the move will allow an extra 60,000 parents enter the workforce in the next four years. PW: The seemingly serious wobbles faced by the government\u2019s 30-hour free childcare offer for younger children has unsettled quite a few Tory MPs, who fear it will cause chaos if it doesn\u2019t work. Hunt promises more support \u2013 but is vague as to what, and how much. Non-dom tax status The chancellor confirms non-dom tax status will be \u201cabolished\u201d and replaced by a \u201cmodern, simpler and fairer\u201d system from April 2025. The status is enjoyed by people who live in the UK but who have certain overseas links \u2013 often determined by whether their father was born abroad. The status means they pay UK tax on money earned here, but not on their worldwide income. After four years, those coming to the UK will pay the same tax as other UK residents. PW: This was billed in advance, but is still politically extraordinary. Downing Street has either defended non-domiciled tax status \u2013 as enjoyed by Sunak\u2019s wife \u2013 or tried to not talk about it. Now it is being abolished, if replaced with a new system that still gives some benefits. The key aim here is to spike Labour\u2019s guns \u2013 this was one of Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves\u2019s few outlined fiscal plans. Did I mention an election was coming? Property tax Hunt says the government will reduce the higher rate of property capital gains tax from 28% to 24%. He also announces the abolition of stamp duty relief for those buying more than one dwelling. PW: For all Hunt\u2019s insistence this will bring in more overall revenue, reducing a tax aimed at higher-rate earners can be very easily painted by Labour as a break for richer people \u2013 and richer second-home owners. Holiday lets Hunt confirms plans to scrap the furnished holiday lets regime. The initiative gives tax reliefs on properties being rented out to holidaymakers and make renting out to holidaymakers more profitable than to long-term tenants. The move is expected to raise \u00a3300m a year for the Treasury. PW: Another relatively minor tax change which taps into what appears to be genuine public sentiment \u2013 in this case, worries about how the rapid growth of the Airbnb economy risks hollowing out some holiday-dominated communities. Vaping tax Hunt confirms widely expected plans for a \u201cvaping products levy\u201d to be paid on imports by manufacturers, specifically on the liquid in vapes. It will be introduced in October 2026. The move is an attempt to discourage children from buying the products. It is expected to raise \u00a3500m by 2028/29. A one-off increase in tobacco duty is also announced. Alcohol and fuel duty Alcohol duty was due to rise by 3% from August but Hunt said it will be frozen until February 2025, benefiting 38,000 pubs across the UK. The government is \u201cbacking the great British pub\u201d, Hunt says. Hunt said he would freeze fuel duty at its current level for another year, as expected. The levy should rise in line with inflation but this has not happened since 2011. A 5p cut to fuel duty, which was introduced in 2022 and is due to run out this month, has been extended. PW: An increasingly common aspect of recent budgets has been chancellors extending supposedly \u201ctemporary\u201d freezes, allowing them to repeat the same good news at every budget or statement. Hence alcohol and fuel duties are not changed. The latter is announced with slightly half-hearted \u201cplan for drivers\u201d rhetoric by the chancellor, plus the now-mandatory shout-out for the Sun. Savings Hunt announces a new \u201cBritish Isa\u201d, giving investors a \u00a35,000 extra tax-free allowance to \u201cencourage more people to invest in UK assets\u201d. Hunt says a new British Savings Bond will launched in April, delivered by the state-owned National Savings and Investments. It will offer a guaranteed rate, fixed for three years. PW: One of the many elements of this budget briefed in advance, this will be welcomed, but thus far is another fairly minor tweak, politically speaking. Windfall tax and energy Hunt extends the windfall tax on the profits of North Sea oil and gas companies by a year, raising an expected \u00a31.5bn. It was introduced in May 2022 after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring, feeding through to producers\u2019 profits. It was due to end in March 2028, but will now conclude in 2029. The chancellor confirms the government will spend \u00a3160m on two nuclear sites. The first, on the island of Anglesey or Ynys M\u00f4n, is the Wylfa facility in north Wales. It is owned by Japan\u2019s Hitachi. The government hopes to find a partner to develop a nuclear power station there. The Oldbury site in South Gloucestershire is also part of the agreement. He allocates \u00a3120m for green industries to develop technologies including offshore windfarms and carbon capture and storage projects. PW: What Hunt describes as \u201cclean energy\u201d is focused on nuclear, which some might quibble with. But with the Conservatives badly split on where \u2013 or if \u2013 to build onshore wind and solar farms, nuclear is about as safe as it gets, politically. The arts The government will spend \u00a326.4m on the National Theatre to upgrade its stages. Independent films with a budget of less than \u00a315m will receive a new tax credit. The Treasury will also provide eligible film studios in England with 40% relief on their gross business rates until 2034. PW: Such announcements are, in fiscal terms, small change down the back of the sofa, but do resonate. Plus, as Hunt noted, the creative industries are disproportionately important to the UK economy. This section also allowed the chancellor to make a lightly limp joke about Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, \u201cwho seems to fancy her thespian skills when it comes to acting like a Tory\u201d. Other measures The household support fund, introduced by the government in 2021 to help families struggling with the cost of living, has been extended by six months. Hunt says he plans to allow full expensing to apply to leased assets. Full expensing allows businesses to offset investment in items such as new factory machinery and IT equipment against tax. He adds that the VAT registration threshold will be increased from \u00a385,000 to \u00a390,000 from the start of April, saying it would help \u201ctens of thousands of businesses\u201d. He confirms that the government plans to sell a chunk of shares in NatWest bank in the summer. The bank was bailed out during the financial crisis to the tune of \u00a345.5bn to help save the UK\u2019s financial system from collapse. The state\u2019s remaining one-third share in the bank is now worth about \u00a37bn. \u201cI want to create opportunities for a new generation of retail investors to engage with public markets,\u201d Hunt says. Hunt announces that AstraZeneca \u2013 the pharmaceutical company behind the Covid vaccine developed by Oxford University \u2013 plans to invest \u00a3650m in the UK to expand its footprint on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus and fund the building of a vaccine manufacturing hub in Speke in Liverpool. The chancellor makes a one-off adjustment air passenger duty (APD) on non-economy flights. APD on premium economy and business class flights will be hiked by more than 10% next year. It will add \u00a366 in tax to a London-New York flight in business class, up to \u00a3647, from April 2025. APD on a premium economy seat will rise \u00a322 to \u00a3216 on a transatlantic flight, or from \u00a326 to \u00a328 on a short-haul flight. PW: It is notable that Hunt announces both a tax break for smaller businesses, and efforts to address what he calls \u201chistoric underinvestment\u201d \u2013 a concession that many voters believe the UK\u2019s infrastructure is somewhat crumbling. There is even a slightly retro shout-out for \u201clevelling up\u201d."

            "title": "What to expect from Jeremy Hunt\u2019s spring budget",
            "date": "2024-03-06T05:00:11Z",
            "content": "Jeremy Hunt is due to set out the government\u2019s plans for tax and spending in his budget on Wednesday. In what is expected to be the last budget before a general election, the chancellor\u2019s biggest giveaway is likely to be a further cut to the national insurance contributions paid by employees, after a 2p reduction in his autumn statement. Meanwhile, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will publish updated economic forecasts and an assessment of the government\u2019s finances for the next five years \u2013 running beyond the next election to 2029. Here is what to expect. Personal tax cuts The personal allowance \u2013 the amount people can earn before starting to pay tax \u2013 and the thresholds for the higher and additional rates \u2013 are to be frozen again. This means that as wages increase, more people will be pushed into higher-rate tax bands. This trend is forecast to increase the overall tax rate above 37% of GDP by 2028 \u2013 the highest in modern times, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank. However, Hunt is expected to spend \u00a310bn on a headline tax cut \u2013 reducing the national insurance contribution rate by 2p, from 10% to 8% of pay. This comes on top of a 2p cut in the autumn statement, which reduced the rate from 12% to 10%. The cut will reportedly take effect from April this year. Fuel duty Fuel duty has not risen for 15 years and it is widely expected that the chancellor will freeze it again. He is also expected to extend the 5p cut to fuel duty, which was introduced in 2022 and is due to run out this month. Combined, the measures will cost an estimated \u00a35bn. Tax rises With economic growth flatlining, there is not much spare cash to fund Hunt\u2019s budget giveaways. The money for personal tax cuts will need to be raised through tax rises in other areas and further cuts to public services. There is speculation that the tax reliefs for UK residents who claim non-dom status will be reduced, with potential savings of \u00a32bn a year. A new vaping levy will raise \u00a3500m, while higher taxes on second homes used as holiday lets could raise a few more hundreds of millions of pounds. Hunt is also considering extending the windfall tax on the profits of North Sea oil and gas companies, introduced in May 2022 after Russia\u2019s restriction of the gas supply into Europe led to record prices on the global gas markets. Public service cuts The chancellor is considering reducing an already bare-bones 1% increase in public spending above inflation to just 0.75%. The warning is that after a series of unfunded pay settlements for nurses and other public sector workers, and a period of rampant price increases affecting public services, this could lead to significant shortfalls in the cash available to the NHS and other areas of Whitehall. The move would raise \u00a35bn to \u00a36bn a year. Hunt has also announced a public sector efficiency drive that he hopes will bring \u00a31.8bn in savings by 2029. He says his plan \u201cwill free up thousands of police officer hours\u201d, with less time spent on admin and more on tackling crime. Councils will also be asked to make efficiencies by using fewer consultants and scaling back diversity training, and have been asked to produce their improved productivity plans by July. Government finances The OBR, which is independent of government, will come out with its latest predictions for the economy. It is expected to forecast lower inflation and lower interest rates this year than it did at the autumn statement in November. Lower inflation will lift the pressure of rising prices from public services, and lower interest rates will cut Hunt\u2019s debt bill. However, last year\u2019s recession will probably mean the OBR revises down its prediction made in November of 0.7% growth in gross domestic product (GDP) this year and 1.4% in 2025. The likelihood is that the forecasts more closely follow the Bank of England\u2019s 0.2% this year and 0.6% in 2025. The bad news for the chancellor is this reduces tax receipts from households and businesses. The swings and roundabouts are expected to leave Hunt better off, but with only a modest increase in the \u00a313bn of spending headroom he had in November without some extra tax rises or a reduction in spending on public services. The chancellor has said he will meet a self-imposed debt rule that forces him to bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio in the final year of a five-year forecast."

            "date": "2024-03-05T12:30:01Z",
            "content": "London-based tech firm Nothing\u2019s latest Android attempts to shake up the budget phone market with something a little more interesting. Costing from \u00a3319 (\u20ac329/A$529) the Phone 2a aims to take the cool design and intrigue that made its higher-end models stand out and package it up into something cheaper but still novel, sits alongside the full-fat Phone 2 costing \u00a3579. The new model sticks with Nothing\u2019s cool, semi see-through design. It has a big, smooth and bright OLED screen on the front with a semi-transparent back allowing you to see its interesting design elements, including the \u201cglyph\u201d LEDs that Nothing has made its trademark. This time the phone is made of plastic, rather than the metal and glass of the Phone 2, and the LEDs are only in the top section of the phone around the central camera module. But they can still perform complex patterns for ringtones and notifications, show the volume, charge percentage, timers and other fun things, such as a music visualiser. The phone feels smooth and well made, but the back plastic attracts dust like a magnet and picks up scratches fairly easily. Specifications Screen: 6.7in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (394ppi) Processor: MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro RAM: 8 or 12GB Storage: 128 or 256GB Operating system: Nothing OS 2.5 (Android 14) Camera: 50MP main and ultrawide, 32MP selfie Connectivity: 5G, eSIM, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5.3 and GNSS Water resistance: IP54 (splash resistant) Dimensions: 162 x 76.3 x 8.9mm Weight: 190g Mid-range power with long battery life Inside the Phone 2a has a mid-range MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro chip, which performs pretty well for the price. The software feels snappy and smooth, apps load quickly and games run well. It can\u2019t match the performance of a high-end phone and gets pretty hot when gaming, but handles most tasks with aplomb. The Nothing has solid battery life too. The phone lasted a good 52 hours or two days between charges with general use, including several hours spent on 5G a day. Gaming dents the battery more than high-end rivals, consuming about 18% an hour playing Diablo Immortal for instance. Sustainability Nothing says the battery maintains at least 90% of its original capacity for at least 1,000 full charge cycles. The Phone 2a is generally repairable in the UK. Screen replacements cost \u00a370 or batteries cost \u00a336 plus about \u00a335 labour and shipping by Nothing. The device is made of recycled aluminium, copper, plastic, steel, tin and other materials accounting for 20% of the phone\u2019s weight. It has a carbon footprint of 52kg CO2 equivalent. The company publishes sustainability reports and runs a trade-in scheme. Nothing OS 2.5 The phone runs Nothing OS 2.5, which is based on Android 14 matching the firm\u2019s other phones. The software offers a clutter-free experience but with an interesting visual design based around dot-matrix art, widgets and icons. It can be styled to look just like regular Android, but it encourages you to fill your home screen with monochrome icons, big folders and widgets for a much more interesting experience. Like the fun glyph lights on the back, none of these customisations bog the phone down or get in the way of day-to-day tasks. Unfortunately Nothing comes up short on software support, only offering three years of software updates and four years of bimonthly security updates. When the best in the business now offer at least seven years, four years just isn\u2019t good enough for your wallet or the planet, even in the budget market. Camera The Phone 2a has two 50-megapixel cameras on the back and a 32MP selfie camera that perform very similarly to the more expensive Phone 2. The main camera general takes good photos handling high-contrast scenes well. But it has a tendency to over-sharpen fine detail in bright light while struggling to preserve detail in middling to dim light. The ultrawide camera produces decent shots too, but images look soft when viewed at full size. The phone has no telephoto camera with images captured beyond 2x digital zoom being poor. Still, the camera is decent for the money, though soundly beaten by Google\u2019s Pixel 6A or 7A, which can often be found around this price. Price The Nothing Phone 2a costs from \u00a3319 (\u20ac329/A$529). For comparison, the Nothing Phone 2 costs \u00a3499, the Google Pixel 7a costs \u00a3449 and the Samsung Galaxy A54 costs \u00a3349. Verdict The Nothing Phone 2a is a solid entry into the budget phone market that manages to stand out from an otherwise often dull crowd with an interesting design and fun software. You get a lot of phone for the money, with a big and crisp display, long battery life, solid performance and a design that doesn\u2019t look budget. The plastic body might put some off but it feels solid and well made, and is splash resistant, which isn\u2019t guaranteed at this end of the market. The camera is good even if it can\u2019t rival Google\u2019s budget phones that can be had for only a little more. The worst bit is short software support life, which will render the phone unsafe to use well before its hardware gives out. Pros: interesting design with glyph lights, good screen, decent performance, long battery life, slick Android 14 software, premium look feel at budget price, good fingerprint scanner, splash resistant. Cons: no optical zoom camera, only four years of security updates, camera not best in class, plastic back scratches easily."

            "date": "2024-03-26T16:43:35Z",
            "content": "Cuts to the BBC\u2019s budget by successive Conservative governments have been \u201cshortsighted\u201d and risked undermining its future, the director general said in a speech on Tuesday. Announcing a further \u00a3200m of cuts to the corporation, Tim Davie said 14 years of cuts had reduced its budget by 30% in real terms and had \u201cchipped away at our income over many years and have put serious pressure on our finances\u201d. Speaking at the Royal Television Society in central London, Davie suggested cuts between 2010 and 2020 plus \u201ca tough couple of years of flat funding\u201d had undermined its ability to future-proof the broadcaster during a period of digital transformation. The cuts are \u201cparticularly problematic as a strong balance sheet and the ability to deploy capital strategically is essential if we are to navigate the digital transition\u201d, he said. In a series of pointed criticisms about government-imposed funding cuts, he added: \u201cTo strip money from the BBC during this period has been particularly shortsighted.\u201d The BBC has already made swingeing cuts to programming \u2013 including limiting Newsnight to \u201cinterview and debate\u201d and reducing its running time to 30 minutes \u2013 as part of \u00a3500m of annual savings needed because of inflation and a two-year freeze of the licence fee. He also highlighted the fragility of BBC World Service, which has faced deep reductions, including the loss of hundreds of jobs and radio output in 10 languages \u2013 including Chinese, Hindi and Arabic. Davie said the service was \u201cuniquely valuable and globally important\u201d but said the corporation could not \u201ckeep asking UK licence fee payers to invest in it when we face cuts to UK services\u201d and said its long-term funding should come from central government budgets. The licence fee agreement expires at the end of 2027 and ministers have vowed to replace it with a new funding model. In March, the government appointed a nine-person advisory panel to look at alternatives to the licence fee, including a number of longstanding BBC critics. It was described by one member of staff at the BBC as a \u201cpanel of gravediggers\u201d. Davie promised the BBC\u2019s \u201cbiggest-ever consultation process\u201d on overhaul of the licence fee \u2013 which will rise by \u00a310.50 to \u00a3169.50 on 1 April \u2013 including looking at the way it is enforced and how the cost could be more progressive. But in a week where the US and UK accused hackers backed by China\u2019s government spy agency of conducting a years-long cyber-attack campaign, the director general also warned that the UK risked losing its \u201csoft power\u201d on the global stage. \u201cRussia and China are investing hard, and not properly funding one of the UK\u2019s most valuable soft power assets makes no sense economically or culturally,\u201d he said. The BBC will sign more deals with commercial partners \u2013 akin to the recent partnership with Disney to produce Doctor Who \u2013 and will relaunch bbc.com and the BBC app internationally, with Davie adding that it was necessary to \u201cradically transform and renew\u201d the corporation. The youth channel BBC Three \u2013 which was reinstated as a linear channel three years ago, having been axed in 2016 \u2013 will lose its commissioning power, with programmes instead commissioned by iPlayer in a \u201cdigital first\u201d approach. Setting out a plan for the future in which the BBC would \u201cpursue truth with no agenda, back British storytelling and bring people together\u201d, he argued that the corporation could act as a ballast against increasing polarisation exacerbated by social media. Davie ruled out the use of artificial intelligence in the broadcaster\u2019s journalism but said it planned to \u201cproactively deploy AI on our terms\u201d to create \u201ctools that help us build relevance\u201d. The BBC was already working with big tech companies to develop \u201cunique ethical algorithms\u201d to increase personalisation for users, but stressed they were \u201cnot simply driven by the narrowing of an individual\u2019s recommendations\u201d and would avoid the \u201cdeep polarisation\u201d created by commercial algorithms. Content would also be curated using \u201cserendipity, curiosity\u201d and \u201cwhat [\u2026] BBC editors may judge to be important stories\u201d, he said."

            "date": "2024-03-17T02:19:21Z",
            "content": "Niger\u2019s ruling military junta says it has revoked with immediate effect a military accord that allows US military personnel and civilian staff on its soil. As of 2023 there were about 1,100 US troops in Niger, where the US military operates out of two bases including a drone base known as airbase 201, built near Agadez in central Niger at a cost of more than US $100m. Since 2018 the base has been used to target Islamic State militants and Jama\u2019at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), an al-Qaida affiliate, in the Sahel region. The junta\u2019s announcement follows a visit by US officials this week which was led by assistant secretary of state for African affairs Molly Phee and included Gen Michael Langley, commander of the US Africa command. Col Amadou Abdramane said on Niger television on Saturday that the US delegation did not follow diplomatic protocol, and that Niger was not informed about the composition of the delegation, the date of its arrival or the agenda. He added that the discussions were around the current military transition in Niger, military cooperation between the two countries and Niger\u2019s choice of partners in the fight against militants linked to al-Qaida and Islamic State. Since seizing power in July 2023, the Niger junta, like the military rulers in neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso, have kicked out French and other European forces, and turned to Russia for support. \u201cNiger regrets the intention of the American delegation to deny the sovereign Nigerien people the right to choose their partners and types of partnerships capable of truly helping them fight against terrorism,\u201d Abdramane said. \u201cAlso, the government of Niger forcefully denounces the condescending attitude accompanied by the threat of retaliation from the head of the American delegation towards the Nigerien government and people.\u201d Abdramane stopped short of saying US forces should leave. But he alleged their status and presence was illegal and violated constitutional and democratic rules because, he claimed, it was unilaterally imposed in 2012. He said Niger was not aware of the number of US civilian and military personnel on its soil or the amount of equipment deployed and, according to the agreement, the US military had no obligation to respond to any request for help against militants. \u201cIn light of all the above, the government of Niger, revokes with immediate effect the agreement concerning the status of United States military personnel and civilian employees of the American department of defence on the territory of the Republic of Niger,\u201d Abdramane said. The US defence department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apart from the Agadez airbase, the US has invested years and hundreds of millions of dollars in training Niger\u2019s military. Some of those forces were involved in the July overthrow of Niger\u2019s democratically elected president, Mohamed Bazoum. In October, Washington officially designated the military takeover as a coup, which triggered US laws restricting the military support and aid that it can provide to Niger. But in December, Phee said the US was willing to restore aid and security ties if Niger met certain conditions. With Associated Press and Reuters"

            "content": "A first-of-its-kind training exercise involving more than 20,000 soldiers from 13 countries has launched across northern Norway, Sweden and Finland as the region prepares to become a fully Nato territory within days. The joint defence exercise, which runs until 14 March, was previously known as Cold Response and held in northern Norway, a founding Nato member, every other year. In recognition of Finland\u2019s recent membership of the western military alliance, and with Sweden expected to join imminently, this year it is being designated Nordic Response for the first time. The training exercise across air, land and sea \u2013 which will also include soldiers from the UK, US, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Canada \u2013 will incorporate a cross-border operations exercise in the Arctic Circle. The Norwegian military said the exercise was intended to demonstrate \u201ca unique level of cooperation and interoperability as they cross borders on land, sea and air\u201d. Nordic Response is part of an ongoing series of Nato exercises, Steadfast Defender, involving 90,000 soldiers. It is also closely aligned with the UK-led naval exercise Joint Warrior, which ran between Scotland, Norway and Iceland last week. The latest exercise, which started on Sunday, will involve more than 50 submarines, frigates, corvettes, aircraft carriers and amphibious vessels at sea, over 100 combat, maritime surveillance and transport aircraft, and thousands of soldiers on the ground using artillery systems, tanks and tracked vehicles. Most of the activity will be centred on northern Troms county and the west of Finnmark county in Norway, but there will also be maritime activity along the coast of the north of the country and exercises across borders in northern Finland and Sweden. The newly elected Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, the Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re, and the Swedish crown princess Victoria are all scheduled to visit. The Swedish government is anxiously awaiting the final signoff from Hungary to finally complete its Nato membership. It had been hoped the process could have been finished off last week, but having only been signed by the speaker of Hungary\u2019s parliament on Sunday it still needs to be signed by the president before the documentation can go to Washington. Last Monday, Hungary\u2019s parliament approved the historically neutral country\u2019s membership, nearly two years after it submitted its application. Finland became a member in April last year. The Norwegian military said Nordic Response was aimed at strengthening Nordic cooperation and in turn bolstering the alliance\u2019s ability to defend the region. All relevant countries, including Russia, had been informed of the exercise, it said. \u201cWith Finland and soon Sweden as allied neighbours, the exercise contributes to closer Nordic integration within the framework of Nato,\u201d the Norwegian military said in a statement. \u201cThe exercise also strengthens operational total defence cooperation in the Nordic countries, which results in better cooperation in peace, crisis and conflict. Closer operational cooperation in the Nordic region strengthens Nato\u2019s ability to defend the Nordic region.\u201d"

It acquired the Fractl:2 system, which its Australian developers say has the precision to shoot down a drone travelling at 100km/h and can be operated remotely. Drones have become an increasing threat in modern warfare and have been widely deployed in the Ukraine conflict, as well as being used by Houthi rebels to attack international shipping in the Red Sea. The system is battery-operated and one charge can shoot down 50 drones, its manufacturer say. The laser system, which has been developed by Melbourne-based AIM Defence, replaces the need for ammunition. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Australian government paid $4.9m for the prototype from AIM Defence, which says it has performed more than 200 drone defeats both indoors and outdoors. According to sources, AIM Defence is investing in expanding manufacturing facilities in Melbourne. The prototype technology is expected to be \u201cin the hands\u201d of ADF operators by mid-2024. The company, co-founded by the laser scientist Jae Daniel and the technology entrepreneur Jessica Glenn, was this year selected to take part in an international counter-drone exercise by the Canadian defence department. The Counter Uncrewed Aerial Systems Sandbox 2024 will take place in Canada from May to June and includes 15 companies from across the world, including one other Australian organisation, EOS Defence Systems. Sean O\u2019Byrne, a professor of aerospace engineering at the Australian National University, said he was not aware of any similar technology being deployed to date, though there were a number of companies worldwide that were interested in the space. While O\u2019Byrne has not yet seen AIM Defence\u2019s technology, he said that as far as the sector went, direct energy is a \u201chorizon technology\u201d in the sense that it was quite new in terms of deployment. \u201cIt\u2019s an old technology in terms of the idea, but the systems have not been powerful enough and there are various technical challenges in adaptive optics to focus on a moving target,\u201d he said. \u201cThe target might be moving up, down, left, right, towards you or away from you. \u201cYou have to have an optical system that can focus and there are challenges technologically with that and also challenges with delivering enough power to the spot of focus very fast. Building a portable platform that can do all of those things is challenging.\u201d Guardian Australia is awaiting comment from the Australian defence force."

            "date": "2024-03-05T12:28:38Z",
            "content": "Germany\u2019s defence minister has said that one of the generals on a military conference call on Ukraine that was intercepted by Russia may have broken security protocol by using a non-secure line to dial in. Boris Pistorius said the 38-minute phone call held over the platform WebEx that was subsequently leaked by Kremlin-controlled TV, had not been intercepted by an individual Russian spy but was most likely the result of a random sweep of insecure data on the sidelines of the Singapore airshow. One of the participants dialled in from his hotel room, and either his mobile phone or an insecure connection in his hotel provided the vulnerability, Pistorius said. Speaking to journalists in Berlin on Tuesday morning, Pistorius said that disciplinary measures were being looked into, as the participant had contravened rigid security guidelines by not using a secure, authorised connection. He said Germany was taking technical and organisational steps to ensure a similar incident was not repeated. Amid widespread criticism towards Germany as well as sheer embarrassment over the call in which information about military tactics of Germany and its European and US allies were revealed \u2013 including that Britain and the UK had \u201ctroops on the ground\u201d \u2013 Pistorius said he had spoken to many of his counterparts on Monday, and they had expressed \u201cno sense of annoyance towards Germany\u201d, and \u201creassured me that trust in Germany is uninterrupted\u201d. He said there had been unanimity among Germany\u2019s partners, that \u201cwe won\u2019t let ourselves be divided by this Russian attack\u201d. He said that every one of Germany\u2019s partners was \u201cfamiliar\u201d with such attacks, adding that the \u201cbreadth of such attacks is getting ever broader\u201d. Pistorius called the interception part of a \u201cperfidious game\u201d Russia was playing against western allies, accusing it of trying to \u201cdrive a wedge\u201d between European and US allies, and added: \u201c[We] will not allow Putin to get on our nerves.\u201d He refused to discuss the contents of the phone call, insisting that to do so would be \u201cletting Putin set the agenda\u201d. Led by Lt Gen Ingo Gerhartz, the head of the German air force, or Luftwaffe, the meeting, which took place a fortnight ago, was in preparation for a briefing with Pistorius. It focused on Taurus missiles, and touched on the refusal by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to donate the weapons to Ukraine, over his fears that their 500km range meant they could be used to target Russia, thus making Germany a party to the war. As part of the conversation, the participants discussed how Britain was working closely with Ukraine in deploying Storm Shadow missiles, and suggested Britain had troops in Ukraine. At the meeting, a transcript of which has been seen by the Guardian, the German officers concluded that use of the missiles in the near future would only be viable if German soldiers were involved on Ukrainian territory. The alternative, to train Ukrainian soldiers, in order to avoid putting German soldiers on Ukrainian terrain, was a possibility but would take months of preparation, they said. They also discussed potential targets the Taurus could reach, including the strategically-vital Kerch Bridge, connecting mainland Russia and Russian-occupied Crimea. Russia has interpreted the conversation as a direct German plan to attack Russia, saying the intentions indicate the will for a full-blown war. Pistorius insisted that the communication system of Germany\u2019s defence ministry had \u201cnot been compromised\u201d. Amid criticism that WebEx is unsafe, he said that for certain conversations up to a specific level of security the platform was used, but not the version open to the public, rather one with an additional level of security, using Bundeswehr-controlled servers, and not foreign ones. Pistorius said events like the Singapore airshow, which attracted high-ranking military personnel from across Europe, were notorious for attracting espionage and seen as the equivalent of a \u201claid out banquet\u201d for Russian intelligence services. According to his information, the two-day event had been riddled with \u201cextensive espionage operations\u201d carried out by Russian intelligence. He said the German WebEx conference had been a \u201clucky hit\u201d by spies working \u201cwithin the framework of a comprehensive strategy\u201d. IT experts were in the process of forensically investigating the equipment used by the participants, Pistorius said, and the process of disciplinary action was being looked into. However, he resisted calls to sack anyone involved. As long as \u201cno serious\u201d conclusions came out of the investigation, he said he would \u201cnot let any of my best officers become the victims of Putin\u2019s games\u201d."

            "date": "2024-03-29T16:08:03Z",
            "content": "The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is facing one of the most serious threats yet to his coalition government after the country\u2019s supreme court ordered an end to government subsidies from Monday for many ultra-Orthodox men who do not serve in the army. The ruling follows a series of delays by the government in presenting a proposal to the court aimed at enhancing the military enlistment of ultra-Orthodox men, who have historically been exempt from conscription. The court has previously ruled the current system discriminatory and given the government until Monday to present a new plan, and until 30 June to pass it. Netanyahu, whose government includes parties supportive of and opposed to ultra-Orthodox enlistment, on Thursday asked the court for a 30-day extension to find a compromise. Israel has mandatory army service, but for decades made an exemption for ultra-Orthodox Jews, also known as Haredi, who are allowed to continue full-time Torah study and live on government stipends. But as Israel\u2019s armed forces wage a nearly six-month-old war in Gaza in which 500 soldiers have been killed, legislators from the government and the opposition have voiced a stance that places the onus of heightened military service obligations on the Haredi community, rather than imposing additional duties on those already in service. Benny Gantz, a political rival of Netanyahu who has declared his willingness to resign from the emergency unity government over the issue, praised the court\u2019s decision and said it recognised \u201cthe need for soldiers during a difficult war, and the need for everyone in our society to take part in the right to serve the country\u201d. The move could have deep political and social consequences. Netanyahu is struggling to bridge a major split over military service in the shaky national unity government cobbled together in the days after Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack. Supporters of a review of the exemption include the defence minister and other cabinet members managing the war, who predict months more fighting that will strain manpower and stoke public demands for more equitable call-ups. The two ultra-Orthodox parties in Netanyahu\u2019s religious-nationalist coalition, United Torah Judaism and Shas, denounced the ruling as a \u201cmark of Cain\u201d. Aryeh Deri, the head of Shas, called the court\u2019s decision \u201cunprecedented bullying of Torah students in the Jewish state\u201d. If the ultra-Orthodox parties leave the government, the country would be forced into new elections, and Netanyahu is trailing significantly in the polls. An alternative plan, which seeks to extend the duration of military service for conscripts and raise the age for reservists while also urging an end to the customary exemptions granted to yeshiva students, has been rejected by the Haredi parties. Some Haredi men have said they would rather go to jail than enlist. The exemption policy dates back to shortly after the founding of the state of Israel, when 400 yeshiva students were permitted to avoid conscription. As Haredi populations have increased \u2013 to about 12% of the country\u2019s 9 million citizens \u2013 tens of thousands avoid the military call-up and live on government stipends for religious study. Last Saturday, Israel\u2019s Sephardi chief rabbi, Yitzhak Yosef, said Haredim would leave Israel en masse if their exemption from compulsory service was not renewed. In a letter to the supreme court on Thursday, Netanyahu asked the judges to defer the 31 March deadline for the government to come up with a new military conscription plan, saying additional time was needed for an agreement to be reached. The judges did not respond to his request. Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this report."

            "date": "2024-03-31T09:00:34Z",
            "content": "Annie Jacobsen was a high school student in 1983, when ABC television broadcast the film The Day After, about the horrors of nuclear war. She never forgot the experience. More than 100 million Americans watched and were terrified too. One of them lived in the White House. According to his biographer and his own memoirs, it helped turn Ronald Reagan into a nuclear disarmer in his second term. Not long after, the world\u2019s stockpile of nuclear warheads peaked and began to decline rapidly, from 70,000 to just over 12,000 currently, according to the Federation of American Scientists. That is still enough however to reduce the Earth to a radioactive desert, with some warheads left over to make it glow. Meanwhile, the global situation is arguably the most dangerous since the Cuban missile crisis, the Russian invasion of Ukraine grinding on mercilessly and China contemplating following Moscow\u2019s example by making a grab for Taiwan. The danger of nuclear war is as immediate as ever but it has faded from public discourse, which is why Jacobsen, now a journalist and author, felt driven to write her new book, Nuclear War: A Scenario. \u201cFor decades, people were under the assumption that the nuclear threat ended when the Berlin Wall went down,\u201d Jacobsen said, before suggesting another reason the existential threat of nuclear weapons has been filtered out of mainstream discourse \u2013 it has been turned into a technical debate. \u201cNuclear weapons and the whole nomenclature around them have been so rarefied it\u2019s been reserved as a subject for those in the know,\u201d she said. In her book, Jacobsen seeks to break through jargon and details in order to tell a terrifying story in a devastatingly straightforward way. The spoiler alert is that it doesn\u2019t end well. As the book promises on the cover, it presents a single scenario for a nuclear war, set in the present day. North Korea, perhaps convinced it is about to be attacked, launches a surprise missile strike against the US, leading Washington to respond with a salvo of 50 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). These are aimed at North Korea\u2019s weapons sites and command centres, but in order to reach their intended targets the missiles have to fly over Russia, because they do not have the range to use any other route. All too aware of the danger of miscalculation, the US president tries to get hold of his Russian counterpart. But the two men and the countries they run are not getting on, and he fails. Making things even worse, Russia\u2019s dodgy satellite early warning system, Tundra, has exaggerated the scale of the US salvo, and from his Siberian bunker, the Russian president (Vladimir Putin in all but name) orders an all-out nuclear attack on the US. The scenario is based on known facts concerning the world\u2019s nuclear arsenals, systems and doctrine. Those facts are all in the public domain, but Jacobsen believes society has tuned them out, despite (or perhaps because of) how shocking they are. Jacobsen was stunned to find out that an ICBM strike against North Korea would have to go over Russia, and that Russia\u2019s early warning system is beset with glitches, an especially worrying fact when combined with the knowledge that both the US and Russia have part of their nuclear arsenals ready to launch at a few minutes\u2019 notice. Both also have an option in their nuclear doctrine to \u201claunch on warning\u201d, without waiting for the first incoming warhead to land. A US president would have a few minutes to make a decision if American early warning systems signaled an incoming attack. In those few minutes, he or she would have to process an urgent, complex and inevitably incomplete stream of information and advice from top defence officials. Jacobsen points out that in such circumstances the president is likely to be subject to \u201cjamming\u201d, a chorus of military voices urging he or she follows protocols which lead inexorably towards a retaliatory launch. \u201cMy jaw dropped at so much of what I learned, which was not classified but had just been removed or rather sanitised from the public discourse,\u201d she said. \u201cI found myself constantly surprised by the insanity of what I learned, coupled with the fact that it\u2019s all there for the public to know.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Ultimately, only presidents can make the decision and once it is made, no one has the authority to block it. It is called sole authority, and it is almost certainly the most frightening fact in the world today. It means a handful of men each have the power to end the world in a few minutes, without having to consult anyone. It is not a group anyone would choose to have that responsibility, including as it does the likes of Putin and Kim Jong-un. In Washington it is a choice this year between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. They all bring a lot of human frailty, anger, fear and paranoia to a potential decision that could end the planet. \u201cYou would want to have a commander-in-chief who is of sound mind, who is fully in control of his mental capacity, who is not volatile, who is not subject to anger,\u201d Jacobsen said, referring to this year\u2019s presidential election. \u201cThese are significant character qualities that should be thought about when people vote for president, for the simple reason that the president has sole authority to launch nuclear weapons.\u201d Nuclear War: A Scenario is published in the US by Dutton Nuclear War is published in the UK by Transworld Publishers Ltd, \u00a320.

            "content": "The Sellafield nuclear waste dump is to be prosecuted for alleged information technology security offences, the industry watchdog has said. The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) said on Thursday that it had notified the state-owned Cumbrian nuclear company that it would be prosecuted under industry security regulations. The prosecution follows the Guardian\u2019s revelations last year of multiple cyber failings at the vast site, part of a year-long investigation into cyber hacking, radioactive contamination and an unhealthy workplace culture at Sellafield. The ONR said: \u201cThese charges relate to alleged information technology security offences during a four-year period between 2019 and early 2023. There is no suggestion that public safety has been compromised as a result of these issues. The decision to begin legal proceedings follows an investigation by ONR, the UK\u2019s independent nuclear regulator.\u201d Sellafield, which has more than 11,000 staff, was placed into a form of \u201cspecial measures\u201d for consistent failings on cybersecurity in 2022, according to sources at the ONR and the security services. Among the Guardian\u2019s revelations in December were that groups linked to Russia and China had penetrated its computer networks, embedding sleeper malware that could lurk and be used to spy or attack systems. At the time Sellafield said it did not have evidence of a successful cyber-attack. The site has the largest store of plutonium in the world and is a sprawling rubbish dump for nuclear waste from weapons programmes and decades of atomic power generation. Other findings in the Guardian\u2019s Nuclear Leaks investigation included concerns about external contractors being able to plug memory sticks into its computer system while unsupervised. The Guardian also revealed that cyber problems have been known by senior figures at the nuclear site for at least a decade, according to a report dated from 2012, which warned there were \u201ccritical security vulnerabilities\u201d that needed to be addressed urgently. Sellafield\u2019s computer servers were deemed so insecure that the problem was nicknamed Voldemort after the Harry Potter villain, according to a government official familiar with the ONR investigation and IT failings at the site, because it was so sensitive and dangerous. At the time, Sellafield said that \u201call of our systems and servers have multiple layers of protection\u201d. \u201cCritical networks that enable us to operate safely are isolated from our general IT network, meaning an attack on our IT system would not penetrate these,\u201d it said. This week, the Guardian revealed that Richard Meal, Sellafield\u2019s chief information security officer, is to leave the site after more than a decade. He will be the second senior leader to leave this year, after the top director responsible for safety and security, Mark Neate, announced in January that he planned to leave. In January, Sellafield appointed Graeme Slater as its chief digital information officer, responsible for cybersecurity. The ONR said details of the first court hearing would be announced \u201cwhen available\u201d. Britain\u2019s public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, last month launched an investigation into risks and costs at Sellafield. A spokesperson at the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, which funds Sellafield, said: \u201cSafety and security at our former nuclear sites is paramount and we fully support the Office for Nuclear Regulation in its independent role as regulator. \u201cThe regulator has made clear that there is no suggestion that public safety has been compromised at Sellafield. Since the period of this prosecution, we have seen a change of leadership at Sellafield and the ONR has noted a clear commitment to address its concerns.\u201d Sellafield said: \u201cThe Office for Nuclear Regulation\u2019s Civil Nuclear Security and Safeguards has notified us of its intention to prosecute the company relating to alleged past nuclear industry security regulations compliance. \u201cAs the issue is now the subject of active court proceedings, we are unable to comment further.\u201d"

            "title": "Diplomats fear growing power of Iranian factions that want nuclear weapons",
            "date": "2024-03-10T08:00:12Z",
            "content": "There are growing fears among diplomats in the US and Europe that Iran\u2019s largely unmonitored nuclear programme and the destabilisation caused by the Gaza conflict are strengthening the hand of Iranian factions that back the development of nuclear weapons. The Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, has reiterated in recent days that his country is pursuing a civilian nuclear programme for now. However, at a quarterly meeting last week of the governing board of the nuclear inspectorate, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the US and its European partners issued dire warnings about the threat posed by Iran\u2019s lack of cooperation on its nuclear programme. The IAEA director, Rafael Grossi, even admitted that that the inspectorate had lost \u201ccontinuity of knowledge about the production and stock of centrifuges, rotors, heavy water and uranium ore concentrate\u201d in Iran. Russia\u2019s envoy to the IAEA, Mikhail Ulyanov, also warned that the situation was \u201cfull of danger and risks getting out of control\u201d, though he placed the blame largely on the US walkout from the 2015 nuclear deal. The warnings came after the success of hardliners opposed to the 2015 deal constraining Iran\u2019s nuclear programme in last weekend\u2019s parliamentary elections. The elections were highly managed and in Tehran especially were marked by a very low turnout, but the parliament can nevertheless help frame domestic political debate. The sense of urgency has increased not just because Iran is enriching uranium at such a high level \u2013 very close to the 90% regarded as weapons grade \u2013 but also because in recent months senior Iranian figures have questioned Tehran\u2019s commitment to a solely civilian nuclear programme. The regional geopolitical context, including fears of the Gaza conflict metastasising into a wider Iran-Israel war, is also a factor, as is the knowledge that the 2015 nuclear deal expires in October next year, during a possible Donald Trump presidency, leading to the nuclear issue being removed from the UN security council agenda. Kasra Aarabi, the director of IRGC research at United against Nuclear Iran, said: \u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s refusal to impose direct consequences on Iran \u2013 despite its consistent acts of aggression since October 7, including an Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps proxy attack that killed three US soldiers in Syria \u2013 has emboldened the Iranian regime and made supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei and the IRGC believe the regime can escalate without facing any repercussions.\u201d Gen Michael Kurilla, the commander of US Central Command, warned the US armed services committee on Thursday that if Iran became a nuclear power it would \u201cchange the Middle East for ever\u201d. He added: \u201cThe key to deterrence is for Tehran to understand that this behaviour will have consequences for it,\u201d clarifying that \u201cthe deterrence is temporary\u201d. There have long been concerns about Tehran\u2019s answers \u2013 deemed as not credible by the IAEA \u2013 to questions about nuclear material found at three facilities and the extent to which weapons inspectors can do their job in the country, but the US is losing patience with what it describes as Iranian stonewalling. Laura Holgate, the US envoy to the IAEA, told the board last week: \u201cAfter five years of only limited, last-minute cooperation by Iran; five years of failure by Iran to follow through on its commitments; and five years of unresolved questions related to the presence of nuclear material at undeclared locations in Iran, we cannot allow Iran\u2019s current pattern of behaviour to continue.\u201d Holgate has asked for a definitive comprehensive report from Grossi on Iran\u2019s compliance before the next board meeting in June when the E3 group \u2013 Britain, France and Germany \u2013 will have to consider further sanctions via the UN. The E3 were equally blunt. In a statement, they said: \u201cIran has continued enriching uranium far beyond what it committed to in the JCPoA [the nuclear deal]. \u201cIran must now take serious and meaningful steps that show a genuine desire to de-escalate. Recent public statements made in Iran regarding its technical capabilities to produce nuclear weapons go in the opposite direction.\u201d The UK ambassador to the IAEA, Corinne Kitsell, said: \u201cAfter so many missed opportunities and lost time, the need for the board to hold Iran accountable to its legal obligations is long overdue.\u201d Iran insists it is willing to negotiate a follow-on version of the nuclear deal and talks in the background with the deputy foreign minister, Ali Bagheri, and his European counterparts continue. At the same time, Tehran is increasingly highlighting Israel\u2019s semi-declared nuclear weapon programme. The Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, told a Geneva disarmament conference in February that the Israeli regime was \u201cthe real source of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\u201d in the region. \u201cIt is necessary that the entire nuclear arsenal of this regime be eliminated and all of its nuclear facilities be placed under safeguards and verification mechanisms of the International Atomic Energy Agency,\u201d he said. Aarabi, of United against Nuclear Iran, said: \u201cThe remainder of this year will be extremely volatile, not least as there is growing mood within the regime that the next 10 months may present the best opportunity to move towards weaponisation prior to a potential new administration in White House.\u201d"

            "title": "Did Ukraine war lead Russian security services to neglect Islamist threat?",
            "date": "2024-03-24T15:00:32Z",
            "content": "As Russia observes a day of mourning for the victims of Friday\u2019s terror attack, along with the sorrow comes the hard question that follows most similar incidents: how could this have happened? Rooting out determined and well-trained terrorist cells is not an easy task for security services in any country, but there are numerous signs that failing to prevent Friday\u2019s attack was in large part down to a catastrophic security failure on the part of Russian authorities. First, there was the public warning from the US government earlier in March that it had learned of \u201cimminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow\u201d by terrorists. The warning, also shared privately with the Russian government, suggested Washington had picked up some fairly specific intelligence relating to an upcoming attack. But Putin, three days before the attack, brushed off these warnings, calling them an \u201cattempt to scare and intimidate our society\u201d. In light of Putin\u2019s public dismissal of the threat, it also seems Russian authorities did not take additional security measures to protect such large gatherings, with numerous witnesses talking of an extremely light security presence at the Crocus City Hall. The police response to the attacks was so slow that the handful of attackers were able to roam the venue at will, kill more than 100 people and then slip away without being apprehended or shot on the spot. For a country with a giant, sprawling security apparatus, this slow response is shocking. Some Russians pointedly compared the absent police response on Friday with the overwhelming police presence at the funeral of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, after his death in a Russian prison. \u201cThe FSB obviously had their priorities wrong. They had their main resources on Ukraine and on the domestic opposition. These are the priorities placed upon them from the top,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, an expert on the Russian security services. As the crackdown on dissent has intensified in the two years since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin\u2019s security services have gone after people who put likes on anti-war social media content, LGBTQ+ adolescents who can now be accused of \u201cextremism\u201d simply for attending gay club nights, and people laying flowers in memory of Navalny. Thousands of security officials have been sent away from their day jobs in Russia to manage the takeover of newly occupied parts of Ukraine, rounding up Ukrainian sympathisers and sowing terror in a foreign country rather than keeping an eye on security threats at home. There was also a feeling that the threat from domestic Islamist terrorism, ever-present during the first decade of Putin\u2019s rule, had subsided. Strong-arm tactics in the North Caucasus region, combined with allowing several thousand radicals to leave for Syria and Iraq several years ago, led to a feeling that the fight against Islamist terror was over. \u201cEverybody relaxed and there was a general feeling that there was no longer a serious threat,\u201d said one analyst who works on the phenomenon inside Russia. The dynamics at play in Friday\u2019s attack, with most of the perpetrators apparently radicalised citizens of Tajikistan, are different to the terror attacks in the early part of Putin\u2019s rule, when attackers tended to be from the North Caucasus. Galeotti said: \u201cCentral Asian Islamic terrorism remains a real problem for the FSB. The FSB has a lot of experience dealing with extremists in the Caucasus, they have spent huge resources on that, but central Asia is more of a blind spot.\u201d Predictably, in the aftermath of the attack, rumours and wild theories abounded about who might \u201creally\u201d have been responsible, even as Islamic State took responsibility for the bloodshed. Putin hinted at supposed Ukrainian links to the attacks, and Russian pro-war commentators went further, making a concerted effort to suggest that the Islamic State claims were a red herring and the attacks were actually organised by Kyiv. Ukraine has fiercely denied this. Meanwhile, Ukrainian military intelligence and some western commentators suggested the whole thing had been a \u201cfalse flag\u201d event, organised or facilitated by the Kremlin to consolidate the war effort in Ukraine. There is so far no evidence that either of these suggestions are true, although the coordinated claims of Ukrainian involvement by Russian sources do suggest that the Kremlin plans to use the aftermath of the attacks for political gain. The coming days will show whether the Kremlin\u2019s claims of Ukrainian involvement are simply a distraction tactic from the intelligence failure, or if they will be used to bolster a ramping up of war rhetoric. In many societies, there would be serious political questions raised after such an attack, but Putin rarely punishes subordinates for failures and will likely be keen to avoid too much talk of an intelligence catastrophe. \u201cYou would think heads should roll at the FSB, but there was no meaningful retribution for their intelligence failures during the invasion of Ukraine. Putin is hesitant to implement a major reshuffle,\u201d said Galeotti."

            "title": "No, you\u2019re the threat to democracy: Trump\u2019s latest alternate reality attack",
            "date": "2024-03-20T09:00:47Z",
            "content": "On the cusp of the election year, Donald Trump made a decision: knowing Joe Biden would structure his campaign around the threat Trump poses to US democracy, Trump would use the same line back at Biden. It was an unlikely bet, given that Trump is facing 88 criminal charges for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. But Trump started laying out that message last summer, sprinkling into his speeches the idea that the US president was \u201cgrossly incompetent\u201d and that such incompetence posed a threat to democracy. As charges rolled in against the former president, none of them lodged by Biden himself, he added the claim that Biden was also using his power to shut down his opponent, threatening democracy by engaging in \u201celection interference\u201d. As 6 January 2024 approached, three years after the insurrection, Trump ramped up his attempt to turn one of his liabilities against his opponent. On the 2024 campaign trail, Trump falsely claims to be a savior of democracy and, with increasing harshness, says Biden is the threat. At a rally in Ohio this month, Trump predicted an end to US democracy if he doesn\u2019t win the race. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to have another election in this country, if we don\u2019t win this election \u2026 certainly not an election that\u2019s meaningful,\u201d he said. The \u201cthreat to democracy\u201d retort was Trump\u2019s latest attempt at rebranding the truth, a practiced part of his effort to create an alternate reality for his disciples. In that mirror world, Trump is both the victim and the strongman, the only person who can drive out an underworld of deep-staters who control the country and have unjustly targeted him because he threatens their supposed dominance. The wealthy businessman casts himself as an everyman, the guy willing to say what others are thinking, no matter how uncouth. Jump to the timeline \u201cSomeone on his staff has made it clear that criticisms that he is anti-democratic are hurting his image,\u201d Edward Schiappa, a humanities professor who researches argumentation, media influence and rhetorical theory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an email. \u201cRather than fix the image, or otherwise moderate any of his lies, he has resorted to the Pee-wee Herman strategy of: \u2018I know you are but what am I?\u2019\u201d (Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story.) Trump\u2019s previous efforts to shift blame by warping criticisms of himself are legion. Fake news, which once referred to untrue articles online that fooled readers, became a retort to media critical of Trump. Not paying taxes makes him \u201csmart\u201d. Efforts to hold him accountable are \u201cwitch-hunts\u201d or a \u201choax\u201d. After being called out for racist words and actions, he claimed to be \u201cthe least racist person anywhere in the world\u201d \u2013 this, despite a track record of dehumanizing language aimed at immigrants. \u201cBelieve me,\u201d a man whose political career runs on a stack of falsehoods often tells his audiences. The seeds of these falsehoods culminated in the biggest lie he has attempted to get his followers, and in turn the American public, to believe: that he won an election he lost. That claim reverberates in all he does on the campaign trail in his attempt to return to the White House. Trump\u2019s attempt to cast himself as pro-democracy also coincides with more authoritarian language, saying he would be a dictator for a day and vowing to go after his political opponents, whom he called \u201cvermin\u201d. He called those arrested for storming the US Capitol \u201chostages\u201d rather than acknowledging the crimes they committed. Jennifer R Mercieca, a professor specializing in political rhetoric at Texas A&amp;M University, said she would have expected Trump to double down on his \u201cdictator for a day\u201d messaging rather than fall into this back-and-forth with Biden over who\u2019s better for democracy. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting and, in fact, a sign of weakness that Donald Trump is allowing Joe Biden to define this election as democracy versus autocracy,\u201d Mercieca said. Trump\u2019s consistent base doesn\u2019t need his new line about threats to democracy in order to vote for him; in fact, the far right of the Republican party, Trump\u2019s most ardent followers, favor some degree of authoritarianism. This inclination was on display at CPAC in February, where the far-right activist Jack Posobiec praised the insurrection and called for overthrowing democracy, though he later attempted to walk back the comments as partly satirical. \u201cWelcome to the end of democracy. We are here to overthrow it completely,\u201d Posobiec said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get all the way there on January 6, but we will endeavor to get rid of it.\u201d For that Trump-loving core group, being a Trump supporter is part of their core identity, Schiappa said. When Trump repeats a claim over and over, like that the 2020 election was stolen, it becomes part of that self-identity, making their beliefs and attitudes hard to charge, he said. It\u2019s an argument technique called \u201ctu quoque\u201d, essentially attacking an opponent\u2019s argument by pointing out a hypocrisy, but it\u2019s more understandable as the kind of language you\u2019d hear in a match of playground finger-pointing, not in a presidential election. \u201cThrough sheer repetition, aided by conservative news media, he has persuaded a group of devoted followers that what he speaks is true,\u201d Schiappa said. \u201cIt is similar to how a cult works in the sense that his followers are deeply invested in him \u2013 emotionally and for their own sense of identity. This combination leads a minority of Americans, who are sufficiently unmotivated or unable to consider alternative sources, to believe claims that rational adults know are false.\u201d Beyond that group for whom Trump is a part of their identity, his ability to sway beliefs is weaker. So who is this argument for? Given the democracy message\u2019s lack of needed appeal to his base, it would seem Trump is seeking out a less radical voter by starting to proclaim himself a savior of democracy. But, Schiappa noted, \u201coutside of self-identified conservatives, no, I do not think Trump\u2019s assertions that Biden represents a threat to democracy has much influence\u201d. Mercieca said it could be for donors, some of whom eschew Trump\u2019s authoritarian rhetoric. \u201cI think they don\u2019t want to give money to somebody who says they\u2019re going to end democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cThey still probably legitimately recognize that democracy is actually a better environment for business than autocracy.\u201d A timeline of key moments for Trump\u2019s \u201cthreat to democracy\u201d March 2023 In a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump calls on the audience to \u201ccomplete the job\u201d by sending him back to the White House so he can \u201creclaim our democracy\u201d. April 2023 Biden launches his re-election campaign with a video that frames his bid around freedom, equality and democracy. It includes imagery from the insurrection and calls out \u201cMaga extremists\u201d. A few days later, Trump speaks to a crowd at a rally in New Hampshire and references the launch video: \u201cHe states he\u2019s running because Trump and Maga pose a threat to democracy. Can you believe it? Maga is Make America Great Again, right? No threat there. No. \u201cIt\u2019s Biden who poses the threat to democracy because he is grossly incompetent, has no idea what he\u2019s doing, and basically he doesn\u2019t have a clue and that\u2019s a very bad position to put our country in. Our country\u2019s in a very dangerous position right now.\u201d June 2023 The US justice department charges Trump with 37 felonies related to keeping classified documents after he left the White House (more charges are later added). At an arraignment in Miami on 13 June, Trump pleads not guilty. That night, he rails against the charges and Biden, outside Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey. \u201cThis day will go down in infamy,\u201d Trump says. \u201cAnd Joe Biden will forever be remembered as not only the most corrupt president in the history of our country, but perhaps even more importantly, the president who together with a band of his closest thugs, misfits and Marxists tried to destroy American democracy. But they will fail and we will win bigger and better than ever before.\u201d August 2023 The special counsel Jack Smith spends much of 2023 working on an investigation into Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, culminating in a grand jury indicting Trump on 1 August 2023. At an Alabama Republican dinner on 4 August, Trump calls the indictment a \u201csham\u201d with \u201cfake charges\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not the ones trying to undermine American democracy,\u201d Trump says. \u201cWe are the ones fighting to save our democracy. We\u2019re fighting to save our democracy. This ridiculous indictment against us, it\u2019s not a legal case. It\u2019s an act of desperation by a failed and disgraced crooked Joe Biden and his radical-left thugs to preserve their grip on power.\u201d Elsewhere, in Fulton county, Georgia, a grand jury hands up an indictment of Trump on 14 August in another election subversion case, centered on the swing state in 2020. The sprawling case includes Trump and many of his allies and involves state racketeering and conspiracy charges. After his booking in Fulton county, Trump brings up his common line that the charges are \u201celection interference\u201d but doesn\u2019t mention Biden by name \u2013 the case is not brought by the US justice department, but by the local prosecutor Fani Willis. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is election interference. They\u2019re trying to interfere with an election. There\u2019s never been anything like it in our country before,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is their way of campaigning, and this is one instance, but you have three other instances. It\u2019s election interference.\u201d September 2023 Biden makes remarks a couple times that call out Trump as a threat to democracy and pins his re-election campaign on preserving US democracy, just as his 2020 election was. \u201cLet there be no question: Donald Trump and his Maga Republicans are determined to destroy American democracy,\u201d Biden says at a New York fundraiser. \u201cAnd I will always defend, protect and fight for our democracy.\u201d In an Arizona speech framed around democracy issues later that month, Biden calls out the Maga agenda but doesn\u2019t mention Trump by name much. He doesn\u2019t mention the charges against Trump, which come in part from Biden\u2019s justice department. \u201cThis Maga threat is a threat to the brick and mortar of our democratic institutions,\u201d Biden says in Arizona. In response to the speech, Trump\u2019s campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung gives NBC News a now familiar response: \u201cThe radical-left Democrats, now led by crooked Joe Biden, are the greatest threat to democracy the United States of America has ever faced.\u201d November 2023 In Colorado, a trial is under way that seeks to boot Trump from the ballot there, citing the 14th amendment as its basis. The amendment\u2019s third clause disqualifies Trump from holding the White House again, the filers argue, because he engaged in insurrection while he was an officer of the US. The case will eventually end up in the US supreme court, after Colorado becomes the first state to decide Trump is disqualified from appearing on the state\u2019s ballot, based on the amendment. In a speech in Iowa on 18 November, Trump brings up the cases now in several states that seek to keep him from returning to high office, calling them an \u201celection-rigging ballot-qualification scam\u201d. \u201cOur opponents are showing every day that they hate democracy,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re trying every illegal move they can to try and steal this election because they know that in a free and fair fight against President Trump and crooked Joe Biden, Biden doesn\u2019t have a shot. He\u2019s going to be going down into his basement again. He\u2019s going to be hiding.\u201d December 2023 On the campaign trail throughout the US, Trump keeps bringing up the democracy argument, solidifying its place in this election\u2019s stump speech for the former president. The third anniversary of 6 January is on the horizon, a date that Biden is expected to use to drive home his points that his re-election protects democracy from the threat posed by Trump and his followers. In Iowa on 2 December, Trump says: \u201cBiden and his radical left allies like to pose as standing up as allies of democracy. Joe Biden is not the defender of American democracy, Joe Biden is the destroyer of American democracy.\u201d His speech to the New York Young Republicans on 9 December is perhaps his most extensive broadside at Biden over democracy issues yet. He\u2019s not a threat to democracy, he says \u2013 he will \u201csave democracy\u201d. Biden is the threat, and the claims that Trump is the threat are a \u201choax\u201d. The media is part of the hoax, too, and is using it to deflect from the left\u2019s \u201cmonstrous abuses of power\u201d. \u201cWe call it now the threat-to-democracy hoax because that\u2019s what it is. These guys are so good with misinformation, disinformation, it\u2019s a slight difference,\u201d Trump says. The lines Trump uses to attack Biden on democracy issues come out with a bit more clarity after a few months of him using them here and there while campaigning: \u201cBiden is the real threat to democracy for two simple reasons. He\u2019s corrupt, and he\u2019s incompetent, grossly competent. But we have to fight Democrat misinformation at every corner if the Republican party is to survive.\u201d Back on the campaign trail in New Hampshire, on 16 December: \u201cWe\u2019re engaged in a righteous crusade to liberate this nation from a corrupt political class that is waging war on American democracy like never before.\u201d On 17 December, in Nevada: \u201cJoe Biden is a threat to democracy. They\u2019re weaponizing law enforcement for high-level election interference because we\u2019re beating them so badly in the polls.\u201d In the Nevada speech, Trump brings up one of the terms he has effectively turned on its head, depriving it of its previous meaning: fake news. It used to refer to stories published by sham outlets that were patently fake, but for years now, Trump has been using it to refer to media he doesn\u2019t like. \u201cWe have some great journalists and reporters, but mostly, for the most part, they\u2019re corrupt and fake. Hence the term fake news. That was a good one. We have a lot of good ones,\u201d he says. On 19 December, the Colorado supreme court rules that Trump is disqualified from the ballot because of the 14th amendment. In an Iowa speech that same day, Trump again calls Biden a threat to democracy. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder crooked Joe Biden and the far-left lunatics are desperate to stop us by any means necessary,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to violate the US constitution at levels never seen before in order to win this election. Joe Biden is a threat to democracy. It\u2019s a threat.\u201d January 2024 On the eve of the insurrection\u2019s anniversary, Biden delivers a speech going deep on democracy issues, saying a \u201cdetermined minority\u201d is doing all it can to \u201cdestroy our democracy\u201d. Trump won\u2019t condemn political violence, Biden says. He pledges that democracy is our \u201csacred cause\u201d that he will protect. \u201cThis is the first national election since [the] January 6 insurrection placed a dagger at the throat of American democracy,\u201d Biden says. In a response to Fox News Digital after the speech, Trump uses his practiced line: \u201cBecause of his gross incompetence, Joe Biden is a true threat to democracy.\u201d In the weeks following the 6 January anniversary, Trump keeps up his rhetoric about democracy. Back on the campaign trail, Trump tells supporters at an Iowa rally that a vote for him is a vote to \u201creclaim our democracy from crooked Joe Biden and the entire criminal class in our nation\u2019s capital\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s never happened, the weaponization of justice like they\u2019re doing right now,\u201d Trump says. \u201cThe DoJ is very corrupt. What they\u2019re doing is very corrupt. People aren\u2019t going to take it. Joe Biden is a threat to democracy. He\u2019s weaponizing law enforcement for a high-level election interference.\u201d After a court hearing about his claim of presidential immunity from prosecution, he says that the justice department\u2019s cases against him, playing out now during an election year where he\u2019s a candidate, are the \u201creal threat to democracy\u201d. At a New Hampshire rally again later that month, he says the prosecutions of his actions are more akin to what happens in \u201cbanana republics, third-world countries\u201d. \u201cJoe Biden is a threat to democracy. That\u2019s what it is. He\u2019s a threat to democracy,\u201d Trump tells the crowd. \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing there is so bad, it\u2019s a Pandora\u2019s box. It can happen the other way. And when it happens the other way, it\u2019s going to be a terrible thing, too. And that\u2019s not a threat. That\u2019s just the way life is. That\u2019s the way life works. It doesn\u2019t have to be me. It could be anybody else.\u201d He closes out the month in Las Vegas, reciting his stump speech about Biden being a threat to democracy because he\u2019s both incompetent and also interfering with Trump\u2019s re-election. \u201cIncompetence is a gross threat to democracy,\u201d Trump says. March 2024 At a 2 March rally in Richmond, Virginia, days before Biden\u2019s planned State of the Union address, Trump brings up the democracy line again, saying he\u2019s no threat. \u201cJoe Biden and his fascists that control him are the real threat to democracy in this country,\u201d Trump says. \u201cThey are a big threat, and they are corrupt. They are a big threat. He is the one. They have the standard line: \u2018Donald Trump is a threat to democracy.\u2019 Some advertising agency wrote that down. I\u2019m not a threat. I\u2019m the one that\u2019s ending the threat to democracy.\u201d Biden issues his State of the Union address on 7 March, an energetic defense of Democratic values, where he never uses Trump\u2019s name, instead referring to him as Biden\u2019s \u201cpredecessor\u201d. As expected, democracy is a cornerstone of the speech: Biden notes how democracy is under threat both in the US and around the world. \u201cJanuary 6 and the lies about the 2020 election, and the plots to steal the election, posed the gravest threat to our democracy since the civil war,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they failed. America stood strong and democracy prevailed. But we must be honest, the threat remains and democracy must be defended.\u201d Trump and his allies in Congress \u201cseek to bury the truth about January 6\u201d, the president says. But the moment calls for speaking the truth. \u201cAnd here\u2019s the simplest truth: you can\u2019t love your country only when you win,\u201d Biden says. \u201cAs I\u2019ve done ever since being elected to office, I ask you all, without regard to party, to join together and defend our democracy.\u201d On 9 March, both Biden and Trump hold rallies in Georgia. There, Trump responds to the State of the Union, calling it an \u201cangry, dark, hate-filled rant\u201d that wouldn\u2019t bring the country together. \u201cI\u2019m going to bring it together,\u201d Trump says. \u201cHe\u2019s a threat to democracy. I will tell you, he\u2019s a threat to democracy. Weaponize government. Weaponize the FBI. Weaponize the DoJ. He\u2019s a threat to democracy for other reasons also. No 1, he\u2019s grossly incompetent.\u201d In a 16 March speech in Ohio, Trump derides the court cases he faces and again calls the January 6 rioters \u201cpatriots\u201d and \u201chostages\u201d. He warns that there will be a \u201cbloodbath\u201d if he loses the race, though his campaign later claims Trump was talking about the effects on the auto industry and the economy. Biden\u2019s campaign says the comment was another sign of Trump\u2019s threats of political violence, saying :\u201cHe wants another January 6.\u201d In the speech, Trump starkly lays out what he thinks will happen if he loses the election: US democracy will end. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to have another election in this country, if we don\u2019t win this election \u2026 certainly not an election that\u2019s meaningful,\u201d he says."

            "date": "2024-03-08T17:05:35Z",
            "content": "The Priory healthcare group has been fined more than \u00a3650,000 over the death of a 23-year-old patient who was hit by a train after absconding from a mental health hospital. Matthew Caseby, a personal trainer, was able to leave Birmingham\u2019s Priory hospital Woodbourne by scaling a wall after being \u201cinappropriately unattended\u201d for several minutes in September 2020, an inquest jury ruled in 2022. The healthcare company pleaded guilty to a criminal safety failing linked to the death of a patient, breaching the 2008 Health and Social Care Act, at Birmingham magistrates court on Friday. Priory\u2019s barrister, Paul Greaney KC, entered the guilty plea on behalf of the company. A second charge under the same law was withdrawn. With costs, Priory faces a total bill of \u00a3693,852. The London-based provider was charged after an investigation into the death of Caseby conducted by the Care Quality Commission. The 23-year-old University of Birmingham graduate was detained at the hospital under the Mental Health Act after being seen running on railway tracks near Oxford five days before his death. He climbed over the 2.3-metre (7ft 6in) fence after being left alone in a courtyard. Caseby\u2019s father, Richard Caseby, who had been campaigning for a prosecution of the healthcare organisation, told the court the company attempted to \u201cevade accountability for its gross failures\u201d. In a victim impact statement which he presented as part of the prosecution on Friday, he said: \u201cI found it unbelievable that a private company commissioned by the NHS to care for its most vulnerable psychiatric patients in the greatest crisis of their lives could be so cruel and resort to such desperate tactics to hide the truth.\u201d After sentencing, Richard Caseby said: \u201cMy family is relieved that the Priory has finally been held to account for its criminal neglect. However, the prosecution over Matthew\u2019s death brings no real satisfaction because, of course, nothing can bring our son back \u2026 [and] the same fatal mistakes are made again and again. \u201cThe Priory was prosecuted and fined \u00a3300,000 for the death of Amy El-Keria; it was fined \u00a3140,000 for the death of Francesca Whyatt and today it was fined \u00a3650,000 over the death of Matthew. \u201cThis roll call of death and neglect will continue until the government stops the NHS outsourcing mental health services to the Priory.\u201d During Friday\u2019s court sitting, the defence lawyer said the company had pleaded guilty on the basis that it had exposed service users to a risk of avoidable harm by not carrying out a full review of three previous abscondments from the ward, not all of which took place over the same fence. After the verdict, the Birmingham and Solihull senior coroner, Louise Hunt, urged health officials to consider imposing minimum standards for perimeter fences at acute mental health units. A Priory spokesperson said: \u201cWe would like to repeat how deeply sorry we are to Matthew\u2019s family and once again apologise unreservedly for the shortcomings in the care provided to Matthew in 2020. \u201cWe take our responsibilities extremely seriously and have implemented all the recommendations identified during the investigation process and the inquest into Matthew\u2019s death. These include raising the height of the courtyard fencing at Woodbourne hospital to 3.2 metres. There are no national standards for fence heights in adult acute mental health services as provided at Woodbourne, but we have now installed 3.2-metre fencing in 15 of our facilities across 24 wards. \u201cWe cooperated fully and transparently with the CQC\u2019s investigation, recognising the shortcomings in care and entering a guilty plea at the earliest opportunity. We have cared for over 100,000 people in the last five years and remain committed to balancing the need to keep patients safe, with the need for patients to receive the least restrictive care in therapeutic environments which promote their recovery.\u201d \u2022 In the UK, the charity Mind is available on 0300 123 3393 and Childline on 0800 1111.

            "date": "2024-03-08T19:00:10Z",
            "content": "It is boom time in private healthcare. It has never been, or needed to be, a big provider of diagnostics and treatment in the UK before. The NHS\u2019s provision of care to everyone, free at the point of delivery, has seen to that. That also explains why take-up of private medical insurance has remained stuck at about 10% of the population. The health service\u2019s mere existence left little room for the private sector to expand. However, the NHS\u2019s fragile state \u2013 it still gives people mostly high-quality care, it just cannot do that quickly any more \u2013 is a historic opportunity for the private sector to go from small to significant. It could become what one expert calls \u201ca new normal\u201d \u2013 a not unusual place where people get treated. The private sector knows history is on its side. The long delays for NHS care that are now endemic \u2013 and cause so much worry, risk and harm to those left waiting \u2013 are not going to get better anytime soon, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies said last week. So it is promoting its services like never before \u2013 and finding more and more people want or need them. Leaflets through doors offering \u201crapid access to diagnostics and treatment\u201d at a local private hospital target those anxious at having to wait weeks, months or even years for the NHS equivalent. One recent edition of the Metro newspaper contained advertisements for 20% off breast health checks on Harley Street, advanced MRI body scans \u201cfrom only \u00a3199\u201d, obesity treatment using the Allurion balloon and laser eye surgery by \u201cworld-class consultants and surgeons\u201d. Business is booming because all three sources of the sector\u2019s income are growing, and \u2013 again, thanks to the NHS\u2019s woes \u2013 are likely to keep growing for the foreseeable future. Recent figures from Healthcode, which tracks the use of private healthcare, showed record numbers of procedures were performed on people with private medical insurance (PMI) in private clinics and hospitals during 2023 \u2013 more than \u00a34bn in activity. Given more and more people are becoming covered by PMI, either by paying for the policy themselves or getting it from employers \u2013 with many now offering it as a new perk to help staff overcome their struggles to access NHS care \u2013 that record looks likely to be broken again. Separate data published last Tuesday by the Private Healthcare Information Network showed that private hospitals cared for 665,000 people, a combination of PMI and \u201cself-payers\u201d, between January and September 2023 \u2013 a new record and 7% higher year on year. The commonest procedures performed included blood tests, knee replacements, peripheral nerve blocks, eardrum surgery and tonsil removal. The number of self-payers is 32% above pre-Covid times, although it did fall slightly to 66,000 in July to September 2023 from 69,000 the quarter before. The sector\u2019s only other negative was a drop in people seeking cosmetic surgery, such as a nose job, because more people are going abroad for it. In the last month alone one friend paid \u00a34,000 to have a bone spur on her foot removed, a family friend agreed to spend \u00a312,000 on a new hip, and an acquaintance decided to seek private treatment for his enlarged prostate because peeing into a bag while waiting for NHS care is tiresome. And new Independent Healthcare Providers Network figures show that private hospitals in England are performing record numbers of procedures on NHS patients, paid for by the NHS \u2013 1.67m last year compared with 1.3m in 2019. Even a Labour government committed to reviving the NHS will not seek to disturb its growing interdependence with the private sector. One patient\u2019s desperation boosts one private provider\u2019s dividend, yes, but it also means that person gets care which the enfeebled, overwhelmed NHS can no longer provide when it is needed. Tragically, that will not change anytime soon."

            "date": "2024-03-17T12:15:33Z",
            "content": "Haiti\u2019s healthcare system has all but collapsed amid the ferocious gang insurrection which forced the resignation of the country\u2019s prime minister, leaving victims of the violence with little hope of medical attention, according to aid workers in the stricken Caribbean country. In the past two weeks hospitals have been set ablaze, doctors murdered and the most basic medical supplies have now dried up. Only a single public hospital in Haiti\u2019s capital now remains operational \u2013 and that too is expected to shut its doors soon. \u201cThe healthcare system in Port-au-Prince is basically nonexistent,\u201d said Mackynzie Archer, a consultant advising leading medical NGOs in Haiti. \u201cThings are deteriorating quickly.\u201d Fighting between the heavily armed gangs and security forces has paralysed Haiti\u2019s capital in the worst episode of violence the Caribbean country has seen in decades. Armed bandits attacked police stations, government buildings and the international airport, achieving their stated goal on Monday when the prime minister, Ariel Henry, announced he would step down once a transitional council had been appointed. But as political factions jockey for position, the violence has continued. About half of the Haitian population is going hungry, water and electricity are scarce, and civilians are struck by stray bullets on a daily basis. At least 15,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in the latest wave of gun battles, the UN estimates, bringing the total number of internally displaced people to more than 360,000. \u201cResidents of Port-au-Prince have been reduced to forced nomads, constantly moving between neighbourhoods, seeking refuge with relatives or strangers, or residing in temporary shelter,\u201d said Laurent Uwumuremyi, director for Haiti at the American charity Mercy Corps. \u201cFear permeates every corner\u201d. The eruption of street warfare has caused a spike in emergency patient admissions for wounds just as most hospitals \u2013 unable to get the staff, power or basic medical supplies they need \u2013 are closing their doors. Several facilities, including St Francis de Sales, one of the capital\u2019s last remaining trauma care centres, and Jude-Anne hospital, which treats emergency patients, have been set on fire and ransacked. \u201cThey took everything \u2013 the operating rooms, the X-rays, everything from the labs and the pharmacies,\u201d Dr Ronald V LaRoche told the New York Times. \u201cImagine! They are taking windows from hospitals! Doors!\u201d Even before the current unrest, gunmen controlled main roads and access to the city\u2019s port, choking supplies of anaesthetic, blood and oxygen. \u201cIt was not uncommon for patients to wait in a hospital bed for routine surgeries for a month as there are no medical supplies to operate on them with,\u201d Archer said. Healthcare workers are staying home to avoid being caught in the crossfire of street skirmishes or assassinated by teenagers with assault rifles for giving medical treatment to police or rival gang members. Dr Nathalie Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Laurent became the latest fatality in the healthcare community on Tuesday when armed men sprayed her car with bullets near her home in Port-au-Prince. At the State University of Haiti hospital, a general medical care center in the centre of Port-au-Prince, BBC reporters found no medical staff in a clinic full of patients \u2013 only a dead body covered with flies decomposing in the tropical heat. \u201cThere are no doctors, they all fled last week,\u201d one patient told the BBC. Haiti\u2019s people have faced enormous challenges in recent decades, including a deadly cholera outbreak and a 2010 earthquake which killed more than 200,000 people. But the recent anarchy has eclipsed past episodes of desperation, said Francesco Segoni, a spokesperson for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) who compared the current humanitarian situation to that of a war zone. A recent MSF survey of the gang heartlands of Cit\u00e9 Soleil found that four in every 10 deaths were caused by violence \u2013 a figure comparable to those in Raqqa when the Syrian city was dominated by the Islamic State and blitzed by an international bombing campaign. \u201cViolence is virtually unchecked. There\u2019s no place in Port-au-Prince that is safe today,\u201d Segoni said. The crisis is also causing unnecessary deaths among pregnant women and elderly people, who are dying because they cannot find life-saving hospital or treatment medicine that would be deemed basic in most parts of the world. \u201cThe gangs and the politicians can\u2019t find an agreement and the population is paying the price,\u201d said Flavia Maurello, head of the Italian charity AVSI in Haiti. Caribbean leaders and the US have backed a plan in which a transitional council will take over from Henry. But several key factions have refused to participate, while the gang leader Jimmy \u201cBarbeque\u201d Ch\u00e9rizier \u2013 the apparent architect of the current unrest \u2013 has rejected any solution backed by the international community. MSF and other NGOs have managed to open mobile clinics in some areas but it remains unclear how long they will be able to safely operate. \u201cWe fear we will run out of medicines and medical supplies, which are absolutely essential to meet the enormous needs we are facing at the moment,\u201d said Mumuza Muhindo Musubaho, who heads up MSF\u2019s Haiti operations. At Bernard Mevs, a 50-bed critical care clinic in the north of the capital, nurses are desperately trying to keep patients alive with a bare-bones staff and without electricity, said Archer. \u201cIt is likely that in the next week or so, they will also close, which will be the final blow to the healthcare system in Port-au-Prince.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-22T14:00:07Z",
            "content": "A giant chocolate fountain and a fight over an AFL stadium make headlines, but the serious debate in the Tasmanian election is over how to address entrenched problems in the country\u2019s smallest state. Politically, the question is whether Australia\u2019s sole remaining Liberal government can survive an expanding crossbench expected to take votes from the major parties. Here are some things worth knowing as Tasmanians go to the polls on Saturday. What\u2019s changing? Every election promises change, but few guarantee it so clearly. Whatever happens, Tasmania\u2019s lower house will grow by 40%, increasing from 25 to 35 MPs. Under Tasmania\u2019s Hare-Clark system, candidates are elected in five multi-member electorates \u2013 Bass, Braddon, Clark, Franklin and Lyons. Each currently has five MPs. That will now become seven. Advocates for the expansion believe that, among other benefits, it should create a more representative democracy. It means a candidate needs just 12.5% of the vote \u2013 fewer than 10,000 votes \u2013 to become an MP. The expansion coincides with polling suggesting support for the Liberal and Labor parties is falling. Several polls have put their combined support at less than 70% and possibly little more than 60%. It suggests that, short of a major surprise, no party will win a majority and an expanded crossbench of Greens, independents and possibly debutant Jacqui Lambie Network members will have a significant say in how the state is run. How did we get here? An election wasn\u2019t due until May 2025, but the Liberal premier, Jeremy Rockliff, went early, blaming a standoff with two conservative MPs, John Tucker and Lara Alexander, who quit the Liberal party to become independents 10 months ago and turned a majority government into a minority that struggled to control parliament. The Liberals have been in power for a decade and are seeking a fourth term. They go to the polls as the state faces widely acknowledged crises in healthcare and housing, has a nationally underperforming education system and with the recommendations of a damning commission of inquiry into the state\u2019s response to child sexual abuse yet to be acted on. The government has been criticised for its lack of transparency \u2013 laws it introduced requiring the disclosure of political donations are the weakest in the country \u2013 and what opponents say is a lopsided deal with the AFL to build a stadium on the Hobart waterfront. Several senior members resigned last term, including Rockliff\u2019s popular predecessor, Peter Gutwein. The opposition leader, Rebecca White, is leading Labor to a third straight election. She had resigned following the 2021 loss, but quickly returned to the leadership when her replacement, David O\u2019Byrne, stepped down after historic misconduct accusations were made public. Political analysts say the state Labor branch has spent most of the term struggling to move on from factional fights that wrecked its campaign three years ago and prompted a national executive takeover that ended just as the election was called. What happened in the campaign? Plenty. The Liberals issued 270 media releases, averaging seven a day, while Labor put out 170. It has been such an avalanche that analysts say it\u2019s hard to gauge how much of it has grabbed the public\u2019s attention. The Liberals\u2019 campaign \u2013 launched on the Rockliff family farm at Sassafras, with the leader arriving on a tractor, shirt untucked and wearing Blundstones \u2013 has focused on the need for a \u201cstable majority government\u201d. Its plan for its first 100 days of the next parliament includes 70 itemised commitments, many targeted at addressing the issues that all parties have identified as voters\u2019 biggest concerns \u2013 cost of living, health and affordable housing. Critics argue the government could have introduced most of what it is promising in the last term and it is unclear why it hadn\u2019t. Unlike three years ago, when it lost time in arguments over the candidates it had preselected, Labor is widely seen as having run a disciplined campaign, pledging to reduce power bills and repair the health system. White was declared a clear winner of a Sky News/Mercury debate with Rockliff in which the leaders answered questions from undecided voters, but polls continue to suggest Labor\u2019s vote will struggle to reach 30%. Analysts attribute this less to the campaign itself and more to the several years during which the public has not had a clear idea of what the party stands for. A potentially significant ALP announcement to build a new hospital in New Town, in Hobart\u2019s north, was left until Tuesday of the final week of the campaign. The Greens, led by Rosalie Woodruff, also focused on health and cost of living, and were the only party to release a substantial environment policy. The Greens and some prominent independent candidates signed a pledge to end native forest logging, a step taken this year in Victoria and Western Australia but not backed by Tasmania\u2019s major parties. Instead, the Liberals want to expand logging into 40,000 hectares of protected forests against the wishes of senior timber industry figures. It suggests the future of logging could be a significant issue in the next parliament. What about chocolate towers and green devils? No campaign is complete without a circus and the Liberals duly provided when Rockliff went full Willy Wonka and promised $12m to a help build the world\u2019s largest chocolate foundation near the state\u2019s famous Cadbury factory. But the big side event came in the final week, when the campaign was overshadowed by the launch of the Tasmanian AFL team. The newly named Tasmania Devils quickly signed up 150,000 foundation members, far exceeding expectations. What\u2019s unclear is whether the strong support for a team translates into acquiescence over the Macquarie Point stadium demanded by the AFL in return for the state being given a licence to field a team from 2028. Until now, polls have suggested a majority of people do not want a tax-payer funded stadium. The Liberals say the stadium will be built, but began the campaign promising to cap state funding for the development at $375m, with any shortfall to come from the private sector. Small problem: no potential investors have been named. And the Macquarie Point development still needs to be approved by parliament. Labor says it backs the team but not a stadium, and that it will renegotiate the deal with the AFL if in government. The AFL says the team is contingent on the stadium. Most potential crossbenchers are either sceptical or outright opposed to a state-funded football ground. The only thing that can be said with certainty is that it\u2019s unclear how the issue will be resolved. Who\u2019s coming in? Eric Abetz, for one. The former Coalition Senate leader and minister in the Howard and Abbott governments lost his seat in 2022 but is considered almost certain to win a state spot in Franklin, the state\u2019s southernmost electorate. The 66-year-old conservative has maintained a relatively low profile during the campaign, but it\u2019s assumed he aims to play a central role \u2013 and possibly the top one \u2013 in future Liberal governments. While Rockliff is a moderate on social and cultural issues, having supported the federal Indigenous voice to parliament and proposed a ban on LGBTQ+ \u201cconversion therapy\u201d, Abetz\u2019s election would continue a rightwing shift in the Tasmanian Liberals\u2019 parliamentary membership since the departure of Gutwein, his predecessor, Will Hodgman, and several senior ministers. The other potential arrival of note is the Jacqui Lambie Network. The party is running without saying what it would do on most issues, and its candidates are not well known, but polls suggest they have a chance at the final seat in several electorates. It potentially makes Lambie a key player in shaping the next parliament, though she won\u2019t be part of it herself, and despite the public not having a clear idea of what her MPs would stand for. What happens now? The last parliament finished with 11 Liberals, eight Labor MPs, two Greens and four independents \u2013 the Clark MP Kristie Johnston, and three (Alexander, Tucker and O\u2019Byrne) who were elected as major party MPs in 2021. Predictions under the Hare-Clark system are particularly perilous and electoral analyst Kevin Bonham says he doesn\u2019t make them, but he has aggregated published polls and cautiously estimated what it could mean for seats. If correct, it suggests the next parliament could be something like: 15 Liberals, 10 Labor, four Greens, three Jacqui Lambies and three independents. It would be a parliament in which parties and MPs have to work together to pass legislation. Uniquely, Tasmania maintains the tradition of an election night tally room and the leaders will each address the crowd at the Hotel Grand Chancellor on Saturday night. But with 167 candidates running across the five electorates, the final result may not be clear for days and possibly weeks."

            "content": "An Indigenous prisoner used a pencil sharpener and tweezers to treat an ingrown toenail after delays in seeing a doctor to assess the painful condition, with the Victorian ombudsman criticising the healthcare provided to First Nations people in custody. In a report into the healthcare for Indigenous prisoners, tabled in parliament on Wednesday, the ombudsman said the lack of input from First Nations people into the culturally informed policies was having a \u201cdevastating\u201d effect on their health outcomes. It concluded the current system was failing to meet the needs of Aboriginal people, which the ombudsman said was \u201cwrong and discriminatory\u201d. The report found some prisoners did not have immediate access to programs to tackle their drug use, such as methadone for opioid-use disorder, and had ongoing medications abruptly stopped. The ombudsman documented an example of an Indigenous prisoner who had been attempting to see a podiatrist and had made multiple requests for an appointment over a period of weeks.

He told the investigation that when he requested a Band-Aid the prison officers were unable to provide one. \u201cThey went and had a look, they didn\u2019t even have any Band-Aids there,\u201d the prisoner said, according to the report. In another case, a female prisoner had fallen ill with an infectious and life-threatening illness that she believes she contracted at the prison. She said she did not think there was any point asking prison officers for assistance. According to the report, another person noticed she was \u201cso hot she smelt like a burnt cheeseburger\u201d. The friend then called \u201cat least six codes [requests for help]\u201d before staff attended and the woman was in hospital for nearly a week. The outgoing ombudsman, Deborah Glass, whose 10-year term ends this month, said the experiences of First Nations people were often missing from discussions about policies that affected them \u2013 despite commitments from every level of government about Indigenous-led solutions. \u201cSome of the things we heard were deeply confronting and distressing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe heard about a yearning for cultural connection. About the devastating impact a lack of cultural and family connection in prison can have, and what a huge difference it makes when they do receive cultural support with their healthcare needs.\u201d The report made five recommendations, which the Department of Justice and Community Safety has accepted in principle, subject to funding. The recommendations include working with Aboriginal-controlled community organisations to design and deliver health services in custody that were \u201cculturally safe\u201d for Indigenous people. The report also recommended the department consider how current health contracts for prison can be reformed to provide oversight that is more \u201cculturally safe\u201d and responsive to Indigenous people, and invest in education and training to boost the number of Indigenous health workers in the state. The ombudsman visited three Victorian prisons \u2013 the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre, the Melbourne Assessment Prison and the Ravenhall Correctional Centre \u2013 and interviewed representatives from the Department of Justice and Community and Safety and healthcare providers. Last year, the Victorian government took over healthcare from private operators in women\u2019s prisons. The ombudsman said it was too early say whether the public prison\u2019s new healthcare provider was working but the change was made \u201cwithout meaningful input from key Aboriginal community representatives\u201d."

            "content": "Some 6.8% of American adults are currently experiencing long Covid symptoms, according to a new survey from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), revealing an \u201calarming\u201d increase in recent months even as the health agency relaxes Covid isolation recommendations, experts say. That means an estimated 17.6 million Americans could now be living with long Covid. \u201cThis should be setting off alarms for many people,\u201d said David Putrino, the Nash Family Director of the Cohen Center for Recovery From Complex Chronic Illness at Mount Sinai. \u201cWe\u2019re really starting to see issues emerging faster than I expected.\u201d When the same survey was conducted in October, 5.3% of respondents were experiencing long Covid symptoms at the time. The 1.5 percentage-point increase comes after the second-biggest surge of infections across the US this winter, as measured by available wastewater data. More than three-quarters of the people with long Covid right now say the illness limits their day-to-day activity, and about one in five say it significantly affects their activities \u2013 an estimated 3.8 million Americans who are now experiencing debilitating illness after Covid infection. A new study found that thousands of people in the UK may not be working because of long Covid. Americans have also missed work at higher rates since the pandemic started. The rate of adults currently experiencing long Covid has not been this high since November 2022; the greatest height since CDC began tracking the illness was 7.6% in June and July 2022. The \u201cestimates represent just a snapshot in time\u201d, making it difficult to identify the role of different factors like recent surges, vaccination rates, new variants and survey methods, said Dave Daigle, a spokesperson for the CDC. The most recent Household Pulse survey took place between 9 January and 5 February, and asked respondents if their Covid symptoms were currently lasting three months or more. Because long Covid symptoms, by definition, appear or linger after infection, the rate could continue to rise in coming months even as infections fall from the winter peak. The next round of survey results are expected at the end of this month. US health agencies define long Covid as symptoms lasting four weeks or longer, so the rate by that definition may be even higher than reported in this survey. There are notable differences across geography, with the highest rates reported in North Dakota, Kentucky, West Virginia, Alaska and Maine, and the lowest rates in Hawaii, Pennsylvania and Wyoming. A total of 17.6% of American adults have ever experienced long Covid symptoms, the survey found. Although children are not included in the CDC survey, they also experience long Covid, including fatigue, brain fog and headaches, as well as serious respiratory and cardiovascular issues, such as myocarditis, studies show. The rise in long Covid cases is particularly worrisome because \u201cwe still don\u2019t know all of the things that long Covid does, how it does it, and why,\u201d said Lara Jirmanus, a clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School and a member of the People\u2019s CDC. Ignoring Covid cases now is \u201chubris that almost assumes that we can see the future\u201d, Jirmanus said. \u201cNobody knows what long Covid will do five years from now. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to throw all caution to the wind.\u201d The survey results were released on 22 February, more than a week before the CDC updated its Covid isolation recommendations. The CDC says in that guidance that the \u201cprevalence of long Covid also appears to be decreasing\u201d, in contrast to its own survey findings. The advice from the agency to leave isolation after symptoms have begun improving flies in the face of scientific evidence and will probably lead to more spread of the virus and more cases of long Covid, experts said. \u201cIt\u2019s very irresponsible advice, and it just doesn\u2019t follow the science. And it\u2019s a shame because we rely on public officials and we rely on government officials to interpret and present science to us \u2013 that\u2019s their job. And right now, they\u2019re failing in their responsibility to us,\u201d said Putrino. While vaccines help reduce the risk of developing long Covid, the best way to prevent it is by avoiding Covid, Putrino said \u2013 especially since repeat infections raise the likelihood of prolonged illness. \u201cEvery time you get a Covid infection, you place yourself at higher risk of going on to develop long Covid.\u201d Those who already have long Covid may experience a resurgence or worsening of symptoms with new infections. One study found that 80% of patients reported their symptoms were more severe with reinfection. There is no cure for long Covid, and funding for research on treatments and medications has been slow to materialize. Putrino said he expects long Covid rates to rise and fall with each surge, but the baseline rate may increase over time, which can have immense repercussions for Americans\u2019 health and wellbeing. \u201cAll of these cases that are occurring with no protection from the government and no guidance from the government on infection prevention \u2013 it\u2019s taking its toll,\u201d Putrino said. And it is not yet clear whether the rise in long Covid sufferers has an upper limit, or if cases will continue increasing indefinitely. \u201cIt\u2019s very troubling to me that those risks are not being shared with the public,\u201d he continued. \u201cAllow people to make their own decisions, but give them all the information to make their own decisions.\u201d"

            "content": "Like many people, I have had Covid and I have had long Covid. They are very different experiences. I first caught the disease at the start of the pandemic in March 2020, when its effects were relatively unknown. It was unnerving and highly unpredictable. I did not get particularly sick, but I probably gave the virus to my father, who did. Back then, Covid appeared to be the great divider \u2013 the old were far more at risk than the young, and those with pre-existing vulnerabilities most at risk of all \u2013 and the great equaliser. Almost everyone experienced the shock and the fear of discovering a novel killer among us. We soon acquired a shared language and a sense of common purpose: to get through this together \u2013 whatever this turned out to be. I developed long Covid last year, six months after I had caught glandular fever. The fresh bout of the Covid virus made the effects of the glandular fever far worse: more debilitating and much harder to shake. Some mornings it was a struggle to get out of bed, never mind leave the house. It was as though Covid latched on to what was already wrong with me and gave it extra teeth. The experience was unpredictable in a very different way from the drama of getting sick in 2020: not a cosmic lottery, but a drawn-out bout of low-level, private misery. Good days were followed by bad days for no obvious reason, hopes of having recovered were snuffed out just when it seemed like the worst was past. Long Covid is less isolating than being locked down, but it is also a lonelier business than getting ill at the peak of the pandemic was, if only because other people have moved on. The physical and psychological effects of these different versions of Covid \u2013 the short and the long \u2013 are oddly parallel to its political consequences. The disease turns out to be its own metaphor. We are all suffering from political long Covid now. The early drama is over. A series of lingering misfortunes has replaced it. As with long Covid, different countries are suffering in different ways, trapped in their own private miseries. The shock of the new has gone, to be replaced by an enduring sense of fatigue. When the pandemic hit, its effects on politics were intensely felt and hard to predict. In some ways, it seemed like the ultimate stress test. Different political systems \u2013 and leaders \u2013 were exposed in different ways. Those with longstanding vulnerabilities seemed destined to fail. At the same time, the advent of Covid appeared to open up the prospect of new kinds of political solidarity. We were in this together. Covid\u2019s global impact was a reminder of what it is that we all have in common. An acute awareness of our shared vulnerability might create the conditions for a renewed sense of purpose in tackling global problems, including the climate emergency. Maybe a pandemic was just what we needed to remember what was at stake, and to remind some of us how lucky we are. Four years on, the picture looks very different. The immediate experience of the pandemic feels more and more remote, even though public inquiries are now under way, trying to establish just what really happened and who was to blame for what went wrong. Part of the reason for the remoteness is that much of what once looked like high-stakes decision-making has come out in the wash: many outcomes were similar, regardless of the political choices that were made. Maybe it was in the lap of the gods after all. At the same time, the more pernicious but harder to recognise political consequences of Covid are all around us. The immediacy of the threat has passed, but the lingering signs of the damage it did to the body politic are everywhere. The pandemic and its consequences \u2013 lockdowns, economic dislocation, inflation, growing frustration with political elites \u2013 have found out pre-existing weaknesses in our politics and made them worse. It has given what ails us extra teeth. The early days of Covid gave reason to hope that the massive disruption it entailed might also shift the direction of travel of global politics. That hope turned out to be illusory. In the first phase of the pandemic, it looked to have exposed populist grandstanding for what it was: bleach, it turned out, was no sort of viral disinfectant. But populism remains on the rise around the world, feeding off the many discontents of the lockdown years, and of the years that preceded them. Likewise, Covid did not start any major wars \u2013 2020 and 2021 were two of the most peaceful years for international conflict on record. But a post-Covid world is now as militarily dangerous as at any time since the cold war. Covid did not exacerbate climate breakdown: for a short while, carbon emissions fell as economies shut down. But the world is still getting warmer and the hope that tackling the virus would provide a model for more urgent climate action turns out to have been a pipe dream. The pandemic wormed its way into the weak spots in our political life, just as long Covid finds weaknesses in the human body. It no longer galvanises us, nor is it capable of destroying us. Instead, its symptoms are erratic and hard to fathom, appearing in surprising and seemingly unrelated places. Political long Covid is neither the great divider nor the great equaliser. It\u2019s the great destabiliser. * * * During 2020, when the pandemic forced governments around the world to improvise their responses at breakneck speed, it looked as though it would expose some basic truths about the strengths and weaknesses of different political systems. The biggest and most immediate contrast was between autocratic China and the democratic west. Ruthlessness and decisiveness \u2013 which the Chinese political system appeared to possess in abundance \u2013 were the order of the day. The democracies struggled to keep up. In March of that year, after Italy became the first European country to grapple with the question of how to keep its population from infecting one another, the Chinese sent a group of health officials to help advise. The Italians were concerned by the fact that, despite putting draconian lockdowns in place, the virus was still spreading. The Chinese explained the problem. These weren\u2019t actually lockdowns as they understood them. People could still leave their homes for emergencies, enforcement was sporadic, and punishment was relatively light. Meanwhile, in Wuhan, the very centre of the Covid outbreak, armed guards stood outside apartment blocks, curfews were brutally enforced and those with the virus could be barricaded inside their homes. Within a matter of weeks, Italy\u2019s death toll was more than double that of China\u2019s. The biggest contrast with China was the US, where a federal system of executive decision-making, a widespread suspicion of government mandates and an incompetent president meant that Covid soon killed far more people than anywhere else. If the US was the flagship for democracy, then it looked like democracy was failing to answer the call. However, it quickly became clear that the global picture was more complicated than any hastily assembled political morality tale might suggest. New Zealand \u2013 democratic, liberal and with a robustly independent population \u2013 for a long time kept the virus almost completely at bay. The country had the advantage of being an island state that was able to shut its borders. But Britain is also an island, and that made no difference to the government\u2019s ability \u2013 or inability \u2013 to act. Vietnam, which is not an island, did almost as well as New Zealand. Russia did almost as badly as the US. Some of the worst death tolls were in the countries of eastern Europe, such as Bulgaria and Serbia, which had a mixed legacy of authoritarianism and democracy. Dividing the world up by regime types proved little. Demography turned out to be as important as politics: elderly, unhealthy populations suffered more. Equally, any geopolitical morality tales concealed a more complex set of tradeoffs. A zero-Covid policy, ruthlessly enforced as in China, turned out to be storing up trouble for the future. Even with the advent of effective vaccines \u2013 and China\u2019s homegrown versions turned out to be less effective than elsewhere \u2013 too many of China\u2019s population remained unprotected from the virus and the much-delayed economic opening left them exposed. China has also displayed a longstanding weakness of autocratic systems: an absence of transparency means we don\u2019t know the ultimate death toll there, because they are not telling. It is simply not possible to compare it with other countries. The wider tradeoffs \u2013 the toll that lockdowns have taken on mental health, on treatment for other illnesses, on educational prospects for the children worst affected \u2013 make it hard to draw any clear political lessons. Sweden, which was heralded \u2013 and viciously derided \u2013 for providing a real-time experiment in the efficacy of non-lockdown policies, now presents as mixed a picture as anywhere else: more Covid-related deaths than its Scandinavian neighbours (2,576 deaths per million, compared with Denmark\u2019s 1,630 and Norway\u2019s 1,054) but similar or even lower overall excess mortality rates from all causes, and less educational and economic disruption, though no readily quantifiable economic benefits. Covid was not just a political stress test. It was a series of impossible choices. Four years on, it is also clear that many of the lasting political consequences of the virus have little to do with the relative performance of individual governments. In the UK, the long-term incumbent parties north and south of the border are suffering serious Covid fallout despite adopting opposed approaches to the pandemic. The Tories in Westminster were reluctant lockdowners, the SNP in Edinburgh far more enthusiastic ones. It made little odds for the final outcomes: overall mortality rates were relatively consistent for the UK as a whole and variations had more to do with the underlying population profiles in different parts of the country than with the policy preferences of elected politicians. What lingers is something more familiar: the whiff of corruption and the stench of hypocrisy. Although Rishi Sunak, as chancellor, was responsible for one of the more hare-brained schemes of 2020, \u201ceat out to help out\u201d \u2013 which gave diners discounts for getting back into pubs and restaurants, at a time when the virus was still widespread in the population and about to surge back \u2013 that is not the reason why he is in such deep political trouble. Instead, the Covid legacy that haunts the Tories stems almost entirely from the parties held in Downing Street during Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership, when the rest of the country was still locked down. Ultimately it is not the contrast between the public performance of different administrations that has come to matter politically, but the contrast between public pronouncements and private practice: not how many died in the end, but how many died while the wine was flowing in Downing Street. Hypocrisy is the political killer. The same is true for the SNP. Nicola Sturgeon, who once appeared caring and decisive in her nightly news conference, now seems sanctimonious and evasive, her WhatsApp messages long deleted, her personal grievances exposed. The harsh light of a public inquiry has revealed the SNP to have been as motivated by petty point-scoring and score-settling as any other self-interested political party. Politics everywhere \u2013 in whatever form \u2013 takes its toll on its practitioners. The scars accumulate, especially for longstanding administrations. Covid, initially, appeared to be something else: an unprecedented governmental challenge, requiring a new kind of skill set. But in the end, it found a way to expose the regime fatigue that had set in regardless. As Johnson and Sturgeon have discovered, long political Covid is a lonelier business than the exposure they faced in the white heat of the initial outbreak. It works its way through to latch on to personal vulnerabilities and makes them far harder to shake off. * * * What happened to the sense of solidarity that the arrival of Covid appeared to have engendered? In the early days of the pandemic, many governments \u2013 including in the UK \u2013 were worried that people would soon tire of restrictions on their freedom of movement. Some behavioural models had indicated that widespread disobedience would become the norm after a matter of weeks. Those models turned out to be wrong. Most citizens around the world did as they were told for far longer than might have been expected. This gave rise to a hope that concerted action on an equivalent scale might be possible in other areas, too. If, in the face of a serious threat, the public was willing to act in the common interest, even if that meant making significant personal sacrifices, then perhaps other collective action problems \u2013 from mass migration to the climate crisis \u2013 might be amenable to a similar spirit of cooperation. Maybe we were more public-spirited than we had given ourselves credit for. Yet no such dividend has been delivered. On the most contentious political questions, we remain as far apart as ever. Environmental policies \u2013 particularly when tied to net zero targets \u2013 still provoke deep divisions and can stoke widespread anger. A voting public that was so furious with Johnson over breaking his own Covid rules that it effectively helped turf him out of office nonetheless elected a Tory in his Uxbridge and Ruislip constituency when the party turned the issue of the Ulez traffic levy being introduced by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, into a symbol of bureaucratic meddling in the affairs of local communities. Lockdown was one thing. But environmental protections are something else: readily weaponised as evidence of elite interference in ordinary people\u2019s lives. Anti-immigrant sentiment, including among many of the older voters who most dutifully complied with Covid restrictions, continues to fuel populism around the developed world. Geert Wilders won the popular vote in last year\u2019s Dutch general election on a platform that combined migrant-bashing with net zero scepticism. But unlike some other far-right politicians, Wilders is no Covid sceptic. He had also been one of the first Dutch politicians to complain about his country\u2019s slow rollout of its Covid vaccination programme. Why does Covid solidarity not translate to other areas? In part, it is the lack of any comparable sense of urgency. Net zero targets are there to stave off long-heralded but also long-distant threats of catastrophe. At its height, Covid threatened to crash public health systems in a matter of days. But there is another difference. Public support for government restrictions during Covid was about controlling collective behaviour when it threatened our personal safety. The danger was other people: keep them in to keep us safe. Climate action is so much harder to sell because it seems to represent an infringement of personal freedom for the sake of some far less immediate collective benefit. In that sense, Covid compliance has more in common with anti-immigrant sentiment. Keep them out to keep us safe. Throughout the pandemic, public opinion in the UK tended to be critical of the government for being too eager to lift restrictions rather than too keen to impose them. In a pandemic the majority of British people want other people to be told what to do, even if it means being told what to do themselves. This has not been the case everywhere. In large parts of the US, the public proved deeply resistant to the many varieties of mandated behaviour, particularly when it came to mask-wearing, which became a proxy for a whole host of other resentments and frustrations. The pandemic latched on to what unites us and what divides us. It did nothing to change the contours of those divisions. The truth is that public cooperation during Covid did not reveal civic capabilities of which we had been unaware. Publics obeyed the injunctions of democratic politicians because those politicians were already doing their best to respond to the choices of the public. Successfully observed lockdowns were as much a reflection of ongoing behaviour as they were a constraint upon it. Likewise, when lockdowns failed, it was often because political leaders, themselves pandering to perceived public opinion, failed to endorse them wholeheartedly. Covid didn\u2019t generate the political response required to change the way we live. In most cases, it gave us the political response that we asked for. * * * The area where Covid made the biggest immediate political difference was in public finance. Politicians suddenly found the money that was needed to stave off disaster, conjuring it up any way they could. The magic money tree turned out to exist after all. In a genuine crisis, despite everything that had been said about the insurmountable limits on public spending, there proved to be both a will and a way to surmount them. As chancellor in 2020, Sunak launched a furlough scheme that guaranteed 80% subsidies to almost everyone in employment: the closest the UK has ever come to instituting a kind of universal basic income. In the US, a rolling series of extensive relief and stimulus packages included direct cash payments to all households, mortgage relief, tax holidays and giant subsidies to businesses. As a result, people stayed in work and businesses stayed afloat, while public debt in both countries soared. At the same time, governments around the world spent heavily to support vaccine development programmes. Conventional practice in the pharmaceutical industry meant there was invariably a multi-year gap between finding a new treatment and bringing it to market. But again, these constraints turned out to be dispensable. Effective vaccines arrived within a year of the outbreak. Was this, then, the model for an alternative political future, in which vastly accelerated public spending can drive innovation while protecting citizens from disruption? Could it be the means of tackling the climate crisis? In reality, the response to Covid was less like a trial run for a new climate politics and more like the response to a war. The emergency measures were put in place for the attritional phase of the pandemic, when the threat of collapse was real. They have been steadily wound down ever since. Meanwhile, the spending on vaccine research was only a part of wider government programmes that tended to be far less efficient and highly wasteful. As in any actual war, successful weapons programmes are the exception, not the norm. Most of the money gets siphoned off by schemes that go nowhere. As a result, the legacy of government action on Covid has been lingering dissatisfaction rather than a new sense of political possibility. The symptoms of political long Covid include public frustration with the bill that has to be paid. Part of the cause for that frustration is widespread inflation, stoked by looser public finances, which has fuelled anger with governments around the world and created electoral volatility. Javier Milei might not be president of Argentina without Covid-fuelled inflation. Donald Trump might not be making a comeback without it, either. At the same time, stories of the waste and corruption that inevitably went along with unfettered government spending continue to surface. In the UK, the face of government pandemic spending is not Kate Bingham, the head of the highly effective UK vaccines taskforce, but the Tory peer Michelle Mone, who is accused of having used a VIP fast-lane to bypass standard procurement processes and secure government contracts for a company to supply PPE worth more than \u00a3200m, much of which apparently turned out to be useless (though the company denies this). The price of sidelining politics as normal is that when politics as normal resumes, the corner-cutting doesn\u2019t look so good. In the aftermath of the first and second world wars, when government spending among the belligerents was colossal, and waste and corruption were widespread, lasting social transformation nonetheless followed in their wake. The foundations of a new kind of welfare state were laid by the scale of wartime public investment, along with a sense that public sacrifices needed to be repaid. The pandemic has not been the same. In part, it is a question of scale. The $12bn the US federal government spent supporting vaccine research is a drop in the ocean of public spending. Even the trillions of dollars the US government made available in various forms of aid pales compared with the legacy of pre-existing programmes such as Medicare and Medicaid. The levels of US public debt in 2024 are similar as a percentage of GDP to what they were in 1945, in the immediate aftermath of the second world war. But that has more to do with the long-term burdens of welfare programmes and defence spending than with the response to Covid. In a war, the young fight and give up their lives to keep the old safe, who in return pledge to make life better for those who are being asked to make the ultimate sacrifice. It is part of what creates a sense of mutual obligation between the generations. In Covid, it was the old who lost their lives, but it was still the young who made many of the sacrifices, in lost employment and educational opportunities. That makes the tradeoff more complicated. Its legacy has not been a new intergenerational compact. If anything, political differences between the generations are wider than ever, and Covid has exacerbated them. The young have not been repaid for their sacrifice with the kinds of promises that tend to follow an actual war: better housing, greater educational access, full employment. This is in part because the price paid by the younger generation has proved far harder to quantify than the physical toll the disease took on the old. Who owes whom for what? This was a war with no obvious winners. Except, perhaps, those politicians who saw what might come next. In October 2022, as his invasion of Ukraine was stalling, Vladimir Putin told his government coordination council in Moscow that the lesson was clear: Russia needed to translate Covid urgency into military urgency. \u201cWe faced certain difficulties and the need to upgrade our work, give it a new momentum and a new character when we were responding to the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d he said. Those lessons had to be taken forward in prosecuting the war. \u201cWe need to get rid of those archaic procedures that are preventing us from moving forward at the pace the country needs.\u201d As a first step, Putin declared martial law in the four regions controlled by Russian forces. Covid was not an actual war, though it often felt like one. Nor was Covid a dry run for how to deal with the challenge of the climate crisis, though it occasionally felt like that too. Now we know that Covid was, for some politicians, a dry run for war itself. * * * Covid did not fundamentally change the way we live. The French writer Michel Houellebecq, when asked what impact Covid would have on the future, said: \u201cThe same, but worse.\u201d That is perhaps too bleak. It is not all worse. In some respects, life has returned to its previous patterns, for better and for worse. The drivers of change remain the same, even if some of them have accelerated. The pandemic dramatically accelerated some social transformations that were already under way. Working from home was something being facilitated by new technology long before 2020. The pandemic did not create hybrid working, nor did it begin the steady hollowing out of downtown office space. But it brought them forward by about a decade. Politics, too, is similar enough to what went before that it seems unlikely future historians will see 2020-21 as representing a sea-change in world affairs. The US and China are more hostile to each other than they were, though the hostility had been growing for more than a decade before 2020. The Middle East is more unstable than it was, electoral politics more fractious, authoritarians more assertive, the planet hotter, the disparities greater. This is somewhat different. But none of it is new. And there is no vaccine for political long Covid, any more than there is for the longer form of the disease itself. Its effects are too sporadic and its triggers still too poorly understood for that. But in one respect, the political consequences of Covid in 2024 might yet come to look decisive in the history of the 21st century. The politician who paid the highest electoral price for the pandemic was Donald Trump. At the start of 2020 he was well set for re-election: the US economy was relatively strong, his base was relatively happy (above all with his nominations to the supreme court), and the Democrats were unable to agree on a candidate to oppose him. Covid changed all that. Trump handled it badly \u2013 he never got his message straight \u2013 and even some of his supporters noticed. The economy suffered. The Democrats rallied behind Joe Biden, who did not have to suffer the physical stresses of a full campaign because most forms of campaigning were impossible. Trump lost, but only narrowly \u2013 without Covid he would almost certainly have won. For the many people inside and outside the US who found Trump beyond the pale, his removal from office looked like one of the few blessings of the pandemic. Yet had Trump won in 2020 he would have been, like most second-term US presidents, something of a lame duck. He had achieved little by way of serious reform in his first term: a second term would have likely been even more underwhelming, since Trump runs on resentment, which re-election would have done much to defuse. Now, in 2024, we would be looking at the back of Trump, and at a new generation of candidates, some of whom might have been offering something new. Instead, a narrow defeat in 2020 \u2013 coupled with his insistence that he had been robbed \u2013 has given Trump all the resentment he needs. It is Biden who has inherited the problems of a post-Covid world and the challenge of defending his administration from the resentments that have built up. A second Trump term coming after an interlude of four years, during which time he and his supporters have been making sure they won\u2019t get fooled again, and his opponents have been looking for ways to have him jailed, is a far more serious prospect. The stakes are much higher. The damage could be far greater. This year is the busiest year around the world in the history of electoral democracy: more than 4 billion people are entitled to vote in elections from India to Ireland to Mexico. It is one sign that Covid, which put so many democratic freedoms on hold, did not do so permanently. But the US presidential election in November still has the potential to outweigh all that. Trump is by no means certain to win. Yet if he does, and if he decides this time to make good on his promise to change the way the US is governed, by hollowing out the administrative state and by withdrawing US support for Ukraine and for Nato, then Covid will have had a truly lasting impact on global politics. At that point, political long Covid will be hard for any of us to escape. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on X at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."

            "title": "Cost of private Covid jabs risks widening health inequalities, experts warn",
            "date": "2024-03-28T16:00:12Z",
            "content": "Experts and patient groups have warned that the high cost of private Covid vaccinations could exacerbate health inequalities and leave those more at risk from the virus without a vital line of defence. Both high street chain Boots and pharmacies that partner with the company Pharmadoctor are now offering Covid jabs to those not eligible for a free vaccination through the NHS, with the former charging almost \u00a3100 for the Pfizer/BioNTech jab. While Pharmadoctor says each pharmacy sets its own prices, it suggests the Pfizer/BioNTech jab will set customers back \u00a375-\u00a385, while the latest Novavax jab will cost about \u00a345-\u00a355. However experts have raised concerns that the high cost of the private jabs will widen inequalities, with the vaccinations unaffordable for many. \u201cThe most disadvantaged in society are most likely to be exposed to respiratory viruses due to things like poverty, intergenerational households and crowded workplaces. While they might be most in need of a seasonal vaccine, they will also be the least likely to afford \u00a3100 in the midst of a cost of living crisis,\u201d said Dr Marija Pantelic, of the University of Sussex. Some have noted private Covid jabs cost far more than a seasonal flu vaccination, which retails at about \u00a320. Graham Thoms, the chief executive of Pharmadoctor, said the margins were in line: \u201cPharmacists will buy flu vaccines from the manufacturers for about \u00a35 whereas the Novavax Covid vaccine will cost them \u00a336 [including VAT], hence why the Covid vaccination service using the Novavax vaccine will cost patients on average \u00a350.\u201d While free Covid jabs will be provided in the NHS spring booster campaign, they are limited to adults aged 75 years and over, residents in care homes for older adults, and those aged six months and over who are immunosuppressed \u2013 a smaller pool than for the recent autumn Covid booster campaign. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said the NHS vaccination programme is based on cost effectiveness, and focuses on protecting those who are most vulnerable and therefore most likely to end up in hospital. \u201cVaccination of those who are not vulnerable, [such as] younger healthy adults, still has the potential to lower the risk of infection, which is good for them, but the benefits for the healthcare system and thus taxpayers, are very small,\u201d Pollard said, although he noted workplace vaccination schemes might reduce employee absences which could be valuable to society. However many have expressed concerns that some groups at increased risk from Covid are no longer eligible for jabs on the NHS, meaning protection comes with a hefty price tag. \u201cThe availability of private vaccines will disproportionately affect high-risk groups, including diabetics, who have accounted for a significant number of Covid deaths,\u201d said Lara Wong, founder of the support and advocacy group Clinically Vulnerable Families. \u201cDespite being recently approved for antiviral treatments, these newly approved groups will not have access to them until 2025, and they are also not being offered the NHS spring boosters that they desperately need,\u201d she said. Pantelic added some people may not even know they are at increased risk from Covid, given many have undiagnosed conditions and socioeconomic stressors that compromise their immune system. Prof Amitava Banerjee, of University College London, also voiced concerns over whether the booster campaign is reaching all high risk groups, adding the rationale for current eligibility needs to be better communicated, while greater consideration needs to be given to the potential impact of not widening free provision, including in terms of long Covid. The latter, he said, matters as vaccinations appear to reduce \u2013 although not eliminate \u2013 the risk of ending up with long Covid, and reduce the severity of the condition when it does occur \u2013 the only tool currently known to do so. \u201cAgain, by making [a Covid jab] something that people have to pay for, that reduces access to it \u2013 probably in the people who are most at risk and more vulnerable,\u201d he said. Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, agreed. \u201cWhilst obtaining a vaccine privately may be better than nothing, it inevitably creates two-tier access,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an absurd price amidst a cost of living crisis and is not how the UK should be managing such an important public health issue.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-06T14:05:53Z",
            "content": "A German man who voluntarily received 217 coronavirus jabs over 29 months showed \u201cno signs\u201d of having been infected with the virus that causes Covid-19 and had not suffered from any vaccine-related side effects, according to a study published in the medical journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. The 62-year-old, from Magdeburg, Germany, whom doctors described as \u201chypervaccinated\u201d, said he had had the large number of vaccines for \u201cprivate reasons\u201d, according to the researchers from University of Erlangen-Nuremberg who examined him. According to the news magazine Spiegel, the man\u2019s vaccine spree had sparked a criminal investigation against him for suspected fraud, after suspicions he had run a scam to sell the vaccine certificates to people who did not want to get the jab. The initial reports relating to the study, which gave scant information, had sparked widespread speculation, with suggestions that the man was suffering from paranoid hypochondria, that he possibly had a needle fixation, or he was a doctor who might have been administering vaccines to patients himself. There were also questions as to whether he had financed the jabs out of his own pocket, or received medical authorisation to receive them. Later reports confirmed the criminal investigation against the man, who was accused of getting so many doses in order to be able to collect the stamped and signed vaccination cards, which could then be forged and sold on to people who did not want to be vaccinated and so faced extensive restrictions at the height of the pandemic. A public prosecutor in Magdeburg had opened an investigation into the fraud allegations but no criminal charges were actually filed, authorities confirmed to the researchers. The academics contacted the man after reading about him in a newspaper report. He accepted their request to study his body\u2019s response to the multiple jabs. \u201cWe then contacted him and invited him to undergo various tests in Erlangen,\u201d Dr Kilian Schober said. \u201cHe was very interested in doing so.\u201d They vaccinated him for the 217th time for the purpose of the study, the researchers said. The research team said it had seen official confirmation for 134 of the vaccinations, which included eight different vaccines, including various mRNA vaccines. They looked at previous blood tests the man had given over multiple years and also examined blood samples as he went on to receive further vaccines. Confirmation of 130 of the vaccines, within a nine-month timeframe, came from the public prosecutor\u2019s investigation against the man, Spiegel reported. \u201cThe observation that no noticeable side effects were triggered in spite of this extraordinary hypervaccination indicates that the drugs have a good degree of tolerability,\u201d Schober said. The researchers found that his immune system was fully functional. Certain immune cells and antibodies against the virus that causes Covid-19 (Sars-CoV-2) were present in considerably higher levels compared with people who had received just three vaccines, the team reported. \u201cOverall, we did not find any indication for a weaker immune response, rather the contrary,\u201d said one of the leading study authors, Katharina Kocher. Further tests showed the reaction of the man\u2019s immune system to other viruses remained unchanged \u2013 proof, the researchers said, that his immune system had not been damaged by having to respond to so many vaccinations. The researchers said that even though further details about the man or his motives would not be made public, he had effectively served the common good by demonstrating \u201chow well tolerated the vaccines generally are\u201d. However, they warned the public against following the man\u2019s example, saying that excessive vaccinations were not in general advisable and could cause unpleasant and unnecessary side effects. The fact that the man \u2013 who never contracted the coronavirus \u2013 tolerated so many jabs so well did not mean that would translate into the rest of the population. Prof Dr Andreas Radbruch, an immunologist and president of the European Federation of the Immunological Associations of Experts (EFIS), who was not involved in the study, said that hypervaccination would not increase a person\u2019s protection beyond the point at which their immunological memory was satiated. \u201cThe vaccine is absorbed by the antibodies before it can trigger an immune response. Beyond a certain level of concentration of antibodies, the immune system closes off and no more new antibodies are made,\u201d he told German media. \u201cOnce someone has enough antibodies, you cannot increase their protection with further vaccinations.\u201d Germany\u2019s standing commission on vaccination, Stiko, advises that a person\u2019s basic immunity is reached after three episodes of contact with a pathogen, such as one vaccine and two infections, or vice versa. In Germany, those considered at risk and everyone over the age of 60 is advised to get a top-up coronavirus vaccine every autumn."

            "date": "2024-03-11T16:06:54Z",
            "content": "Bereaved families who lost loved ones to Covid have accused the former Welsh health minister of incompetence and arrogance after he revealed that all his WhatsApp messages from the time had been lost. Vaughan Gething, who is standing to be the next Welsh first minister, said the messages had been a way of \u201cblowing off steam\u201d rather than being used to make government decisions but said he was embarrassed they had vanished. Appearing at the Welsh leg of the UK Covid inquiry in Cardiff, Gething denied that the fact the Labour government\u2019s cabinet did not formally discuss Covid until a month after the administration was warned of the risk showed it had been too slow. He also defended his government for taking almost two weeks longer than the Westminster government to begin Covid testing patients being sent from hospital into care homes, claiming Wales did not have the capacity to do this. Speaking outside the hearing, Anna-Louise Marsh-Rees, who leads Covid-19 Bereaved Families Cymru, said: \u201cHe makes [the former UK health minister] Matt Hancock look like a strategic planning pandemic genius. He wasn\u2019t prepared. He didn\u2019t react. It was all just so casual. Thousands of people died in Wales because of these decisions. There was no sense of urgency. He was meant to be in charge of protecting our loved ones and he just didn\u2019t. His arrogance is astonishing.\u201d Marsh-Rees said the revelation that all Gething\u2019s WhatsApp messages had gone was \u201cflabbergasting\u201d. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t so tragic it would be like something out of The Thick Of It,\u201d she said. Another member of the group, Sam Smith-Higgins, was so angry that she walked out of the hearing, describing the Welsh government\u2019s response to Covid as \u201cchaotic\u201d. She said: \u201cThis is a socialist government but they are acting like a dictatorship. They don\u2019t want to learn from this. The complacency that we\u2019ve heard today from a man who could be first minister next week. We cannot allow the Welsh government to point to Westminster and say they were terrible. They were terrible but we made huge mistakes in Wales.\u201d Gething blamed a \u201csecurity rebuild\u201d of his Senedd mobile phone for the deletion of his WhatsApp messages. He said: \u201cIt is a matter of real embarrassment, because if I\u2019d been able to recover those messages then we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation.\u201d Gething said the messages had been used in place of \u201cconversations you have in the corridor\u201d and not for decision-making. He characterised discussions as \u201clargely blowing off steam and being supportive\u201d. The Welsh cabinet had its first formal discussion about Covid on 25 February 2020, a month after Wales\u2019s chief medical officer, Frank Atherton, told the first minister, Mark Drakeford, there was a significant risk of the disease arriving in Wales. Even then, it was only in \u201cany other business\u201d on the agenda. Gething said fellow ministers were aware he was making weekly statements about Covid and attending UK government Cobra meetings. Asked why the Welsh government did not order patients to be tested for Covid before moving from hospitals to care homes until 13 days after England, he seemed to criticise the UK government, saying: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t the sharing of information you\u2019d have expected between the department of health and others \u2026 I certainly do wish we\u2019d been able to move more speedily.\u201d He also said he did not think Wales had the testing capacity to do it. Gething was asked why the government had been prepared to allow 70,000 people to gather in Cardiff for a Wales v Scotland rugby game on 14 March 2020. The match was eventually cancelled by the Welsh Rugby Union but not until 20,000 Scottish rugby fans had arrived in the Welsh capital. He said: \u201cIn hindsight I think we\u2019d do that differently \u2026 of the awkward choices we made that is definitely one that jars.\u201d"

            "content": "US marriages have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, with more than 2m such unions in 2022 \u2013 while the divorce rate continued to fall, according to the federal government. The total of almost 2.1m \u201cI do\u2019s\u201d in 2022 marks a 4% increase from the year before. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the data on Friday, but it has not released marriage data for last year. In 2020, the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, there were only 1.7m US weddings \u2013 the lowest number recorded since 1963. The pandemic threw many marriage plans into disarray, as communities ordered people to stay at home and banned large gatherings to limit the spread of Covid, which has killed more than a million Americans and millions more around the world. US marriages then rose in 2021, but not to pre-pandemic levels. They ticked up again in 2022 and surpassed 2019 marriage statistics by a small margin. New York, the District of Columbia and Hawaii saw the largest increases in marriages from 2021 to 2022. Nevada, home to Las Vegas\u2019s quickie wedding chapels, continued to have the highest marriage rate in the nation, though it slightly decreased from 2021. The number and rate of US divorces in 2022 fell slightly, continuing a downward trend, the CDC said. Overall, marriages remain far less common than they once were in the US. According to data that goes back to 1900, weddings hit their height in 1946, when the marriage rate was 16.4 per 1,000 people. The rate was above 10 in the early 1980s before beginning a decades-long decline. In 2022, the marriage rate was 6.2 per 1,000 population. The Associated Press contributed reporting"

            "date": "2024-03-21T05:00:24Z",
            "content": "In March 2020, the pandemic closed in like a fog, ushering in a strange new vocabulary, alarming statistics and the fear of illness and death. In the days before the first national lockdown was ordered, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser suggested that a \u201cgood outcome\u201d would be keeping UK deaths below 20,000, a number that sounded improbably awful at the time, but which has been dwarfed by the 233,791 deaths recorded as of December 2023. The direct effects of the Covid-19 virus have been profound and continue to be felt, including by those with long Covid. But four years on, the UK is also reeling from the broader health impacts of the pandemic. Babies and children appear to have suffered developmental setbacks due to lengthy periods of isolation. Access to healthcare continues to be affected. Older people, who needed protecting most from Covid, were also uniquely vulnerable to the effects of physical inactivity. For some individuals, the pandemic prompted a rethink of priorities and provided new opportunities that paved the way for a healthier life. But as a nation, it delivered a body blow, from which experts say recovery will not be easy or automatic. Babies and preschool children Babies born in 2020 emerged into a different world from those born before or afterwards. Even after the newborns left socially distanced hospital wards, grandparents and friends were kept at arm\u2019s length (or farther), play groups and playgrounds were shut and interactions with other children were limited. \u201cSome of the babies were born quite isolated, they didn\u2019t see many people and most of the faces they saw would\u2019ve been masked,\u201d said Prof Monica Lakhanpaul, a researcher in child health at University College London and a consultant paediatrician. \u201cThey weren\u2019t able to engage with other children as much, which affects emotional, physical and social development.\u201d Official data shows national rates of child development are now lower among two-year-olds than they were in 2018-19, before the pandemic, with more than 80,000 children born in 2020-21 failing to reach one or more of the key measures of progress for their age group. \u201cWe have seen early years children who weren\u2019t physically moving as much. We\u2019re seeing children with speech delay because there was less human interaction,\u201d Lakhanpaul said. \u201cThe caveat is that those most affected are those who we were already concerned about.\u201d This is reflected in widening disparities between local authorities, with nearly 95% of children in Wokingham, Berkshire, meeting developmental targets compared with just 44% of those in Brent, north London. With many health visitor checkups done remotely, or postponed, fewer developmental delays were spotted. \u201cDevelopmental milestones are like building blocks. You need the bricks at the bottom to get to the next stage,\u201d said Lakhanpaul. \u201cIf everything is delayed, you can\u2019t integrate with society and do all the things you\u2019re meant to do with other children of that age.\u201d A central purpose of measuring milestones is to prevent, or limit, this onward cascade by targeting interventions effectively. Prof Adam Finn, a paediatric researcher at the University of Bristol, makes a comparison with growth delays during a lengthy childhood illness. \u201cOnce they\u2019re better, if you give them the food they need, they don\u2019t just start growing again, they catch up and then they go back to normal,\u201d he said. The same is true for some other aspects of development, he said, \u201cbut you have to do stuff to fix it; it won\u2019t just happen by itself\u201d. The concern is that those interventions are not happening \u2013 or not for everyone. \u201cSchools are already working at capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ones that most need it are the least well resourced. The wealthy schools and the wealthy people have already got that and spare.\u201d In February 2021, at the most intensive phase of the vaccine programme, Sir Simon Stevens, the then head of NHS England, said the country was facing a \u201cdual epidemic\u201d of coronavirus and disinformation, which needed to be fought with \u201cequal vigour\u201d. Some have blamed a lingering \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d for the declining uptake of childhood vaccines that is now threatening a resurgence of measles, polio and whooping cough (pertussis) in the UK. However, Finn, who is also a member of the government\u2019s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), argues the pandemic has merely exacerbated an ongoing decline, mostly driven by poverty, insecure housing and overstretched NHS services. \u201cThere\u2019s been a steady downward trend in coverage that was already going on before Covid and which has continued to go on since,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just down to anti-vaccine, mad internet stuff.\u201d \u201cThe real problem we\u2019ve got is around delivery,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is that vaccination enjoys majority support that politicians can only dream of \u2013 surveys show 95% support. There\u2019s not a big problem with people who don\u2019t like vaccines.\u201d With sufficient vaccine coverage, herd immunity protects everyone. But some areas, notably central London and the West Midlands, have slipped well below the critical threshold with potentially alarming health consequences that a national vaccine catchup campaign is now racing to avert. Without improved uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, London could be heading for a measles outbreak of between 40,000 and 160,0000 cases, which would lead to dozens of deaths and thousands of people being hospitalised, the UK Health Security Agency has estimated. A steep rise in cases of whooping cough \u2013 553 were confirmed in England in January, compared with 858 for the whole of 2023 \u2013 is also prompting concern. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing diseases that really haven\u2019t been around since the later half of the last century,\u201d Finn said. \u201cWe\u2019re now two generations on \u2013 nobody remembers them. There\u2019s this false impression that these illnesses don\u2019t need to be worried about.\u201d Primary school-age children With schools closed, sports clubs cancelled and playgrounds cordoned off, physical activity among primary school-age children plummeted during the first lockdown. Cooped up at home, many children were also eating more \u2013 and more unhealthily. Obesity rates increased steeply, by 45% in four- to-five-year-olds and by 21% in 10- to 11-year-olds during the first year of lockdowns. After the pandemic, obesity levels in the younger, reception-age children roughly returned to expected (still high) levels, but the proportion of children leaving primary school overweight, with obesity or severe obesity is now at a much higher level than before the pandemic. Almost one in four children aged 10 and 11 in England are living with obesity, according to a recent analysis of more than 1 million children. \u201cYounger children went back to buzzing around and having broadly similar quality diet,\u201d said Prof Keith Godfrey, of the University of Southampton and a co-author of the research. \u201cBut in the children leaving primary those poor health behaviours seem to have become embedded and there were persistent widening of disparities of advantaged and disadvantaged areas.\u201d The soaring cost of healthy food is likely to have compounded the problem, with children living in poorer areas twice as likely to be obese than those living in wealthier neighbourhoods. Without active interventions, the majority of teenagers who are overweight or living with obesity remain on this trajectory into adulthood, meaning that an additional 56,000 children are facing a heightened risk of type 2 diabetes, cancer and other serious illnesses. \u201cIt\u2019s among the biggest impacts of the pandemic,\u201d Godfrey said. \u201cObesity affects a child\u2019s ability to learn and consequently their economic opportunities. It affects their mental health. It affects their physical health, including asthma, susceptibility to diabetes, heart disease, osteoarthritis and a whole range of downstream health consequences. That is the sad and harsh reality.\u201d Teenagers and young people Teenage years are generally defined by friendships, school, hobbies and a growing sense of independence. The pandemic swept much of this away. \u201cThere\u2019s normally a process: you\u2019re looked after by your parents, you\u2019re observed by your parents and then you become independent,\u201d said Lakhanpaul. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing children who are more anxious about doing those normal risk-taking behaviours.\u201d Multiple studies show a population-level deterioration in young people\u2019s mental health, with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and there has been an unprecedented increase in non-attendance at school, with 28% of mainstream secondary school pupils classed as persistently absent (missing at least 10% of school days) in the last academic year. It would be wrong, though, to assume the mental health challenges faced by teenagers were freshly seeded by the pandemic. \u201cIt was amplifying and accelerating trends that were already evident,\u201d said Prof Craig Morgan, a professor of social epidemiology at King\u2019s College London. \u201cAnd it was the people who were already the most disadvantaged who suffered most.\u201d Prof Willem Kuyken, whose research found a rise in depression, and social, emotional and behavioural difficulties over the course of the pandemic, also identified factors that buffered young people against the toll of the pandemic, including a secure home environment and close friendships. Young people less likely to be shielded included those living in households affected by job loss, where parents were key workers, in overcrowded accommodation or with caring responsibilities for younger children. \u201cIf school is your safe place, the pandemic was awful,\u201d he said. In south London, Morgan\u2019s team asked dozens of teenagers to keep written or audio diaries of their experiences during the first year of the pandemic. \u201cWhat really came through was a real concern about exams and academic progress,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the pandemic wore on, things got worse.\u201d One teenager said school had become a \u201cprison of learning\u201d, with all the fun stripped away, while others complained of unrelenting workloads and pressure. Limited internet and computer access meant some children were acutely disadvantaged. \u201cThere were parallel concerns about climate change and all of this crystallised into entrenched distress,\u201d said Morgan. Recent figures from the Resolution Foundation showed a doubling in the number of 18- to 24-year-olds who were \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d due to health issues, including mental health, prompting a Daily Mail front page describing \u201cGeneration sicknote\u201d. More sympathetic coverage of the \u201cmental health crisis\u201d in young people tends to focus on undeniably overstretched mental health services. But Morgan questions whether this points to the correct primary policy prescription. \u201cThe fact that we now frame everything in terms of mental health means that all of these problems are subsumed under this single heading without any granularity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt places the problem within the child and that serves to obscure some of these wider, contextual factors. The narrative around mental health is blinding us a bit to what is driving it.\u201d At worst, this can lead to well-meaning interventions that are ineffective or can even serve to widen inequalities. A recent trial by Kuyken and others, for instance, found that mindfulness training in schools did not improve mental health \u2013 although there was some indication of benefits for pupils who were well at the outset and who were most engaged. \u201cIf you\u2019re not having breakfast and your parents are struggling, I\u2019m not sure how being \u2018in the moment\u2019 is going to touch that in terms of how you feel,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe need public health initiatives, such as free school meals and free internet access. You\u2019re never going to address a population-level public health problem by providing more counsellors.\u201d Adults Navigating healthcare systems tends to fall to adults in mid-life: for themselves, children and parents. The strain the pandemic placed on the NHS has made securing appointments, being referred to specialists, obtaining diagnoses and treatments an increasingly competitive pursuit that is driving inequalities. Some areas of medicine have been affected more than most. Gynaecology waiting lists increased by 60% between 2020 and 2022 \u2013 a bigger proportion than any other area of medicine. Despite the government launching a widely welcomed women\u2019s health strategy, there is concern that diagnostic waiting times for conditions such as endometriosis have deteriorated, with women in England now waiting an estimated nine years. Private healthcare has become a \u201cnew normal\u201d for sections of society, creating a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d system for dental care, cataract removal, hip replacements, cancer diagnosis and gynaecology scans. But even within the NHS, different people receive different care. Long Covid, which has a higher prevalence in people aged between 35 and 69, is a case in point. When the condition first emerged, doctors sometimes noted a stereotype among patients attending new specialist clinics: many were high achievers, thriving professionals, the kind of people who ran marathons at the weekend. Some speculated these people were pushing themselves too hard after being unwell. Prof Claire Steves, an ageing and health researcher at King\u2019s College London and a consultant geriatrician, has an alternative explanation. \u201cIn order to get through the system, you need to have loads of social advantages,\u201d she said. \u201cYou probably know about healthcare and are able to bash through the barriers.\u201d Studies have found that white, middle-class, more educated people are over-represented at long Covid clinics, but population-based surveys, where people are sampled randomly, show you are more likely to get long Covid if you live in a deprived area, and do not show a bias based on ethnicity. \u201cThere are really stark differences in access to care,\u201d said Steves. In 2020 and 2021, \u201cHow was your lockdown?\u201d became a familiar question: some took up new hobbies or got a dog; for others it was universally bleak. \u201cWe talk about \u2018the pandemic\u2019 but there were many different situations that people experienced,\u201d said Dr Dar\u00edo Moreno-Agostino, who researches population mental health at UCL and King\u2019s College London. His team has used longitudinal data, including cohorts born in 1970, 1958 and 1946, to look at how these people who have been tracked for decades fared. With the pandemic, all three generations reached or surpassed the worst mental health levels ever experienced in up to 40 years. \u201cOne of the things that we keep finding is that women were disproportionately impacted,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are quite stark differences by gender.\u201d For the past 20 years, women in the 1970 British Cohort Study had reported higher life satisfaction, on average, than men, but during the pandemic this difference disappeared. \u201cIt\u2019s talking about a historical advantage on life satisfaction being lost,\u201d said Moreno-Agostino. Older people Within weeks of the earliest reports emerging from China, it was clear that Covid posed a particular danger to older people. In the UK, a \u201cstay at home\u201d order was issued to people over 70 and pregnant women a week before the first national lockdown. Compliance in older age groups was high, and as stories emerged of care homes being ravaged by the virus, some were left afraid of leaving the house even to exercise. \u201cWe were quite shocked at how much people\u2019s physical activity changed over the pandemic, especially in older people,\u201d said Steves. The profoundly negative health impacts of inactivity is sometimes overlooked, with evidence that it can be at least equal to the effects of smoking, drinking and obesity. Spending a lot of time sitting increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes and some cancers. \u201cIt\u2019s not the case that because you\u2019re older you can\u2019t benefit from exercise \u2013 if anything you can probably benefit more,\u201d said Steves. Data analysed by Steves from TwinsUK, a registry of 14,000 identical and non-identical twins, showed a substantial decrease in physical activity among older adults, and those who had the lowest strength to begin with were most affected. Blood pressure rates, obesity rates and alcohol consumption all increased, too. This is worrying because when it comes to physical activity there is a threshold effect. A marathon runner in their 70s who reduces their activity for a few months will still be fully functional. But someone on the brink of being unable to live independently could tip into a more profound decline. Steves and colleagues are actively studying the extent to which activity levels have bounced back \u2013 and which factors predict recovery. But she is concerned that a \u201cwave of frailty\u201d will be seen in the older population. Across all age groups, the pandemic appears to have chipped away at health and the NHS treatment that people receive. The challenge of reversing these trends can appear overwhelming and insurmountable, but recognising the scale of a problem can also, in time, galvanise a proportionate response. \u201cThere are parallels with the Industrial Revolution, which was really bad for health inequalities,\u201d said Steves. \u201cBut that was followed by a period of philanthropy, government leadership and infrastructure changes. The pandemic does have a legacy that\u2019s important for health. So we need to also think about how this could be a major opportunity.\u201d"

            "title": "Chinese tourism to Australia still in the doldrums after pandemic travel bans",
            "date": "2024-03-03T14:00:05Z",
            "content": "In the two weeks either side of lunar new year, Mandy Ho, who manages a hot air balloon company in Melbourne, has many balls in the air. Most mornings before dawn, when weather permits, her colleagues fly Chinese tourists from the vineyards of the Yarra Valley over Melbourne\u2019s eastern suburbs to parkland on the city\u2019s fringe. Interpreters make sure nothing is lost in translation. Ho has spent weeks preparing tourists and arranging buses to collect them from hotels. She\u2019s already met some of them while running the company\u2019s Mandarin smartphone app, website and Chinese social media channels. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But this year, she\u2019s noticed a shift. Ho says Chinese tourist numbers are still down by about half when compared with pre-pandemic levels. It\u2019s a financial hit for the company, Global Ballooning, as the Chinese market brings in about 50% of its clients. \u201cI was expecting a full recovery this year as it\u2019s the first year they can travel overseas for Chinese new year,\u201d Ho says. \u201cBut it\u2019s been a much slower recovery than what we expected.\u201d Ho isn\u2019t the only tourism operator disappointed by the sluggish return of Chinese tourists. Tourism Australia figures show 102,000 Chinese holidaymakers visited Australia in September 2023. Four years earlier, the number was 688,000 in the same month. \u201cI think there\u2019s a few reasons for this,\u201d Ho says. \u201cThe economy in China isn\u2019t great and a lot of people are choosing to go to Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia because they\u2019re visa-free. This is the first year they\u2019ve been able to travel since the pandemic and they\u2019re preferring short-haul flights.\u201d Ho\u2019s analysis is supported by statistics from booking platform Trip.com, which has reported a 30% increase in Chinese tourism to south-east Asia in recent weeks, compared with 2019 levels. Trips to Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea have also increased. As Chinese tourists take their money elsewhere, Ho and other tourism providers have had to get creative. \u201cWe tried not to put all our eggs in the one basket,\u201d Ho says. \u201cWe diversified our market and this year we\u2019re seeing a lot people coming back from the United States, from Taiwan and Hong Kong, too.\u201d \u2018We\u2019re not hitting alarm bells just yet\u2019 Peter Shelley from the Australian Tourism Export Council, a peak body for tourism operators, says many of his members are also disappointed but are not panicking. \u201cIf we are honest, I think we were all hoping it would be a little bit more buoyant. It was never going to be 100%, we hoped it would be about 75%,\u201d Shelley says. \u201cAre we worried about it? I don\u2019t think anyone is hitting the alarm bells just yet. It\u2019s still early days, and maybe by the end of the year we\u2019ll be back to 2019 levels.\u201d Shelley says many Chinese consumers now realise Australia is an expensive country to visit and fly to. This month, there\u2019s about 170 scheduled flights between China and Australia. That\u2019s 86% of all flights during the same month in 2019. Tourism Australia, a government agency that promotes holiday making, knows what\u2019s at stake. In 2019, Chinese visitors spent $12.4m in Australia. The agency hopes tourism will return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year, despite Oxford Economics suggesting that may not happen until 2025-26. \u201c[While] travel with China reopened a year later than other markets, we are confident about its recovery as the market continues to steadily rebuild,\u201d a Tourism Australia spokesperson says. But some experts are concerned by anecdotal evidence this past fortnight. Dr Paul Stolk, a senior lecturer in tourism at Newcastle University, says this lunar new year was a litmus test on the health of the Chinese market. \u201cThis is the period of time where we should see a lot of activity,\u201d Stolk says. \u201cThis period we are in right now could be really telling in terms of whether we will see any bounce back and where it will occur, including capital cities and regional hotspots.\u201d \u2018We\u2019ve been back to normal\u2019 The Great Ocean Road \u2013 a long winding roadway that hugs the south-eastern Victorian coastline over steep cliffs \u2013 is usually filled with busloads of Chinese tourists. For years, signs by the side of the road have reminded Chinese tourists to drive in the left lane. Before the pandemic, some restaurants in coastal towns along this road printed menus in Mandarin. After years of lockdowns, many business owners hoped the Chinese tourists would rush back to the coastline and help them rebound. Liz Price, the general manager of Great Ocean Road Regional Tourism, acknowledges the Chinese tourism market has been slow to recover in the region. But she says recent weeks give some cause for optimism. \u201cWe have had some reports that the numbers have increased over the summer and there has been some growth in coaches day-tripping out of Melbourne,\u201d Price says. This may be due to the Australian government reissuing group visas for Chinese travellers in September. Dr Maneka Jayasinghe, a tourism expert at Charles Darwin University, says this should lead to an increase in tourists in coming months. Sally Cannon, who runs the Apollo Bay Bakery about two-and-a-half hours drive west of Melbourne, which claims to be the home of the scallop pie on the Great Ocean Road, is also optimistic. Unlike Ho, Cannon has noticed an increase in Chinese tourists over the last two weeks. So, too, have other business owners closer to Melbourne, in Lorne. Cannon says she\u2019s hopeful the numbers will continue to rise. \u201cPre-Covid, Chinese tourists were a big part of our business,\u201d Cannon says. \u201cOver the past few years, we\u2019ve managed to continue without them, but it\u2019s nice to see them return. \u201cThis has been the first year since Covid where it\u2019s felt we\u2019ve been back to normal. I just have this feeling it will continue.\u201d \u2018It was like a green light\u2019 Like many sections of the Australian economy, political tensions between Beijing and Canberra have had some impact on tourism. But analysts differ on the how significant the influence has been. Tom Parker, the chief executive of the Australia China Business Council, says tensions may have played a role in tourism numbers until prime minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s trip to Beijing in November \u2013 the first by an Australian leader in seven years. \u201cSymbolism is important in China,\u201d Parker says. \u201cThis trip certainly symbolised a lot within China, including that it was OK to engage with Australia again. It was like a green light. These things are never said directly, but the visit, at that leadership level, told a story.\u201d Shelley says the impact of geopolitical tensions would have been clearer if the borders had been open during the pandemic era. \u201cIf we were talking about this a few years ago, I think the impact would have been quite high,\u201d Shelley says. \u201cI must say, the current government has smoothed the waters but there could still be an undertone of tension.\u201d Ho believes the enduring appeal of the Australian landscape will always attract tourists from China, no matter the political climate. She just hopes they won\u2019t wait too long to return. \u201cI definitely think they will come back,\u201d Ho says. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much to offer. By the end of this year, I\u2019m sure the numbers will have increased.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-21T16:20:24Z",
            "content": "\u2018Today is the first day of your new life on this pristine, lovely island. So, congratulations!\u201d says Tom Nook, the benevolent tanuki landlord, a few minutes into Animal Crossing: New Horizons. (Nook is often besmirched online, but you can\u2019t argue that he\u2019s extremely welcoming.) Many players read this comforting message at a destabilising and frightening time in the real world: Animal Crossing: New Horizons came out on Nintendo Switch on 20 March 2020, a few days before the UK entered its first Covid lockdown. This was fortuitous timing. When we were all stuck at home, the game let us plant our native fruits, tend to our flowers and see what the town shop had on offer, repaying our extensive loans (interest-free, thankfully) to Tom Nook as a way of escaping the chaos and daily death tolls. We opened the gates to our islands and welcomed friends and strangers into our pristine little worlds. As real life crumbled, we started anew with bespectacled cats, sheep in clown\u2019s coats and rhinos who looked like cakes. The game\u2019s sudden popularity caused Nintendo Switch sales to skyrocket among pandemic-induced shortages. New Horizons had sold 44.79 million units by December 2023 \u2013 nearly three-and-a-half times more than any other game in the Animal Crossing series, which has been running since 2001. It\u2019s the second best-selling Switch game to date, behind Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Player April tells me she and her partner, Matthew, amassed over 700 hours in the game, turning their island into a joint creative project. \u201cWe planned the specific themes and items we were going to use, how the neighbourhoods would look, and even the lore behind some of the places and characters,\u201d she says, adding that an in-game party organised by Matthew was one of the best birthdays she\u2019s ever had. \u201cI\u2019ve never identified as a gamer and it\u2019s the first game since being a pre-teen that I\u2019ve bought and played,\u201d Amy says. \u201cI could see the sense of community it was offering my friends when we couldn\u2019t do things in real life. We had date nights on there, star-gazing, visiting friends and taking photos with people I was very far removed from in reality.\u201d Many players, including Amy, still play now. She shares the game with her five-year-old niece: \u201cwe now play together and I can pass on what I already know and see the fun continue.\u201d She gets to explore Amy\u2019s island, filled with happy memories created over the past four years. John O\u2019Shea, creative director of the National Videogame Museum, in Sheffield, is massively proud of his team\u2019s work on the Animal Crossing Diaries, a digital exhibition aiming to document the impactful and memorable moments experienced by players during worldwide lockdowns. O\u2019Shea likens the project to the Science Museum Group collecting key \u201cartefacts\u201d of the Covid era, including the first vial of the vaccine used in a mass immunisation programme. \u201cIn the future, we\u2019ll be able to look at those and say that\u2019s representative of what the pandemic was like. But actually, I think that the Animal Crossing Diaries, as an archive of people\u2019s experiences, gives a fascinating insight into the psychology of that time,\u201d he says. The entries are deeply personal, and allow us to relive an aspect of the pandemic through someone else\u2019s eyes, from solo Pride festivals, to a 50th birthday party (fancy dress mandatory). In a familiar sentiment, one writer describes how playing helps them to \u201cforget about all the terrible stuff going on right now\u201d. Shivani\u2019s diary entry documents the creation of their island, Bollywood, \u201cto pay homage to my cultural upbringing\u201d. They found the game a creative outlet when India struggled through the pandemic. With travel bans, they hoped Bollywood would enable visiting players to learn about India\u2019s culture. Other players were inspired to take their Animal Crossing experiences beyond digital boundaries once lockdowns were finally over \u2013 such as May Naidoo, who set himself the goal of seeing the real-life counterparts of all 43 pieces of art in Animal Crossing\u2019s in-game museum. Naidoo documented his experience on TikTok, racking up over 1.8 million views on the video marking the challenge complete. \u201cCompleting it [the challenge] has widened my appreciation of art in general, and I\u2019ve been able to see iconic art in person and visit dream countries and cities for the first time,\u201d Naidoo says. \u201cI probably would have never visited some of these places if it wasn\u2019t for this goal. It definitely feels global and in the last few cities I visited, after previous videos have gained attention online, I was able to meet people and make friends in new cities, get invited and privately toured by some museums.\u201d Naidoo, like others volunteering their stories, feels thankful for the opportunities and experiences gained by playing the game during lockdowns and has taken it with him, long after the world opened up. Others find that talking about the memories stirs a desire to jump back in. In her book Playing With Reality: Gaming in a Pandemic, journalist Alex Humphreys reflects on the role that video games took on in our lives during Covid. Browsing the Diaries, Humphreys notes the blurred lines between realities: \u201csometimes the only way of knowing which world they\u2019re talking about is when you see the currency \u2018bells\u2019 referenced in the next sentence.\u201d For millions, Animal Crossing became far more than just a game. Animal Crossing Diaries is a digital exhibition organised by the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield"

            "date": "2024-03-24T07:00:43Z",
            "content": "There has been hysterical talk, of late, of \u201cno-go areas\u201d in London, districts out of bounds to one community or another. To anyone who moves about the city every day the characterisation is nonsense, an invention of political voices that feed on division. But there is, at the same time, a more private realm in which barriers between communities are being raised: that of storytelling. There is a strain in the culture that wants to put \u201ckeep out\u201d signs around the particular experiences of the capital\u2019s varied citizens; to make each community\u2019s tales and histories only theirs to tell. This is a rare novel, in that hostile landscape policed by cultural studies departments and the 3am stasi on social media, that is temperamentally unafraid of trespass. Andrew O\u2019Hagan goes where his story takes him, deep into the lives of all the communities who live around \u201cthe Cally\u201d, the main road that heads north from the capital\u2019s new centre, King\u2019s Cross. The result is a book \u2013 it\u2019s hard to resist the word Dickensian \u2013 that feels as near an authentic slice of contemporary London life as any packed tube carriage. He starts, where novels have often started, in the life of that newly endangered species, the white British male academic. Campbell Flynn is an art historian, a writer of bestsellers about the Dutch golden age. Flynn, a tenement Scot who now wears a cravat, has married into that landed caste with \u201cinvisible money\u201d after whom the Georgian squares of Islington are named. He and his wife have a townhouse in one of those squares \u2013 there\u2019s also a weekend place in Suffolk, where the neighbour stocks \u201can honesty larder\u201d of local produce at the roadside \u2013 but Flynn\u2019s hold on that life is precarious, both materially and psychologically. The novel\u2019s epigraph is from Robert Louis Stevenson: \u201cAfter a certain distance, every step we take in life we find the ice growing thinner below our feet\u2026\u201d The reader is invited to watch in sympathetic fascination as, over the course of more than 600 pages, Flynn slips below the ice. He does not go down without a struggle. He\u2019s clever enough to have sensed that cultural survival lies both in serious reinvention and the retention of a sense of humour: \u201cIf ambiguity was the spirit of the age, Campbell felt he had been a dutiful officer in that war\u2026 He\u2019d marched against Section 28, he\u2019d read every book on the fall of empire, was the proud father of a queer daughter, the first into pronoun therapy, yet his destiny, like everybody\u2019s, was to fall short, and he knew it would be better if he could see the funny side.\u201d When we meet him, as the capital is giving its head a wobble after the successive concussions of Brexit and lockdown, he is exploring different strategies for that personal renewal. For one thing, he has written, anonymously, a short polemic about the crisis in masculinity, \u201cWhy Men Weep in Their Cars\u201d. In his public life, meanwhile, he has befriended one of his students at University College, Milo Mangasha, who has grown up on the estates that rise above Flynn\u2019s own leafy Henry James world; Milo is both an after-hours computer hacker and a radical post-colonial theorist; he is still half-involved with his rap artist mates from school. Flynn wants, naively, to find the common purpose in their worlds; Milo sees an opportunity for show trial and re-education. This is no simple morality tale, however. In delineating Flynn\u2019s fall, the light of O\u2019Hagan\u2019s attention falls on each of his characters equally \u2013 this is a book that comes with a two-page cast list as a preface, to help you keep your bearings. Flynn writes of his beloved Vermeer that he was \u201cthe patron saint of individual merit\u2026 For thousands of years, privilege and power, determined by birth were the drivers of history. But with this mysterious woman, standing at a musical instrument or reading a letter in the common light of day, we find that it is merit and consciousness, the personal power of ordinary people, that rules the world.\u201d O\u2019Hagan\u2019s book examines what that platitude might actually mean for people like Flynn and employs that \u201ccommon light\u201d as his own authorial ambition, bringing to full life not only the man of letters, his titled friends and relatives, but the complex day to day of the people who work in the car wash or do shifts at sweatshop garment factories. Without too much strain, his plotting establishes a web of connection that convincingly takes in all of these worlds: the sitting tenant in Flynn\u2019s Islington basement, Mrs Voyles, bitter remnant of an Islington before gentrification; Cecylia Krupa, praying for a better England in her Polish church; and Zak Byre, the property developer\u2019s son, who divides his time between a \u00a37m flat and direct action for Extinction Rebellion. This being a novel of London, the thread is indebtedness. If you follow the money, O\u2019Hagan suggests, it inevitably leads from eye-watering mortgage to city fixer to money-laundering oligarch to Saudi real estate, with stops for drug dealers and people traffickers and bitcoin investors along the way. As a journalist, longtime editor-at-large of the London Review of Books, O\u2019Hagan has always been curious to discover the precise tone of new worlds and old. Alongside critical essays on Burns or Stevenson, he has written deeply researched investigations into cryptocurrency and Julian Assange and the dark web; his personal report on the Grenfell Tower fire excited outrage among those who wanted the security of seeing the tragedy only through their own off-the-peg preconceptions, by instead insisting on proper human complication and nuance. As a novelist, he has tended to write more closely from his own emotional life, from his debut, Our Fathers, set in the Ayrshire housing projects in which he grew up, to Mayflies, 2020\u2019s poignant fictionalised account of a teenage friendship. This book is a departure from that more personal focus, in that he brings into play all of his reporter\u2019s eye for detail and feel for critical ironies. The result is a tragicomedy of manners that has a pitch-perfect grasp of the icy snobberies of Garsington Opera and the patois of drill rappers; a frontline dispatch from the trenches of culture wars and a much-needed, vividly enjoyable broadside to them. \u2022 Caledonian Road by Andrew O\u2019Hagan is published by Faber (\u00a320).

            "title": "India gets its own HPV vaccine to stop 70,000 women dying of cervical cancer a year",
            "date": "2024-03-12T09:00:01Z",
            "content": "It is a Wednesday morning and Sneha Neurgaonkar sits on a gurney in a private hospital in Pune, India. The 14-year-old is at the Lalwani mother and child care hospital to receive the first Indian-made human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, which prevents cervical cancer. Unlike the 10-year-old girl who was given the vaccine before her, Sneha knows what cervical cancer is and the damage it is doing to women in her country. \u201cI researched cervical cancer on Google and it\u2019s bad,\u201d she says. \u201cProtection is very important because females are the leaders of the future generation and without them, there is no world.\u201d Cervical cancer is the second biggest cause of cancer deaths among women in India, killing an estimated 70,000 a year \u2013 a quarter of the global burden of the disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, with about 90% of deaths from the disease occuring in low- and middle-income countries. Nearly all cervical cancers are caused by an infection from certain types of HPV. It takes 15 to 20 years for the disease to develop. The HPV vaccine has been shown to significantly reduce cases, but access to the vaccine in India has been extremely limited because the existing doses, sold by foreign pharmaceutical companies Merck and GSK, are expensive. Developed as a joint initiative between the Indian government and the Serum Institute of India (SII) \u2013 the world\u2019s largest vaccine manufacturer by dose \u2013 Cervavac is the first vaccine manufactured in the country to receive approval from its drugs controller general. Last month, the government announced it would include the vaccine in the country\u2019s immunisation programme, meaning it will be distributed for free to girls between nine and 14. Until this month it was only available in private healthcare settings at a cost of 2,000 rupees (\u00a319) for three doses. From March 8 it was offered at the hospital at the price of 1,500 rupees to those who had registered in advance. Adar Poonawalla, SII\u2019s chief executive, says the vaccine will be available by December to the government at a cost of 300-400 rupees a dose. The SII, based in Pune, can currently manufacture 70m doses of the vaccine annually, but aims to at least double that by 2026. About 25 million children are born in India every year. Once demand in India has been satisfied, Poonawalla wants to export the vaccine. \u201cWe\u2019ll start with African countries, the Indian subcontinent, maybe South America,\u201d he says. \u201cEurope and the US probably won\u2019t be seeing this vaccine because they\u2019re used to the 9-valent [vaccine]. Maybe in five or six years, we\u2019ll make the 9-valent and go to these countries.\u201d Umesh Shaligram, an executive director at SII, says the new HPV vaccine \u201cwill have a huge impact\u201d. \u201cI always had a feeling that women in low- and middle-income countries are not well treated,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a mother who gives you energy and power. In Indian spirituality we have prayers, we have goddesses everywhere. If you ask me whether we pass on that respect, probably not. I always felt that lack. I was very happy we could do something for that particular aspect of life.\u201d This vaccine comes almost two decades after the first HPV vaccine was developed in 2006. Shaligram blames Covid for the delay in production, but some have criticised the delay. \u201cAt some point it has to stop being an achievement when we get a low-cost indigenous vaccine that we can afford 18 years after one in the west,\u201d says Achal Prabhala, coordinator of the AccessIBSA project, which campaigns for access to medicines in India, Brazil and South Africa. \u201cWhy can\u2019t SII challenge the environment to produce vaccines simultaneously to those in the west?\u201d Back at Lalwani, Sneha and her mother, Sonia, are happy she has been vaccinated with an Indian-made vaccine. \u201cIf it is made in India, we have more trust,\u201d says Sonia. Sneha says she has been telling her friends about the vaccine. She doesn\u2019t think many of them know about cervical cancer. \u201cCurrently there\u2019s not much awareness,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have not been taught about it in school. Period awareness is now being implemented, but before it was considered taboo.\u201d Her doctor, Sunita Lalwani, a consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician, agrees: \u201cI don\u2019t think the government or families used to spend money on women\u2019s health. It was only in [childbirth] or if the lady really fell ill where women were taken care of. Vaccination was never considered. Women\u2019s health was very taboo.\u201d Despite the WHO\u2019s recommendation that all women over 30 attend a cervical cancer screening every five to 10 years, less than 2% of women in India aged 30 to 49 years have been screened. Lalwani faces problems in convincing women to attend appointments for cervical smears, a procedure in which a small brush is used to gently remove cells from the surface of the cervix and the area around it so they can be checked for cancer. \u201cPap smears have always been available but where are the takers? I have to ring up my patients and send them SMS. Let me tell you, many don\u2019t turn up.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-26T15:41:40Z",
            "content": "Boots is to offer Covid vaccinations for almost \u00a3100 a shot, making it the latest provider to sell the jabs to those not eligible for a booster through the NHS. The company has confirmed it will offer the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to healthy customers in England aged 12 and over from next week, at a cost of \u00a398.95 a jab. Boots is the latest company to capitalise on the decision by manufacturers to sell the vaccinations privately: last month, Pharmadoctor announced it would be offering Covid jabs to eligible customers through partner pharmacies in the UK. While Pharmadoctor notes each pharmacy sets its own prices, it suggests the Pfizer/BioNTech jab will set customers back \u00a375-\u00a385, while the latest Novavax jab will cost about \u00a345-\u00a355. According to Graham Thoms, the chief executive of Pharmadoctor, more than 1,000 patients have already been privately vaccinated using the Pfizer/BioNTech jab, with Novavax jabs expected to begin from 22 April. The announcement by Boots comes as vaccination services gear up for the spring booster campaign, in which people aged 75 years and older, residents in care homes for older people, and people aged six months and over with a weakened immune system will be offered another Covid jab free on the NHS. However, with eligibility for this and previous campaigns limited, most healthy people have not had a booster jab since late 2021, and experts warn their protection will have waned over time. A spokesperson at Boots said: \u201cWe are launching a private Covid-19 vaccination service for people who are not eligible for an NHS vaccination but still want the option to protect themselves from the virus. \u201cOur private service builds on our existing delivery of Covid-19 vaccinations for the NHS and we are pleased we can now offer Covid-19 vaccinations both on behalf of the NHS and privately, as we have done with flu vaccinations for many years.\u201d Boots said it was working hard to make sure the jabs were as affordable as possible, stating that the near-\u00a3100 price tag allowed the company to cover the cost of the vaccine and other operational costs involved in delivering the service. However, the price is several times higher than the cost of a private flu vaccination, which cost \u00a319.95 at Boots last winter. While experts have previously welcomed the move to make Covid jabs available to those not eligible for a booster through the NHS, they have warned high prices could limit their accessibility. Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist at Swansea University, said the cost of the Boots service was likely to be prohibitive for many people. \u201cThe price of the Covid vaccines at \u00a399 is regressive in that it will mean only those wealthy enough to afford it will be able to. Moreover, it is unlikely that even many of those who can afford it will do so at that price point,\u201d he said. Williams noted that expensive vaccines were also a concern given Covid tended to have worse outcomes among lower-income populations. \u201cApart from government subsidisation, one potential way to make [Covid jabs] more affordable is for organisations and employers [to] think about offering boosters, like flu vaccines, to help employees protect their health \u2013 it could ultimately also prove cost-effective if it means less of the workforce lost to sickness, including via long Covid,\u201d he said. Prof Adam Finn of the University of Bristol said the high prices were not a surprise given businesses tended to charge what they thought people would pay, adding that in general costs tended to be held down by competition, which at present may be limited."

            "date": "2024-03-19T14:57:36Z",
            "content": "Brazil\u2019s federal police have accused Jair Bolsonaro of criminal association and falsifying his own Covid-19 vaccination data, marking the first indictment for the embattled far-right leader with others potentially in store. The supreme court on Tuesday released the police\u2019s indictment which alleges Bolsonaro and 16 others inserted false information into the public health database to make it appear as though the former president, his 12-year-old daughter and several others in his circle had received the Covid-19 vaccine. During the pandemic, Bolsonaro was one of the few world leaders railing against the vaccine, openly flouting health restrictions and encouraging society to follow his example. His administration ignored several emails from the pharmaceutical company Pfizer offering to sell Brazil tens of millions of shots in 2020 and openly criticized a move by S\u00e3o Paulo state\u2019s then governor, Jo\u00e3o Doria, to buy vaccines from the Chinese company Sinovac when no jabs were otherwise available. Brazil\u2019s prosecutor-general\u2019s office will have the final say on whether to use the police indictment to file charges against Bolsonaro at the supreme court. It stems from one of several investigations targeting Bolsonaro, who governed between 2019 and 2022. The former president reiterated that he had not taken the Covid-19 vaccine and said he was calm. \u201cIt\u2019s a selective investigation. I\u2019m calm, I don\u2019t owe anything,\u201d Bolsonaro told Reuters. \u201cThe world knows that I didn\u2019t take the vaccine.\u201d Police accuse Bolsonaro and his aides of tampering with the health ministry\u2019s database shortly before he traveled to the US in December 2022, two months after he lost his re-election bid to Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro needed a certificate of vaccination to enter the US, where he remained for the final days of his term and the first months of Lula\u2019s term. If convicted for falsifying health data, the 68-year-old politician could spend up to 12 years behind bars, and as little as two years, according to legal analyst Zilan Costa. The maximum jail time for a charge of criminal association is four years, he said. Bolsonaro retains staunch allegiance among his base, as shown by an outpouring of support last month, with an estimated 185,000 people clogging S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s main boulevard to decry what they \u2013 and the former president \u2013 characterize as political persecution. Brazil\u2019s top electoral court has already ruled Bolsonaro ineligible until 2030, on the grounds that he abused his power during the 2022 campaign and cast unfounded doubts on the country\u2019s electronic voting system. Other investigations include one seeking to determine whether Bolsonaro tried to sneak two sets of expensive diamond jewelry into Brazil and prevent them from being incorporated into the presidency\u2019s public collection. Another relates to his alleged involvement in the 8 January 2023 uprising in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, soon after Lula took power, that resembled the Capitol riot in Washington two years earlier. He has denied wrongdoing in both cases."

            "title": "US sees surge in measles cases as health experts plead for more vaccinations",
            "date": "2024-03-26T12:00:12Z",
            "content": "Measles cases in the US are rising, as major health organizations plead for increased vaccination rates and experts fear the virus will multiply among unvaccinated populations. Most notably, this year\u2019s tally of measles cases has now outpaced last year\u2019s total. On Thursday, there were 64 confirmed cases in 17 states, compared with 58 cases in the entirety of last year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). By Friday, the tally in Chicago grew by two to a total of 17. \u201cMeasles is one of the most contagious diseases known to man,\u201d said Dr David Nguyen, an infectious disease specialist at Rush University Medical Center. Experts say that these incidents could approach the outbreak that spanned 31 states in 2019, when 1,274 patients got sick and 128 were hospitalized in the worst US measles outbreak in decades. Yet the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is extremely effective. Just one dose offers about 93% protection against infection, while the second dose is 97% effective \u2013 and the protection is often lifelong. Treatments, isolation and airborne precautions also stop the spread of the virus. \u201cEvery measles outbreak can be entirely preventable,\u201d said Dr Aniruddha Hazra, associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago. The American Medical Association has issued an appeal to increase vaccination rates, while the CDC released a health advisory urging providers to ensure all travelers, especially children over six months, receive the MMR vaccine. Typically, the first dose of the vaccine is given at one year of age, which means babies are at particular risk in outbreaks. But an extra dose may be given after six months of age if a baby may be exposed to active cases. Most of the cases \u2013 93% by last Monday \u2013 had been linked to international travel and most cases have been among children old enough to be vaccinated, the CDC says. Measles represents a major global threat, with more than 9m cases and about 136,200 deaths from measles, primarily children, in 2022. Last month, there were 10 measles cases in south Florida, most of them linked to an outbreak at an elementary school, and doctors are still on the lookout for cases due to the long incubation period of the virus. The Florida surgeon general, Dr Joseph Ladapo, controversially went against CDC recommendations and allowed unvaccinated children who had been exposed to measles to return to school without quarantining. It\u2019s not clear if Florida officials held vaccination campaigns to bolster immunity in schools. Local school officials declined to comment on this issue. In Chicago, one measles case was reported earlier this month before the virus landed at a shelter for migrants, many of whom did not have access previously to healthcare like vaccines. \u201cMeasles was already here in Chicago, but like any communicable disease, they often migrate to vulnerable communities,\u201d said Hazra. \u201cThe perfect storm is occurring.\u201d About 1,900 people live in close quarters in a former warehouse. In Chicago, more than 11,000 people currently reside in shelters like these, which were hastily converted to house the nearly 37,000 migrants who have arrived in the city since 2022. These individuals were sent on buses and planes by order of Greg Abbott, the Texas governor. Chicago\u2019s health department quickly administered nearly 1,000 MMR vaccines at the affected shelter, and \u201cpeople are lining up to get this vaccine\u201d, Hazra said. The CDC also deployed a team to help with contact tracing and isolation procedures. Hazra noted that \u201cmeasles has a very long incubation period\u201d, meaning \u201ccontact tracing and isolation can be leveraged\u201d more \u201csuccessfully with this disease than we were able to do with Covid-19\u201d. Ninety per cent of unvaccinated people will become infected if they are exposed to measles. The virus can linger in the air for hours and infect people who never come into direct contact with a patient. Each patient can infect an average of 12 to 18 other people if the community is not protected by vaccines. Typically, at least one in five unvaccinated measles patients need to be hospitalized, and nearly one-fifth of children develop pneumonia. One in 600 babies who are not yet eligible for vaccines suffer from a fatal neurological complication, and about one in 1,000 children develop encephalitis, or brain swelling, which can lead to convulsions, deafness and intellectual disabilities. Measles can also cause immune amnesia, making people more vulnerable to other infections in the months and years following a case. \u201cIn 2000, we declared measles eliminated in the US,\u201d Nguyen said. As the sparks of cases threaten to erupt into sustained outbreaks among unvaccinated communities, that status may be \u201cunder threat\u201d, he said. \u201cWe need a lot of people to be vaccinated and immune in the population for it to stop spreading,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not vaccinated, you should get vaccinated.\u201d As of 2021, 91.6% of children over the age of two had received at least one MMR vaccine. But the share of kindergarteners protected by vaccines fell from 95.2% in the 2019-20 school year to 93.1% in 2022-23. In outbreaks like the one seen in 2019, the virus can find a niche of unvaccinated people in a community and spread like wildfire. \u201cThese numbers will continue to rise, year to year, as we see erosion in vaccine confidence,\u201d said Hazra. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just going to stop at measles, but also other vaccine-preventable illnesses that we have been close to eradicating in this country for the past decades.\u201d"

            "content": "Senior Tories are braced for a catastrophic set of local elections that will see a collapse in council seats won at the peak of the \u201cvaccine bounce\u201d enjoyed by Boris Johnson. Rishi Sunak\u2019s allies regard the results as the most dangerous moment remaining for the prime minister before the general election. While many of Sunak\u2019s Tory critics have little appetite for removing him, some said they were asking themselves: \u201cWhat is there to lose?\u201d after a pre-election budget that has failed to increase Conservative support. Sunak, under pressure to explain how he would pay for his pledge to abolish national insurance contributions by the end of the next parliament, has expanded on the measures in the budget by announcing that he is preparing a new benefits squeeze to fund it. Thousands of council seats across England will be up for grabs this May, with most of them last returning councillors in 2021. At that point, Johnson\u2019s government was enjoying a boost in popularity as a result of the Covid vaccine rollout, while Keir Starmer was on the verge of resigning after losing the Hartlepool byelection. On the morning after the results, one newspaper front page said Johnson was now eyeing a \u201cdecade in power\u201d. According to an Opinium poll for the Observer, the Tory share of the vote has fallen from 42% then to 25% today. The poll slump means that May\u2019s results are likely to be dire for the Tories, with some experts predicting the party could lose as many as half of its councillors up for re-election. Party officials accept that the results will probably be bleak but are already pouring all their efforts into a push for a general election most likely to be held in the autumn. \u201cNo one\u2019s disputing it\u2019s going to be difficult,\u201d said one senior source. \u201cBut it\u2019s still going to be the second-most important set of elections this year.\u201d In England, there will be seats up for grabs in more than 100 councils. There will also be elections for regional mayors and the London assembly. Andy Street, the Conservative West Midlands mayor, and Ben Houchen, the Conservative Tees Valley mayor, are among those facing re-election. Both became symbols of the \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda initially espoused by Johnson. Sam Freedman, a former senior adviser to Michael Gove and now a senior fellow at the Institute for Government, said: \u201cBased on the expected swing from 2021, you\u2019d expect [the Conservatives] to lose somewhere in the region of half their councillors and most of their remaining councils.\u201d While there is widespread acceptance that the results will be punishing, opinions within the party are split over any risk to Sunak\u2019s position. One former cabinet minister said the threat to Sunak was being underestimated. \u201cIt\u2019s clear the budget has had no traction at all,\u201d he said. \u201cA number of colleagues are pretty incandescent. The point they make is: what is there to lose? Frankly, it couldn\u2019t get any worse than this.\u201d However, even critics of Sunak said that most MPs were too demoralised to attempt to replace the leader. \u201cIf Boris was around, Rishi would have already gone \u2013 but as nobody else is obvious who can solve things, people are sticking with what we\u2019ve got and praying,\u201d said a former minister. \u201cEveryone from MPs to members seems to have given up.\u201d Sunak\u2019s allies have been monitoring the party mood and are confident he will be in place to fight the general election. \u201cSpeaking to MPs, even the ones who are not fans of Rishi on the back benches \u2013 or were Boris people \u2013 most of those kinds of people have come round to the fact that it would be crazy to try to do anything and that the guy\u2019s going to lead us into the election,\u201d said one. \u201cThey may or may not love it, but they still want to win. I think the clock\u2019s run down on anything like [removing him].\u201d"

            "content": "All school leaders should receive suicide prevention training to help tackle a \u201cmental health emergency\u201d among teachers, under a plan unanimously backed by a vote by union members. A workforce survey of members of the NASUWT teaching union found that some teachers had been driven to the point of suicide by the stress of the job. Among 12,000 responses, 23% reported drinking more alcohol, 12% the use of or increased use of antidepressants, and 3% said they had self-harmed as a result of their work. The results and emotional testimony from delegates about colleagues who had taken their own lives or planned to do so prompted members to back a suicide prevention strategy for teachers at the union\u2019s annual conference in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, on Sunday. It urged the union\u2019s executive to campaign for staff trained in mental health first aid in all schools and colleges, and fully funded mandatory mental health training. The primary school headteacher Ruth Perry killed herself while awaiting the outcome of an Ofsted report. There have been reports of at least eight other teacher suicides linked to Ofsted reports. The proposer of the motion, Row Martin, listed a number of teachers who had taken their own lives in recent years, including Perry. \u201cWe cannot afford to lose any more teachers,\u201d she said. Delegate Kuldip Hoonjan from Leicestershire told the conference that two of her teacher friends had taken their lives. The unanimously carried motion warned of a \u201crise in suicide, suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts\u201d among teachers, and said the union was concerned the number \u201cwill only increase\u201d. One teacher from Fife told the conference she had had suicidal thoughts after starting at a school with challenging pupil behaviour. \u201cI\u2019ve been in a very dark place in these last few months, to the point where I have repeatedly thought of suicide,\u201d she said. \u201cI have also thought about leaving a career of 20 years.\u201d Delegate Karen Brocklebank said the \u201cstresses of rigorous classroom inspections, government targets, unmanageable amounts of paperwork and 50-hour-plus working weeks\u201d had caused an increase in suicide rates and serious mental health problems among school staff. Another delegate, Claire Ward, spoke of a colleague who had confided in her that they planned to kill themselves. \u201cI was shaking,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of anything other than what had happened for days.

            "date": "2024-03-23T16:00:26Z",
            "content": "Teenage boys were hit hardest by the Covid lockdowns, with their mental health failing to recover despite the return to normality, according to the most comprehensive academic study of its kind. Early research into how lockdown affected children indicated that girls had suffered more significant mental health problems than boys. However, a new study carried out by academics from three UK universities, published in the journal European Child + Adolescent Psychiatry, found that over the long term, teenage boys\u2019 mental health was more adversely affected. The research followed a cohort of about 200 children, aged between 11 and 14 at the time, asking them and their mothers to assess their mental state. It logged data from each child before lockdown, three months after the measures started and again at 15 months into the pandemic. Researchers then compared this data with historical records that show the usual pattern of mental wellbeing for boys and girls during adolescence. The academics found that while both sexes had an immediate decline in their mental health, boys then did not experience the natural improvement in mental wellbeing that usually comes with maturation as they move through the teenage years. Dr Nicky Wright, a lecturer in psychology at Manchester Metropolitan University and a co-author of the paper, said: \u201cThe key message of this is that we expect more boys to be at risk of mental health problems now than we would before [the pandemic]. \u201cGirls, on average, are more likely to suffer with mental health problems than boys. But the girls in the study followed their usual pattern, suggesting the experience of lockdown had a more significant impact on boys than girls. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a pandemic effect on girls\u2019 depression. When you account for puberty and development, it\u2019s consistent with previous trends,\u201d said Wright. This weekend marks four years since the first UK lockdown was called on 23 March 2020. Schools were closed, leaving teenagers who were used to spending at least six hours a day surrounded by peers isolated from society. Work set by teachers for home schooling took an average of between two and three hours a day for most adolescents to complete, and with many parents working, lots of teenagers were left alone for long periods of time. For those who were moving between primary and secondary school during the pandemic years, lockdowns also disrupted integration into new social groups and the chance to form friendships. For older teenagers, universities and colleges switched to virtual lectures and seminars, leaving new students unable to form bonds with others. The psychologist and writer Wendy Gregory said the findings of the study echoed changes to her client list in her private practice. \u201cLockdown has had a horrific impact on mental health, particularly in boys and young men, and partly I\u2019m seeing the results of this now as I\u2019m getting a lot more seeking therapy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has been a big upturn in males seeking mental health support generally across the age ranges, and for teen boys there has been a huge uptick.\u201d In south London, Dr Jen Wills Lamacq, a child psychologist who works in state schools, said she has seen the pandemic effect on boys\u2019 mental health first-hand, including increased difficult behaviour. She believes the decline in young male mental health was triggered by the rupture to their lives at a crucial point in adolescent development. \u201cLots of boys, to regulate their emotions, may want to be outside, doing something active and around other people, without necessarily talking. For long periods of time, they were deprived of opportunities to regulate their mental wellbeing in a way that comes naturally to them,\u201d she said. For parents of teenage boys and young men, the findings may come as little surprise. Single mother Rebecca*, from London, says her teenage son, who was already receiving counselling before the pandemic, had a breakdown during lockdown that resulted in him becoming violent and police being called to restrain him. \u201cHe was doing his GCSEs and when lockdown happened at first it was a huge relief because he didn\u2019t have to go into school, as that was a trigger for anxiety, but losing that routine was awful and he had a breakdown. He had a psychotic episode where he was hearing voices. The police came and were very hard with him, and they put him in handcuffs in front of me,\u201d she said. Rebecca\u2019s son is now an adult and his health has improved from that crisis point, but she says lockdown has had a lasting impact on his mental wellbeing. \u201cI think it was dreadful. I think there will be repercussions for years to come for all kids,\u201d she said."

            "content": "Bereaved relatives have accused ministers of dragging their feet over an inquiry into the death of almost 2,000 patients across NHS mental health trusts in Essex. The inquiry has still not started more than eight months after the announcement that it would be relaunched with beefed-up powers. In June last year, the government gave in to pressure from families and the then chair of the inquiry, granting it legal powers to compel witnesses to give evidence. In December, the new terms of reference were sent to ministers, setting out what the inquiry will investigate. But the terms of reference have yet to be approved by ministers, leaving relatives frustrated, with another \u201cunnecessary\u201d death reported a few weeks ago. Melanie Leahy, whose son, Matthew, died at the Linden Centre in Chelmsford in 2012, said: \u201cI know that this inquiry, the first of its kind nationally, if carried out in a timely and comprehensively investigative manner, it has the power to prevent more deaths, not just in Essex but all over the UK. \u201cWhy am I and all the other bereaved families and injured individuals still waiting? Worse, why are we being met with such callous and terrifying indifference? Why are our legal team being ignored? We can only conclude that our government simply does not care. If the government continues to drag its feet in this way then they must be held to account for their failings. If there are more deaths during this interminable wait, this government needs to be held responsible.\u201d The inquiry initially launched on a non-statutory basis in January 2021 to investigate deaths at the Essex partnership university NHS trust and its predecessors between 2000 and 2020. It was established after a 2019 investigation by the parliamentary and health service ombudsman that found numerous failings in the events surrounding the deaths of Matthew Leahy, 20, and another young man named only as Mr R. Priya Singh, a medical negligence senior associate at Hodge Jones &amp; Allen, which is representing scores of families, called the delay \u201cshocking\u201d, saying: \u201cThe terms of reference are still waiting to be finalised by the government. Why? \u201cWhilst waiting for meaningful progress, yet another unnecessary death occurred a few weeks ago of a loved one whist under the care of Essex partnership university NHS foundation trust.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson expressed sympathies to the bereaved families and said it took the investigation extremely seriously.

NSFT\u2019s crisis team was repeatedly warned of this \u201ccountdown\u201d by his sister, Dr Katie Sidle, a consultant neurologist, as she pleaded with staff to allow her brother to be admitted to hospital. But her concerns were ignored, the inquest heard. Norfolk\u2019s senior coroner, Jacqueline Lake, highlighted a series of \u201cmissed opportunities\u201d, \u201cinadequate assessments\u201d and a lack of mental health beds in the weeks leading up to his death. Lake ruled out suicide and death by misadventure as the state of Sidle\u2019s mind was not revealed by the evidence. He died from head injuries in hospital on 4 July. Following the verdict, Sidle\u2019s family backed calls for a public inquiry into a series of failures at the trust, including its inability to account for 8,440 \u201cunexpected\u201d deaths among its patients or those it recently cared for between 2019 and 2022. The last psychiatrist who assessed Sidle, Dr Vassiliki Papachronopoulou, also warned a trust manager she was \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about the trust\u2019s refusal to admit Sidle. But this warning also went unheeded, the inquest heard. On 29 June, Sidle was refused a hospital bed based on the assessment of a newly qualified mental health nurse, acting without supervision for the first time, the inquest heard. The court was read a transcript of a call on Thursday 29 July between Katie Sidle, who specialises in conditions that often present as psychosis, and the nurse, in which she relayed that her brother was \u201cacutely psychotic\u201d, had a history of masking his symptoms, and had told her that morning he now only \u201ctwo days left to live\u201d. She told the nurse: \u201cSunday [1 July] will be day zero, I\u2019ve no idea what he will do but I\u2019m worried it will be pretty catastrophic.\u201d But the nurse insisted Sidle was \u201cnot psychotic\u201d and refused to reassess him for a crisis mental health bed. Summing up the inquest, Lake noted that the assessment was carried without input from others in mental health team and without Sidle\u2019s notes being read. Lake said: \u201cThe assessment was inadequate and was a further missed opportunity to provide appropriate inpatient care to Christopher which more than minimally contributed to his death.\u201d Lake also highlighted other \u201cmissed opportunities\u201d including emails between teams not being acted upon and a previous \u201cinadequate\u201d assessment of Sidle on 19 May by another nurse who refused to provide hospital care. During this assessment \u201cpsychotic markers were underestimated and/or missed\u201d, Lake said. On the morning of the fatal incident, Katie Sidle again tried to find a hospital bed for her brother. She was told 28 patients were awaiting an acute mental health bed at the time, her evidence submitted to the inquest said. Lake confirmed that she would be publishing two prevention of future deaths reports in the coming weeks. One will address the trusts failings. Lake said: \u201cTraining clearly needs to go further. I\u2019m also not convinced that action has been taken to ensure that all emails are picked up promptly and passed to the relevant person.\u201d The other report will be sent to health secretary expressing Lake\u2019s \u201cconcerns\u201d about the lack of mental health beds. A family statement, issued through their lawyers, Ashtons Legal, said: \u201cWe do not hold the individual clinicians involved in Chris\u2019s care personally accountable for his death \u2013 from our perspective, they too are victims of a failing and dangerous system. We know that Chris would echo this opinion. \u201cChris\u2019s death was entirely avoidable. We expect the trust to take the coroner\u2019s findings seriously. It must follow through with its action plan to address the failings that have been identified. \u201cUntil this trust\u2019s systemic, longstanding failures are remedied \u2013 which it has failed to do despite having been in and out of special measures for nearly a decade \u2013 there will be further avoidable deaths and families left wondering why previous warnings were not heeded.\u201d \u201cThere have been calls for a public inquiry into the quality and delivery of mental health services carried out by NSFT, and we as a family support those calls.\u201d Cath Byford, the NSFT deputy chief executive, said: \u201cWe have taken action to improve as a trust following Christopher\u2019s sad death. This includes amending our crisis triage tool to collect more detailed information and improved staff training. We have also implemented a \u2018Think Family\u2019quality improvement project to capture family and carer knowledge in relation to patient history. This will help us to engage and work with service users, their families, and carers to make the best care decisions to support our patients and identify when further support or intervention is needed.\u201d \u201cWe will act on all concerns raised by the coroner and work to ensure further learning and improvements are embedded.\u201d In the UK, the charity Mind is available on 0300 123 3393.

            "content": "Ministers should order police forces in England to keep attending mental health calls until more funding is in place for the NHS to plug the gap or risk further deaths, a charity is urging. Rethink Mental Illness has written to the home and health secretaries asking them to immediately pause the right-care-right-person scheme, which allows police forces to step back from responding to mental health callouts, after \u201ca series of tragic deaths\u201d associated with the change. The goal of the scheme is to stop officers being diverted from dealing with crime to do work for which health staff are better trained, yet Rethink says that health and social care services need an additional \u00a3260m in funding to plug the gap left by the police, as well as clear lines of oversight and accountability. Mark Winstanley, the chief executive of Rethink Mental Illness, said: \u201cA mental health crisis is an emergency, and plans drawn up on paper have to work effectively in someone\u2019s hour of need. Every second counts in a mental health crisis, and so it\u2019s vital that the process works smoothly and that the most appropriate, trained professional can be quickly on the scene to reduce any risk to life. \u201cWe\u2019re all in agreement that in most cases, the police are not the best agency to support people in severe mental distress. And we believe the Right Care, Right Person scheme has a future, provided it is rolled out carefully. \u201cBut monitoring the initial impact, we\u2019re growing increasingly concerned that forces have stepped back too quickly, without the proper checks and balances in place alongside the resources needed to plug the gap.\u201d Rethink, which works with sufferers of severe mental illness, is hearing concerns anecdotally from the people it supports about how calls are assessed and the varied rates and quality of local implementation. This month Norfolk police suspended the launch of the scheme following the deaths of four family members. Ambulance chiefs recently issued a warning that patients and paramedics have come to harm, while coroners have cited the scheme in prevention of future deaths reports. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe Right Care, Right Person approach ensures that people who have health or social care needs are responded to by the right person, with the right skills, training, and experience to meet their needs. When a crime needs to be investigated or there is a need to protect people from a real and immediate risk of harm, police officers will continue to attend. \u201cPolice forces are working closely with local health and social care partners to ensure that this new approach is rolled out when it is safe to do so. Forces are also supported by a dedicated team from the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council and a comprehensive guidance toolkit.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-01T14:26:23Z",
            "content": "The past 14 years have been a white-knuckle ride for the British economy. Record low interest rates, money creation from the Bank of England on an industrial scale, Brexit, millions of workers furloughed during the pandemic, the biggest fall in output in at least a century \u2013 all that, and a record number of people inactive through long-term ill health. Boring it hasn\u2019t been. At the end of it all, there is a sense of deja vu as Jeremy Hunt puts the finishing touches to next week\u2019s budget. When Liam Byrne departed the Treasury in 2010 he left a note \u2013 meant as a joke \u2013 for his successor as chief secretary, which said: \u201cI\u2019m afraid there is no money.\u201d After almost a decade and a half of economic underperformance, Byrne\u2019s words have come back to haunt the Tories. Under pressure from Rishi Sunak to deliver pre-election tax cuts, the chancellor is scrabbling around for cash to fund the much-anticipated giveaways. The economy is officially in recession and money is tight. Opinion polls suggest the Conservatives are heading for a polling-day pummelling when the election is held, and the state of the economy is the principal cause of voter discontent. Gordon Brown, Byrne\u2019s old boss and the last Labour prime minister, says it should come as no surprise that the electorate is unhappy. \u201cIn 2010, I predicted a decade of austerity when we left office. We have actually had a decade and a half of austerity.\u201d Brown says that what motivated the Conservatives in 2010 was the idea of a small state, to be achieved through austerity and debt reduction. But austerity did not work. Slow growth meant deficit targets were missed and the public finances suffered from a chronic malaise. Productivity growth in the past 14 years had been the weakest since the Industrial Revolution, the former prime minister says. \u201cWe no longer have stop-go, we have different levels of stop, with crisis after crisis. \u201cBritain is a low-growth, low-productivity, low-investment, low-wage economy. And that means higher levels of poverty, destitution and inequality. We are entering a doom loop,\u201d Brown says. Hunt\u2019s case is that since 2010 the UK has grown faster than Spain, Italy, France, Germany or Japan, and that after hitting a 40-year high of 11.1% in October 2022, inflation is coming down fast. Last year\u2019s autumn statement included 110 measures designed to boost growth. Economists say George Osborne blundered when he imposed severe austerity measures on a still-fragile economy Voters may take some convincing that the Conservatives can again be trusted to run the economy. Living standards for workers are on course to be lower at the end of this parliament than when it started in 2019. Real average wages \u2013 pay adjusted for inflation \u2013 are no higher today than they were 16 years ago. What is more, after 14 years the Conservatives can no longer blame their difficulties on their legacy from Labour. Over the past 45 years, parties have enjoyed long interrupted periods in office: 18 years for the Tories between 1979 and 1997; 13 years for Labour from 1997 to 2010; 14 years for the Conservatives since then. After that length of time, governments are judged on their own record, and the one Hunt is defending is markedly worse than the one the Conservatives could boast of in 1997. Back then, growth was much stronger, debt was much lower, and the balance of payments was in surplus. Similarly, in 2010 the economy seemed to be slowly on the mend after the shock caused by the near-collapse of the global banking system two years earlier. Economists say George Osborne \u2013 David Cameron\u2019s chancellor \u2013 blundered when he imposed severe austerity measures on a still-fragile economy. Gerard Lyons, economic adviser to Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London and now chief economic strategist at Net Wealth says: \u201cThe whole period after 2010 was one of major fiscal mistakes. Austerity was wrong and badly executed. The ability to borrow cheaply was staring at us as a huge opportunity but was never taken.\u201d Lyons is also critical of the Bank of England for keeping interest rates low for so long. The official cost of borrowing was cut to 0.5 % in March 2009 and remained below 1% for the subsequent 13 years. \u201cCheap money was an absolute disaster. It led to asset price inflation, greater inequality, zombie companies and inflation.\u201d Lyons says the past 14 years have widened the UK\u2019s divisions, and not just those between north and south. \u201cIt is London versus the rest of the country, cities versus rural places, coastal communities versus those inland, homeowners versus renters, the old versus the young and the skilled versus the unskilled.\u201d Although politically dominated by one party, the period since May 2010 divides neatly into three distinct periods: the austerity years at the start; the Brexit years in the middle; and the pandemic years at the end. Jagjit Chadha, director of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research thinktank, says there is a thread running throughout. \u201cThe supply side of the economy has been very badly managed after the financial crisis and has suffered because of the way Brexit was brought about. That meant we were unable to cope with Covid and the cost of living crisis in the way we might have done. The economy was made riskier just as the global economy became riskier. \u201cWealth and income inequalities have expanded. There has been the growth of the working poor, who need state support. That has led to a structural budget deficit and a continual squeeze on public investment that has further weakened the economy\u2019s supply side. Things have come together that have not been tackled by our political masters.\u201d Lyons supported Brexit and remains convinced that it will be positive for the economy if the opportunities are seized. Even so, he says the three and a half years between the referendum in June 2016 and the December 2019 general election \u2013 when it was unclear on what terms the UK would leave the EU, if it all \u2013 created political instability that depressed investment. Within months of Brexit being finalised, the economy was in the grip of the pandemic. All of which has left the sense of a country stumbling from one crisis to another, and never getting to grips with underlying structural problems that have been evident for decades. Back in 2003, Mervyn King, then governor of the Bank of England, said the economy had enjoyed a NICE \u2013 non-inflationary, consistently expansionary decade \u2013 in which Lady Luck had smiled on the UK. That ceased to be the case five years later when the UK was one of the countries worst affected by the global financial crisis, and it has never really recovered in the 16 years since. Pre-2008 the economy doubled in size every 32 years. The Office for Budget Responsibility now says it will take 40-45 years for that to happen, and on current trends even that looks optimistic. The one positive surprise is that despite everything that has been chucked at the economy, unemployment has remained low. Rachel Reeves, Hunt\u2019s Labour shadow, says the party that wins the next election will have the direst inheritance of an incoming government since the second world war. The chancellor would disagree with that assessment. Voters might not."

            "date": "2024-03-02T06:00:23Z",
            "content": "Jeremy Hunt will attempt to use next week\u2019s budget to reboot the Conservatives\u2019 flatlining performance in the opinion polls before the next general election, with the chancellor widely expected to announce sweeping tax cuts. But while Rishi Sunak will be hoping his chancellor delivers a near-term bounce from crowd-pleasing giveaways, his government is facing growing pressure over the Tories\u2019 management of the economy over the past 14 years. Here are 10 charts outlining the Conservatives\u2019 record since 2010. The deficit \u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this. I\u2019ll cut the deficit, not the NHS,\u201d read David Cameron\u2019s famous campaign poster before the 2010 general election. After the 2008 global financial crisis cratered Britain\u2019s economy, inflicting the largest government deficit of the postwar era (before the Covid pandemic), the Tories came to power pledging to mend the public finances. Under George Osborne in No 11 this included austerity in the public sector and benefit cuts. Sunak is also promising to cut the national debt. But the Tories never eliminated the deficit, and the national debt (the sum of every annual shortfall) has steadily risen from 64.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010 to 96.5% currently \u2013 the highest level since the 1960s. The NHS NHS waiting lists have soared since the Covid pandemic \u2013 but were already rising sharply before the health emergency amid workforce shortages and underinvestment in infrastructure. NHS funding has risen in every year in real terms since 2010, as a ringfenced commitment under the Tories. However, it has increased by far less than the long-term historical average, while a growing and ageing population has added to pressures. Sunak has committed to cutting NHS waiting lists. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates they will be falling come the election but will not hit pre-Covid levels until at least 2030. Economic growth \u201cLong-term economic plan\u201d was a favourite soundbite of the Osborne era. But Britain\u2019s economy has suffered historically weak growth over the past 14 years, after a slow recovery from the 2008 crash; then shocks including Brexit, the Covid pandemic and the cost of living crisis. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimates the UK\u2019s trend annual growth rate has fallen from 3.4% a year in the postwar period up to 1973, to 2.3% up to the 2008 financial crisis, to just 1.2% in the years since. Underinvestment Britain historically lags other advanced countries for public and private investment in the economy. However, the UK has fallen further behind since 2010 amid the impact from austerity, Brexit uncertainty and the political drama of five prime ministers in eight years. The IPPR thinktank estimates the UK has underinvested to the tune of half a trillion pounds, or 30 Elizabeth lines. Most visible in crumbling schools, hospitals and infrastructure, it argues this lack of investment is behind key reasons for lacklustre productivity gains \u2013 a key driver of economic growth. Global Britain? The narrow Brexit vote in 2016 triggered lasting economic upheaval, including tougher trade barriers with the UK\u2019s largest trading partner. The UK economy has notably underperformed other advanced countries since, with real GDP per capita barely above pre-Covid levels, at 4% above the mid-2016 level, compared with 8% in the eurozone and 15% for the US. Rather than an explosion in global trade after Brexit, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates total goods trade volumes have underperformed by about 15% compared with other economies, and relative to staying in the EU. Record increase in taxation Rising debt interest and growing demand on services from an ageing population have pushed up government spending. But sluggish economic growth has meant weak tax income for the exchequer. In response, Sunak has increased taxes, largely by stealth, to put revenues as a share of the economy on track to hit the highest level since the second world war. Sunak launched a freeze on income tax and increased corporation tax during his time as chancellor. Even after tax cuts in last year\u2019s autumn statement, and any expected cuts in next week\u2019s budget, taxes are still expected to be higher as a share of national income than when the Conservatives came to power in 2010. Flatlining wage growth A weak economy has left workers paying the price. Real wages had grown by an average of 33% a decade from 1970 to 2007, but this fell to below zero in the 2010s. In mid-2023, average pay was back at the level during the 2008 financial crisis, after taking account of inflation. This 15 years of lost wage growth is estimated by the Resolution Foundation thinktank to have cost the average work \u00a310,700 a year. The performance has been ranked as the worst period for pay growth since the Napoleonic wars ended in 1815. Food bank usage has spiralled Poverty has deepened over the past 14 years, leading to an explosion in food bank usage. From fewer than 100,000 in 2010, the number of emergency food parcels from the Trussell Trust has soared to almost 3m a year. Deep cuts to benefits and rising living costs have outweighed gains from large minimum wage increases for the lowest-income households. These cuts have reduced the incomes of poorest fifth by just under \u00a33,000 a year, according to the Resolution Foundation. This laid the ground for a deeper cost of living crisis as inflation soared after the pandemic and Russian war in Ukraine to the highest level in 41 years. Unemployment has remained low An economic bright spot since 2010 has been consistently low unemployment, matching among the lowest levels on records dating to the 1970s. The official jobless rate has fallen from about 8% in 2010 to less than 4%, with a damaging rise prevented during the Covid pandemic by the government\u2019s furlough scheme. However, the official figures obscure consistently high economic inactivity \u2013 when working-age adults are neither in a job nor looking for one. This includes a sharp increase in the number of people outside the labour market due to long-term sickness to a record high of 2.8 million. Migration has increased sharply Net immigration to the UK has surged despite Brexit and repeated government promises to reduce it. David Cameron said in early 2010 that if he won the election, he would limit net immigration to \u201ctens of thousands\u201d per year. Net immigration reached a record 745,000 in 2022. The UK population is projected to hit 70 million by mid-2026, a decade earlier than expected. Without growth in the population, and with it the UK workforce, Britain\u2019s economy would have grown at a slower pace. Official figures show GDP per head has remained stagnant or fallen for seven quarters up to the end of 2023 \u2013 the worst performance since modern records began in 1955."

            "content": "The minimum wage has driven up the pay of millions of Britain\u2019s lowest earners by \u00a36,000 a year, making it the single most successful economic policy in a generation, according to a leading thinktank. Since its introduction in 1999 by Tony Blair\u2019s first Labour administration the policy has secured cross-party agreement, and should be seen as the basis for further improvements in the welfare of low wage workers, the Resolution Foundation said. The minimum wage will increase on Monday 1 April as it rises from \u00a310.42 to \u00a311.44, in the third-highest annual change in its history \u2013 a rise of 9.8% in cash terms and 7.8% above inflation. In a study released to mark 25 years since the policy\u2019s introduction, the foundation said workers would have been \u00a36,000 a year worse off since 1999 if their pay had only risen in line with average wages rather than the increases recommended by the independent Low Pay Commission. Nye Cominetti, principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, said parliament should use a review of the commission\u2019s remit \u201cto discuss the future of the minimum wage and low pay more widely ahead of the election\u201d. He said: \u201cPoliticians should reflect on why the minimum wage has been so successful \u2013 such as the combination of long-term political direction and independent, expert-led oversight \u2013 and whether this approach could be broadened to tackle some of the UK\u2019s other low pay challenges.\u201d The foundation said MPs should consider how the level of statutory sick pay had fallen in relation to average wages and could be brought under the umbrella of the commission. Some critics of the minimum wage have argued it is too high while others believe it has not risen fast enough to reduce poverty in the UK. The Living Wage Foundation charity operates the real living wage, which sets a minimum \u00a312 an hour wage across the UK and \u00a313.15 in London. It is aimed at UK workers aged 18 and over but it is not a legal requirement, and businesses choose whether to pay it. The charity says more than 460,000 employees working for 14,000 firms currently receive the real living wage. A report by the International Monetary Fund on the effect of minimum wages across developed and developing countries found that \u201cresearch spanning several decades has not settled the debate\u201d. It said that some studies found a minimum wage had significant benefits for workers while \u201cothers conclude that it is harmful. Many studies have been inconclusive\u201d. The Resolution Foundation said analysis of the UK showed that between 1980 and 1998, hourly pay growth in the UK was twice as fast for the highest earners as it was for the lowest earners \u2013 3.1% versus 1.4% a year. \u201cBut since 1999 this trend has reversed, and hourly pay inequality has fallen with pay growth for the lowest earners five times that seen by the highest earners \u2013 1.6% versus 0.3 per cent per year,\u201d it said."

Some sleep on the floor, while the more fortunate are in hammocks. The children\u2019s stomachs are swollen, the effect of parasites, and their skin is covered in rashes. Warao people are crowded into a makeshift building in the Cidade de Deus slum The second-largest Indigenous community in Venezuela, with about 41,000 members, the Warao are increasingly making the dangerous trek to neighbouring Brazil, fleeing famine and their own country\u2019s economic and political crisis. Since the early 2010s, Venezuela has experienced economic, social and humanitarian turmoil, causing many residents to leave for neighbouring countries. More than 6 million people \u2013 more than 20% of the population \u2013 have fled, one of the largest exoduses in Latin America ever. The Warao people are no exception. About 7,000 Indigenous Venezuelans have entered Brazil since 2014, amid more than 560,000 Venezuelans, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Far from the lush forests of north-eastern Venezuela and southern Guyana, where they once lived a traditional lifestyle, the Warao \u2013 whose name means \u201cboat people\u201d \u2013 now survive on one meal a day. Often, it\u2019s a meagre portion of fish and rice. \u201cFor the rest of the day, the children\u2019s stomachs are soothed with sugar water,\u201d says a distraught mother.

She used to work with traditional handicrafts but now she doesn\u2019t have the money for the material Like many people in the shelter, Paulito Garc\u00eda, 49, left the Orinoco delta in north-eastern Venezuela to come to Manaus. This river labyrinth covers 25,000 sq km and includes more than 300 canals. He remembers the banana plants, sugar cane and cassava he grew there. \u201cI fished, I sold fish, I planted for our consumption and sale, and the women sold handicrafts,\u201d he says. \u201cNature gave us everything.\u201d In Mariusa, his local village, Garc\u00eda was a \u201ccacique\u201d, a village chief. Despite this responsibility, he left his community in 2017 for better opportunities as medical supplies dried up in a national healthcare crisis. \u201cWe had no more fuel for our boats that we used every day, even for fishing or going to the hospital, no more access to anything,\u201d he says. The Indigenous Venezuelans live in a poor and dangerous part of Manaus He travelled hundreds of miles by boat, and bus, and on foot, first reaching Pacaraima in Brazil, then arriving in Manaus months later. Now he shares a 5 sq metre room with his wife and six children. \u201cIn my community, we saw children dying from diarrhoea and fever, and it was impossible to find an aspirin. We felt too vulnerable staying there,\u201d he says. The other Warao continue to call him \u201cthe cacique\u201d as a sign of respect. When Venezuelan migration began, the Brazilian government built shelters and adopted legislative measures to promote the integration of Indigenous communities. The constitutional protection reserved for Indigenous Brazilians now apply to Indigenous people from all countries. The Waraos are, therefore, legal refugees in Brazil. But most of the Warao have no permanent job in Brazil. Some men unload fishing boats and get a few fish in exchange, but most speak only a few words of Portuguese; hardly any have studied. To pay their rent, they are reduced to begging. \u201cAt first, institutions and associations came to help us, such as ACNUR [UNHCR], but then our situation ceased to be considered an emergency,\u201d says Garc\u00eda. This community\u2019s dream is to obtain land to farm in Brazil. Wilmer Mart\u00ednez, 33, also from Mariusa village, lives in the room next door. He decided to travel to Manaus in 2022. He brought his own four children, as well as a newborn belonging to another family from his community, who had tried to give him away three times because of the economic situation. Nearby, Mauco, two, has a swollen stomach and is vomiting. The adopted child needs anti-parasite treatment that is too expensive for the Mart\u00ednez family. \u201cWe\u2019ve been abandoned here,\u201d Mart\u00ednez says. The Warao people believe that everything in nature has a spirit, but the children see little of the natural world now Fish are grilled on the shelter\u2019s rooftop. The house is overcrowded with people who have little or no source of income Warao communities dot the Amazonas region. About 800 Indigenous Venezuelans live in Manaus, mostly in the Cidade de Deus slum. Daisy P\u00e9rez, 42, has never seen such miserable conditions and has been going door to door for help with no luck. She is one of the few members of her Warao community to have completed higher education, and migrated to Brazil in 2017. The former teacher has a good command of Spanish and is proficient in Portuguese, making her the de facto representative of the Warao group. Like some of the Warao refugees in Brazil, P\u00e9rez had already moved within Venezuela, first going to Caracas in 2009 to seek treatment for her mother\u2019s cancer. A young girl in the street outside the shelter Multiple migrations are common for the Warao. These groups were first displaced in the 1960s to make room for hydrologic projects that diverted their water supply. Epidemics such as cholera, malaria and measles began to appear around the same time, forcing some people to leave their villages. However, the current economic crisis, which caused Venezuela\u2019s economy to contract and the inflation rate to increase to more than 63,000% in 2018, caused the most recent wave of Warao migration in search of better economic opportunities. Far away from their homes, the Warao remain attached to their traditions. Whenever possible, P\u00e9rez travels to the nearby mountains to pick moriche, a palm fruit symbolising the tree of life in Warao culture. This fruit is eaten, and its trunk and leaves are used to build canoes, palm houses and baskets, which women sell. Daisy P\u00e9rez (right) is a teacher who moved to Manaus in 2017. She volunteers to help other Warao people improve their standard of living Like many, P\u00e9rez left Venezuela due to the healthcare crisis. Her niece suffered from respiratory failure and could not be treated due to the lack of hospital beds in Caracas. \u201cI told myself that staying there meant not fighting for my children\u2019s future,\u201d says the mother of four. \u201cIt was either leave or wait to see our children starve. Any place was better than Venezuela at that moment.\u201d P\u00e9rez travelled by canoe from her village to the capital of Delta Amacuro, Tucupita. She then completed the journey to Boa Vista, Brazil, by bus and on foot. Hearing that Manaus had shelters for the Warao, she ended up there, along with her sisters and parents. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see myself leaving my parents there with nothing, alone, without being able to help them,\u201d says P\u00e9rez. Like her parents, many older community members have joined their families in Manaus. Pilar, 77, proudly wears her nagua (a traditional dress) as she makes a wicker basket at the Cidade de Deus in the room she rents. Her whole life has been one of displacement: she fled her village with her parents due to flooding, and her community was hit by a wave of cholera in 1994 that forced her to move again. In 2016, she made her way to Brazil to join her daughters. Pilar, 77, has been displaced her whole life \u201cI\u2019ll be a Warao until I die, even if I have to migrate again. All I need is land,\u201d she says. \u201cBut what about the children? Most of them don\u2019t even go to school, and all our traditions are being lost. They won\u2019t know how to fish or navigate in the forest. What will their future be here?\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-16T20:00:13Z",
            "content": "It was easy, during his 18 fruitless months at Manchester City, to be seduced by the idea that Kalvin Phillips was a fine player and all he needed was to start playing again. And then he did start playing again and, having started the 3-1 win over Italy in October and been called up for the games against Malta and North Macedonia in November, he was left out of the squad Gareth Southgate announced on Thursday to face Brazil and Belgium. \u201cHis form just hasn\u2019t been good enough,\u201d Southgate said, and that\u2019s hard to deny. Three minutes into Phillips\u2019s West Ham debut, against Bournemouth, his weak back-pass gifted Dominic Solanke a goal. Twelve minutes after coming off the bench for his second appearance, he was dispossessed, leading to a goal for Manchester United. Two games after that, he was sent off against Nottingham Forest when, five minutes after being booked for a needless shove, he committed a daft challenge on Morgan Gibbs-White. It was excruciating. It got to the point where every second on the pitch was like a slasher horror, watching through your fingers as a likable character sneaks along a dark corridor in the empty school, knowing that at some point, the music will screech as a shadow crosses the screen and torchlight glints off an exposed blade. Even if there have been no calamitous mistakes this month, the statistics really aren\u2019t good: 287 minutes played over eight games in which West Ham have scored three goals and conceded six. The 3-1 win at Everton is the only time the match situation has improved for West Ham in his time on the pitch. And yet he is clearly an extremely talented footballer. What impressed most when he emerged at Leeds under Marcelo Bielsa wasn\u2019t just his range of passing, but the speed with which he would play the pass. He seemingly had a preternatural capacity to assess the disposition of teammates and opponents on the pitch and then choose his option. He played every game for England at Euro 2020 and nobody thought it an aberration that he was named England men\u2019s player of the year for 2020-21. Southgate was keen to talk up the possibility of a way back. \u201cHe just needs to find that rhythm and confidence. There\u2019s a player in there, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll find that.\u201d Phillips is only 28. There is still time and what is encouraging is that David Moyes also seems to believe that, giving him minutes at the end of every match to try to refamiliarise himself with the game. It\u2019s obviously far from ideal to make only two league starts in 18 months at what should be the peak of your career, but players do come back from lean spells or poor transfers. The question is more what went wrong at City. There has been no suggestion that Phillips was anything other than diligent and professional. Although Pep Guardiola did criticise him for returning overweight after the World Cup, he later apologised and Phillips has explained he missed his target by 1.5kg, largely because of an injury and breakdown in communication about exactly when he was expected back. It has become habitual to praise City for their acuity in recruitment. Football could handle owners with extraordinarily deep pockets because they tended to be megalomaniacs who understood celebrity better than the game. The model fell apart with City because they weren\u2019t just rich but smart. They appointed the best coach in the world and built a club to his specifications. They signed exceptionally well. There were the occasional signings who didn\u2019t quite work out \u2013 Danilo, Ferran Torres, Angeli\u00f1o \u2013 but no real flops. It took players time to settle and adapt to Guardiola\u2019s methods and the assumption at first was that Phillips was one of them, not helped by the shoulder injury he suffered early on that required surgery. But gradually it became apparent that Guardiola saw no future for him. Signed for an initial \u00a342m, Phillips\u2019s only two league starts came in May last year when the title was wrapped up and players were being rested for the FA Cup and Champions League finals. So what had gone wrong? Even allowing for the fact that Phillips had suffered a slight decline in form towards the end of his final season at Leeds, why did City sign a player in whom Guardiola seemed to have so little faith? (It\u2019s possible similar questions might be asked about Matheus Nunes, signed for an initial \u00a353m last summer and seen only rarely, although even he has made six league starts; it\u2019s also possible he may be undergoing some sort of reprogramming \u2013 with Guardiola in the first season it\u2019s never easy to tell.) It may be that Phillips proved unable to absorb Guardiola\u2019s tactical instructions \u2013 although given he could handle Bielsa\u2019s, that seems unlikely. It may be there was a personality clash with Guardiola but, while the manager has certainly fallen out with players before, his recent tone in discussing Phillips has tended to be of sadness rather than irritation. It seems rather that there was some sort of breakdown in the City model, that they signed a player their manager didn\u2019t really want; from their point of view the only positive is that at least he wasn\u2019t playing well for one of their rivals. In that sense, Phillips seems an unfortunate victim of the cold economic reality of modern football. To force his way into England\u2019s squad for the Euros would require a remarkable upturn in form, even though, as Southgate said, England \u201cdon\u2019t have many players of that profile\u201d and \u201ca good version of him is an important player for us\u201d. His ideal, perhaps, would be Phillips sitting deep, spraying passes around, releasing Declan Rice to drive on as he has recently for Arsenal alongside Jorginho. For now, though, it\u2019s almost like rehab after a lengthy injury. Before thinking of England, Phillips needs to get back playing regularly, needs to become comfortable on a pitch again, has to remember what it is to be a player. What he achieved under Leeds showed he has the ability; after a difficult 18 months, it\u2019s a question of unlocking it again."

Both the S&amp;P 500 and the tech-dominated Nasdaq set records, with the Nasdaq passing its last peak in 2021, driven higher by gains for Facebook owner Meta and Nvidia, the leading AI chipmaker. Nvidia closed above $2tn in market value for the first time. Nvidia\u2019s market value has doubled in nine months.

Including the Dow Jones index, all three major indexes notched their fourth straight month of gains in a rally largely fueled by growth prospects related to AI.

            "date": "2024-03-20T22:48:27Z",
            "content": "Reddit will enter a new era as a publicly traded company with a market value of $6.4bn after the social media platform\u2019s initial public offering was priced at $34 per share. The price, announced late on Wednesday, came in at the top of the target range set by Reddit\u2019s investment bankers as they spent the past few weeks gauging investor demand for the stock. It sets the stage for Reddit\u2019s shares to begin trading Thursday on the New York stock exchange under the ticker symbol RDDT in the largest initial public offering by a social media company in years. The platform, which is hoping to raise $748m, is set to sell 22m shares. The company\u2019s latest $6.4bn valuation is a drop from 2021, when it was valued at $10bn during a private funding round. Reddit\u2019s IPO was four to five times oversubscribed before it debuted, Reuters reported, a positive sign that it would reach its desired valuation. Its largest shareholder is Advance Publications, the parent company of Cond\u00e9 Nast, which owns such popular magazines as the New Yorker, Vogue and Wired. Reddit has recorded a net loss in each year since its debut in 2005, including losing $90.8m last year. But the company\u2019s approximately 267 million weekly average users and troves of posts have turned it into one of the largest social networks and content platforms, leading investor interest, though it never evolved to the same level of global dominance as a company like Meta. The company\u2019s IPO filing revealed that it had about 1bn posts and more than 100,000 active subreddits. The IPO comes as Reddit has sought to cut down on its yearly losses and find new revenue opportunities, including striking a deal with Google to let the tech giant train its artificial intelligence models on Reddit users\u2019 posts. Reddit\u2019s vast amounts of user-generated data has made it an attractive target for companies seeking to improve the functions of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini. Investors and Reddit executives expressed concern in the lead up to the IPO that some of the platform\u2019s users may attempt to negatively affect the stock price. A small portion of Reddit\u2019s IPO was reserved for some of the site\u2019s own users, including the unpaid moderators who oversee subreddits. The owners of these shares are not under any obligation to hold them for a period of time, and could immediately sell them off. Reddit chief executive Steve Huffman\u2019s attempts to increase revenue over the past year have at times caused backlash from the platform\u2019s users and moderators. Thousands of the platform\u2019s online communities, known as subreddits, shut down last year during a mass protest over Huffman\u2019s decision to start charging for access to the site\u2019s application programming interface. Huffman\u2019s choice hobbled free, popular third-party tools that enhanced the experience of browsing Reddit. Some users said the protest affected the culture of the social network for the worse, though user numbers returned to normal in the aftermath."

            "date": "2024-03-09T17:00:36Z",
            "content": "One of the consistent themes of the Conservative economic narrative is an admiration for the US and its ability to grow quickly. The way it has bounced back from the pandemic and how it has ridden out the impact of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine should serve as a blueprint. A neoliberal Conservative analysis puts the emphasis on tech, innovation and a myth-like entrepreneurial spirit that the UK would do well to emulate. What it ignores is the way the US economy zips ahead on fantastical stock market valuations and off-balance-sheet accounting reminiscent of the years before the 2008 financial crisis. And how both these habits could bite back in a big way, much as they did in 2008, and pretty soon. While Europe wrestles in a largely transparent fashion with the fallout of deindustrialisation and an ageing workforce with high levels of welfare and state subsidies (giving rightwing commentators all the ammunition they need to knock slow-moving social democratic societies), the US hides many of its problems. One of those costs is a looming insurance crisis chronicled by analysts at Bloomberg. It is an off-balance-sheet exercise that ranks alongside student loans and public service pensions for its sheer size, but outranks them for the nightmarish instability of the whole scheme. The financial data provider has documented the switch by millions of homeowners from private insurers to a \u201clast resort\u201d state-run insurer in areas affected by the climate crisis and the hurricanes, wildfires and floods that rising temperatures bring. Those plans have more than doubled their market share since 2018, and their liabilities crossed the $1tn threshold for the first time in 2022, according to Property Insurance Plans Service Office, a research company that tracks the programmes. Critics of the way private insurers have offloaded liabilities worry that even a modest wave of claims in any of these states will overwhelm the finances of the scheme. Still, one could argue that when this happens, it will be the US government that picks up the tab, keeping a bad problem relatively self-contained. A looming banking crisis may not be so easy to stop at the border. Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that US banks were at risk from the impact of high interest rates on the value of commercial property. Office blocks that have seen their value soar in the last 15 years are now seriously underwater, financially speaking. Analysts have been worried for some time about the huge liabilities on bank balance sheets, but the lack of demand for office space, as a result of the trend for working from home, means a crisis is now imminent. We all remember how the sub-prime residential property markets of California, Florida and many other US states became a bubble after several years of aggressive mortgage selling to people with low incomes. It burst, triggering the 2008 financial crisis, after a series of interest rate rises meant the mortgages were unaffordable and owners handed back the keys. The IMF said a \u201csizable subgroup\u201d of banks were in trouble, \u201cwith fears that the failure of one institution could precipitate a broader loss of confidence in the sector\u201d. It added: \u201cBeyond the unrealised losses due to higher interest, the credit risk carried by some institutions, particularly their exposure to corporate real estate, is at the centre stage of investors\u2019 fears today.\u201d Staff at the credit rating agency S&amp;P have also signalled concerns about high interest rates, though they make a separate point, saying rising debt bills could trigger a wave of corporate failures in the US next year. At a recent briefing, some of the agency\u2019s analysts said thousands of companies had hedged their interest rate exposure, betting that they could refinance when rates fell back. What if rates only tick down gently? These companies will find their loans unaffordable and go bust. Central bank governors in the US, eurozone and UK are expected to cut the cost of borrowing slowly this year. Possibly too slowly. Another concern is the exuberance seen in US stock markets. Could it be that increases in share values over the last two years, pushing the US S&amp;P 500 to a record high, constitute a speculative bubble and a rout is imminent? A great admirer of the US, Rishi Sunak appears to believe the UK would be well placed sitting in Washington\u2019s slipstream. That means loosening the constraints on financial companies and banks, letting them join the dash for profit, while running down the capacity of public services, including health. It also means becoming more dependent on foreign investment and imports of essential goods from countries that have lax health and safety laws, weaker workers\u2019 rights and more autocratic or unstable governments. Whatever kind of potential shock you care to think about \u2013 health, financial or trade \u2013 the UK is becoming more, not less, vulnerable."

            "content": "The UK\u2019s largest shares-focused investment fund has been downgraded by a leading ratings firm after a \u201cnumber of missteps\u201d by the star stock-picker Terry Smith. Morningstar demoted the \u00a335bn Fundsmith Equity fund\u2019s rating from gold to silver, saying the manager\u2019s ill-timed sale of shares in large companies including Amazon and the software firm Adobe had hurt performance. The downgrade will be a further blow for Smith. Fundsmith profits tumbled 14% to \u00a350m in the year to March 2023, according to the latest available filings, as customers started to pull money from the fund. The decline in profits resulted in Smith\u2019s pay falling for the first time since 2016, to \u00a331.1m, down from \u00a336.4m a year earlier. Daniel Haydon, a Morningstar analyst, said in the ratings firm\u2019s report: \u201cWhile Smith\u2019s careful sell discipline has long been an edge, some questions have become apparent more recently.\u201d Smith has admitted to bad timing in relation to the sale of four major stocks, the report noted. \u201cIn some cases (Adobe and Amazon.com) \u2013 having seen their share prices rise significantly after selling \u2013 he now thinks he acted too soon despite feeling his fundamental analysis stacked up at the time,\u201d it said. \u201cIn retrospect, he wished he had better incorporated thematic tailwinds relating to artificial intelligence. Elsewhere, he waited too long to make full sales of Est\u00e9e Lauder and PayPal, and this hurt performance.\u201d \u201cFor a high-conviction fund of 20-30 stocks that trades infrequently, this is a number of missteps,\u201d the report added. Smith, who grew up in Forest Gate, east London in 1960s, has long been one of the UK\u2019s most popular fund managers, delivering stellar returns that left many hailing him as Britain\u2019s answer to Warren Buffett. Fundsmith, which Smith founded in 2010, runs the UK\u2019s largest stock-focused investment fund and manages \u00a335bn on behalf of clients ranging from small savers to big institutions. Smith moved his operations to Mauritius in 2014. Commenting on Morningstar\u2019s downgrade, Fundsmith said the fund continued to outperform global benchmarks on a historical basis. The company said: \u201cWe have made it clear from the outset that we do not expect our strategy, or indeed any strategy, to outperform the market or even make a positive return in all reporting periods and market conditions. \u201cWe think that investors should judge our returns over the long term, and since inception Fundsmith Equity is up 596% or 15.7% on an annualised basis, net of fees, compared with 11.8% for the benchmark MSCI World. Looking over the last three years, Fundsmith Equity outperformed the average return delivered by funds in the IA [Investment Association] global sector.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 2 April 2024. Fundsmith profits fell to \u00a350m in the year to March 2023, not to \u00a350bn. It manages \u00a335bn on behalf of clients, not \u00a325bn. And due to an error introduced during editing, an earlier version said that the Fundsmith Equity fund was up 11.8% annually since its inception, once fees are stripped out; the correct figure is 15.7%."

            "date": "2024-03-01T17:18:10Z",
            "content": "Two of the largest pharmacy chains in the US, CVS and Walgreens, will start selling the abortion pill mifepristone on prescription at stores in several US states later this month, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing interviews with officials at both companies. Joe Biden quickly applauded the decision, issuing a statement from the White House hailing an \u201cimportant milestone\u201d in maintaining access to the pill and encouraged other pharmacies to pursue similar options. \u201cWith major retail pharmacy chains newly certified to dispense medication abortion, many women will soon have the option to pick up their prescription at a local, certified pharmacy \u2013 just as they would for any other medication,\u201d the US president said. \u201cThe stakes could not be higher for women across America,\u201d he added. The two pharmacy chains will not be providing the medicine by mail, the newspaper reported. In the coming weeks, CVS will begin filling prescriptions for the abortion medication mifepristone in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the Times reported. The pharmacy chain said it received certification to dispense the medication in states where abortion is still legal. And CVS intended to add those states to its distribution \u201con a rolling basis\u201d, chain spokeswoman Amy Thibault said to the Associated Press. Meanwhile, Walgreens will begin providing the pill in a select number of pharmacies in California, New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Illinois. \u201cWe are beginning a phased rollout in select locations to allow us to ensure quality, safety and privacy for our patients, providers and team members,\u201d a Walgreens spokesperson, Fraser Engerman, told the Times. Although both chains have plans to expand dispensing of the medication to other states where it is legally permissible, they have held off on expanding access where abortion bans are in place, the Times reported. The latest news comes as Republican-led states have widely blocked access to abortion since the US supreme court in 2022 overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision making access to abortion a national right in the US. Last December, the supreme court agreed to hear oral arguments in a case about abortion medication. The decision of that case, set for this summer, could further challenge access to mifepristone. It was 2000 when the FDA approved mifepristone to terminate pregnancies of up to 10 weeks, when used with a second drug, misoprostol. Labeling from the FDA for more than 20 years limited dispensing to a subset of specialty offices and clinics, due to safety concerns. Mifepristone is taken first to dilate the cervix and block the hormone progesterone, which is needed to sustain a pregnancy. Misoprostol is taken 24 to 48 hours later, causing the uterus to contract and expel pregnancy tissue. CVS has nearly 9,400 stores in the US. Walgreens has about 8,700.

            "content": "Ricardo Lopez\u2019s taqueria is famous for a melt-in-your-mouth birria recipe that takes three days to prepare. Every week, hundreds of customers flock to La Vaca Birria in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District for a taste of the slow-braised beef served over rice and beans or tucked into a crispy taco with a side of rich dipping broth. Lopez recently hiked the price of his signature birria burrito to $22, an eye-popping figure even in the pricey city. The move rankled some customers, with one posting a scathing review that expressed disbelief at how the burrito\u2019s price had doubled from $11 just two years ago. In a detailed response that quickly went viral, Lopez argued that the price tag was justified due to the runaway costs of ingredients such as beef and onion, as well as rising labor costs. His plea felt like a microcosm of the pain experienced by restaurant owners across the US as food prices remain stubbornly high despite cooling inflation. Many items have yet to return to pre-pandemic prices, leaving small food businesses \u2013 already operating on thin margins \u2013 with limited options beyond passing the increase to customers. Lopez, 31, talked to Guardian about the factors that helped push his burritos from $11 to $18 to $22, and why he hopes \u201cevery damn Mexican restaurant in the Bay area raises their prices\u201d. Rising costs When Lopez went back to his food order receipts from mid-2021, and compared them with his recent orders, he found many items whose prices had risen and, in some cases, almost doubled. He shared the receipts with the Guardian to verify the prices; for some items, he could not find receipts from 2021, so we relied on his memory of the price. (These prices are different from his Instagram estimates, since they\u2019re based on different dates.) Behind the cost increases The rising costs of ingredients are driven by some major geopolitical events, from droughts in the midwest and Texas to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Continuing droughts have encouraged ranchers to shrink the size of their cattle herds, said Ted Schroeder, an agricultural economist at Kansas State University, thus reducing supply and driving up price. At one point in recent years, \u201cclose to 60%\u201d of US cattle grazing lands were experiencing significant drought, he said. The wholesale price of beef is up 46% over the past three years, Schroeder said, and beef prices are expected to remain near record highs. The Black Sea region, where Russia meets Ukraine, is a major source of the world\u2019s grain supply, but another major crop in Ukraine is sunflowers, which are used to make popular cooking oils, said Ricky Volpe, a food supply chain economist at California Polytechnic State University. The war has pushed the price of kitchen oil up, as well as having effects on global supplies of wheat and petroleum. The jump in Lopez\u2019s estimated onion prices was a bit of a head-scratcher, Volpe said, and might be specific to a particular supplier, since overall onion costs weren\u2019t up that much. The broader reasons behind price inflation continue to be debated, with some US researchers and politicians arguing that the country is experiencing \u201cgreedflation\u201d, propelled by companies deciding to turn customers\u2019 willingness to pay higher prices during the pandemic into ongoing profits. \u201cAfter Covid, everything skyrocketed first, and then everything lowered,\u201d Lopez said. But \u201cnothing has gone down to pre-Covid pricing, which is hard to understand being anything besides greed\u201d. How do you solve the price of a burrito? While overall food prices have gone up sharply in the past few years, Volpe said, they haven\u2019t jumped as much as the 100% increase in La Vaca Birria\u2019s burrito. One possibility, he said, was that Lopez\u2019s small business might have been charging too little in the beginning and operating at a loss. Lopez said that Volpe was right: to attract people to his recently opened business, he had tried to keep the price of his food as low as possible, worried that people would not try something new that was also pricey. In November 2023, Lopez wrote on Instagram, his business account was overdrawn. Then, just days later, a San Francisco Chronicle reviewer crowned La Vaca Birria the best burrito in the Mission district, the heart of the city\u2019s Mexican food scene, and customers tripled overnight. The first thing Lopez did after the glowing review wasn\u2019t raise his prices: it was lower the commission he was offering to food delivery apps in exchange for displaying his restaurant more prominently on their sites. But in December 2023, still feeling the squeeze, he raised the burrito price from $18 to $20. Then, in early March 2024, he raised it again. As one commenter pointed out, $22 is not the price of a burrito you can eat every day. And that\u2019s \u201ccompletely correct\u201d, Lopez said. \u201cWe do not see ourselves as an everyday burrito.\u201d Higher-volume businesses in the Mission such as the burrito-slinging institution El Farolito might have a smaller profit margin per burrito, but they reliably serve thousands of customers a day. Lopez is serving closer to 200 customers on a good day and is still building name recognition. There is no way a small business, especially a one-location store like Lopez\u2019s, can compete with big chains on the cost of their food, Volpe, the food chain economist, said. So deciding to offer a more expensive, high-quality product is the most rational choice. Another unique factor of La Vaca Birria\u2019s burrito math is that Lopez has a Muslim business partner and the restaurant serves all-halal meat. That means they attract enthusiastic Muslim customers from as far as Sacramento, but also that they don\u2019t serve pork, which, at about $2 a pound, is substantially cheaper than beef, Lopez says. While other Mexican restaurants can make higher margins on their pork al pastor or carnitas burritos, he said, La Vaca Birria doesn\u2019t have that option. What is good Mexican food worth? The debate over the $22 burrito has raised questions about whose cuisine is allowed to be expensive. With Italian food, customers \u201cdon\u2019t have an issue\u201d with paying $22 for pasta al pomodoro, Lopez pointed out, even though the dish is relatively cheap to make: canned tomatoes, dried or fresh pasta, and just a few other ingredients. So when it comes to a $22 burrito, Lopez asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d Preparing his birria is an intensive, three-day process, based on a recipe inherited from his grandfather. It takes an hour just to clean the seeds and the stems from the dried chillis for the spice mix that flavors it. The beef is marinated overnight, then braised in the oven at a low temperature for six hours, and then has to chill in the fridge for a full day. At the end, scrubbing the beef pans can take another hour. Lopez says he\u2019s seen many Mexican and Chinese restaurants avoid raising prices because the cuisine is valued for offering cheap and takeout meals. \u201cThe Chinese and Mexican restaurants have not been increasing prices along with inflation,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m barely seeing some restaurants where the burrito is $15. It should have been that two years ago.\u201d After multiple television stations did segments on La Vaca Birria\u2019s $22 burrito, Lopez says, the restaurant received angry phone calls including one who told them to \u201cget the f*** out of his country\u201d and another calling him an idiot. Some of the backlash appears racist: Lopez said that a Black baker in San Francisco who sells $18 loaves of sourdough talked about facing similar criticism after being named one of the country\u2019s most creative new bakeries by Bon App\u00e9tit. Lopez says that in the eyes of some, restaurateurs of color may be allowed to innovate, but \u201cpeople don\u2019t think it should be worth any more than a certain price point\u201d. But many of the comments on Lopez\u2019s Instagram posts about rising costs have been unexpectedly positive, with people across industries saying that the challenges of inflation have resonated with them. He said the controversy had doubled the number of customers coming in to try La Vaca Birria\u2019s specialties. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of business,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople, at least in San Francisco, have definitely come out to support.\u201d Illustrations by Rita Liu; development by Andrew Witherspoon"

            "date": "2024-03-15T05:00:40Z",
            "content": "Macmillan Cancer Support, one of Britain\u2019s biggest and best known charities, is planning to axe 150 jobs \u2013 one in 14 of its workforce \u2013 saying that it is getting harder to raise money to cover rising demand for its help due to increasing numbers of people living with cancer. The charity, whose services play a vital role in local NHS provision, spends \u00a3250m a year funding about 11,000 specialist cancer nurses and care workers and providing financial, practical and emotional support and advice to the public, including thousands of \u00a3200 grants to patients needing help with energy and travel costs. Macmillan is an established part of the UK\u2019s voluntary fabric and traditionally one of its most effective and popular fundraisers, consistently pulling in more than \u00a3200m a year from legacies and money raised by tens of thousands of participants in events ranging from marathons, hikes and bike rides to its signature coffee mornings. But its heavy reliance on charity fundraising has been exposed by soaring inflation and a surging demand for advice and support from rising numbers of people needing help to cope with the financial and psychological consequences of cancer diagnoses and long waits for NHS treatment. It said in a statement: \u201cLike many organisations, Macmillan has felt the impact of a difficult financial environment. It is getting harder to raise money, and inflation means it costs more to do the same as we did a few years ago. We are tackling these challenges by transforming, so we can have more impact for people with cancer, but without relying on raising more money to be able to do that. \u201cThis has meant taking the difficult decision to reduce the size of the organisation and sadly means we must make some valued colleagues redundant. We are taking these difficult decisions, and building a new strategy to ensure Macmillan is in the best possible position to provide the vital support people living with cancer need now and long into the future.\u201d A Macmillan spokesperson said it had sought to \u201cminimise the impact\u201d of the cuts on beneficiaries living with cancer. While the job losses were organisation-wide, they would not hit staff providing advice and support direct to the public. The vast majority of the clinicians it funds are employed by the NHS. The move has shocked the voluntary sector because the biggest charities have been largely resilient to the cost of living crisis, unlike smaller organisations, which are often at the mercy of donor fatigue and council funding cuts. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise. Most big charities are hiring rather than shedding jobs,\u201d one analyst said. A Macmillan staff member told the Guardian the latest round of cuts had created a \u201chorrible atmosphere\u201d and questioned whether the management had taken its eye off the ball of its core fundraising role. \u201cA lot of good people will be losing their jobs,\u201d they said. \u201cIt\u2019s all pretty grim.\u201d The job losses come three years after Macmillan Cancer Support culled 300 jobs during the pandemic, as it prepared to lose tens of millions of pounds in income as a result of the lockdown cancellation of thousands of fundraising events. Although fundraising income picked up after the Covid lockdowns ended, the charity faces underlying financial challenges. It spent more than it made in donations in four out of the past five years, and has more than once drawn heavily on dwindling financial reserves to balance its books and meet the rising demand for services. Its latest financial accounts for the year to 31 December 2022, published in October, showed the charity\u2019s income had dipped from \u00a3231m to \u00a3227m, partly as a result of declining donations as rising living costs hit donor pockets. At the same time, spending on staff, overheads, grants and services rose to \u00a3252m. Of Macmillan\u2019s income, 97% comes via fundraising and legacies. It raised \u00a3204m this way in 2022, down \u00a36m year-on-year, and lower than pre-Covid levels. Fundraising is understood to have flatlined over the past year. Macmillan Cancer Support has topped YouGov\u2019s annual charity rankings \u2013 that measure which charities the public would be most likely to donate to \u2013 for 11 years in a row, ahead of other household names such as Cancer Research UK and the British Heart Foundation. The charity\u2019s chief executive, Gemma Peters, who joined just over a year ago, has described Macmillan\u2019s culture as \u201cquite clunky, siloed and a bit too hierarchical\u201d. She last year launched a major strategy review to re-examine its role, structure and priorities, including its heavy reliance on charity fundraising. Sarah Vibert, the chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said: \u201cCharities of all sizes are facing a triple threat of record demand, falling income and rising operational costs \u2013 with none of these showing signs of letting up anytime soon.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-15T18:01:13Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak will accept an inflation-busting 5.5% increase in his salary for being an MP, No 10 has indicated. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) has recommended MPs\u2019 salaries rise to \u00a391,346 in April, from \u00a386,584. The uplift is higher than the rate of consumer price inflation, which was 4% in January. It is significantly more than the 2.9% increase that MPs received last year, against what Ipsa called an extremely difficult backdrop. Asked whether Sunak would accept the pay rise, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said all Commons ministers would receive the rise awarded by Ipsa. The independent watchdog, established in 2009 after the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal, said the pay uplift was in line with one recently agreed for the senior civil service. Sunak\u2019s spokesperson said government ministers had opted not to accept increases to their ministerial salaries, which are separate. No 10 said: \u201cFor the government\u2019s part, I would point out that ministers are already voluntarily waiving part of their salaries, forgoing any pay increase to their ministerial salaries, which means that salaries of ministers in the Commons have not increased since 2010.\u201d According to government data, the prime minister\u2019s salary in 2022-23, the financial year in which Sunak entered office, was \u00a380,807, of which \u00a375,440 was accepted. This sum is paid on top of the salary the prime minister receives for being an MP. A summary of Sunak\u2019s taxable UK income published by No 10 last month showed he paid more than \u00a3500,000 in tax in 2022-23 from an income of \u00a32.2m. The prime minister made \u00a31.8m in capital gains, up from \u00a31.6m in 2021-22, and received \u00a3290,000 in other interest and dividends. All of the investment income and capital gains came from a US-based investment fund listed as a blind trust, according to the summary. The \u00a3139,477 he received from his MP and prime ministerial salaries made up 7% of his income. His total earnings over the last four years are about \u00a37m. Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, whose father is a billionaire co-founder of the Indian IT company Infosys, have a combined wealth estimated at about \u00a3529m, according to 2023\u2019s Sunday Times rich list. The prime minister has faced accusations of being out of touch with people struggling with the cost of living. The Ipsa chair, Richard Lloyd, said: \u201cServing as an MP should not be reserved to those wealthy enough to fund it themselves. We believe our decision recognises the vital role MPs play in our democracy and considers the continued economic challenges facing the country. \u201cWe are committed to supporting a parliament that reflects our society, where people from all walks of life can decide to become MPs.\u201d"

            "content": "Grocery price inflation in Great Britain has slowed to 4.5%, its lowest level since February 2022, but one in four households are still struggling financially, retail researchers have found. However, the figures also suggest a change in sentiment with upmarket retailers Waitrose and Ocado the only grocers to win new shoppers in the past three months, according to the latest monthly figures from the analysts Kantar, as growth in more expensive branded groceries outstripped supermarket own-label. Ocado was the fastest-growing brand, according to Kantar, as price cuts helped the online grocery specialist recover from a post-pandemic slump. In a separate trading statement issued on Tuesday, Ocado Retail reported a near 11% rise in sales to \u00a3645m in the three months to 3 March, underpinned by an 8% rise in the number of items sold after introducing more Marks &amp; Spencer branded items and matching Tesco prices on thousands of products. Hannah Gibson, the chief executive of Ocado Retail which is a joint venture between M&amp;S and technology group Ocado, said the market was stabilising, with shoppers prepared to spend on treats but offsetting the costs by making savings on the basics. \u201cConsumers are feeling a bit more confident. They are very conscious of value but want to spend on things they enjoy,\u201d she said. Waitrose\u2019s pace of annual sales growth, at 3.9% according to Kantar, was faster than at the discounter Aldi for the first time since 2021. Aldi has been the target of price-match campaigns by Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Lidl. Only Asda, the Co-op and Iceland trailed behind Aldi\u2019s 3.1% rise in sales, with even struggling Morrisons ahead on 3.6%. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: \u201cGrocery inflation has come down significantly since hitting an eye-watering peak of 17% in March 2023. However, despite this continued slowdown, many British households are still feeling the squeeze. Twenty-three percent identified themselves as struggling financially in our data \u2013 the same proportion as reported in November last year.\u201d Lidl remains the fastest-growing high street grocer, with sales up by 8.8% helped by a 24% rise in sales of baked goods and a 11% jump in fruit, vegetables and salads. Across Great Britain, \u00a3605m more was spent on promotional deals this month than in March last year, while nearly a third of baskets across Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda collectively contained at least one product price-matched to a discounter. While sales of branded goods are now growing faster than own-label, sales of supermarkets\u2019 premium own-label lines are up by 16.1%, the quickest rate in nearly three years. This may be partly down to budget constraints easing but also points to consumers still seeking out cheaper options to big brands. Prices are falling most rapidly on key goods such as butter and milk but rose strongly on sugary sweets and chocolate confectionery before Easter, when families stock up on seasonal treats. The number of hot cross buns sold was up 15% on last year."

            "date": "2024-03-12T08:23:30Z",
            "content": "Unemployment rose and wage growth slowed in the three months to January as the UK labour market showed signs of weakness, reflecting a broader slowdown in the economy. The unemployment rate rose unexpectedly to 3.9 in January from 3.8% in December according to the Office for National Statistics, while annual average wages growth including bonuses fell to 5.6% from 5.8% in the previous month. City economists had expected unemployment to reman flat and pay growth to slow to a more modest 5.7%. Pay without bonuses also ticked lower, to 6.1% from 6.2% over the same three-month period. Employers cut back on hiring new staff, pushing the number of advertised vacancies down on the quarter by 43,000 to 908,000, indicating that the recession during the last six months of 2023 took a slightly bigger toll on the labour market than first estimated. The Bank of England has waited to see signs that wage growth is slowing before making a move to reduce interest rates, and is expected to view the latest figures as another reason to begin that process this year. However, more recent surveys have shown UK businesses regaining confidence in the economic outlook and preparing to raise prices as employees continue to receive pay rises above the rate of headline inflation, which is now 4% \u2013 still double the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. A rise in the number of people leaving the labour market, mostly due to ill-health, will also likely mean that employers struggle to find staff and wages growth falls slowly over the coming months. Tony Wilson, the director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said: \u201cIn all, there are well over half a million more people out of work than before the pandemic began. This is being driven by more young people and older people outside the labour force, and in particular because of more people reporting long-term health conditions that stop them from working. \u201cIn our view this is holding back the recovery as the economy is continuing to create jobs, with nearly a million unfilled vacancies reported today.\u201d The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the figures showed his plans to increase incomes were working. \u201cOur plan is working. Even with inflation falling, real wages have risen for the seventh month in a row. And take home pay is set for another boost thanks to our cuts to national insurance which in total are putting more than \u00a3900 a year back into the average earner\u2019s pocket,\u201d he said. Wilson said the rise in inactivity meant the government needed \u201ca different approach to how we reach and engage with people who are out of work and may want to come back to work\u201d. He added: \u201cIn particular our employment services need to be more accessible, inclusive and supportive. Employers need to play their part too, and do more to keep people in work and to open up opportunities for those who may need more support.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-13T12:08:01Z",
            "content": "A surge in high street and online spending helped Britain\u2019s economy return to growth in January, boosting hopes that the recession of late 2023 will be short-lived. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said national output \u2013 as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 rose by 0.2% in the first month of 2024, largely as a result of a sharp recovery in retail sales after December\u2019s hefty drop. The ONS said unless there were revisions to past growth figures it would now take monthly GDP falls of 0.3% in February and March for the recession to continue into the first quarter of 2024. The UK met the technical definition of recession after contracting in the third and fourth quarters of 2023. Data from the UK\u2019s official statistical body showed the 3.4% jump in retail spending was the main factor behind the 0.2% growth in the service sector in January. Higher spending on private healthcare also boosted service sector output. A pickup in housebuilding was the main factor behind a 1.1% jump in construction output, but the production sector \u2013 which includes energy, mining and manufacturing \u2013 contracted by 0.2%. The ONS cautioned against reading too much into one month\u2019s figures and said that over the three months to January, GDP was 0.1% lower than in the three months to October 2023 and was 0.2% smaller than in the three months ending in January 2023. GDP per capita remains below its pre-pandemic level. Liz McKeown, the ONS director of economic statistics, said: \u201cThe economy picked up in January with strong growth in retail and wholesaling. Construction also performed well with housebuilders having a good month, having been subdued for much of the last year.\" \u201cThese were [partly] offset by falls in TV and film production, lawyers and the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry.\u201d Financial markets had expected a pick up in activity after December\u2019s 0.1% contraction, with the consensus forecast among economists of a 0.2% increase. Although the UK will officially remain in a shallow recession at least until the GDP figures for the first quarter of 2024 are released in May, the news of the slight rebound in growth came as a relief to the government. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said in last week\u2019s budget that the economy had turned the corner after a period in which action by the Bank of England designed to tackle high inflation led to slower growth. Responding to the January GDP figures, Hunt said: \u201cWhile the last few years have been tough, today\u2019s numbers show we are making progress in growing the economy \u2013 part of which makes it possible to bring down national insurance contributions by \u00a3900 this coming year. But if we want the rate of growth to pick up more we need to make work pay which means ending the unfairness of taxing work twice.\u201d Rachel Reeves, shadow chancellor, said: \u201cAfter 14 years of economic decline under the Conservatives, Britain is worse off. Rishi Sunak\u2019s claims that his plan is working are already in tatters after Britain was hit by recession last year.\u201d In the final six months of 2023, the economy grew only once \u2013 by 0.2% in November. Every other month recorded a fall or stagnation in GDP. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said: \u201cForward looking, indicators point to further strengthening of momentum in February, bolstering the prospect that the UK experienced a short and shallow recession. Although economic performance has somewhat improved, the outlook remains relatively gloomy.\u201d Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the analystHargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe UK economy snapped back to growth in January, adding fuel to the fire of speculation that the recession will indeed be super-short and ultra-mild. \u201cThe latest snapshot showed that GDP was estimated to have come in at 0.2%, and while the economy is hardly shooting the lights out in terms of growth, there will be relief that light has emerged at the end of a difficult tunnel for many companies.\u201d"

            "title": "Why UK recession may be deeper than two quarters of falling GDP suggest",
            "date": "2024-03-28T13:23:21Z",
            "content": "As the UK economy struggled for momentum, with households tightening their belts, higher defence spending in the second half of last year was a factor that prevented it from contracting by more than it did. The second estimate by the Office for National Statistics of national income, as measured by gross domestic product last year, showed that extra cash for the military, and an increase in government spending more generally, masked a deep and persistent recession in manufacturing and downturns in several other sectors of the economy. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction, and the UK achieved this in the third and fourth quarters of 2023 when GDP fell by 0.1% and 0.3% respectively. Most economists have described this as a technical recession because of its shallowness and the likelihood of a swift, though equally shallow, rebound this year. However, the recession could be considered to be deeper when Britain\u2019s rising population is taken into account. GDP per head was estimated to have fallen by 0.6% in the fourth quarter and to have not grown since the first three months of 2022, the ONS said. Across 2023 as a whole, GDP per head is estimated to have fallen by 0.7% when taking into account the latest ONS assessment of migration and its impact on the number of people in the UK. One factor that illustrates the UK\u2019s longer term decline can be found in trade data published on Thursday, where it is clear that exporters have had a tough time. The difficulties stretch back to the financial crash of 2008 and the recession that came immediately afterwards. They were made worse by the lack of private investment that followed the Brexit vote in 2016 and trade restrictions with the EU since 2021. To illustrate the point, the balance of payments deficit in the first quarter of 2011 was \u00a32.9bn. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the deficit had expanded to \u00a326.3bn, or 3.9% of GDP, a widening of \u00a35.9bn from the third quarter. These figures exclude the often-volatile trade in gold and other precious metals. One of the biggest elements of the decline across the second half of last year came from the UK\u2019s trade in goods. A recent study by the ONS showed total goods exports in 2023 fell by \u00a315.2bn, or 4.6%, compared with 2022, \u201cwith substantial decreases in exports to both EU and non-EU countries\u201d. To give a comparison with the pre-pandemic period, when the international trade scene was more settled, total goods exports were down by \u00a344.7bn, or 12.4%. The rocketing price of imported raw materials and energy played a big part in the rising cost of making goods in the UK and the difficulty of selling higher priced goods abroad. As a message to the government, it emphasises how open and vulnerable the UK manufacturing sector has become to global shocks, and how the economy needs to be much more resilient. And a higher population, which brings with it higher public spending, can bolster GDP, but unless workers are able to increase their productivity, the level of GDP per head will struggle to regain 2022 levels."

            "title": "Blow for Sunak as revised figures confirm UK went into recession last year",
            "date": "2024-03-28T11:49:28Z",
            "content": "Official figures have confirmed that the UK economy went into recession at the end of last year, after the latest estimate found it contracted in the last two quarters of 2023. In a blow to the government\u2019s economic standing, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy, as measured by gross domestic product, shrank by 0.3% in the last three months of the year, unrevised from an earlier estimate. It followed a contraction of 0.1% in the third quarter of 2023, confirming a technical recession \u2013 two consecutive quarters of negative growth. As he prepares for a general election, Rishi Sunak has been seeking to reassure Tory MPs that the economy is turning around, after business surveys showed a recovery in private sector activity in the first few months of the year. A steep fall in inflation in recent months is expected to prompt the Bank of England to start cutting interest rates this summer, easing the pressure on mortgage payers and indebted businesses. However, one of the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC), which sets interest rates eight times a year, said on Thursday that cuts \u201cwere a long way off\u201d, dampening speculation that several reductions in the cost of borrowing would take place this year. Speaking to the Financial Times, Jonathan Haskel said: \u201cAlthough the fall in headline inflation is very good news, it is not informative about what we really care about: what we really care about is the persistent and the underlying inflation. I think cuts are a long way off.\u201d The consumer prices index (CPI) fell from 4% in January to to 3.4% in February. The decrease was mainly due to declining energy and food price growth. Inflation in the services sector remained above 5%. Haskel said he was worried about the high level of wages growth. He added that interest rates should remain high until there was evidence that wages growth had settled at a lower level. The Bank\u2019s governor, Andrew Bailey, said last week that interest rate cuts were \u201cin play\u201d, adding that he was increasingly confident inflation was heading towards Threadneedle Street\u2019s 2% target after it hit a peak of 11.1% in October 2022. Financial markets expect at least three quarter point rate cuts this year. The ONS said the latest GDP estimate for the final quarter of 2023 showed all three sectors of the economy \u2013 services, production and construction \u2013 experienced falling output. The figures indicated that and a deeper recession was prevented by a rise in government spending. Services declined by a milder 0.1%, compared with a 0.2% fall in the first estimate, but without making a difference to the overall decline in the wider economy, the ONS said. Britain\u2019s trade declined and household consumption also fell despite a fall in inflation towards the end of 2023. The ONS said retail sales had the largest monthly fall in December since January 2021, when Covid-19 restrictions were in place. Ashley Webb, a UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s mild technical recession at the end of last year was as mild as previously thought and the economic recovery is probably already under way.\u201d He said the firm\u2019s forecast for the economic recovery in 2024 and 2025 was that it would be stronger than the Bank of England expects. The firm has predicted that inflation will fall further than the Bank forecasts and that interest rates will be cut faster and further than current market pricing suggests. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the ONS figures showed that Sunak had \u201cbroken his promise to grow the economy and left Britain in recession with working people paying the price. The Conservatives cannot claim that their plan is working or that they have turned the corner on more than 14 years of economic failure.\u201d The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said last year was \u201ctough\u201d after interest rates remained high to bring down inflation, but added: \u201cWe can see our plan is working. Inflation has fallen decisively from over 11% to 3.4%, the economy grew in January and real wages have increased for eight months in a row. \u201cOur cuts to national insurance will boost growth by rewarding work and putting over \u00a3900 a year back into the average earner\u2019s pocket.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-06T14:00:40Z",
            "content": "The latest GDP figures show that the Reserve Bank has slowed things down so drastically that Australia\u2019s economy, for the first time for 40 years, has gone an entire year where it grew only because of population increases. There really is no good news to find in the December GDP figures. There\u2019s a fair bit of \u201cworst since\u201d about the numbers. Take the overall calendar year. In 2023 Australia produced just 2.0% more than it did in 2022. That is the worst since the lockdown year of 2020 and just the fourth time since the 1990s recession that we did not produce over 2% more than we did the previous year: If the graph does not display click here On a per capita basis things were truly bad. 2023 was only the third time in the past 40 years that our economy was smaller when accounting for population growth than it had been the year before. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup This is not indicative of things going well. It\u2019s indicative of an economy that has been slowed to a halt by the Reserve Bank. We generally don\u2019t look at total year growth, we focus more on quarterly growth. When we take into account population, Australia\u2019s economy shrunk 0.3% in the December quarter. This was off the back of a 0.5% fall in the September quarter and a 0.2% fall in the June quarter. In the March quarter of last year it didn\u2019t fall. But it didn\u2019t grow either \u2013 growth was 0.0%. If the graph does not display click here But don\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t hear talk of an \u201cofficial recession\u201d because total GDP in the December quarter went up 0.2%. Cripes. 0.2% is not far off an error term. The economy in the December quarter last year was just 1.5% bigger than it was in the final three months of 2022. That is half the average 3% growth Australia has had since the end of the 1990s recession. The only reason anyone really cares about GDP is because there is a link between growth and unemployment. Historically we need GDP growth of about 2.5% to keep unemployment stable. If GDP grows slower than that, unemployment rises; if we get GDP growth above 2.5%, unemployment falls. So with 1.5% growth, it\u2019s not a shock that unemployment went from 3.5% in December 2022 to 3.9% in December 2023. And remember, this is what the RBA wanted. It predicted this growth in its February Statement on Monetary Policy and, worse, it predicts growth of just 1.3% in the year to June. If it gets its way, expect unemployment to keep rising. So what kept the economy growing at all in the December quarter besides population? Trade mostly \u2013 or really our lack of it. Net exports contributed 0.6 percentage points of the 0.2% growth in December. So that means, if you took away our trade, our economy shrank 0.4%. You might think that is because our exports grew. Nope. \u201cNet exports\u201d is exports minus imports. Our exports actually went down in the December quarter, but so too did our imports. We imported 3.4% less stuff in the December quarter than we did in July, August and September. And a big factor was the drop in imported consumer goods \u2013 down 5.4%. Australians stopped shopping. And businesses knew this would happen. Three months ago, when looking at the September-quarter figures, I noted that \u201cchange in inventories\u201d was the biggest contributor to growth and that was not a good thing \u201cbecause next quarter we will likely see those inventories run down as businesses decide there is not much point buying more stock given households are not spending\u201d. And, alas, that came true. In the December quarter businesses ran down the stocks of things they had to sell \u2013 because why bother building up stocks when you know people aren\u2019t buying? This reduced GDP by 0.3%pts in the December quarter: If the graph does not display click here If you take away trade and government spending, Australia\u2019s domestic private sector fell 0.5% in the December quarter. That is not healthy. And we all know it. Household consumption grew a measly 0.1% in the December quarter. And what we bought was mostly essential items \u2013 food and groceries and paying off bills. Our spending on discretionary items (those things we can do without) fell 0.9%. If the graph does not display click here That\u2019s a direct result of interest rate rises. And it has meant even though average household disposable income finally rose again, we did not feel like we were doing OK. If the graph does not display click here Partly this is because the increase came after a long fall, and we\u2019re only back where we were in 2015 (although it is worth remembering that from 2015 to 2019 household living standards barely rose). But it is also due to what drove the increase in living standards. Partly it was an increase in wages but also an increase in the value of housing and the incomes investors received from their properties. That is not exactly a wide scope of the nation. There was also an increase in social assistance and a reduction in the level of tax being paid, although this is not as great as it sounds. The Bureau of Statistics noted this was due to \u201cchanged timing of final tax return submissions compared to previous years\u201d. If the graph does not display click here And so we find ourselves bidding goodbye to the 2023 economy, and the knowledge that we ended the year with a weak economy teetering on the brink of recession, with essentially only population growth keeping things going. We should remember that the Reserve Bank decided in November to increase interest rates one more time, just when this economy was struggling, just as households were cutting back on buying discretionary items and just as unemployment was rising. The Reserve Bank assured us it was aware of the risks of slowing the economy too harshly. Right now it should be very worried indeed. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

            "date": "2024-03-11T18:22:35Z",
            "content": "Thank you to Tom Wall for keeping the story of the Bristol protest alive in his long read (\u2018It was so wrong\u2019: why were so many people imprisoned over one protest in Bristol?, 5 March). I\u2019m the mother of one of the young people convicted of riot at the \u201ckill the bill\u201d protest in March 2021. My son is currently in prison serving his sentence. He was 19 years old at the time of the protest. A bright university student with no protest experience and no criminal convictions, he had never before been in trouble with the police. He was assaulted by the police like many others, but later put on a wanted list, arrested and charged with riot. This has affected him severely, and he tried to kill himself shortly after. He was dragged through the courts, which affected his mental health even further. He couldn\u2019t face any more pressure and pleaded guilty. It\u2019s hard to describe the effect it has had, and will have, on him and the whole family for the rest of our lives. But we are united and we will get through this. As for my son, we know he will achieve greatness after prison. He\u2019s studying while inside and is determined not to give up. He has all the support he needs from family and friends. It\u2019s clear that the charges of rioting were political. Three years on, not one police officer has faced disciplinary action. My son still fears speaking out and has lost any hope that he and the others can get justice. We have lost all confidence in policing and the justice system. How this is even possible in a democratic country? Name and address supplied \u2022 I have family and friends who attended the protest in Bristol, some of whom went on to be arrested and charged. I attended many of the court cases, watched hours of footage and heard the evidence. I was staggered by the severity of the charges. My daughter, who was 19 at the time with no previous criminal record, was sentenced to 14 months in prison. Her experiences there, not to mention the cost to the public purse, seem completely at odds with her actions on the day. As a family, we watched in horror as the early cases went to court, some ending in outrageously long sentences. She, like other defendants who came to trial later, was given the chance to plead guilty to a lesser charge and avoid the lottery of the jury. The way in which the charges changed as the cases proceeded should be investigated. After such a difficult experience, which has robbed me of faith in the judicial system, I was relieved to finally read an article that reflected the events as they happened. Phil Lazarus Whiteparish, Wiltshire \u2022 I was interviewed by Tom Wall at the end of last year on behalf of my daughter Mariella Gedge-Rogers and as one of the founders of the family and friends support group Justice for the Bristol Protesters (JBP). Mariella was one of the first people to plead not guilty to riot, but was found guilty and sentenced to five and a half years in prison, before the Crown Prosecution Service started offering others a plea bargain. Mariella was trodden on by a police officer, sustaining an injury to her hand. But more serious was how she felt while her head was pushed in the gutter. Her words were: \u201cI feared for my life, thoughts of George Floyd and Sarah Everard were going through my mind.\u201d She clashed with the police after witnessing others being attacked by them. She pleaded guilty to violent disorder for some minor offences, but was given this harsh and disproportionate sentence. As mentioned in the article, not one police officer has been held to account for their actions. JBP started a petition to call for a public inquiry into the excessive police brutality, and we have more than 2,000 signatures. We have also been attempting to establish how the riot charge was allowed to be used on what was essentially a protest, exacerbated by overzealous policing. The inconsistencies and timings of the trials determined Mariella\u2019s fate \u2013 five and a half years instead of perhaps 20 months. Is this really a fair justice system? Heidi Gedge Bristol \u2022 As a family member of one of the people affected, the injustices that took place that day are still being felt by many of the protesters and their families. Most of the protesters were young people with no criminal record and got caught up in police violence. These young people\u2019s lives have been irrevocably changed by spending time in custody and then having a criminal record. Meanwhile, no police officers have even been cautioned after inflicting unprovoked violence on many of the protesters. It was really good to read Tom Wall\u2019s excellent and balanced piece on the subject, especially the background to the event, which really does go some way to explain the unjust riot charges that were imposed, with their long custodial sentences, for \u201ccrimes\u201d that have not received this sentence in the past. It is chilling to think how our young people have been used in this way as part of the government gradually eroding our right to protest. Name and address supplied"

            "content": "\u201cWe are here today to give our children confidence that parents have their back,\u201d said Paul, speaking outside a school in Carlisle that has become the centre of a race attack storm. \u201cWe are saying \u2018don\u2019t be afraid\u2019. We need to nip these things in the bud now. Things are getting out of hand.\u201d Paul was one of about 30 black parents and supporters outside the school on Monday morning. They were angry and wanted answers after a black pupil there was subjected to abhorrent and distressing racial abuse. The boy was filmed on Friday being abused. A video that has circulated on social media appears to shows him being taunted, pushed and punched by one white boy who makes him kiss his shoes. The boy\u2019s mother and supporters held a meeting with a senior teacher and school governors as the protesters waited with handmade signs that expressed their anger. Janett Walker, the chief executive of the campaign group Anti Racist Cumbria, was at the meeting and said afterwards that it had been encouragingbut that it was early days. She said incidents like this were too often blamed on bad apples. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about bad apples,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have got deep-rooted racism in society and we need to look at how we uproot that, not just keep blaming it on individuals. It is a societal problem. \u201cOn an average week we get at least two emails from parents, schools, pupils, about racism that is happening in some shape or form. Cumbria may be a mainly white county but it is no worse or better than anywhere \u2026 racism is a problem across society.\u201d Some of those gathered were not parents but felt they had to show solidarity. William, a hospital worker, said: \u201cIt is bad enough that these things happen to us at work but it should not be happening to our kids. We just want a safe place for our kids. We want justice.\u201d Sharon and her family had moved from Manchester to Carlisle five years ago \u201choping that we would be getting away from things like this. It\u2019s a shock to the system, you don\u2019t expect it. Carlisle is generally a nice area and everyone is friendly so when you see things like this, it shakes you.\u201d Sharon continued: \u201cI\u2019ve been here [in the UK] 18 years. It is still hard for me. I still experience racism but I know how to deal with it. This family have not experienced anything like this so it is doubly traumatic.\u201d Another parent, who asked not to be named, said her children had had good experiences at the school. \u201cI was really shocked by the video. I was traumatised. I recognised where it happened and I just thought it could have been any of my sons,\u201d she said. A number of parents said they knew it was not an isolated incident. Paul said his son had been racially abused by a different pupil at the school. \u201cMy son had trauma. He refused to come into the school. He was scared,\u201d he said. \u201cMy son is a black belt but we teach him to keep calm, we teach him to be tolerant, to be loving. It took me a while to bring him back.\u201d Cumbria police said the video that was being circulated was abhorrent and they have asked people to refrain from sharing it. Four teenage boys have been arrested, one on suspicion of racially aggravated actual bodily harm and the other three on suspicion of abetting racially aggravated actual bodily harm. All have been bailed with conditions and investigations are continuing. The force said: \u201cWe\u2019d like to reassure the community we continue to take this incident extremely seriously. We understand an incident like this can be concerning for many and has caused shock to anyone viewing the images circulating online. Additional patrols have been deployed over the weekend and we will continue to engage with key community stakeholders.\u201d The school has been approached for comment. Some outside the school discussed organising a march in solidarity. Kelvin Enabulele said he had been racially assaulted in Carlisle 16 years ago, so the reports brought back grim memories. \u201cIt\u2019s happening in schools across Cumbria and the issue is how does the school handle it? What do they do about it?\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to see things happening.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-08T00:03:54Z",
            "content": "Ten years on, Jiang Hui still hopes he will one day find the answer to what happened when his mother disappeared in 2014. \u201cMy mother was a very normal person. She came from a working-class family. She was very resilient, persistent,\u201d says Jiang, 50, from Beijing. His mother, Jiang Cuiyun, was a 72-year-old retired picture editor and had just been on a holiday in Malaysia. She was one of 153 Chinese citizens onboard flight MH370. Jiang now tries to embody those tenacious qualities of his mother in his decade-long search for answers. His quest for closure has seen him sell his house and quit his job as an IT manager to campaign for the victims full-time. He now relies on his savings. He has travelled the world, including to Madagascar, where he found a piece of possible debris in 2016. In Malaysia, Grace Nathan thinks of her mother, Anne Daisy, during significant life events such as her wedding and the birth of her sons, and still speaks of her in the present tense. \u201cMy children resemble her; I see a lot of similarities,\u201d says the 35-year-old from Kuala Lumpur. \u201cThey are both very jovial and I think that\u2019s from her.\u201d Nathan says she has come to terms with the fact that she may never see her mother again, but when it comes to the emotional side of things, she says she has simply not been able to bridge that gap. \u2018It took me 10 years to get this hearing started\u2019 In a court in Beijing, Jiang and the families of more than 40 other Chinese passengers are suing the airline and related companies, including German insurer Allianz, Boeing and Rolls-Royce. The first trial, at Chaoyang people\u2019s court, concluded on 6 December last year after only 10 days of hearings. No date has been given for a verdict. \u201cI am really disappointed in the Chinese legal system,\u201d Jiang says. \u201cThe legal nature of this case is not that complicated. I can\u2019t comprehend at all why it would take so long \u2013more than a decade.\u201d Some families want compensation, ranging from 10m-80m yuan ($1.4m-$11.2m). Some, like Jiang, simply want a fund restarted that would offer a reward for new information. \u201cThe search could very soon have tremendous progress. The bounty could provide critical momentum.\u201d But despite his steadfast belief that more of MH370 can be found, Jiang is \u201cnot very optimistic\u201d about the lawsuits. Similar efforts in Malaysia and the US have failed, in part because of disagreements about accountability and jurisdiction. In 2018, judge Ketanji Brown Jackson in the US dismissed a lawsuit from relatives on the grounds that the disappearance was \u201cat its core a Malaysian tragedy\u201d. \u201cIt already took me 10 years to get this hearing started,\u201d Jiang says. \u201cIt really reflects that the courts are not sufficient in their determination. It is mistreatment in terms of justice.\u201d Grace Nathan in Malaysia remains resolute in her quest for answers and justice. She emphasises how international cooperation \u2013 14 nationalities were represented onboard \u2013 and corporate responsibility can help fund further searches. \u201cMalaysia has never come out to say it is a budget issue,\u201d she says. \u201cBut even if it is, that is really one of the easiest obstacles to overcome because there were so many nationalities onboard the plane, China being the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\u201d On Sunday, prime minister Anwar Ibrahim reiterated Malaysia\u2019s position that it was willing to reopen an investigation if there was compelling new evidence. Transport minister Anthony Loke said he was ready to meet the US marine robotics company Ocean Infinity to discuss a new search after it submitted a proposal to the government. Nathan hopes this is a step in the right direction. \u201cThis is an optimistic move... No search can guarantee the finding of the plane, [but] if we don\u2019t try we will never know.\u201d Jacquita Gonzales, whose husband Patrick Gomes was the flight supervisor on MH370, has long been frustrated by the lack of search activity, even if only to prevent another tragedy. She is now awaiting the results of any meeting with Ocean Infinity. \u201cWe are happy that the announcement was made. It\u2019s a step in the right direction for them not to forget about it or keep silent,\u201d she says. However, Fuad Sharuji, the crisis director for Malaysian Airlines when MH370 was lost, is more cautious. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to note that Ocean Infinity has graciously offered to search for MH370 at \u2018no-find, no-fee\u2019 basis. However, I\u2019m rather sceptical that the new search area would result in a positive find..\u201d \u2018The Malaysian government has delayed justice\u2019 The victims\u2019 families in China have organised themselves into a rare collective able to express their grief and anger publicly. That is because most of their ire is directed at Malaysian, rather than Chinese, authorities. \u201cI am disappointed in the Chinese justice system, but even more angry with the Malaysian justice system,\u201d says Jiang, who also accuses Malaysia of actively impeding the relatives\u2019 quest for justice. \u201cThe Malaysian government has delayed justice,\u201d he says, referring to the fact that the government allowed the airline to be restructured in a way that frustrated the ability of families to sue the company. In 2015, Malaysia Airlines was nationalised following months of financial difficulties over MH370 plus another disaster, the shooting down of flight MH17 over Ukraine. A restructuring process followed, in which the legal liabilities arising from the loss of MH370 were not passed on to the new entity, Malaysia Airlines Berhad. Dr Ghouse Mohd Noor, a friend of MH370 pilot Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, is critical of the Malaysian government\u2019s handling of the investigation, accusing it of self-interest, and has called for accountability. \u201cThe government is only working for what they think is best for their political purposes \u2026 with their decisions influenced by the expected outcome that would benefit the ruling government,\u201d Noor says, in reference to claims of early efforts to use the tragedy to smear Anwar, who was opposition leader at the time. Jiang and the other relatives have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health problems. \u201cIt\u2019s not only the original incident. The reluctance and the nonchalant attitude of the Malaysian government and the other companies, it\u2019s really causing a secondary level of damage,\u201d he says. The families of more than 100 of the Chinese passengers have accepted compensation from the airline, with settlements reportedly ranging from 2.5m to 3m yuan ($349,000\u2013$418,000). But Jiang has never considered accepting the offer. The settlement specifies that there is no duty to continue the search, he says, and \u201cthat is not in my best interest\u201d. Like many of the families, Jiang has faced financial difficulties. He estimates he\u2019s spent 30,000-40,000 yuan investigating MH370. Other families have struggled to pay medical bills, he says. Although initially supportive of the victims\u2019 families, the Chinese government has been cautious about the potential diplomatic fallout. Some relatives feel Beijing should put more pressure on Kuala Lumpur to continue the search. When the court proceedings in Beijing began in November, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson said the government was paying \u201chigh attention\u201d to the lawsuits, but declined to comment further. Meanwhile, the families continue to cope as best they can, with their minds sometimes filling in the gaps where the mystery endures. For Jacquita Gonzales and the family of her missing husband, Patrick Gomes, there is little respite, even at night. \u201cAn aunt that brought him up said she had a dream he was drenched from head to toe and he said to her, \u2018I\u2019m sorry but I tried my best.\u2019 \u201cKnowing the kind of person Patrick is, he would have done his best to help everyone onboard.\u201d Additional research by Tau Yang and Tzu Wei Liu"

From our joint research, we\u2019ve found that it is often the case that children and young people enjoy their parents\u2019 social media posts because it can be a marker of parental care and pride. But these decisions to post or not to post have to involve the children. Privacy issues are certainly valid, but we found that children who had good, trusting relationships with their parents were generally happy with their parents\u2019 posts as long as permission was agreed. Interestingly, embarrassing photos of them as a small child were fine with the young people. But they were much less comfortable with recent photos. The platforms used also made a difference \u2013 a changeover that usually happened when the young people went through a transitional moment, such as starting secondary school.

            "content": "From Covid conspiracy theories to recent speculations about Catherine, Princess of Wales, social media is at the heart of how we share information, and misinformation, with one another in the 21st century. For those who want to have a better understanding of social media and how it affects us, here are a selection of titles that explore how we consume, share, and manipulate information on social media platforms. *** So You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed by Jon Ronson Journalist and author Jon Ronson argues we live in \u201ca great renaissance of public shaming\u201d, and this book tracks down some of the many victims of online shaming to understand what happened to them as a result. In the process, we learn about Ronson\u2019s own values, question our own, and figure out how we\u2019ve reached a time where an online feed can become a social courtroom. *** Doppelganger by Naomi Klein After getting repeatedly mistaken for feminist-turned-conspiracy-theorist Naomi Wolf online, and then in real life, Naomi Klein penned Doppelganger as an earnest and introspective look at herself. The book explores how conspiracy theories and lies spread quickly through the internet, and how the social and political climate of the physical world manipulates the way we experience online platforms. While not exclusively about social media, the story behind Doppelganger is a perfect case of the ways our digital lives and identities intersect with what we experience in reality \u2013 and how dangerous the repercussions of spreading online lies can be. *** Irresistible by Adam Alter Have you ever wondered why you can\u2019t stop scrolling on your TikTok \u201cfor you\u201d page, or obsessing over how many likes you got on a recent Facebook post? You\u2019re not alone, and Adam Alter\u2019s book explores why we get sucked into the digital world. He answers what makes an online addiction, whether it be to emails, Instagram, or Netflix, different to other forms of addiction \u2013 and warns us of the dangers this could cause long-term. As well as introspection, he gives practical solutions to how digital addiction can be controlled for good. *** Extremely Online by Taylor Lorenz Journalist Taylor Lorenz calls this book \u201ca social history of social media\u201d; she uses real-life case studies of mothers, teenagers, politicians and influencers to assess how social media touches all demographics. Extremely Online explores topics from the digital economy and influencer culture, to what makes moments go viral on Twitter and how this is all influencing the way we socialise and understand the world. At its core, this book explores the idea of what it means to connect \u2013 and how social media as an innovation has warped communication. *** TikTok Boom by Chris Stokel-Walker TikTok is arguably one of the most significant advancements in social media in the past two decades. This book by journalist and writer Chris Stokel-Walker explores how the app is changing the way users interact with content. It moves away from the social-commentary style of the other books mentioned here, instead using business and technology analysis as a means to describe wider socio-political repercussions of the app. Stokel-Walker bridges the gap between the digital and the physical, showing the feedback loop that exists between what happens online on platforms such as TikTok and the real world."

            "content": "Gaby Hinsliff is right that absolutely fundamental reform of the Metropolitan police is needed (I read the Couzens report expecting evidence of rank misogyny. What I found was almost worse, 29 February). One of the areas that most needs attention is recruitment, because the Met has been attracting too many of the kind of people it needs least. Norman Dixon, in his 1976 book On the Psychology of Military Incompetence, explained why the military tended to attract the wrong kind of officer. In effect, because it was by nature authoritarian, it attracted authoritarian characters who were least able to respond appropriately in difficult situations. I wonder if the same process happens in the recruitment of police officers. In other words, that the necessarily authoritarian nature of policing tends to attract the very kind of personality who is least able to act appropriately in situations where empathy and human consideration are needed. Of course, not all recruits will be of this type, but it seems clear that the usually much-maligned personality tests may be one way to weed out the wrong kind. Proper record-keeping and sharing between different parts of the system are also essential.

            "content": "Simon Jenkins is right to highlight the negative impact that overcrowding and staff shortages are having on our prison system (Britain\u2019s prison system is brutal and broken. Why does reforming it seem so impossible?, 14 March). People are spending far too much time in their cells and one of the areas that is suffering is prison education. Evidence clearly shows that participating in education reduces reoffending and makes it more likely that people leaving prison will secure a job. Yet too often people are locked in their cells when they should be in a classroom or workshop, while the education that is on offer is too narrow and not of sufficient quality. This is a missed opportunity to make a positive difference to people\u2019s lives. The former Guardian columnist Erwin James, who arrived in prison with no qualification and left with a university degree, said that \u201ceducation lifted me like I had never been lifted before\u201d. We need to give many more people in prison the same opportunity to get the knowledge, skills and qualifications they need to thrive when released. Jon Collins Chief executive, Prisoners\u2019 Education Trust \u2022 Simon Jenkins is absolutely right to say that our penal policy is stuck in the dark ages. The capacity crisis facing prisons is the predictable result of locking up more people for longer. Of course, public protection is paramount and victims of crime should be respected. However, more than half of people sent to prison last year committed a non-violent offence and there is a wealth of evidence that community sentences are more effective at reducing reoffending than a short stay in prison. The swingeing cuts to the Ministry of Justice\u2019s budget in the decade following 2010 have left too many people in prison living in shocking conditions, stuck in their cells for unacceptably long periods of time. It\u2019s surely now time for politicians to rethink our approach to prisons and to focus on what works to deliver safer communities. The irony is that the public agrees. A 2018 survey found that fewer than one in 10 people think that having more people in prison is the most effective way to deal with crime, favouring early interventions such as better parenting, discipline in schools and better rehabilitation. Andy Keen-Downs CEO, Prison Advice and Care Trust \u2022 In the 1980s, I worked for the East Northamptonshire probation service as a well-supported community service organiser (CSO) and supervisor. The experience was personally rewarding but, more importantly, rewarding for the offenders and their families. Not only did they do useful hard work in the local community, but it was clear that they had found new routes out of criminality. Of course, it didn\u2019t work that way for everybody and sometimes supervision was lax. It was clear that the CSOs needed more workplace training and higher wages to ensure that they could deliver the underlying vision and mission for community service orders (as originally articulated by Barbara Wootton) and for more suitably experienced people to be attracted to this job. CSOs are the most effective means of safely reducing the prison population \u2013 if the overall quality and funding can be radically improved. There is enormous practical scope for uprating this service to achieve its potential. Adam Hart London"

            "date": "2024-03-21T16:58:34Z",
            "content": "The Conservative candidate for the Greater Manchester mayoral election has defected to Richard Tice\u2019s rightwing Reform UK party. Dan Barker was selected only three months ago as the Tory candidate to challenge the incumbent mayor, Labour\u2019s Andy Burnham, in May\u2019s elections. On Thursday he announced that he had joined Reform UK \u2013 becoming the second high-profile Conservative to join the fledgling populist party after MP Lee Anderson\u2019s defection earlier in March. Barker\u2019s move came on a day when Reform said it had sacked two more of its general election candidates, after removing another on Wednesday, over comments on their social media feeds. In a post on X, Barker said Reform UK is the party that represents ordinary people: \u201cDelighted to be joining the new home of conservatism with Reform UK. Reform represents the ordinary people of this country.\u201d A Reform spokesperson said: \u201cReform is delighted that Dan Barker has joined us. He is an excellent candidate and will be a great representative for Reform and Manchester. \u201cHe knows that today, if you believe in the future of this city, and this country, then Reform is to the future as the Tories are to the past.\u201d The Conservatives have until 5 April to select a new candidate for mayoral elections which take place on 2 May. While Barker was unlikely to win, his defection is a bitter blow to Rishi Sunak as he tries to present a united front for the Conservatives ahead of the local and mayoral elections. The threat from Reform is increasingly grave for the Conservatives ahead of the general election.. A YouGov poll published on Thursday showed Reform at 15% support nationally, just four points behind the Conservatives, and ahead of the Liberal Democrats. Reform UK sacked three of its general election candidates in 24 hours over comments that were highlighted on social media feeds. The party said Roger Hoe, a Yorkshire businessman, was removed as the candidate for Beverley and Holderness on Thursday after it emerged that an account on X in his name had tweeted material including praise for the far-right activist Tommy Robinson. Reform also dropped Ginny Ball as its Rutland and Stamford candidate after the exposure of a range of racist comments on her social media feed, including comments calling for the deportation of black British-born public figures. Later on Thursday the party removed Benjamin \u201cBeau\u201d Dade, Reform\u2019s candidate for Swindon South. It came in the wake of claims put forward by the counter-extremism group Hope Not Hate that he was a rightwing influencer who had fantasised about deporting \u201cmillions\u201d of UK citizens so the nation could \u201crid itself of the foreign plague we have been diseased with\u201d. Hope Not Hate said Dade had published a \u201cpolicy roadmap\u201d for the Mallard website, a little-read far-right outlet, in late 2022 in which he called for the deportation of \u201cpotentially millions of foreigners and their dependants who have come here since 1997\u201d. A Reform UK spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cHis comments were brought to our attention, and we acted. Other parties might learn from this. \u201cClearly our vetting process is now taking place in public and everyone is now being re-vetted.\u201d"

            "content": "The BBC has apologised for referring to Reform UK as \u201cfar right\u201d in a news report. The apology related to coverage of the Liberal Democrats\u2019 spring conference by the broadcaster, which said it had removed a sentence from an article that did not adhere to its editorial standards. Reform UK, which blends an anti-immigration message with other rightwing positions in areas including culture and the climate crisis, is the successor to the Brexit party. Lee Anderson was unveiled earlier this month as the party\u2019s first-ever MP after he was stripped him of the Conservative whip over comments he made about Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, which were condemned as Islamophobic. Tice said: \u201cThere are very significant implications of calling a political party, and by implication, its leader and senior leadership team far right. It is that which is defamatory and libellous. That is why they have apologised immediately.\u201d He also said he expected the BBC to change its editorial guidelines. Tice said the label of being \u201cfar right\u201d would have \u201chuge implications\u201d, if other media outlets used it and suggested that he and others could lose their bank accounts or the ability to get a mortgage. He said his lawyers had also been in touch with other organisations. The BBC said: \u201cIn an article about the Liberal Democrats\u2019 spring conference we wrongly described the political party Reform UK as far right when referring to polling. This sentence was subsequently removed from the article as it fell short of our usual editorial standards. Reform describes itself on its website as \u201ca national political party offering commonsense policies on immigration, the cost of living, energy &amp; national sovereignty\u201d. The party has continued to attempt to capitalise on its momentum in polls, which show it eating into the Conservatives. YouGov put Reform on 14% last week, although it has underperformed in byelections in comparison to its political predecessors, the Brexit party and Ukip. Other polling has suggested that the party would receive a further major boost if its founder and current honorary president, Nigel Farage, returned as leader."

            "date": "2024-03-11T17:04:58Z",
            "content": "Richard Tice arrived on a podium in the kind of faceless Westminster building where suits go to talk about workflow management and the carpets make it look like an 80s wedding, and boy, he looked cheerful. Wearing the turquoise tie that is a signature of his Reform party, he had an important announcement to make. Everybody knew what it was, because it was obvious, but also because more than one person had taken a wrong turn on the way to the room and seen Lee Anderson lurking in an antechamber. The only element of suspense was how the big reveal would play out. Would this great Tory scalp leap out of a cake or \u2013 wait \u2013 what if they drove in in a white van? \u201cPeople\u2019s concern and anxiety has turned to anger and fury,\u201d Richard Tice began. \u201cNothing works. Britain is broken, and we all know who broke it.\u201d Yup, I have no problem with any of that. Give him a chance, though; he\u2019s only getting started. \u201cThere is absolute fury that the Tories have imposed on us, without any democratic consent, in complete breach of the 2019 manifesto, mass immigration.\u201d It wasn\u2019t funny yet. Realistically, the bons mots wouldn\u2019t start until 30p Lee arrived, but I still started laughing. The sheer brass neck of this oleaginous, monied blow-hard, claiming superior insight into the hardships and true feelings of the British people, seemed funny in the moment. Or maybe it was nerves, watching Tice\u2019s hatreds build up piece by piece, starting with the easy bits (we all hate the Tories), moving through the body work (legal migrants, illegal migrants), towards the decorative, novel touches (Sadiq Khan, Hamas supporters lining London streets), until he had a working Meccano vehicle made of hate. Who doesn\u2019t laugh when they\u2019re nervous? The crowd was divided down the middle; on one side, more men in turquoise ties; on the other, mostly journalists, like the two families of the bride and groom. The bride\u2019s tribe, if you\u2019re prepared to indulge this over-compressed analogy, were the \u201cstraight-talking men of the people\u201d (you could tell by the turquoise); the groom\u2019s were the liberal elite (you could tell by their awkward questions). The late anthropologist David Graeber described this dance. The right wing pretends to be stupid. The liberals make fun of them as idiots. Everyone who resents the cultural elite looks at them laughing up a gale and thinks: \u201cI bet they\u2019d feel the same way about me.\u201d The choreography is so screamingly obvious, so predictable, someone should just set it to music and we could at least save ourselves having to watch this posturing. \u201cI might not know a lot of these long words,\u201d Anderson said, \u201cbut I know a few short ones. Unfortunately, this leads me to be labelled as controversial, but my opinions are not controversial. They\u2019re opinions which are shared by millions of people.\u201d What\u2019s he even saying, this great man of the people, who shouts \u201cbum\u201d while everyone else shouts \u201cantidisestablishmentarianism\u201d? Which bit is controversial \u2013 that he is too dumb to make an idea hold together over two sentences? There I go again, with the sneering. There he goes again, with the pretending to be stupid. \u201cWho\u2019s laughing?\u201d Anderson said, pugnacious, dour, as he arrived with camera-clicking fanfare before the crowd. \u201cIs that you, Harry?\u201d He needs Harry Cole, political editor of the Sun, to be laughing, so he can pretend to be angry. Tice held him in professionally courteous embrace with one hand, the other outstretched like an end-of-the-pier turn, looking delighted. Anderson\u2019s speech made no sense. He rattled off some of the UK\u2019s gifts to humanity \u2013 \u201clike the Industrial Revolution, like railways, culture, vaccines. And we defeated fascism\u201d \u2013 then railed against those who want to \u201cerase our history\u201d, those who want to \u201cgive our country away\u201d. There was a lot of repetitive, nauseating pabulum about how normal people want their country back, and it was down to him to give it to them. The pro-Palestinian marches taking place in London most Saturdays were \u201can angry baying mob\u201d, he said. \u201cThis is a murderous, vile, wicked thing that we see on our streets, and the police are doing nothing.\u201d Sometimes shoplifters are involved, though whether they are in league with the vile people who oppose massacre and starvation, it\u2019s never quite clear. London\u2019s Jews don\u2019t feel safe, and neither does Lee Anderson. He blames Mayor Khan. \u201cIn the real world, my parents are watching this on TV every night and they\u2019re disgusted.\u201d It\u2019s like listening to an angry baby. Most of the questions afterwards centred on loyalty and consistency: as recently as 10 weeks ago, Anderson was never leaving the Tories, and now he is, and what would he say to colleagues? \u201cWhen I found myself suspended\u201d [as he was the first time he smeared Sadiq Khan, for having \u201chanded the city to his mates\u201d] \u201cfor speaking my mind, that, for me, was unpalatable. I cannot be part of an organisation which stifles free speech.\u201d Well, duh, also, you\u2019d been kicked out. So there was that. \u201cMy message to colleagues,\u201d he said, \u201cis, this time next year, they\u2019ll be sat on the same benches as me.\u201d Maybe \u2026 park benches? Must not laugh. Must keep straight face. If only they would stop saying things."

His government certainly shoulders a lot of blame but so do those who have done nothing to help since he was voted out. The earliest millennials will be 70 in 2050, meaning almost all will be working when the world is forecast to reach temperatures more than 2C above pre-industry averages unless we do something. They are the first generation who can\u2019t really say \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019ll be dead by then\u201d, but they of course are not the only group screwed by climate change. When I turned 20 in 1992, I had experienced one month of global temperatures 1C above the average of the late 19th century. That was one month more than my father had experienced when he turned 20 in 1966. For their first 20 years, millennials born in January 1985 had just four months of temperatures 1C higher than the late 19th-century average. When my daughter turned 20 last year, she had experienced 106 months of them. If the graph does not display click here John Howard is not to blame for climate change, but inaction on climate change in this country started under his watch. He was the one who made sure Australia was able to count land clearing when calculating our emissions, and thus be able to claim reductions when we haven\u2019t made any at all. If the graph does not display click here His government killed any chance of bipartisan policy for a price on carbon. But Howard\u2019s actions are no excuse for anyone in government since, because we kept using his government\u2019s definition of emissions and repeated its claims that we need more gas to lower emissions. More millennials are paying for private health insurance than any during the Medicare period. Why fund public health when you can force people to prop up the private health sector with the \u201clifetime health cover\u201d policy! If the graph does not display click here Howard\u2019s desire to kill unions for the purpose of keeping wages down and profits high turbocharged (and distorted) the \u201cneoliberal project\u201d that began in the 1980s under Hawke and Keating. If the graph does not display click here Millennials have barely any experience of conducting industrial action for better pay and conditions, and coincidentally, those who started working after 2010 entered at a time real wage growth was heading south. If the graph does not display click here Is there any good news? Fortunately, overall unemployment is now lower than anyone of working age has experienced. Millennial women for example are much more likely to work than their older sisters and mothers. Just over 80% of women born in 1980 were employed in their early 40s compared with 67% of those women born in 1950. If the graph does not display click here Men in their 30s and 40s are less likely to be working full-time but the drop from about 90% to 82% is much less than the increase for women of the same age from 28% to 50%. That\u2019s good because millennials chose a pretty bad time to come into the labour force and be unemployed. Whereas boomers had unemployment benefits roughly 25% below poverty, by 2007 they were 47% below and by the middle of 2020 they hit 50% below. If the graph does not display click here But all this work means they all own homes, right? Ahhh. Now we get to it. Millennials, despite being more likely to have work than earlier generations, are much less likely to own a home. If the graph does not display click here When Howard said in 2003, \u201cI don\u2019t get people stopping me in the street and saying, \u2018John, you\u2019re outrageous, under your government the value of my house has increased\u2019\u201d, 57% of gen Xers in their late 30s and 65% of those in their early 40s already owned a home. Little wonder his government was happy to not only provide a 50% discount to capital gains tax that turned the housing market into a casino, but also introduced the first homeowner\u2019s grant and then later doubled it to keep juicing house prices. If the graph does not display click here Factors outside Australia also played a part in the soaring prices. But neither Howard nor anyone who followed has done anything to stop it. Australian governments have decided that building homes is no longer worth doing despite every single person in the country (including all the MPs who have investment properties) knowing housing is a good bet. There was a time when 20% of all new residences were being built by the public or social sector. Now it\u2019s less than 2%. If the graph does not display click here Now sure, in 1990 interest rates got up to 17%. But those rates came down quickly and the loan sizes were much smaller compared with now. Anyone who took out their first home loan after 2005 is paying much higher mortgage repayments than those who took out loans in the 1980s. If the graph does not display click here Have millennials been screwed? Sure, they are more likely to be in work, but they work in a time of low wages growth. They are better educated, but pay much higher rates of Hecs/Help, and they are required to pay more for health cover. They know climate change is not some far-off event and yet governments filled with older MPs either do nothing or merely pretend to do something. And they know that owning a home is less likely than for any generation since the second world war and their repayments will be larger should they be lucky enough to buy a home. Blaming John Howard is easy, but he was just the main avatar of a political and economic project designed to boost the wealth and incomes of those whose votes mattered more from 1980 through to 2010. Unfortunately, the impact of those policies \u2013 especially on climate change \u2013 has screwed not only the millennials, but the generations to come. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

Most sectors, such as housing, transport and farming, remained so far behind their interim targets \u201cthe acceleration required [to] meet the 2030 target is now beyond what is credible\u201d. In response to the committee\u2019s conclusions, Oxfam warned the Scottish government\u2019s credibility was \u201cnow firmly on the line\u201d and Friends of the Earth Scotland accused ministers of \u201can embarrassing and abject failure\u201d. Mike Robinson, the chair of the civic society umbrella group Stop Climate Chaos, said: \u201cAfter declaring a climate emergency, the Scottish government has failed to deliver anything close to an emergency response, and must now redouble efforts. \u201cWhile every party in the Scottish parliament carries some blame, the Scottish government has lost its position as a climate leader and we would like to see the first minister make an emergency statement to parliament to set out his response.\u201d The CCC\u2019s criticisms have been growing in intensity for some years. In the Scottish government, the Scottish National party shares power with the Scottish Greens after signing a cooperation agreement in 2021 that prioritised action on climate. Humza Yousaf, who succeeded Nicola Sturgeon as first minister and as SNP leader, has put less emphasis on climate action, despite its significance in the deal with the Greens. With the SNP facing significant losses in the next general election, he has endorsed the oil industry\u2019s position that heavier taxes to fund a transition to clean energy are unjustified, cut funding for forestry and watered down proposals to switch farming subsidies towards nature recovery. In its annual progress report to Holyrood, the CCC found: \u2022 Scotland would need to cut emissions across housing, transport, farming and waste by ninefold in the next six years to meet its 2030 target. \u2022 Its tree-planting, peatland restoration, heat pump installation, recycling and electric van rates are \u201csignificantly\u201d off track. \u2022 On transport alone, the government had to achieve a fourfold increase in its annual reductions to hit the 2030 target. \u2022 It has no strategy to decarbonise aviation, and has failed to use the powers to set higher air departure taxes given to Holyrood in 2016. In one of the few policy areas it applauded, the CCC said the government\u2019s \u201cbold\u201d heat in buildings bill could become a template for the rest of the UK if it was implemented as planned. As well as banning gas and oil-fired heating by 2045, the bill will mandate minimum energy efficiency standards for private and rented homes and require lower carbon heating to be installed when a house is sold. M\u00e0iri McAllan, the Scottish net zero secretary, implied the Scottish government had effectively dropped its 2030 target. She said the CCC had long been clear that hitting that target \u201cwill be extremely challenging, and may not be feasible\u201d. However, she said: \u201cWe remain fully committed to meeting our target of net zero emissions by 2045. We are under no illusion that the hardest part of this journey is ahead of us.\u201d Scottish ministers had developed proposals to cut car usage by 20% by 2030 and for decarbonising buildings, but she blamed the UK government for the delays to Scotland\u2019s climate change plan. Ministers in London had \u201creneged on their net zero commitments, and rolled back on policies already announced and accounted for\u201d, as well as cutting capital funding for Scotland needed to deliver new infrastructure. \u201cWe will now carefully consider the report\u2019s recommendations and our next steps \u2013 including legislative options \u2013 before providing a formal response,\u201d McAllan said."

            "date": "2024-03-13T06:00:05Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s plans for adapting to the effects of the climate crisis \u201cfall far short\u201d of what is required, the government\u2019s statutory adviser has said. The Climate Change Committee (CCC) has examined the national adaptation programme published by ministers last July, intended to set out how people, buildings and vital national infrastructure such as water, transport, energy and telecommunications networks could be protected from the increasing severity of storms, floods, heatwaves and droughts that are afflicting the UK as a result of global heating. In a damning verdict delivered on Wednesday, the committee found that the government had no credible plan for making the UK resilient to the increasing effects of extreme weather. Julia King, chair of the adaptation subcommittee of the CCC, said: \u201cThe evidence of the damage from climate change has never been clearer, but the UK\u2019s current approach to adaptation is not working.\u201d The national adaptation plan published last July, known as Nap3, was the third in a series of five-yearly updates in response to an assessment of climate risks, required under the 2008 Climate Change Act, from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. But the CCC found that although it was an improvement on previous efforts, the new plan was still inadequate and required improvement before the next scheduled update in 2028. King said: \u201cDefra needs to deliver an immediate strengthening of the government\u2019s programme, with an overhaul of its integration with other government priorities such as net zero and nature restoration. We cannot wait another five years for only incremental improvement.\u201d The CCC found that most of Nap3 was based on existing policy or mechanisms, which were inadequate and ignored more than half of the short-term actions to address urgent risks from extreme weather that had been identified in the latest risk assessment. The report sharply criticised Defra for failing to make adaptation a priority and to work closely with other government departments on the issue. Ministers had also failed to fund adaptation efforts sufficiently, or provide the incentives for private sector investment, the CCC found, and there was too little monitoring and evaluation. Jim Hall, commissioner at the National Infrastructure Commission, pointed out that utilities and other companies were planning to spend about \u00a3400bn on infrastructure by 2030, so it was essential that the need for it to be resilient to extreme weather was taken into account. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a short window to ensure that [the \u00a3400bn spending] is optimised for adaptation and resilience, and government must seize the moment,\u201d he said. Analysts said the reports showed that the government must step up its efforts to protect people, land and infrastructure, or face disaster. Friends of the Earth said it was planning to take the government to court over the inadequacy of its climate plans. The group\u2019s head of policy, Mike Childs, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that government plans to protect people, property and infrastructure from the escalating climate crisis are unfit for purpose and must be improved. Ministers must do more to face up to the reality of climate change, including faster action to end our reliance on costly fossil fuels and a robust plan to help safeguard people\u2019s lives and livelihoods from the consequences of a rapidly warming planet.\u201d Gareth Redmond-King, head of the international programme at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) thinktank, said: \u201cAs this government slows action to tackle climate change, their advisers remind us they\u2019re also doing nothing like enough to adapt to the dangerous impacts from it. Climate impacts are getting worse every year as we heat the planet. Not investing to adapt our infrastructure and services is a bit like not bothering to insure your house: it might save you some money in the short term, but it will cost you an awful lot more when your roof falls in.\u201d The UK should also be helping other nations to adapt, he added. Half of the UK\u2019s food imports come from places around the world likely to bear the brunt of the rapidly changing climate. \u201cIf we don\u2019t support other nations to adapt, then harvests of staples such as rice, bananas and tea will fall, leading to shortages and higher prices,\u201d Redmond-King said. Last month was the hottest February ever recorded globally, and in the UK it was the fourth wettest. Heavy rain is making it difficult for farmers to get crops in the ground, while crop pollination may also suffer as the mild February brought bees early from their winter sleep, only to famish as few blooms were ready. Tom Lancaster, land analyst at ECIU, said: \u201cRelentless rain this winter is likely to lead to a terrible harvest, come the summer. Floods last year hit yields, just as droughts did the year before.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe government\u2019s third national adaptation programme sets out a robust five-year plan to strengthen infrastructure, promote a greener economy and safeguard food production in the face of the climate challenges we face. \u201cWe are investing billions in projects to improve the UK\u2019s climate resilience, including \u00a35.2bn in flood and coastal schemes in England, safeguarding future water supplies by accelerating \u00a32.2bn of investment through our ambitious plan for water, and driving tree planting and peat restoration through the \u00a3750m nature for climate fund. \u201cOur negotiators played an important role at the Cop28 summit to help bring an ambitious global goal on adaptation to life and as a leading nation on climate adaptation, the UK is well placed to achieve these ambitions in full.\u201d"

            "content": "Greta Thunberg has accused Sweden of being \u201cvery good at greenwashing\u201d as she staged a protest along with about 50 other activists outside her home country\u2019s parliament. The activists \u2013 who she said were acting as a group of concerned, largely young individuals rather than representing a particular organisation \u2013 sat outside the main entrance to Sweden\u2019s government buildings in Stockholm on Monday morning in an attempt to stop politicians from getting to work. The action came on a high-stakes day for the Swedish government, with the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, and numerous key figures in Brussels for its official flag-raising ceremony outside Nato headquarters after becoming members last week. The 21-year-old climate activist said: \u201cSweden is unfortunately not unique in completely ignoring the climate crisis, not treating it as an emergency at all. But actively trying to greenwash, deceive and lie in order to make it seem like they are doing enough and that they are moving in the right direction, when in fact the exact opposite is happening.\u201d She added: \u201cSweden in particular is very good at greenwashing and framing themselves as a climate leader, when we have very high emissions per capita if we include all our emissions, including consumption based and biogenic emissions etc and especially if we look at historic emissions. So we are not a climate leader at all.\u201d The Swedish government, a centre-right coalition run by the Moderate party and dependent on the support of the far-right Sweden Democrats, has faced heavy criticism in recent months over how it plans to reach its agreed climate goals with policies that are expected to greatly increase emissions. All over the world, Thunberg said, \u201cpeople seem to be physically incapable of focusing on several things at the same time\u201d. She added: \u201cWe need to be able to tackle the climate crisis in a way that addresses all the other root causes as well and make sure that we have a just transition.\u201d The aim of Monday\u2019s protest against the climate crisis and the people that it is killing, Thunberg said, was to highlight how \u201cthe people in power are ignoring the most affected and activists and young people and the science\u201d. She accused politicians of instead \u201cprioritising short-term economic profits\u201d, which she said was \u201csacrificing human life and the planet in the name of greed\u201d. She said this type of protest marked a first for Sweden, although similar actions had happened in other locations around the world. \u201cThe climate justice movement has for decades tried to get our message across and scientists and the most affected people have been sounding the alarm for even longer than that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the people in power have not been listening, they have been actively ignoring and silence those speaking out.\u201d Climate scientists were also in attendance at the demonstration to show their support. Swedish police, who are understood to be at the protest, have been contacted for comment."

            "date": "2024-03-26T22:21:35Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s main carbon offsets method is a failure on a global scale and doing little if anything to help address the climate crisis, according to a major new study. Research by 11 academics found the most popular technique used to create offsets in Australia, known as \u201chuman-induced regeneration\u201d and pledged to regenerate scrubby outback forests, had mostly not improved tree cover as promised between about 2015 and 2022. The peer-reviewed study, published in the nature journal Communications Earth &amp; Environment, analysed 182 projects in arid and semi-desert areas and found forest cover had either barely grown or gone backwards in nearly 80%. The academics said it meant these projects were therefore not reducing emissions as promised, and polluting companies that bought offsets created through these projects were often not reducing their impact on the climate as they claimed. They said this was a globally significant problem as Australia\u2019s forest regeneration method is the world\u2019s fifth biggest nature-based offsets program, with projects covering nearly 42m hectares, an area larger than Japan. More than 37m carbon credits \u2013 each meant to be worth a tonne of CO2 drawn from the atmosphere and worth between $750m and $1bn \u2013 had been issued for these projects by June last year. The authors of the study include Andrew Macintosh, an environmental law professor at the Australian National University (ANU), a former head of a carbon credit integrity assurance body and more recently a sharp critic of the management of the scheme. Two years ago he described it as a \u201csham\u201d and a fraud on taxpayers and the environment. The researchers said the findings add to growing scientific literature that highlighted \u201cthe practical limitations of offsets and the potential for offset schemes to credit abatement that is non-existent, non-additional and potentially impermanent\u201d. Megan Evans, a senior lecturer in environmental policy at the University of New South Wales in Canberra and a co-author of the new study, said the researchers found there was \u201cnowhere near the forest cover that you should see\u201d given the number of carbon credits issued. \u201cWhat this means is that the projects are not actually sequestering the amount of carbon claimed, and we\u2019ve got a whole bunch of carbon credits in the system that don\u2019t represent one tonne of CO2,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of these credits are being used to offset heavy emitters under the safeguard mechanism, so we\u2019re not actually reducing carbon emissions at all. The overall outcome is we\u2019re increasing the amount of carbon pollution. \u201cWe\u2019re ultimately getting worse outcomes for the climate than if we didn\u2019t have these [forest regeneration] projects.\u201d The researchers called on the Australian government to stop issuing carbon credits to regeneration projects in uncleared areas \u201cfor the sake of the integrity of Australia\u2019s carbon market and the country\u2019s decarbonisation efforts\u201d. The Clean Energy Regulator, which manages the scheme, said it had confidence in the integrity of the carbon credit scheme and the human-induced regeneration method. \u201cA number of reviews have confirmed the integrity of the HIR method,\u201d a spokesperson said. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen told the ABC\u2019s RN Breakfast on Wednesday that a review of the carbon credit scheme that he commissioned from Ian Chubb, a former Australian chief scientist, had backed the integrity of the system. Bowen said Chubb found the scheme was \u201cbasically sound\u201d, but needed some reforms that were being implemented. The Chubb review was not asked to examine individual projects. Bowen said the regulator had also asked Cris Brack, an honorary ANU associate professor and forest researcher, to review the performance of five-year-old projects and found they were \u201cdemonstrating regeneration, and proponents are implementing the project activities\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s been other checks in relation to the significant increase in vegetation that we\u2019re looking for and it has found that increasing vegetation exists,\u201d Bowen said. The carbon credits generated through forest regeneration can be used by companies to meet emissions reductions goals under the safeguard mechanism, a Coalition policy revamped under Labor to require the country\u2019s 215 biggest industrial polluting facilities to reduce their emissions intensity by up to 4.9% a year. The projects analysed in the new paper are mostly in dry outback areas in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. They do not involve tree planting, but are said to regenerate native forests by reducing the impact of grazing by livestock and feral animals. Critics, which have included the Australian Conservation Foundation, say research suggests grazing by livestock and feral animals mostly does not affect \u201cwoody vegetation cover\u201d. The study said the total amount of woody vegetation cover in the areas analysed increased by less than 1% after grazing was reduced. The researchers examined 75 projects that they said, based on the number of credits they received, should have had near 100% forest cover, but found the actual coverage in 2022 was only 21%. This was only a 1.8% increase since the projects were registered, they said. Don Butler, an ANU ecologist who led the statistical analysis, said the changes largely mirrored what happened in nearby areas not included in the projects. David Eldridge, another co-author and a longtime NSW government scientist now at the University of NSW\u2019s Centre for Ecosystem Science, said the results of the study were not a surprise. \u201cThey align perfectly with what decades of research in Australia\u2019s rangelands suggests would occur,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2024-03-20T17:05:48Z",
            "content": "In a move being hailed as one of the most significant climate rules in US history, the Biden administration announced on Wednesday new regulations on tailpipe emissions. The rule, which calls for a 56% reduction in fleetwide average carbon emissions by 2032, constitutes the strictest-ever limit on pollution from the nation\u2019s cars and light trucks. \u201cToday, we\u2019re setting new pollution standards for cars and trucks,\u201d Joe Biden said in a statement. \u201cUS workers will lead the world on autos making clean cars and trucks, each stamped \u2018Made in America\u2019. You have my word.\u201d The new standards do not mandate the sale of particular kinds of vehicles, but they all but ensure a dramatic a dramatic increase in EVs over the next eight years. EVs made up just 7.6% of new car sales last year. But by 2032, the standards will mean EVs make up 35% to 56% of sales, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The new standards form one of the most significant pieces of the White House\u2019s efforts to slash greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation is the largest source of planet-warming emissions in the US, and passenger cars and trucks account for the majority of that pollution. By the time the rule is fully implemented in 2055, it will have cumulatively slashed more than 7bn tons of carbon dioxide emissions, senior administration officials told reporters on Tuesday. It will also tackle toxic pollution, they said, slashing fine particulate emissions by 95% and emissions of NOx and volatile organic compounds by 75%. But the regulation has been weakened since it was first proposed last spring. The final rule would result in the same endpoint \u2013 a 56% reduction in fleetwide average carbon emissions by 2032 from 2026 levels \u2013 but the year-over-year tightening of the pollution standards between 2027 and 2030 will happen at a more gradual pace. The change aligns with asks from auto manufacturers and the United Auto Workers. UAW, which has long noted that EV jobs often pay less than traditional autoworker jobs, last year said the EPA should revise its standards to increase stringency \u201cmore gradually\u201d in an effort to ensure they do not \u201cdisproportionately impact domestic union auto production\u201d. In a Wednesday statement, the union said: \u201cBy taking seriously the concerns of workers and communities, the EPA has created a more feasible emissions rule that protects workers building ICE vehicles, while providing a path forward for automakers to implement the full range of automotive technologies to reduce emissions.\u201d Automakers also applauded the changes. \u201cThe right pace for something this consequential and transformative \u2026 gives us a chance to secure manufacturing and industrial base needed for long term success,\u201d said John Bozzella, president of the automaker trade group Alliance for Automotive Innovation, in an EPA press conference on Wednesday. But critics say the slower cuts will allow automakers to continue selling fossil fuel-powered vehicles longer and will produce more cumulative pollution. \u201cThis rule could\u2019ve been the biggest single step of any nation on climate, but the EPA caved to pressure from big auto, big oil and car dealers, and riddled the plan with loopholes big enough to drive a Ford F150 through,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the safe climate transport campaign at the environmental advocacy group Center for Biological Diversity. Last spring, the EPA projected that electric vehicles would need to make up about two-thirds of car and light truck sales by 2032, up from less than one-tenth in 2023, to meet emissions reduction goals. In a shift from the 2023 proposal, which did not mention plug-in hybrid vehicles, the EPA\u2019s final rule suggests manufacturers achieve the same reduction by ensuring 56% of cars sold are fully electric and 13% are plug-in hybrids by 2032. The move comes after automakers criticized the earlier omission. The EPA says the rule will save the nation $99bn a year, including $46bn in reduced fuel costs and nearly $16bn in auto repair and maintenance. The rule is also expected to prevent 2,500 premature deaths by 2055 thanks to cuts in pollution. Some environmental groups applauded the new limits. \u201cEvery single day, millions of Americans suffer under the weight of vehicle pollution, unsustainable gas prices and the climate crisis, all fueled by tailpipe emissions spewing from gas cars throughout our communities,\u201d said Ben Jealous, executive director of the Sierra Club. \u201cToday, President Biden, in one of the most significant actions his administration can take on climate change, has put forward standards with benefits extending far beyond reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d The new standards, Jealous said, will \u201csave lives and money for families\u201d. Republicans have already launched plans to go after the new regulation. Two GOP lawmakers are preparing a resolution aiming to kill the rule, E&amp;E News reports. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump has said he would repeal Biden\u2019s \u201cinsane electric vehicle mandate\u201d on his first day in office. Senator Joe Manchin, the conservative Democrat from West Virginia, has said he would support Republicans\u2019 efforts to overturn the rule. In a Wednesday statement, he called it \u201creckless and ill-informed\u201d and said it \u201cwill impose what is effectively an EV mandate without ensuring the security of our supply chains from nations like China and without a realistic transition plan that addresses our domestic infrastructure needs\u201d. EV sales are accelerating. Last year, they were up by 54% compared with 2022, which was a 46% increase from 2021, according to Wards Auto Data. \u201cFrom plug-in hybrids to fuel cells to fully electric, drivers have more choices today,\u201d said Biden\u2019s national climate adviser, Ali Zaidi, in emailed statement. \u201cThis growth means jobs, and it means we are moving faster and faster to take on the climate crisis.\u201d Advocates say the rule will benefit communities of color who are more likely to breathe in pollution from roads and highways. \u201cWhile there\u2019s undoubtedly more work ahead to improve our environment, today marks a positive step forward in protecting communities like mine,\u201d Asada Rashidi, environmental justice organizer for the South Ward Environmental Alliance and member of the National Environmental Youth Advisory Council, said at the EPA\u2019s Wednesday press conference. Regan said the rule \u201cmarks a historic win for public health, for the environment and for the future of our country\u201d."

            "content": "The failure to tackle Europe\u2019s \u201crunaway\u201d transport emissions could lead to the sector pumping out nearly half of the continent\u2019s planet-heating pollution by 2030, a report has found. Driven by polluting cars and pushed higher by the growing thirst for flights, transport emissions in Europe have grown 26% since 1990 \u2013 even as efforts to clean up other areas of the economy have led to an overall emissions fall. If policies continue to clean up transport slower than other sectors, such as electricity and industry, the greenhouse gases emitted when Europeans move around could make up 44% of the continent\u2019s total emissions by the end of the decade, according to modelling from the campaign group Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E). Transport was the \u201cproblem child\u201d of Europe\u2019s climate efforts, said William Todts, the executive director of T&amp;E. \u201cThe good news is transport emissions in Europe have peaked. The bad news is other sectors are decarbonising three times faster.\u201d The report estimated that current policies would cut transport emissions by 8% between now and the end of the decade, with legacy car fleets continuing to burn oil, shipowners facing little incentive to run their operations more efficiently, and the expansion of airports and demand for flights offsetting gains from the uptake of greener fuels. It called on policymakers to \u201cmake the job easier\u201d by stopping demand for transport from growing. Among the recommendations in the report were shifting taxes on company cars to speed up the switch to electric vehicles, encouraging the shipping industry to use efficient technologies, cutting down on business flights, and building fewer roads and airports. Giulio Mattioli, a transport researcher at the University of Dortmund who was not involved in the study, said the results of the analysis seemed plausible and the policy recommendations sensible. He said: \u201cThe report highlights something very important, namely that transport emissions have grown over time, unlike emissions in other sectors, and that this growth is mainly due to an increase in travel activity, which has more than offset technological improvements.\u201d \u201cThis is something that is rarely mentioned in public, political and media debates \u2013 and my impression is that the public is largely unaware of this.\u201d The report also found that current policies to cut emissions in the transport sector would not be enough to reach climate neutrality by 2050. Compared with their levels in 1990, which countries have taken as their baseline for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, transport emissions in Europe are on track to fall 25% by 2040 and 62% by 2050. Mattioli said: \u201cSome argue that it is no big deal if transport emissions do not decline or even increase, as we are making progress in other sectors. This report shows that \u2026 this argument will be more and more difficult to defend.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-14T08:53:17Z",
            "content": "The energy company Shell has watered down a key green target as it prepares to defy climate experts by growing its liquified natural gas business and holding its oil production steady until 2030. The company signalled that it may slow the pace of its emissions reductions for this decade by setting a new plan to reduce the carbon emissions intensity of the energy it sells by 15-20% by the end of the decade, compared with its previous target of 20%. The weakened target, which was set out in its latest energy transition strategy, will enable Shell to slow the pace of its emissions reductions in a decade that climatologists have warned is crucial in averting a climate catastrophe. Agathe Masson of the campaign group Reclaim Finance said the \u201cretrograde step\u201d showed once again that Shell had \u201cno interest in acting for the climate\u201d. Climate experts have called on all fossil fuel companies to reduce the emissions from the energy they sell, known as \u201cscope 3 emissions\u201d, by cutting their production of oil and gas. Shell\u2019s targets refer to the carbon intensity of their products, rather than the absolute emissions. This means it could produce more gas at a lower emissions intensity but still raise its total emissions overall as it ramps up production. The strategy update includes a new target to reduce the scope 3 emissions from its oil business by between 15-20% by 2030, compared with 2021 levels. It has not set a scope 3 emissions target for its gas business, which is expected to grow by 50% by 2040. The weaker climate targets were set out alongside Shell\u2019s annual report, which shows its chief executive, Wael Sawan, will take home a pay packet worth almost $10m (\u00a37.94m). His predecessor Ben van Beurden was paid \u00a39.7m in 2022. Jonathan Noronha-Gant, a senior fossil fuels campaigner at the NGO Global Witness, said: \u201cShell\u2019s CEO \u00a38m pay packet is a bitter pill to swallow for the millions of workers living with the high costs of energy. Our reliance on Shell\u2019s dirty oil and gas make them rich whilst the rest of us get poorer.\u201d Last month, Shell revealed an annual profit of more than $28bn for 2023, one of its most profitable years on record, as green activists staged a protest outside the company\u2019s London headquarters. Sawan angered green groups last June, when the company appeared to reverse a plan to reduce Shell\u2019s oil and gas production by 1-2% a year, in pursuit of higher profits. Shell hpromised in 2021 it would reduce its oil output every year for the rest of the decade, from a 2019 peak of 1.9m barrels a day. It claimed it had in fact achieved this target in 2021 after the $9.5bn sale of its stake in a large project in the Permian basin in the US. The sale has helped to reduce its oil production to 1.5m barrels a day. Shell said that was the equivalent of 200,000 barrels of oil and gas production last year. The company plans to start enough fossil fuel projects to add 500,000 barrels a day to its oil and gas production by 2025. The decision to continue investing in fossil fuels goes against advice from climate experts who have said there can be no new oil or gas developments if the world hopes to avoid a climate crisis. The new oil and gas projects would enable Shell to \u201ccontinue providing the energy security that the world needs while delivering cashflow longevity into the future\u201d, according to Sawan."

            "date": "2024-03-22T23:00:06Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s first carbon-neutral cattle sale took place this week. Seven hundred Angus breeding cows and heifers, reared through a \u201ccarbon-neutral farming system\u201d, went under the hammer at the saleyards in Gloucester, a small town three hours\u2019 drive from Sydney, on Thursday. In theory, every cow at the auction has released net zero greenhouse gas emissions from birth to sale day, because the farm has sequestered more carbon than the cattle released. The cattle were bred by fourth-generation farmer Robert MacKenzie. \u201cI\u2019m doing it for my family and to show farmers this is achievable,\u201d he said. \u201cI have two sons that will eventually take on the business \u2026 they are part of a generation where sustainability matters.\u201d For Australia\u2019s red meat industry, which has set a sector-wide net zero emissions goal by 2030, the sale is an important proof of concept: is producing net zero cattle worth the cost? How can a live cow be carbon neutral? Well, the individual animal is still making its natural emissions. But it can, theoretically, be embedded within a supply chain that achieves carbon neutrality. Mackenzie\u2019s cattle operation, Macka\u2019s Pastrol, uses soil carbon sequestration to offset their greenhouse gas emissions, which includes methane released by cattle as well as vehicles and electricity generation. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter In 2022, it employed agronomy consultant Agricore to take soil carbon samples across its 6,500ha holdings. The farm then implemented new management practices including intensive stock rotation, planting a more diverse mix of grass species and targeted organic fertiliser use, which is intended to improve landscape health, boost productivity and increase soil carbon. In 2023, another 1,400 soil samples were taken, showing a 40% average increase in soil carbon, at 540kg Co2 sequestered per hectare. The 2024 results are pending. According to Agricore, this meant the farm had stored more carbon in the ground than the total emissions released by the farm over the same year. This carbon accounting approach is known as \u201cinsetting\u201d, where on-farm carbon sequestration is counted against the farm\u2019s operational emissions to reach net zero. How do you get a farm to net zero? The director of Agricore, Hayden Hollis, said annual soil carbon tests across Mackenzie\u2019s farm were conducted in accordance with Clean Energy Regulator (CER) guidelines. While the regulator\u2019s methodology is widely used by the industry, a consortium of Australian soil scientists have called for flaws in the scheme to be \u201caddressed as a matter of urgency\u201d. Agricore\u2019s data is proprietary and could not be viewed by Guardian Australia. One of those scientists is Dr Elaine Mitchell from the Queensland University of Technology. She says intervals of at least five years are usually required to detect statistically significant soil carbon changes. Prof Richard Eckard, an agricultural economist from the University of Melbourne, said soil carbon should be measured on a 10-year running mean to account for seasonal fluctuations, 70% of which is driven by rainfall patterns. He said success could not be determined until \u201cyou have ironed out the rainfall variability and reflect what is truly management\u201d. The margin of error in sampling was about 20%, Eckard said, with another 10% variation in laboratory analysis. \u201cAnnual changes in soil carbon are just buried in the noise of error in our ability to measure soil carbon.\u201d Can soil carbon sequestration mitigate livestock emissions? Pastures have the potential to store huge amounts of carbon, but these gains are by no means permanent and slow overtime. Like Macka\u2019s Pastoral, Jigsaw Farms in western Victoria inset its livestock emissions to achieve carbon neutrality, but this was only possible for about seven years. Hollis said Mackenzie\u2019s soil carbon project was in its infancy and would continue to see soil carbon gains. \u201cBut like any landscape, there comes a point where we hit capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately that\u2019s just the reality of it.\u201d Once that occurs, Hollis said, the farm would have to find other ways of insetting or reducing its livestock emissions, such as tree plantings and breeding for faster-growing cattle. A global study led by Wageningen University in the Netherlands found that under right conditions \u2013 like the high rainfall area where Macka\u2019s Pastoral is based \u2013 short-term data suggests carbon sequestration can be used to mitigate the grazing system emissions. But it found that over the long term, it is \u201coverly optimistic and could be misleading\u201d and \u201chas a limited role to mitigate climate warming\u201d. Farmers also have the option of using carbon gains to obtain Australian carbon credit units (ACCUs) through the CER with the help of a \u201ccarbon developer\u201d. These credits can then be sold and bought by large polluters as offsets to their own Co2 emissions, or used to inset on-farm emissions and become certified carbon neutral by the government\u2019s Climate Active program. There are now 528 soil carbon projects registered under the ACCU scheme, which has received criticism from scientists. So far seven have been issued credits. What\u2019s the market for carbon-neutral cattle? Coles supermarket stocks a small range of carbon-neutral beef and pork bought directly from producers including Jigsaw Farms, which receive a premium price for their cattle. But the sale at Gloucester is the first public cattle auction marketed by a vendor as carbon neutral. Wynand Snyman, the chief executive of Auctions Plus, the online livestock marketplace that hosted the sale, said livestock emissions reporting was in its infancy. The average price across the sale was $1,753 and the highest price, for heifers pregnancy tested in calf, was $4,300. But buyers were largely attracted to the cattle\u2019s genetics, not their carbon footprint. Farmer Bill McDonald bought 13 of Mckenzie\u2019s cows. \u201cThey were good cattle with good genetics at the end of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m working towards being carbon neutral too, so that\u2019s a bonus.\u201d Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community"

            "date": "2024-03-28T13:24:43Z",
            "content": "The Sellafield nuclear waste dump is to be prosecuted for alleged information technology security offences, the industry watchdog has said. The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) said on Thursday that it had notified the state-owned Cumbrian nuclear company that it would be prosecuted under industry security regulations. The prosecution follows the Guardian\u2019s revelations last year of multiple cyber failings at the vast site, part of a year-long investigation into cyber hacking, radioactive contamination and an unhealthy workplace culture at Sellafield. The ONR said: \u201cThese charges relate to alleged information technology security offences during a four-year period between 2019 and early 2023. There is no suggestion that public safety has been compromised as a result of these issues. The decision to begin legal proceedings follows an investigation by ONR, the UK\u2019s independent nuclear regulator.\u201d Sellafield, which has more than 11,000 staff, was placed into a form of \u201cspecial measures\u201d for consistent failings on cybersecurity in 2022, according to sources at the ONR and the security services. Among the Guardian\u2019s revelations in December were that groups linked to Russia and China had penetrated its computer networks, embedding sleeper malware that could lurk and be used to spy or attack systems. At the time Sellafield said it did not have evidence of a successful cyber-attack. The site has the largest store of plutonium in the world and is a sprawling rubbish dump for nuclear waste from weapons programmes and decades of atomic power generation. Other findings in the Guardian\u2019s Nuclear Leaks investigation included concerns about external contractors being able to plug memory sticks into its computer system while unsupervised. The Guardian also revealed that cyber problems have been known by senior figures at the nuclear site for at least a decade, according to a report dated from 2012, which warned there were \u201ccritical security vulnerabilities\u201d that needed to be addressed urgently. Sellafield\u2019s computer servers were deemed so insecure that the problem was nicknamed Voldemort after the Harry Potter villain, according to a government official familiar with the ONR investigation and IT failings at the site, because it was so sensitive and dangerous. At the time, Sellafield said that \u201call of our systems and servers have multiple layers of protection\u201d. \u201cCritical networks that enable us to operate safely are isolated from our general IT network, meaning an attack on our IT system would not penetrate these,\u201d it said. This week, the Guardian revealed that Richard Meal, Sellafield\u2019s chief information security officer, is to leave the site after more than a decade. He will be the second senior leader to leave this year, after the top director responsible for safety and security, Mark Neate, announced in January that he planned to leave. In January, Sellafield appointed Graeme Slater as its chief digital information officer, responsible for cybersecurity. The ONR said details of the first court hearing would be announced \u201cwhen available\u201d. Britain\u2019s public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, last month launched an investigation into risks and costs at Sellafield. A spokesperson at the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, which funds Sellafield, said: \u201cSafety and security at our former nuclear sites is paramount and we fully support the Office for Nuclear Regulation in its independent role as regulator. \u201cThe regulator has made clear that there is no suggestion that public safety has been compromised at Sellafield. Since the period of this prosecution, we have seen a change of leadership at Sellafield and the ONR has noted a clear commitment to address its concerns.\u201d Sellafield said: \u201cThe Office for Nuclear Regulation\u2019s Civil Nuclear Security and Safeguards has notified us of its intention to prosecute the company relating to alleged past nuclear industry security regulations compliance. \u201cAs the issue is now the subject of active court proceedings, we are unable to comment further.\u201d"

            "content": "McDonald\u2019s restaurants in multiple countries including the UK and Australia have been hit by a \u201ctechnology outage\u201d, which the fast food chain denied had been caused by a cybersecurity attack. Australia, the UK, Japan and China were among the markets where services were affected, with restaurant, drive-through and online orders hit. In the UK, one franchise owner operating 21 branches in the Midlands told the BBC that for a 90-minute period on Friday they \u201ccouldn\u2019t serve anyone\u201d. In Hong Kong, the McDonald\u2019s Facebook page said self-ordering kiosks and mobile phone orders were \u201cnot functioning\u201d and asked customers to order at the restaurant counter. McDonald\u2019s said the outage occurred at about 5am in the UK (1200 CDT in the US) and that \u201cmany markets\u201d were back online by Friday afternoon although some were still \u201cin the process of coming back online\u201d. The company\u2019s global chief information officer, Brian Rice, said the problem was not due to a cyber-attack. He indicated it was due to an unspecified change to IT systems run by an outside contractor for McDonalds, blaming a \u201cthird-party provider during a configuration change\u201d. \u201cWhat happened today has been an exception to the norm, and we are working with absolute urgency to resolve it,\u201d Rice wrote in a message to McDonald\u2019s employees and franchise partners. McDonald\u2019s has about 40,000 outlets worldwide, with more than 14,000 stores in the US. A UK spokesperson for McDonald\u2019s said the outage affecting restaurants had been \u201cresolved\u201d in the UK and Ireland. In the UK, the Downdetector site, which flags outages on apps, reported more than 1,000 outages on the McDonald\u2019s app on Friday between 6am and 3pm with a spike around 7am. In a post to social media platform X, a customer in Australia said it was \u201cimpossible to buy anything\u201d via drive-through or online. McDonald\u2019s spokesperson in Australia said the problem had affected restaurants \u201cnationwide\u201d but all outlets had since reopened. Japan was also hit, with McDonald\u2019s Japan\u2019s X account confirming there was a \u201csystem failure\u201d impacting stores. \u201cWe apologise for any inconvenience this may cause and ask that you please wait for a while until the service is restored,\u201d a translation of the social media post read. Many McDonald\u2019s outlets in Japan stopped taking in-person and mobile customer orders because of a system disruption, according to a spokesperson. McDonald\u2019s has almost 3,000 outlets in the country. In China, the hashtag \u201cMcDonald\u2019s collapsed\u201d was the fifth most popular search term on the country\u2019s Weibo social media platform on Friday afternoon. McDonald\u2019s is one of the most popular western fast food chains in China, with more than 5,000 stores. However, it\u2019s main rival, KFC, has nearly double that number. McDonald\u2019s posted an update on Weibo on Friday saying the problem had been fixed, adding: \u201cLove having you back!\u201d But several people commented that they had already bought a KFC meal instead. There were also unconfirmed reports from social media users of problems in Germany and New Zealand, as well as news reports of problems in Sweden."

            "date": "2024-03-29T04:30:29Z",
            "content": "With the announcement that the UK government would be imposing sanctions on two individuals and one entity accused of targeting \u2013 without success \u2013 UK parliamentarians in cyber-attacks in 2021, the phrase \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d comes to mind. But that would underestimate the iceberg. James Cleverly, the home secretary, said the sanctions were a sign that \u201ctargeting our elected representatives and electoral processes will never go unchallenged\u201d. But some experts saw it as a sign that the UK had been pushed into a corner by a decision in Washington to indict seven individuals associated with the hacking outfit known as APT31, who are accused of engaging in a \u201cprolific global hacking operation\u201d that sent more than 10,000 malicious emails to politicians, officials, journalists and critics of China across several continents. The sanctions \u201cwon\u2019t make a blind bit of difference\u201d to the UK\u2019s cybersecurity, according to Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at the University of Surrey, who said they were \u201cthe equivalent of sending a stiffly worded letter\u201d. The UK government \u201chave got to say something because the Americans are saying something, but still don\u2019t want to upset the Chinese\u201d. The government revealed the historical hacking attempts on the same day that it pointed the finger at a \u201cChinese state-affiliated entity\u201d for compromising the Electoral Commission\u2019s systems between 2021 and 2022. The Chinese embassy in London said the UK\u2019s statement was \u201ccompletely unfounded and constitutes malicious slander\u201d. But the UK did not accuse any of the sanctioned entities of being involved in that breach. The government has \u201cconflated two separate issues in a way that is quite confusing to the general public\u201d, said Jamie MacColl, a research fellow in cybersecurity at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank. Part of the reason that the UK\u2019s response is seen by some as being weak and confusing is that Chinese hacking attempts are not isolated events. Rather, they constitute the ecosystem in which all western governments must navigate their relationships with Beijing. In a report published on 27 March, Google said China \u201ccontinues to lead the way for government-backed exploitation\u201d. APT31 alone has been linked to hacks in France, Finland and of Microsoft, while New Zealand said this week that another well-known Chinese hacking outfit, APT40, attacked its parliament in 2021 (the Chinese embassy in New Zealand denied the allegations). A recent leak of data from the Chinese cybersecurity firm iSoon revealed the extent to which China\u2019s hackers for hire compete for government contracts, sometimes hoovering up data from foreign agencies on spec with the hope of selling it to the highest bidder. In the case of APT31, the US Department of Justice alleges that the hacking operation was directly run by a provincial department of China\u2019s ministry of state security. But in general, said Mei Danowski, a China cybersecurity expert and author of the Natto Thoughts newsletter, nearly every cybersecurity firm in China would have some sort of contract with government clients. With a cybersecurity industry worth an estimated $13bn (\u00a310.3bn), that is a lot of potential hackers. That leaves western governments struggling to coordinate an effective response to hacks or hacking attempts. In many cases, the Chinese government has plausible deniability about responsibility, and it is not always clear what the impact of data breaches are. Audrye Wong, an assistant professor at the University of Southern California, said that while Russian-based hacks often \u201csow discord and chaos\u201d, China was \u201cmore cautious\u201d and \u201cstill very much cares about shaping perceptions of China and the Chinese Communist party\u201d. Many western international security experts refer to the maxim that while Russia may be the storm, China is climate change. Danowski says that since the US indicted hackers associated with a company called Chengdu 404 in 2020, its business operations in China have carried on as normal, suggesting that the \u201cname and shame\u201d tactic adopted by the US and the UK this week may be symbolic at best. And while China says it has \u201cno interest or need to meddle in the UK\u2019s internal affairs\u201d, some cybersecurity experts note that gathering information on foreign states is the bread and butter of every country\u2019s intelligence operations \u2013 in other words, spies spy. Reuters recently reported that Donald Trump, while president, had authorised a covert CIA operation on Chinese social media to turn Chinese public opinion against Beijing, in an operation that may still be active. If Chinese cyber-attacks lead to \u201cthe harassment of dissidents, I could see why sanctions would be justified\u201d, said MacColl. \u201cBut from my perspective the activity that\u2019s been named is predominantly political espionage.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-27T16:21:45Z",
            "content": "A former Royal Air Force officer who has led Sellafield\u2019s information security for more than a decade is to leave the vast nuclear waste site in north-west England, it can be revealed. Richard Meal, who is chief information security officer at the Cumbrian site, is to leave later this year. Meal will be the second senior leader to depart the organisation this year, after the top director responsible for safety and security \u2013 Mark Neate \u2013 announced in January that he planned to leave. His imminent departure follows several safety and cybersecurity failings, as well as claims of a \u201ctoxic\u201d working culture, that were revealed in Nuclear Leaks, a year-long Guardian investigation into Sellafield, late last year. Sellafield said no staff departures were linked to the revelations. Sellafield, which has more than 11,000 staff, was placed into a form of \u201cspecial measures\u201d in 2022 for consistent failings on cybersecurity, according to sources at the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the security services. Sellafield said it did not have evidence of a successful cyber-attack after the Guardian revealed that groups linked to Russia and China had penetrated its networks. Meal joined Sellafield, the nuclear waste and decommissioning site in Cumbria that is also the world\u2019s largest store of plutonium, in late 2013. In his early career, he spent nearly two decades in the Royal Air Force in security positions until 2005. He then held a string of consultancy roles, including at industry giant KPMG. In 2016, Meal told Sellafield\u2019s in-house magazine that the cost of getting cybersecurity measures wrong was \u201chuge\u201d. \u201cFrom a financial level, the cost of returning a plant to service if it was shut down could be in the millions of pounds. That\u2019s before you consider the operational impact on delivering our mission, and the need to manage safety and reputational issues,\u201d he said. Last year, Meal was appointed to the North West Cyber Resilience Centre\u2019s guidance council, which helps businesses across the region protect themselves against the threat of cybercrime. It is chaired by Andrew Snowden, the police and crime commissioner for Lancashire. In response to the Guardian\u2019s investigation, the energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, said the reports were \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and wrote to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), the state-owned body that ultimately runs Sellafield, demanding a \u201cfull explanation\u201d. In his response, the NDA\u2019s chief executive, David Peattie, said there had been \u201cnecessary changes to the leadership, governance, and risk management of cyber\u201d and responsibility for its cyber function had been moved. A new head of cybersecurity took up the role in January. Sellafield declined to name the new appointee. On announcing his departure, Neate said that he had decided last year \u201cthat 2024 was the right time for me to move on\u201d. He will be replaced this week by the current head of the site\u2019s \u201cspent fuel management value stream\u201d, James Millington, on an interim basis. Separately, Nic Westcott, the former Openreach and Severn Trent executive, was seconded from Nuclear Waste Services in January as interim chief people officer. In its latest annual report, the ONR stated that \u201cimprovements are required\u201d from Sellafield and other sites in order to address cybersecurity risks. It also confirmed that the site was in \u201csignificantly enhanced attention\u201d for this activity. A spokesperson for Sellafield said: \u201cWe take cybersecurity extremely seriously at Sellafield. We work with our regulators to continuously review and improve where required.\u201d The spokesperson said: \u201cWe have not initiated or conducted an investigation nor have we made any personnel changes as a result of the Guardian\u2019s allegations.\u201d Britain\u2019s public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, last month launched an investigation into risks and costs at Sellafield. The Nuclear Leaks series detailed concerns over cracks in the concrete and asphalt skin of a toxic point known as the First Generation Magnox storage pond or informally as \u201cDirty 30\u201d. This week, Sellafield said that the building had been \u201cprioritised for cleanup\u201d by the NDA and that the first \u201czeolite skip\u201d \u2013 containers used to absorb radiation in the 1970s and 1980s \u2013 had been removed and placed in a shielded box. Separately, Sellafield released its gender pay report for the year to 5 April 2023, which showed the median gender pay gap had risen to 13.7% from 11.3% a year earlier. The proportion of women in the upper quartile of its pay scale was static, at 18%. Sellafield issued a range of responses to the Guardian\u2019s initial reports into its cybersecurity, safety and cultural issues, which it published online."

            "date": "2024-03-25T19:14:49Z",
            "content": "In March last year an integrated review of the UK\u2019s defence and foreign policy said it would protect the country\u2019s \u201cdemocratic freedoms\u201d from Chinese state attacks. A few months later the Electoral Commission confirmed why democratic institutions and processes were on the threat list as it revealed that a cyber-attack \u2013 by a then unidentified assailant \u2013 had accessed the data of 40 million voters. On Monday the UK government said an unnamed Chinese state-backed actor was behind the sortie and that a Beijing-affiliated group, called APT31, was likely to have been responsible for targeting the email accounts of four British parliamentarians who have been critical of China. The list of targets cited by the integrated review went beyond democratic institutions and processes however, and outlined the scale of the Chinese cyber-threat. The economy, critical national infrastructure and supply chains were also mentioned. Last year the all-party intelligence and security committee of parliament said China had the resources to target the UK \u201cprolifically and aggressively\u201d, referring to \u201chundreds of thousands of civil intelligence officers\u201d and a \u201chighly capable and increasingly sophisticated cyber-espionage operation\u201d. The Electoral Commission was just the latest target of a data-gathering operation that is global and is \u201cbeing done on an industrial scale\u201d, according to Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University. While names and addresses on their own are not enough to pose a substantial threat to electoral integrity, they could be combined with other data to target specific voters in swing seats, he said. \u201cThe attackers were able to walk off with what on the face of it does not sound like high-value data. But when you combine it with information elsewhere, like social media accounts, you can start to narrow it down to specific individuals or groups that should be targeted,\u201d he said. In a recent report, the US cybersecurity firm Secureworks said it had seen Chinese hackers attack organisations around the world deemed a high priority for Beijing\u2019s economic strategy including biotechnology, aerospace, renewable energy and microchips. The aim of the attacks was to secure data and intellectual property. Defence industry supply chains in the western world have also been targeted. In 2022 the director of the FBI, Christopher Wray, warned western companies that China was trying to \u201cransack\u201d their intellectual property. In the same year a Chinese government intelligence officer was sentenced to 20 years in prison in the US for crimes including an attempt to steal aircraft engine technology from General Electric. Don Smith, the vice-president of threat research at Secureworks, said China could run the \u201cfull gamut\u201d of cyber operations. The latest incidents outlined by the UK government on Monday were consistent with a wide-ranging strategy, he added, which covers intellectual property theft, targeting rival states such as the UK and attacking non-governmental organisations. \u201cThe Chinese are involved in the full gamut of cyber operations,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThese range from traditional cyber-espionage for reasons of national security, to carrying out cyber-espionage for commercial advantage and targeting those perceived to be enemies of the Chinese state.\u201d In a statement on Monday, the US deputy attorney general, Lisa Monaco, said China\u2019s global hacking operation aimed to \u201crepress critics of the Chinese regime, compromise government institutions and steal trade secrets\u201d, as the US charged seven alleged Chinese hackers with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions and wire fraud in a day of joint action with the UK. China wants to be a world-leading power in the field of artificial intelligence. According to some observers, this could be where the Electoral Commission hack, and others like it, have serious consequences as half the world heads to the polls this year. Darktrace, a British cybersecurity firm, said on Monday the adoption of generative artificial intelligence \u2013 which can create plausible audio, text and image from a simple hand-typed prompt \u2013 has the potential to \u201cincrease levels of disruption and allow for more sophisticated techniques to sow misinformation, access sensitive information and influence voters\u201d. Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, said on Monday the UK \u201cwill not hesitate to take swift and robust actions wherever the Chinese government threatens the United Kingdom\u2019s interests.\u201d Those threats will undoubtedly continue \u2013 and not just for the UK."

            "content": "The US economy is the strongest in the world and Joe Biden was right to say so in his State of the Union address, a rightwing Republican economist allied to Donald Trump and a co-author of a plan to reshape the federal government said on Friday morning. \u201cLet me just say one thing positive about where we are right now,\u201d Stephen Moore told Fox Business. \u201cOne thing that Biden said last night was true. It is true that the United States today has the strongest economy. There is no question about it. \u201cIf you look at what\u2019s happening in Europe today, Germany, Britain, France, if you look at Japan and China, they\u2019re not growing. And so it is true \u2026 the way I like to put it is we are the least rotten apple in the cart and that\u2019s something that\u2019s important to cheer.\u201d It was a surprising statement from Moore, who Trump tried to put on the Federal Reserve board in 2019, only for widely reported issues arising from his tax and legal affairs to prompt his withdrawal. A liberal watchdog recently labeled Moore an \u201cextremist\u201d, in relation to his work on Project 2025, a sprawling plan to stock the US government with rightwingers and reshape public policy should Trump defeat Biden in November. A member of hard-right groups including the Heritage Foundation, FreedomWorks and the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, Moore is also a regular analyst for Fox. On Friday, the Guardian asked Moore if he credited Biden for the strong economy, as was further expressed by strong February jobs numbers released that morning. Moore said: \u201cNo I don\u2019t credit Biden for the economy. \u201cIt IS true that we have the strongest economy, but as I said, we are the least rotten apple in the cart. Most of the rest of the world is in recession.\u201d Asked who he did credit for such a strong US economy, if not the president who has supervised it for three years, Moore did not immediately reply. Economic conditions are vital in every presidential election. Allan Lichtman, a professor at American University in Washington who has correctly predicted the winner of each presidential election since 1984, said recently Biden was leading Trump on five key measures, one being long-term economic trends. Nonetheless, as his rematch with Donald Trump gets into gear, Biden must combat polling showing voters do not believe the economy is working for them."

            "date": "2024-03-12T08:29:48Z",
            "content": "By historical standards Britain\u2019s current recession is a mild one, but even so weak activity is starting to take its toll on the labour market. Nothing dramatic is happening. Unemployment is up a bit but the jobless rate remains below 4%. The number of people employed fell slightly and job vacancies continued to decrease, although the total of 908,000 remains above pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, as the annual inflation rate has fallen so pay growth has moderated too. For the time being at least workers\u2019 living standards are rising because wages are rising more rapidly than prices. The big picture is that the labour market is still relatively tight given the fact that the economy has been moving sideways for the best part of two years. There has been no large-scale job shedding and there are still shortages of workers in many sectors. In anticipation of the recession being short-lived, employers are hanging on to their existing staff because they are worried they will have problems recruiting when the economy does start to pick up. So while pay levels are coming down, they are probably not coming down quickly enough to prompt the Bank of England into an immediate cut in interest rates. Private sector regular pay \u2013 an indicator closely watched by Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee \u2013 was 6.1% higher in the three months ending January 2024 than in the same quarter a year earlier. That is well down on last summer\u2019s peak of 8.2% but slightly higher than the Bank has been forecasting. With inflation poised to fall from 4% to about 2% within the next few months, further moderation in earnings growth is likely. Even so, the latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggests the structural labour market problems remain unresolved. As Tony Wilson, the director of the Institute for Employment Studies thinktank points out, at 75% the UK\u2019s employment rate for those aged 16 to 64 is a percentage point lower than it was before the arrival of the pandemic four years ago even though unemployment has fallen back to where it was pre-Covid. \u201cSo as has been the story in previous months, there are fewer people in work because there are more people outside the labour force altogether \u2013 not looking or not available for work. In all, there are well over half a million more people out of work than before the pandemic began,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThis is being driven by more young people and older people outside the labour force, and in particular because of more people reporting long-term health conditions that stop them from working.\u201d That is not good for those who are not well enough to work. It is not good for the economy either."

            "date": "2024-03-11T19:44:22Z",
            "content": "New laws designed to improve the rights of gig economy workers in the EU contracted to companies such as Uber have been saved from oblivion after they won the majority backing of member states. The legislation had been blocked by a group of countries last month, when France said it could not support the text on the table and Germany abstained. But on Monday, a compromise text pushed by Belgium got the law over the line, giving it one final chance of being passed before legislative procedures are timed out due to the looming EU parliamentary elections. The Belgian presidency announced the breakthrough during a summit of employment, social affairs and health ministers in Brussels. \u201cBetter working conditions for those delivering your meal at home. Ministers just approved the compromise text on the platform work directive,\u201d it said in a tweet. Pierre-Yves Dermagne, the Belgian deputy prime minister and minister for the economy and employment, said: \u201cWe have taken this historic step, so the message is workers are being heard.\u201d He said the law \u201cwas one of the Belgian presidency\u2019s top priorities\u201d and would improve the working conditions of the 28 million people employed as gig workers in the EU by allowing the \u201creclassification of those bogus self employed persons\u201d. Two years in the making, the directive is designed to give taxi and delivery drivers, such as those working for Uber and Deliveroo, rights similar to those full employees enjoy, including holidays, sick pay and the minimum wage. Under the new laws the default status of gig workers will be as employees and the onus will be on employers to prove they are not, if they so wish. Brussels has previously estimated that this could affect about 5.5 million of the 28 million workers using gig economy platforms. Mark MacGann, the whistleblower who leaked more than 124,000 Uber documents to the Guardian, in part because he believed it misrepresented the economic benefits to drivers of the company\u2019s gig economy model, said: \u201cMillions of platform workers across the EU have waited almost a decade to get governments to recognise their basic human rights. This legislation is an overdue but welcome step in the right direction.\u201d An Uber spokesperson said: \u201cEU lawmakers have voted to maintain the status quo today, with platform worker status continuing to be decided country-to-country and court-to-court. Uber now calls on EU countries to introduce national laws that give platform workers the protections they deserve while maintaining the independence they prefer.\u201d It is understood that four countries \u2013 France, Germany, Estonia and Greece \u2013 said as recently as February that they could not support the text. However, after Estonia and Greece indicated their support at the minister\u2019s meeting, a breakthrough that tipped the balance in favour of the laws. The EU jobs commissioner, Nicolas Schmit, said: \u201cOne member state surprised us by joining the qualified majority at the last moment \u2013 of course that was great news.\u201d Schmit added that the law had much wider scope beyond taxi drivers and food delivery riders who had previously been dismissed as \u201cyoung people with bikes\u201d but were \u201cworkers with precarious jobs\u201d who must \u201cnot be deprived of their rights\u201d. The deal will also give workers the right not to be managed by algorithm, as well as future-proof employment law against employment rights being determined by artificial intelligence, something ministers said was a world first."

            "content": "What kind of society do we want? The most obvious answer is simple: we want people to be happy. We want our children to be as happy as possible, so why not everyone else? The goal should be a world where people enjoy their lives, and feel satisfied and fulfilled. This noble idea was born in the 18th-century Enlightenment. It was probably the most important idea of the modern age. Yet somehow it is seldom talked of today in debates about our future. Some people say it is too ambitious; others say it is not ambitious enough. It is neither. We simply want to make people as happy as possible. And, especially, we want to reduce misery. This should be the goal of every government and every one of us. More than 200 years ago, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \u201cThe care of human life and happiness \u2026 is the first and only legitimate object of good government.\u201d Why else would we have a government than to give us a fairly distributed, better quality of life? But what chance is there of politicians embracing this goal? Fortunately, it is in their interest to do so. The people\u2019s life satisfaction is the best predictor of whether the governing party (or parties) gets re-elected. It is a better predictor than economic growth, unemployment or inflation. That is what evidence in national elections in Europe since the 1970s and in recent US presidential elections shows. It\u2019s not \u201cthe economy, stupid\u201d. It\u2019s people\u2019s wellbeing. Keir Starmer gets this. He has promised: \u201cWith every pound spent on your behalf we would expect the Treasury to weigh not just its effect on national income but also its effect on wellbeing.\u201d This should lead to big changes in national spending priorities. The new science of wellbeing tells us a lot about how policies affect people\u2019s wellbeing. We can then compare this benefit with a policy\u2019s cost and choose those policies that give the highest bang for the buck \u2013 ie the most wellbeing for each pound spent. Mental health emerges as a high priority: The service provided by NHS talking therapies is a success because it saves more than it costs. But we desperately need a parallel service for adults with addiction or personality disorders, who get very little therapy. Similarly, mental health support in schools has been severely held back by lack of funding. It needs a better deal. Altogether the government spends less than \u00a32bn a year on psychological therapy. By contrast, roads and railways transport gets close to \u00a362bn. Yet an extra pound spent on therapy makes much more positive difference to people\u2019s lives than a pound spent on road or rail. Similarly, we shamelessly neglect the post-school education of people who do not go to university. They need guaranteed access to an apprenticeship, provided they are qualified. And so on. We spend too much on things relative to what we spend on people. A major rethink is needed across the field of public spending. The same is true for other organisations. They should be justified by how they contribute to human wellbeing. Schools should not be exam factories; they should be places where young people learn the skills of a life that satisfies and contributes to the wellbeing of others. There are excellent curriculums, such as Healthy Minds in secondary schools, that have proven impacts on wellbeing. Similarly, employers should give more weight to the wellbeing of their workers. What matters most is our own personal goals. In the dominant culture today, the overarching goal is individual success, compared with other people (better grades, better jobs, better income). But this is a zero-sum game. For every winner there is a loser. So however hard people try, overall total wellbeing doesn\u2019t change. But we can be happier if our individual aim is to make others happy and we derive much of our own happiness from doing that. We need that positive-sum goal and countries with high levels of social support and trust (such as the Nordic countries) are indeed happier. It\u2019s not enough for philosophers to say we have \u201creciprocal obligations\u201d to each other. We must say what those obligations are \u2013 to help other people to be happy. That is the message of the Action for Happiness movement. Its members pledge to \u201ccreate more happiness and less unhappiness in the world\u201d. And it provides wonderful materials and meetings to help people live this way. The UN International Day of Happiness takes place on 20 March, when many of us will celebrate at the World Happiness Summit in London. As the general election approaches, let\u2019s ask every politician: \u201cWhat is the goal your party is offering to the country?\u201d Above all, let each of us be, as best we can, a creator of happiness \u2013 as the Como Wellbeing Manifesto put it, let\u2019s put wellbeing first. \u2022 Richard Layard is co-author of Can We Be Happier? and Wellbeing: Science and Policy. The World Happiness Summit is on 19-20 March at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, South Bank, London SE1"

Steve Reed said the measure would save billions of pounds and also protect the environment from mining and other negative actions. He was speaking at the Restitch conference in Coventry, held by the thinktank Create Streets. Labour is finalising its agenda for green renewal and Reed indicated a zero-waste economy would be part of this. This would mean the amount of waste going to landfill would be drastically reduced and valuable raw materials including plastic, glass and minerals reused, which would save money for businesses who would not have to buy, import or create raw materials. Reed said the Conservative government made this pledge in 2011 but little progress had been made towards it: \u201cThe government published a strategy, but they failed to do very much with it.\u201d Reed said a zero-waste economy was achievable and that other comparable countries were aiming for it by 2050: \u201cA series of other countries \u2013 the Netherlands, Belgium \u2013 smaller than us but similar in many respects, have got objectives to become zero-waste economies by 2050 and that has huge economic benefits.

He said the measure did not require a large amount of public investment because the government could work with businesses who would then benefit from having cheaper materials with which to make their goods. Reed said the measure had \u201cbenefit after benefit after benefit\u201d. \u201cRegulation would give businesses the confidence to invest in their facilities and they can be reusing materials rather than mining and using brand new materials.

            "date": "2024-03-11T13:00:29Z",
            "content": "A coalition of progressive organizations has announced a fundraising, lobbying and organizing effort to counter the influx of spending by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) into primary campaigns against progressive Democrats. The effort, called Reject Aipac, is in part a response to the ongoing congressional support for Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza, which has claimed more than 30,000 Palestinian lives since 7 October, when Hamas killed 1,200 people in Israel. Among the groups involved in the campaign are the progressive group Justice Democrats, the advocacy arm of Jewish Voice for Peace and the Sunrise Movement climate organization. \u201cWe have watched as Aipac has done everything it can to silence growing dissent in Congress against Netanyahu\u2019s assault on Gaza,\u201d said the coalition in a statement, \u201ceven as Democratic voters overwhelmingly support a ceasefire and oppose sending more blank checks to the Israeli military.\u201d Founded in the 1950s, Aipac stayed out of the fray during election campaigns for most of its existence, focusing its efforts instead on shoring up bipartisan support for Israel in Congress \u2013 with a focus on military spending. That has changed in recent years. The organization formed a political action committee of its own in 2021 \u2013 and has ramped up campaign funding through its Super Pac, the United Democracy Project (UDP), taking particular aim against progressive Democratic candidates. During the 2022 election cycle, the UDP spent lavishly in support of candidates running against progressive Democrats \u2013 in particular, progressives who spoke out about Palestinian rights and aligned themselves with the \u201cSquad\u201d, a group of progressive House representatives. The group spent $2.3m on the Democratic Pennsylvania primary contest between Congresswoman Summer Lee and her opponent Steve Irwin, who served as a Republican congressional staffer before becoming a Democrat. Lee won, but the race was one of the closest in the nation and Aipac is reportedly in communication with her opponent in the 2024 election, Bhavini Patel, whose campaign has also been linked to Hindu nationalist groups. During the same cycle, Aipac poured millions into a primary campaign against the then congressman Andy Levin \u2013 a progressive former synagogue president and self-described Zionist in Michigan who is a vocal defender of Palestinian rights. Levin lost to Haley Stevens, who has consistently pushed for US military support for Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza. Now, the organization is expected to drop $100m during the 2024 election cycle in an effort to oust candidates it views as insufficiently pro-Israel \u2013 while J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group that in 2022 spent in defense of some candidates Aipac attacked, will reportedly be backing away from that role in 2024. A 2023 Guardian analysis found that the members of Congress who were the most supportive of Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza during the first six weeks of the war were also politicians who had benefited from donations from pro-Israel groups like Aipac. Organizers with Reject Aipac say the coalition, which plans to launch a \u201cseven-figure electoral defense campaign\u201d, was formed to disrupt the foreign policy influence that the pro-Israel group exerts in Congress. Members of the group say it is also an attempt to highlight the alliance that Aipac has had with the far right in recent years. Among the top funders of Aipac-affiliated lobbying and fundraising groups are Republican mega donors and Donald Trump supporters. And the group has endorsed dozens of the same Republicans who attempted to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 presidential election. It\u2019s a connection progressive Democrats have increasingly drawn. \u201cConservative dark money,\u201d wrote Wisconsin congressman Mark Pocan, blasting Aipac on the social media site X (formerly Twitter). \u201cToxic money.\u201d \u201cNo Democratic candidate should take Aipac money or an Aipac endorsement,\u201d said Beth Miller, the political director of JVP Action and a member of the Reject Aipac coalition. \u201cThis is a far-right group \u2013 they\u2019re endorsing insurrectionists, they\u2019re backing extremist, far-right candidates. It should be an embarrassment for any Democratic member of Congress to be taking money or an endorsement from Aipac.\u201d"

            "content": "Most of Joe Biden\u2019s past supporters see him as too old. An 81-year-old president with an unsteady step is a turn-off. But Donald Trump, Biden\u2019s malignant, 77-year-old predecessor, vows to be a dictator for \u201ca day\u201d, calls for suspending the constitution and threatens Nato. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening\u201d, his infamous 2016 shout-out to Vladimir Putin, still haunts us eight years on. Democracy is on the ballot again. Against this bleak backdrop, Sasha Issenberg delivers The Lie Detectives, an examination of disinformation in politics. It is a fitting follow-up to The Victory Lab, his look at GOTV (\u201cgetting out the vote\u201d) which was published weeks before the 2012 US election. Issenberg lectures at UCLA and writes for Monocle. He has covered presidential campaigns for the Boston Globe and he co-founded Votecastr, a private venture designed to track, project and publish real-time results. Voting science, though, is nothing if not tricky. A little after 4pm on election day 2016, hours before polls closed, Votecastr calculations led Slate to pronounce: Hillary Clinton Has to Like Where She Stands in Florida. The Victory Lab and The Lie Detectives are of a piece, focused on the secret sauce of winning campaigns. More than a decade ago, Issenberg gave props to Karl Rove, the architect of George W Bush\u2019s successful election drives, and posited that micro-targeting voters had become key to finishing first. He also observed that ideological conflicts had become marbled through American politics. On that front, there has been an acceleration. These days, January 6 and its aftermath linger but much of the country has moved on, averting its gaze or embracing alternative facts. In 2016, Issenberg and Joshua Green of Businessweek spoke to Trump campaign digital gurus who bragged of using the internet to discourage prospective Clinton supporters. \u201cWe have three major voter suppression operations under way,\u201d Issenberg and Green quote a senior official as saying. \u201cThey\u2019re aimed at three groups Clinton needs to win overwhelmingly: idealistic white liberals, young women and African Americans.\u201d It was micro-targeting on steroids. The exchange stuck with Issenberg. \u201cI thought back often to that conversation with the Trump officials in the years that followed,\u201d he writes now. \u201cI observed so much else online that was manufactured and perpetuated with a similarly brazen impunity.\u201d In The Lie Detectives, Issenberg pays particular attention and respect to Jiore Craig and her former colleagues at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, a leading Democratic polling and strategy firm founded by Stan Greenberg, Bill Clinton\u2019s pollster. Issenberg also examines the broader liberal ecosystem and its members, including the billionaire Reid Hoffman, a founder of LinkedIn and PayPal. The far-right former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro and his \u201coffice of hate\u201d come under the microscope too. Craig\u2019s experience included more than a dozen elections across six continents. But until Trump\u2019s triumph, she had not worked on a domestic race. To her, to quote Issenberg, US politics was essentially \u201ca foreign country\u201d. Nonetheless, Craig emerged as the Democrats\u2019 go-to for countering disinformation. \u201cIt was a unique moment in time where everybody who had looked for an answer up until that point had been abundantly wrong,\u201d Craig says. \u201cThe fact that I had to start every race in a new country with the building blocks allowed me to see things that you couldn\u2019t.\u201d No party holds a monopoly on disinformation. In a 2017 special election for US Senate in Alabama, Democratic-aligned consultants launched Project Birmingham, a $100,000 disinformation campaign under which Republicans were urged to cast write-in ballots instead of voting for Roy Moore, the controversial GOP candidate. The project posed as a conservative operation. Eventually, Hoffman acknowledged funding it, but disavowed knowledge of disinformation and said sorry. Doug Jones, the Democrat, won by fewer than 22,000 votes. The write-in total was 22,819. More recently, Steve Kramer, a campaign veteran working for Dean Phillips, a long-shot candidate for the Democratic nomination against Biden, launched an AI-generated robocall that impersonated the president. Comparing himself to Paul Revere and Thomas Paine, patriots who challenged the mother country, Kramer, who also commissioned a deepfake impersonation of Senator Lindsey Graham, said Phillips was not in on the effort. If the sorry little episode showed anything, it showed disinformation is here to stay. Under the headline Disinformation on steroids: is the US prepared for AI\u2019s influence on the election?, a recent Guardian story said: \u201cWithout clear safeguards, the impact of AI on the election might come down to what voters can discern as real and not real.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Free speech is on the line. Last fall, the US court of appeals for the fifth circuit \u2013 \u201cthe Trumpiest court in America\u201d, as Vox put it \u2013 unanimously held that Biden, the surgeon general, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FBI violated the first amendment by seeking to tamp down on Covid-related misinformation. In the court\u2019s view, social media platforms were impermissibly \u201ccoerced\u201d or \u201csignificantly encouraged\u201d to suppress speech government officials viewed as dangerously inaccurate or misleading. The matter remains on appeal, oral argument before the supreme court set for later this month. Issenberg reminds us that Trump\u2019s current presidential campaign has pledged that a second Trump administration will bar government agencies from assisting any effort to \u201clabel domestic speech as mis- or dis-information\u201d. A commitment to free speech? Not exactly. More like Putinism, US-style. According to Kash Patel, a Trump administration veteran and true believer, a second Trump administration will target journalists for prosecution. \u201cWe will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media,\u201d Patel told Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former campaign chair and White House strategist. \u201cYes, we\u2019re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections. We\u2019re going to come after you.\u201d Welcome to the Trump Vengeance tour. The Lie Detectives is published in the US by Columbia University\u2019s Columbia Global Reports"

Tick tock, tick tock \u2026 that\u2019s the sound of time running out for Gen Z\u2019s favourite app. On Wednesday the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill would require the TikTok owner ByteDance to sell the social media platform or get banned in the US. It\u2019s not clear whether the bill would pass in the Senate. However, the White House has said it supports the legislation. All in all, things don\u2019t look great for TikTok. Lawmakers would have you believe that the reason they\u2019re on the warpath when it comes to TikTok is because Beijing-based ByteDance is a national security threat. They\u2019re worried that China is going to do nefarious things with personal user data and that the TikTok algorithm has the ability to unduly influence Americans. It should be noted that while these fears aren\u2019t unfounded, lawmakers\u2019 obsession with the platform being controlled by China seems to ignore the fact that \u2013 as the Financial Times notes \u2013 \u201csome 60% of [ByteDance] is actually owned by \u2018international\u2019 investors, overwhelmingly American\u201d. While the US government may be citing national security as their motivation for clamping down on TikTok, influential model and activist Emily Ratajkowski has other ideas. On Thursday Ratajkowski told her 2.7 milliom TikTok followers that she reckons the government wants to ban the platform because it has become a hub for progressive activism. \u201cBecause this is one of the few platforms that isn\u2019t completely controlled by the US government, or through corporations that have the US government\u2019s interest in mind, progressive politics have been able to blossom on here,\u201d Ratajkowski said. \u201cTikTok is being banned,\u201d she added, \u201cbecause the US government is legitimately scared with the influence that it\u2019s having \u2026 which to me indicates that TikTok is a very powerful tool for organization, for alternative thinking and for activism.\u201d There\u2019s certainly an argument to be made that the US government isn\u2019t pleased with some of the progressive politics popping up on TikTok. Last year, for example, a number of members of Congress, along with some conservative activists and tech investors, expressed their outrage about the amount of pro-Palestinian content on the platform and argued that TikTok\u2019s algorithm was biased towards Palestine. Funnily enough these same people don\u2019t seem to have much to say about reports which show the US mainstream media is biased towards pro-Israel coverage. Nor do these critics seem particularly concerned about reports from the likes of Human Rights Watch which say Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, systemically censors voices in support of Palestine. TikTok, for its part, has said its algorithm isn\u2019t pro-Palestine. Rather, the company noted in a statement, content on the platform simply reflects the fact that it has a young user base and \u201cattitudes among young people skewed toward Palestine long before TikTok existed\u201d. That said, it\u2019s not even clear that there\u2019s more pro-Palestinian content on TikTok than pro-Israel content \u2013 a lot depends on how you interpret that data. Nevertheless, it is certainly perceived to be friendlier towards pro-Palestinian content than other social media platforms. To be clear: I\u2019m not trying to argue that US lawmakers want to ban TikTok just because of pro-Palestinian voices on the platform. Nor am I saying that TikTok is some beacon of progressive values. Far from it. It has a history of censoring LGBT content in certain areas. And, like almost every other social media app out there, it sucks up swathes of your personal data and does god knows what with it. I think it is right to be wary of TikTok\u2019s power and influence and I think everyone should be alarmed at how much power a single app has. But it\u2019s hardly like TikTok is the only worrying social media platform out there is it? If the US government wants to regulate how much influence tech companies have, and the extent to which they can mine our personal data, then they need to do it across the board, rather than singling out one particular platform. Again, I don\u2019t think TikTok is, in itself, a beacon of progressive values. However, Ratajkowski is right in saying it has been a useful platform for a lot of progressive activists. Not just when it comes to Palestine, but also when it comes to issues like abortion, trans rights and anti-racism efforts. In increasingly authoritarian times we need to protect free speech with everything we\u2019ve got. Banning TikTok is a blatant attack on our first amendment rights and the bipartisan support this ban is receiving should worry us all. Cheering on government-led censorship is a dangerous road that doesn\u2019t lead anywhere good. Billy Baldwin attacks Sharon Stone\u2019s sex claims in misogynistic rant Earlier this week Stone told the Louis Theroux podcast that she\u2019d been pressured into sleeping with Baldwin in the 1993 film Silver. Per Stone, the late Robert Evans, who headed production at Paramount, said she should have sex with her co-star to improve his performance. \u201cNot sure why Sharon Stone keep talking about me all these years later?\u201d Baldwin tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cDoes she still have a crush on me or is she still hurt after all these years because I shunned her advances?\u201d He added: \u201cWonder if I should write a book and tell the many, many disturbing, kinky and unprofessional tales about Sharon? That might be fun.\u201d Baldwin (not to be confused with his more successful brother Alec) has had an extremely forgettable career and I\u2019ve got a feeling these sexist tweets are going to end up being what he\u2019s most famous for. Who\u2019s Afraid of Gender? by Judith Butler review \u201cBecause Butler is a human rights activist, as well as a theorist, the urgent point conveyed by this book is the same as it is in all their work,\u201d writes Finn MacKay in a Guardian review of Butler\u2019s new book, which advocates for gender diversity. \u201cWhy are so many people seemingly happy to give away their power to increasingly authoritarian forces? And why are they so confident that this power will never be used against them?\u201d Missouri law prevents divorce during pregnancy \u2013 even in cases of violence This law isn\u2019t new but has recently gained nationwide attention. Partly because Missouri is currently generating a ton of headlines for all the wrong reasons.

            "date": "2024-03-07T05:00:03Z",
            "content": "Like many people, I have had Covid and I have had long Covid. They are very different experiences. I first caught the disease at the start of the pandemic in March 2020, when its effects were relatively unknown. It was unnerving and highly unpredictable. I did not get particularly sick, but I probably gave the virus to my father, who did. Back then, Covid appeared to be the great divider \u2013 the old were far more at risk than the young, and those with pre-existing vulnerabilities most at risk of all \u2013 and the great equaliser. Almost everyone experienced the shock and the fear of discovering a novel killer among us. We soon acquired a shared language and a sense of common purpose: to get through this together \u2013 whatever this turned out to be. I developed long Covid last year, six months after I had caught glandular fever. The fresh bout of the Covid virus made the effects of the glandular fever far worse: more debilitating and much harder to shake. Some mornings it was a struggle to get out of bed, never mind leave the house. It was as though Covid latched on to what was already wrong with me and gave it extra teeth. The experience was unpredictable in a very different way from the drama of getting sick in 2020: not a cosmic lottery, but a drawn-out bout of low-level, private misery. Good days were followed by bad days for no obvious reason, hopes of having recovered were snuffed out just when it seemed like the worst was past. Long Covid is less isolating than being locked down, but it is also a lonelier business than getting ill at the peak of the pandemic was, if only because other people have moved on. The physical and psychological effects of these different versions of Covid \u2013 the short and the long \u2013 are oddly parallel to its political consequences. The disease turns out to be its own metaphor. We are all suffering from political long Covid now. The early drama is over. A series of lingering misfortunes has replaced it. As with long Covid, different countries are suffering in different ways, trapped in their own private miseries. The shock of the new has gone, to be replaced by an enduring sense of fatigue. When the pandemic hit, its effects on politics were intensely felt and hard to predict. In some ways, it seemed like the ultimate stress test. Different political systems \u2013 and leaders \u2013 were exposed in different ways. Those with longstanding vulnerabilities seemed destined to fail. At the same time, the advent of Covid appeared to open up the prospect of new kinds of political solidarity. We were in this together. Covid\u2019s global impact was a reminder of what it is that we all have in common. An acute awareness of our shared vulnerability might create the conditions for a renewed sense of purpose in tackling global problems, including the climate emergency. Maybe a pandemic was just what we needed to remember what was at stake, and to remind some of us how lucky we are. Four years on, the picture looks very different. The immediate experience of the pandemic feels more and more remote, even though public inquiries are now under way, trying to establish just what really happened and who was to blame for what went wrong. Part of the reason for the remoteness is that much of what once looked like high-stakes decision-making has come out in the wash: many outcomes were similar, regardless of the political choices that were made. Maybe it was in the lap of the gods after all. At the same time, the more pernicious but harder to recognise political consequences of Covid are all around us. The immediacy of the threat has passed, but the lingering signs of the damage it did to the body politic are everywhere. The pandemic and its consequences \u2013 lockdowns, economic dislocation, inflation, growing frustration with political elites \u2013 have found out pre-existing weaknesses in our politics and made them worse. It has given what ails us extra teeth. The early days of Covid gave reason to hope that the massive disruption it entailed might also shift the direction of travel of global politics. That hope turned out to be illusory. In the first phase of the pandemic, it looked to have exposed populist grandstanding for what it was: bleach, it turned out, was no sort of viral disinfectant. But populism remains on the rise around the world, feeding off the many discontents of the lockdown years, and of the years that preceded them. Likewise, Covid did not start any major wars \u2013 2020 and 2021 were two of the most peaceful years for international conflict on record. But a post-Covid world is now as militarily dangerous as at any time since the cold war. Covid did not exacerbate climate breakdown: for a short while, carbon emissions fell as economies shut down. But the world is still getting warmer and the hope that tackling the virus would provide a model for more urgent climate action turns out to have been a pipe dream. The pandemic wormed its way into the weak spots in our political life, just as long Covid finds weaknesses in the human body. It no longer galvanises us, nor is it capable of destroying us. Instead, its symptoms are erratic and hard to fathom, appearing in surprising and seemingly unrelated places. Political long Covid is neither the great divider nor the great equaliser. It\u2019s the great destabiliser. * * * During 2020, when the pandemic forced governments around the world to improvise their responses at breakneck speed, it looked as though it would expose some basic truths about the strengths and weaknesses of different political systems. The biggest and most immediate contrast was between autocratic China and the democratic west. Ruthlessness and decisiveness \u2013 which the Chinese political system appeared to possess in abundance \u2013 were the order of the day. The democracies struggled to keep up. In March of that year, after Italy became the first European country to grapple with the question of how to keep its population from infecting one another, the Chinese sent a group of health officials to help advise. The Italians were concerned by the fact that, despite putting draconian lockdowns in place, the virus was still spreading. The Chinese explained the problem. These weren\u2019t actually lockdowns as they understood them. People could still leave their homes for emergencies, enforcement was sporadic, and punishment was relatively light. Meanwhile, in Wuhan, the very centre of the Covid outbreak, armed guards stood outside apartment blocks, curfews were brutally enforced and those with the virus could be barricaded inside their homes. Within a matter of weeks, Italy\u2019s death toll was more than double that of China\u2019s. The biggest contrast with China was the US, where a federal system of executive decision-making, a widespread suspicion of government mandates and an incompetent president meant that Covid soon killed far more people than anywhere else. If the US was the flagship for democracy, then it looked like democracy was failing to answer the call. However, it quickly became clear that the global picture was more complicated than any hastily assembled political morality tale might suggest. New Zealand \u2013 democratic, liberal and with a robustly independent population \u2013 for a long time kept the virus almost completely at bay. The country had the advantage of being an island state that was able to shut its borders. But Britain is also an island, and that made no difference to the government\u2019s ability \u2013 or inability \u2013 to act. Vietnam, which is not an island, did almost as well as New Zealand. Russia did almost as badly as the US. Some of the worst death tolls were in the countries of eastern Europe, such as Bulgaria and Serbia, which had a mixed legacy of authoritarianism and democracy. Dividing the world up by regime types proved little. Demography turned out to be as important as politics: elderly, unhealthy populations suffered more. Equally, any geopolitical morality tales concealed a more complex set of tradeoffs. A zero-Covid policy, ruthlessly enforced as in China, turned out to be storing up trouble for the future. Even with the advent of effective vaccines \u2013 and China\u2019s homegrown versions turned out to be less effective than elsewhere \u2013 too many of China\u2019s population remained unprotected from the virus and the much-delayed economic opening left them exposed. China has also displayed a longstanding weakness of autocratic systems: an absence of transparency means we don\u2019t know the ultimate death toll there, because they are not telling. It is simply not possible to compare it with other countries. The wider tradeoffs \u2013 the toll that lockdowns have taken on mental health, on treatment for other illnesses, on educational prospects for the children worst affected \u2013 make it hard to draw any clear political lessons. Sweden, which was heralded \u2013 and viciously derided \u2013 for providing a real-time experiment in the efficacy of non-lockdown policies, now presents as mixed a picture as anywhere else: more Covid-related deaths than its Scandinavian neighbours (2,576 deaths per million, compared with Denmark\u2019s 1,630 and Norway\u2019s 1,054) but similar or even lower overall excess mortality rates from all causes, and less educational and economic disruption, though no readily quantifiable economic benefits. Covid was not just a political stress test. It was a series of impossible choices. Four years on, it is also clear that many of the lasting political consequences of the virus have little to do with the relative performance of individual governments. In the UK, the long-term incumbent parties north and south of the border are suffering serious Covid fallout despite adopting opposed approaches to the pandemic. The Tories in Westminster were reluctant lockdowners, the SNP in Edinburgh far more enthusiastic ones. It made little odds for the final outcomes: overall mortality rates were relatively consistent for the UK as a whole and variations had more to do with the underlying population profiles in different parts of the country than with the policy preferences of elected politicians. What lingers is something more familiar: the whiff of corruption and the stench of hypocrisy. Although Rishi Sunak, as chancellor, was responsible for one of the more hare-brained schemes of 2020, \u201ceat out to help out\u201d \u2013 which gave diners discounts for getting back into pubs and restaurants, at a time when the virus was still widespread in the population and about to surge back \u2013 that is not the reason why he is in such deep political trouble. Instead, the Covid legacy that haunts the Tories stems almost entirely from the parties held in Downing Street during Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership, when the rest of the country was still locked down. Ultimately it is not the contrast between the public performance of different administrations that has come to matter politically, but the contrast between public pronouncements and private practice: not how many died in the end, but how many died while the wine was flowing in Downing Street. Hypocrisy is the political killer. The same is true for the SNP. Nicola Sturgeon, who once appeared caring and decisive in her nightly news conference, now seems sanctimonious and evasive, her WhatsApp messages long deleted, her personal grievances exposed. The harsh light of a public inquiry has revealed the SNP to have been as motivated by petty point-scoring and score-settling as any other self-interested political party. Politics everywhere \u2013 in whatever form \u2013 takes its toll on its practitioners. The scars accumulate, especially for longstanding administrations. Covid, initially, appeared to be something else: an unprecedented governmental challenge, requiring a new kind of skill set. But in the end, it found a way to expose the regime fatigue that had set in regardless. As Johnson and Sturgeon have discovered, long political Covid is a lonelier business than the exposure they faced in the white heat of the initial outbreak. It works its way through to latch on to personal vulnerabilities and makes them far harder to shake off. * * * What happened to the sense of solidarity that the arrival of Covid appeared to have engendered? In the early days of the pandemic, many governments \u2013 including in the UK \u2013 were worried that people would soon tire of restrictions on their freedom of movement. Some behavioural models had indicated that widespread disobedience would become the norm after a matter of weeks. Those models turned out to be wrong. Most citizens around the world did as they were told for far longer than might have been expected. This gave rise to a hope that concerted action on an equivalent scale might be possible in other areas, too. If, in the face of a serious threat, the public was willing to act in the common interest, even if that meant making significant personal sacrifices, then perhaps other collective action problems \u2013 from mass migration to the climate crisis \u2013 might be amenable to a similar spirit of cooperation. Maybe we were more public-spirited than we had given ourselves credit for. Yet no such dividend has been delivered. On the most contentious political questions, we remain as far apart as ever. Environmental policies \u2013 particularly when tied to net zero targets \u2013 still provoke deep divisions and can stoke widespread anger. A voting public that was so furious with Johnson over breaking his own Covid rules that it effectively helped turf him out of office nonetheless elected a Tory in his Uxbridge and Ruislip constituency when the party turned the issue of the Ulez traffic levy being introduced by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, into a symbol of bureaucratic meddling in the affairs of local communities. Lockdown was one thing. But environmental protections are something else: readily weaponised as evidence of elite interference in ordinary people\u2019s lives. Anti-immigrant sentiment, including among many of the older voters who most dutifully complied with Covid restrictions, continues to fuel populism around the developed world. Geert Wilders won the popular vote in last year\u2019s Dutch general election on a platform that combined migrant-bashing with net zero scepticism. But unlike some other far-right politicians, Wilders is no Covid sceptic. He had also been one of the first Dutch politicians to complain about his country\u2019s slow rollout of its Covid vaccination programme. Why does Covid solidarity not translate to other areas? In part, it is the lack of any comparable sense of urgency. Net zero targets are there to stave off long-heralded but also long-distant threats of catastrophe. At its height, Covid threatened to crash public health systems in a matter of days. But there is another difference. Public support for government restrictions during Covid was about controlling collective behaviour when it threatened our personal safety. The danger was other people: keep them in to keep us safe. Climate action is so much harder to sell because it seems to represent an infringement of personal freedom for the sake of some far less immediate collective benefit. In that sense, Covid compliance has more in common with anti-immigrant sentiment. Keep them out to keep us safe. Throughout the pandemic, public opinion in the UK tended to be critical of the government for being too eager to lift restrictions rather than too keen to impose them. In a pandemic the majority of British people want other people to be told what to do, even if it means being told what to do themselves. This has not been the case everywhere. In large parts of the US, the public proved deeply resistant to the many varieties of mandated behaviour, particularly when it came to mask-wearing, which became a proxy for a whole host of other resentments and frustrations. The pandemic latched on to what unites us and what divides us. It did nothing to change the contours of those divisions. The truth is that public cooperation during Covid did not reveal civic capabilities of which we had been unaware. Publics obeyed the injunctions of democratic politicians because those politicians were already doing their best to respond to the choices of the public. Successfully observed lockdowns were as much a reflection of ongoing behaviour as they were a constraint upon it. Likewise, when lockdowns failed, it was often because political leaders, themselves pandering to perceived public opinion, failed to endorse them wholeheartedly. Covid didn\u2019t generate the political response required to change the way we live. In most cases, it gave us the political response that we asked for. * * * The area where Covid made the biggest immediate political difference was in public finance. Politicians suddenly found the money that was needed to stave off disaster, conjuring it up any way they could. The magic money tree turned out to exist after all. In a genuine crisis, despite everything that had been said about the insurmountable limits on public spending, there proved to be both a will and a way to surmount them. As chancellor in 2020, Sunak launched a furlough scheme that guaranteed 80% subsidies to almost everyone in employment: the closest the UK has ever come to instituting a kind of universal basic income. In the US, a rolling series of extensive relief and stimulus packages included direct cash payments to all households, mortgage relief, tax holidays and giant subsidies to businesses. As a result, people stayed in work and businesses stayed afloat, while public debt in both countries soared. At the same time, governments around the world spent heavily to support vaccine development programmes. Conventional practice in the pharmaceutical industry meant there was invariably a multi-year gap between finding a new treatment and bringing it to market. But again, these constraints turned out to be dispensable. Effective vaccines arrived within a year of the outbreak. Was this, then, the model for an alternative political future, in which vastly accelerated public spending can drive innovation while protecting citizens from disruption? Could it be the means of tackling the climate crisis? In reality, the response to Covid was less like a trial run for a new climate politics and more like the response to a war. The emergency measures were put in place for the attritional phase of the pandemic, when the threat of collapse was real. They have been steadily wound down ever since. Meanwhile, the spending on vaccine research was only a part of wider government programmes that tended to be far less efficient and highly wasteful. As in any actual war, successful weapons programmes are the exception, not the norm. Most of the money gets siphoned off by schemes that go nowhere. As a result, the legacy of government action on Covid has been lingering dissatisfaction rather than a new sense of political possibility. The symptoms of political long Covid include public frustration with the bill that has to be paid. Part of the cause for that frustration is widespread inflation, stoked by looser public finances, which has fuelled anger with governments around the world and created electoral volatility. Javier Milei might not be president of Argentina without Covid-fuelled inflation. Donald Trump might not be making a comeback without it, either. At the same time, stories of the waste and corruption that inevitably went along with unfettered government spending continue to surface. In the UK, the face of government pandemic spending is not Kate Bingham, the head of the highly effective UK vaccines taskforce, but the Tory peer Michelle Mone, who is accused of having used a VIP fast-lane to bypass standard procurement processes and secure government contracts for a company to supply PPE worth more than \u00a3200m, much of which apparently turned out to be useless (though the company denies this). The price of sidelining politics as normal is that when politics as normal resumes, the corner-cutting doesn\u2019t look so good. In the aftermath of the first and second world wars, when government spending among the belligerents was colossal, and waste and corruption were widespread, lasting social transformation nonetheless followed in their wake. The foundations of a new kind of welfare state were laid by the scale of wartime public investment, along with a sense that public sacrifices needed to be repaid. The pandemic has not been the same. In part, it is a question of scale. The $12bn the US federal government spent supporting vaccine research is a drop in the ocean of public spending. Even the trillions of dollars the US government made available in various forms of aid pales compared with the legacy of pre-existing programmes such as Medicare and Medicaid. The levels of US public debt in 2024 are similar as a percentage of GDP to what they were in 1945, in the immediate aftermath of the second world war. But that has more to do with the long-term burdens of welfare programmes and defence spending than with the response to Covid. In a war, the young fight and give up their lives to keep the old safe, who in return pledge to make life better for those who are being asked to make the ultimate sacrifice. It is part of what creates a sense of mutual obligation between the generations. In Covid, it was the old who lost their lives, but it was still the young who made many of the sacrifices, in lost employment and educational opportunities. That makes the tradeoff more complicated. Its legacy has not been a new intergenerational compact. If anything, political differences between the generations are wider than ever, and Covid has exacerbated them. The young have not been repaid for their sacrifice with the kinds of promises that tend to follow an actual war: better housing, greater educational access, full employment. This is in part because the price paid by the younger generation has proved far harder to quantify than the physical toll the disease took on the old. Who owes whom for what? This was a war with no obvious winners. Except, perhaps, those politicians who saw what might come next. In October 2022, as his invasion of Ukraine was stalling, Vladimir Putin told his government coordination council in Moscow that the lesson was clear: Russia needed to translate Covid urgency into military urgency. \u201cWe faced certain difficulties and the need to upgrade our work, give it a new momentum and a new character when we were responding to the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d he said. Those lessons had to be taken forward in prosecuting the war. \u201cWe need to get rid of those archaic procedures that are preventing us from moving forward at the pace the country needs.\u201d As a first step, Putin declared martial law in the four regions controlled by Russian forces. Covid was not an actual war, though it often felt like one. Nor was Covid a dry run for how to deal with the challenge of the climate crisis, though it occasionally felt like that too. Now we know that Covid was, for some politicians, a dry run for war itself. * * * Covid did not fundamentally change the way we live. The French writer Michel Houellebecq, when asked what impact Covid would have on the future, said: \u201cThe same, but worse.\u201d That is perhaps too bleak. It is not all worse. In some respects, life has returned to its previous patterns, for better and for worse. The drivers of change remain the same, even if some of them have accelerated. The pandemic dramatically accelerated some social transformations that were already under way. Working from home was something being facilitated by new technology long before 2020. The pandemic did not create hybrid working, nor did it begin the steady hollowing out of downtown office space. But it brought them forward by about a decade. Politics, too, is similar enough to what went before that it seems unlikely future historians will see 2020-21 as representing a sea-change in world affairs. The US and China are more hostile to each other than they were, though the hostility had been growing for more than a decade before 2020. The Middle East is more unstable than it was, electoral politics more fractious, authoritarians more assertive, the planet hotter, the disparities greater. This is somewhat different. But none of it is new. And there is no vaccine for political long Covid, any more than there is for the longer form of the disease itself. Its effects are too sporadic and its triggers still too poorly understood for that. But in one respect, the political consequences of Covid in 2024 might yet come to look decisive in the history of the 21st century. The politician who paid the highest electoral price for the pandemic was Donald Trump. At the start of 2020 he was well set for re-election: the US economy was relatively strong, his base was relatively happy (above all with his nominations to the supreme court), and the Democrats were unable to agree on a candidate to oppose him. Covid changed all that. Trump handled it badly \u2013 he never got his message straight \u2013 and even some of his supporters noticed. The economy suffered. The Democrats rallied behind Joe Biden, who did not have to suffer the physical stresses of a full campaign because most forms of campaigning were impossible. Trump lost, but only narrowly \u2013 without Covid he would almost certainly have won. For the many people inside and outside the US who found Trump beyond the pale, his removal from office looked like one of the few blessings of the pandemic. Yet had Trump won in 2020 he would have been, like most second-term US presidents, something of a lame duck. He had achieved little by way of serious reform in his first term: a second term would have likely been even more underwhelming, since Trump runs on resentment, which re-election would have done much to defuse. Now, in 2024, we would be looking at the back of Trump, and at a new generation of candidates, some of whom might have been offering something new. Instead, a narrow defeat in 2020 \u2013 coupled with his insistence that he had been robbed \u2013 has given Trump all the resentment he needs. It is Biden who has inherited the problems of a post-Covid world and the challenge of defending his administration from the resentments that have built up. A second Trump term coming after an interlude of four years, during which time he and his supporters have been making sure they won\u2019t get fooled again, and his opponents have been looking for ways to have him jailed, is a far more serious prospect. The stakes are much higher. The damage could be far greater. This year is the busiest year around the world in the history of electoral democracy: more than 4 billion people are entitled to vote in elections from India to Ireland to Mexico. It is one sign that Covid, which put so many democratic freedoms on hold, did not do so permanently. But the US presidential election in November still has the potential to outweigh all that. Trump is by no means certain to win. Yet if he does, and if he decides this time to make good on his promise to change the way the US is governed, by hollowing out the administrative state and by withdrawing US support for Ukraine and for Nato, then Covid will have had a truly lasting impact on global politics. At that point, political long Covid will be hard for any of us to escape. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on X at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."

Netanyahu hit back on Sunday night in an interview with Politico. If Biden meant \u201cthat I\u2019m pursuing private policies against the majority, the wish of the majority of Israelis, and that this is hurting the interests of Israel, then he\u2019s wrong on both counts\u201d, Netanyahu said. Biden \u2013 who has backed Israel during the five-month-old war with Hamas but whose frustration with Netanyahu has grown increasingly visible \u2013 aired his criticism in an interview with MSNBC. Biden said a potential invasion of Rafah \u2013 the last place of relative safety in Gaza \u2013 was \u201ca red line\u201d for him, but added that he would never \u201cleave Israel\u201d. \u201cThe defence of Israel is still critical, so there\u2019s no red line I\u2019m going to cut off all weapons so they don\u2019t have the Iron Dome to protect them.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s failure to secure the release of hostages still held by Hamas militants, whose 7 October attack on southern Israel triggered the war, has led to regular protests in Israel and calls for early elections, including in Tel Aviv again on Saturday night. The war in Gaza began with Hamas\u2019s unprecedented attack, which killed about 1,160 people, mostly civilians. Israel\u2019s retaliatory military campaign has, according to Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry, killed at least 31,045 people in Gaza, mostly women and children. But Netanyahu said in the interview that this figure included 13,000 militants. \u201cHow do I know that? Because our forces have killed at least 13,000 terrorist fighters,\u201d he said, without elaborating on how that figure was derived. Hamas has not said how many of its members have been killed in the fighting. After five months of war, the UN says a quarter of people in Gaza are on the brink of starvation. The local health ministry said on Saturday that 23 people, including several children, had died of dehydration or malnutrition in the previous 10 days. Aid agencies\u2019 efforts to get humanitarian aid to where it is most needed have been hampered by a combination of logistical obstacles, a breakdown of public order and lengthy requirements imposed by Israel. The plan to open an EU-backed sea corridor from Cyprus, along with aid airdrops by the US, Jordan and others, reflects a growing frustration among even Israel\u2019s closest allies that it is not doing enough to get aid to Gaza\u2019s civilians. The number of aid trucks entering the territory by land over the past five months has been far below the 500 a day that entered before the war. Israeli authorities have consistently denied allegations that it has blocked delivery of aid. \u201cHamas has been stealing humanitarian aid and stockpiling equipment and food for Ramadan for terrorist leaders instead of the Gazan civilians in need,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces spokesperson R Adm Daniel Hagari said on Saturday. There has been growing pressure on Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire before Ramadan, which starts on Monday. However, no deal has been made. An aid ship carrying 200 tonnes of food was due to set sail for Gaza from Cyprus over the weekend but was delayed due to \u201ctechnical difficulties\u201d, according to local media, and was instead expected to set off on Monday. Work had begun on Sunday on a floating jetty in Gaza where the aid could be received, said a spokesperson for one of the organisations responsible for the shipment. In a separate development, a US military vessel carrying equipment for the construction of a second temporary pier in Gaza was en route to the Mediterranean, officials in Washington said. It could be weeks before the facility was functional, they added. Speaking to Politico, Netanyahu predicted the fighting could take another four to eight weeks. It would not take than two months, he said: \u201cMaybe six weeks, maybe four.\u201d Netanyahu said Israelis \u201csay that once we destroy the Hamas, the last thing we should do is put in Gaza, in charge of Gaza, the Palestinian Authority that educates its children towards terrorism and pays for terrorism\u201d. Netanyahu has drawn global condemnation and defied the US, which provides Israel with billions of dollars in military aid, by rejecting calls for a Palestinian state. Biden\u2019s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has spoken of reforming the Palestinian Authority (PA), which has partial administrative authority in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, in a way that could \u201creunite\u201d it and Gaza under PA leadership. But Netanyahu said Israelis \u201calso support my position that says that we should resoundingly reject the attempt to ram down our throats a Palestinian state\u201d.

            "date": "2024-03-25T16:19:37Z",
            "content": "Senegal\u2019s anti-establishment candidate looks almost certain to become president after a stunning election victory that is likely to steer the west African country in a radical new direction. A little over a week after his release from prison, Bassirou Diomaye Faye is almost certain to be declared the country\u2019s next president after his main rival unexpectedly called him on Monday to concede defeat. Most analysts had expected the election to go to a tightly contested second round runoff between Faye and Amadou Ba, who represented the ruling administration. The fact that Faye appears to have secured more than 50% of the vote despite 18 other candidates underlines the desire among Senegalese for the profoundly different political direction that he represents. It is also a damning rejection of Macky Sall, the incumbent president who has been in power for 12 years yet leaves office with his country facing widespread poverty and almost a third of Senegal\u2019s youth unemployed. After Sunday\u2019s peaceful vote, Monday began with Ba in fighting form, insisting that he still expected a runoff vote against Faye to decide the victor. However by mid-afternoon, and with a lengthening number of other candidates congratulating Faye as the winner, Ba abruptly conceded defeat \u2013 despite the full provisional results of the vote not expected until Friday. In a statement, Ba said: \u201cIn light of presidential election result trends and while we await the official proclamation, I congratulate \u2026 Faye for his victory in the first round.\u201d His withdrawal prompted immediate, widespread celebrations among Faye\u2019s supporters in the capital, Dakar. More widely, a peaceful transition of power in Senegal represents a result for democracy in west Africa, a region where there have been eight military coups since 2020. Even so, Senegal\u2019s election almost didn\u2019t happen after Sall abruptly called it off last month, only to backtrack when faced with huge opposition. The triumph for Faye is likely to precipitate significant change in Senegal, including a profound redrawing of its relationship with its former colonial power, France. Promising a presidential programme of leftwing pan-Africanism, Faye wants Senegal to cease using the CFA franc \u2013 the west African single currency pegged to the euro with the financial backing of the French Treasury \u2013 which critics deride as a relic of colonialism. The 44-year-old, who would be Senegal\u2019s youngest president, has also promised to renegotiate huge mining, gas and oil contracts signed with foreign companies. Senegal is due to start hydrocarbon production this year, a development that has brought hopes of future \u2013 and much needed \u2013 wealth for the country. Investors, meanwhile, are wary about a change to an anti-establishment government that may not pursue the same business-friendly policies seen under Sall\u2019s government that have attracted investments into infrastructure. Yet Sall\u2019s policies \u2013 represented directly by Ba in the election \u2013 failed to ease economic hardship in one of west Africa\u2019s more stable democracies. The UN world food programme says 39% of Senegalese people live in poverty. Much of the credit for Faye\u2019s victory will go to Ousmane Sonko, the leader of the Pastef party in which Faye in a senior official. The two former tax inspectors have campaigned together under the slogan \u201cDiomaye is Sonko\u201d, promising to fight corruption, spread wealth more equally and prioritise national economic interests. Faye, along with Sonko, was released from prison 10 days before the election under a rapidly passed amnesty law. Sonko, who was disqualified from the vote because of what he claims are politically motivated charges, has a large following among Senegal\u2019s vast youth population. More than half of the country\u2019s population is under the age of 25, with many sharing concerns about unemployment and poverty."

            "date": "2024-03-27T14:25:41Z",
            "content": "Just 10 days before being elected president of Senegal, Bassirou Diomaye Faye was in prison. Years of political turmoil have left the west African state\u2019s democracy teetering on the brink of collapse, with deadly uprisings and the jailing of opposition figures commonplace. But Faye\u2019s victory, secured in the first round of voting, has left the population, particularly its youth, feeling energised by his promise of radical change. \u201cI feel free. We are finally free. Senegal is free,\u201d said Elhadji Thiam, 27, a merchant and staunch supporter of the Patriots of Senegal (Pastef), Faye\u2019s anti-establishment party, which was banned in July. Faye, a former tax inspector, pitched himself as a pan-Africanist intent on steering Senegal toward economic sovereignty and away from French colonial relics such as the west African CFA franc, a currency pegged to the euro. He has also pledged to overhaul the government, weed out corruption and increase transparency. At 44, Senegal\u2019s youth regard him as a relatable figure whose values have been informed by a traditional village upbringing and a devotion to Islam. His main rival, the governing coalition\u2019s Amadou Ba, conceded defeat after failing to woo voters on a promise of continuing the status quo. It was the first time since Senegal\u2019s independence from France in 1960 that an opposition candidate won in the presidential election\u2019s first round. A smooth election is particularly notable for Senegal, a nation on the peripheries of west Africa\u2019s \u201ccoup belt.\u201d Neighbours such as Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger have experienced a series of military takeovers that have highlighted the precarity of democracy in the region and raised fears Senegal could follow suit. Faye was not his party\u2019s first choice of candidate. He was selected to run in place of the former presidential hopeful Ousmane Sonko, who was barred from running due to a defamation conviction \u2013 charges his supporters say were politically motivated. Sonko captivated Senegal\u2019s youth with his sharp critiques of political elites and achieved a martyr-like status for serving prison time over a myriad of charges. Thiam said: \u201cSonko has done everything for Senegal. When you see someone who\u2019s willing to give their life for their country it\u2019s impossible not to support them.\u201d His popularity was transferred on to Faye with the help of Sonko\u2019s wholehearted endorsement as well as through the oft-recited party slogan: \u201cSonko is Diomaye, Diomaye is Sonko.\u201d Critics of Pastef have condemned the party for promoting what they say are reckless policies that could sink Senegal\u2019s economy, most notably its budding oil and gas industry, and inciting \u201cinsurrectional movements\u201d. Faye will serve as Senegal\u2019s fifth democratically elected president, replacing Macky Sall, who has been in power since 2012. Sall has also been criticised for prioritising foreign interests and businesses over local entities. Opponents blame him for high youth unemployment rates and a related migration crisis, which has reached record highs in recent years. More than 60% of Senegal\u2019s population is under the age of 25. Sall\u2019s popularity among Senegalese youth sunk to new lows during his second term when he began jailing opposition members. His ambiguous stance about whether he would step down at the end of his mandate fuelled violent clashes between protesters and gendarmes. More than 60 people have died in protests since 2021, according to rights groups. Moussa Sarr is a lawyer whose clients include Faye and Sonko as well as other jailed politicians, journalists and activists. He said: \u201cOver the last three years, Senegal has witnessed a massive retreat of democratic norms.\u201d The people he represents, Sarr said, have one thing in common: \u201cThey\u2019ve taken positions that are discordant with the state. And the state tried to muzzle them by arresting them.\u201d Protests were reignited in early February when Sall suddenly announced that the elections, originally scheduled for 25 February, would be postponed by 10 months. The delay, he claimed, was needed in order to investigate alleged corruption within Senegal\u2019s constitutional council. Critics called it a constitutional coup. As Senegal\u2019s parliament was set to vote on the matter, security forces stormed the national assembly and threw out opposition lawmakers. International pressure mounted and Senegal\u2019s constitutional court intervened. Sall reversed course and shortened the delay to one month. An amnesty law was passed and thousands of political prisoners were released. Election day was largely peaceful and Faye\u2019s opponents, namely Ba and Sall, were quick to concede. Lamine Sane, an electoral operations manager with Pastef, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve lived through some of the darkest moments in this country\u2019s history. We were attacked from all sides. Our political party was dissolved, our leader was imprisoned, hundreds of young people were killed for simply demanding good governance.\u201d \u201cDespite everything, we remained resilient,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd now we have a heavy responsibility to bring this country back to democracy.\u201d Shortly after the polls closed on Sunday, vote counts began trickling in. The results were clear: a landslide victory for Faye. Thousands of people flooded the streets to celebrate. Children cheered from atop their parents\u2019 shoulders while others hung from car windows, flags draped around their shoulders, yelling: \u201cWe\u2019re free! Senegal is free!\u201d Outside Pastef headquarters, people danced with brooms to symbolise the sweeping away of corruption. Some crowded around passing cars, using posters of Diomaye to wipe away the dirt. \u201cDemocracy has never been served to us on a silver platter. It\u2019s always been a hard fight,\u201d said Hawa Ba, the head of the Senegal office of the Open Society Initiative for West Africa. \u201cWe were again put to the test and our resilience paid off.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot to do,\u201d she said, \u201cbut at the end of the day, the Senegalese people won. Change happened.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-06T16:30:20Z",
            "content": "Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the US Senate, endorsed Donald Trump for president despite years of acrimony including Trump calling McConnell a \u201cpiece of shit\u201d and attacking his wife in racist terms, and McConnell deeming Trump \u201cpractically and morally responsible\u201d for the January 6 insurrection. \u201cIt is abundantly clear that Trump has earned the requisite support of Republican voters to be our nominee for president of the United States,\u201d McConnell, 82, told the Washington Post on Wednesday, after Trump dominated the Super Tuesday primaries and his last rival, Nikki Haley, dropped out. \u201cIt should come as no surprise,\u201d McConnell said, \u201cthat as nominee, [Trump] will have my support. During his presidency, we worked together to accomplish great things for the American people including tax reform that supercharged our economy and a generational change of our federal judiciary \u2013 most importantly, the supreme court.\u201d In the words of the non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the 2017 tax law McConnell referred to was \u201cskewed to the rich, expensive, and failed to deliver \u2026 promised economic benefits\u201d. In the case of the courts, McConnell did stock the federal bench with rightwingers and steer three justices onto the supreme court, appointments made possible by ruthless tactics and paving the way for policy victories including the removal of the federal right to abortion. That ruling, however, has powered Democrats to victories in campaigns centered on rightwing threats to reproductive rights. McConnell and Trump ultimately fell out over Trump\u2019s refusal to admit defeat by Joe Biden in 2020, culminating in the deadly attack on Congress of 6 January 2021 \u2013 the event which prompted McConnell\u2019s wife, Elaine Chao, to resign as Trump\u2019s transportation secretary. McConnell voted to acquit Trump at his subsequent (and second) impeachment trial, claiming that as Trump had left office the sanction was not needed. But though McConnell excoriated Trump in a Senate speech, labeling him guilty of a \u201cdisgraceful dereliction of duty\u201d and \u201cpractically and morally responsible for provoking\u201d January 6, the former president did not leave the national scene as McConnell clearly expected. As Trump dominated the Republican primary, notwithstanding 91 criminal charges under four indictments, multimillion-dollar civil penalties and attempts to remove him from the ballot, his relationship with McConnell went into deep freeze. Trump\u2019s \u201cpiece of shit\u201d remark was reported. Other insults thrown McConnell\u2019s way included \u201cstone cold loser\u201d, \u201cdumb son of a bitch\u201d and \u201cold broken down crow\u201d. Trump called Chao \u201cCoco Chow\u201d and McConnell\u2019s \u201cChina-loving wife\u201d. Last year, Chao spoke out against such racist mockery. Last week, amid speculation that McConnell would soon endorse, the Kentucky senator said he would step down as leader at the end of this year, after elections in which Republicans hope to regain Senate control. A senator since 1985, McConnell is the longest-serving Senate party leader, having assumed his role in 2006. Contenders to replace him include John Cornyn of Texas and John Thune of South Dakota. Both have endorsed Trump. On Wednesday, Joni Ernst of Iowa also endorsed, giving Trump a full house of GOP Senate leaders. McConnell is destined to be remembered as a hugely influential figure. But his decision to endorse Trump met with widespread scorn. Norman Ornstein, an author and emeritus scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said McConnell had \u201conce again demonstrate[d] a level of moral cowardice that is destructive and pathetic. \u201cHe was responsible for letting Trump off the hook, and having him as the Republican nominee, when he deep-sixed [the] impeachment trial. Now he endorses the vicious autocrat. Shame\u201d."

            "date": "2024-03-30T21:42:18Z",
            "content": "A former national security adviser in the Donald Trump White House has said that the ex-president \u201chasn\u2019t got the brains\u201d to helm a dictatorship, despite his admiration for such rulers. In an interview with the conservative French outlet Le Figaro, John Bolton, 75, was asked whether the former president had tendencies that mirror dictators like the ones he has previously praised. Bolton not only disparaged Trump\u2019s intellectual capacity, he also disparaged his professional background, exclaiming: \u201cHe\u2019s a property developer, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d Now a vocal critic of Trump, Bolton served as Trump\u2019s national security adviser from April 2018 to September 2019. Bolton had previously served as US ambassador to the UN during George W Bush\u2019s presidency, developing a reputation as a foreign policy hawk. Bolton\u2019s remarks to Le Figaro suggesting Trump is not smart enough to be a dictator will almost certainly do little to allay fears on the political left at home or abroad about a second Trump presidency. After all, Trump has suggested he plans to be a dictator, if only for the first day of his presidency, if he were re-elected. Meanwhile, as he seeks a second term in the White House, the incumbent Joe Biden has warned that Trump \u2013 the lone remaining contender for the Republican nomination \u2013 and his allies are \u201cdetermined to destroy American democracy\u201d. Trump recently provided fuel for that argument by hosting Hungary\u2019s autocratic prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Trump, furthermore, is known to have lavished praise on leaders considered opposed to US democratic ideals and foreign policy interests, including North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un and China\u2019s Xi Jinping. Bolton nonetheless claimed Trump \u2013 who is grappling with more than 80 pending criminal charges as well as multimillion-dollar civil penalties \u2013 lacks the kind of coherent political philosophy effective dictators require. He also said Trump does not like to \u201cget involved in policy analysis or decision-making in the way we normally use those terms\u201d. For Trump, Bolton added: \u201cEverything is episodic, anecdotal, transactional. And everything is contingent on the question of how this will benefit Donald Trump.\u201d Such disparagements from Bolton \u2013 who advocated for the Trump White House to withdraw from a deal with Iran aimed at dissuading it from developing nuclear weapons \u2013 are not new. In a new foreword to his account of his work for Trump\u2019s presidency, The Room Where It Happened, Bolton warns that Trump was limited to worrying about punishing his personal enemies and appeasing US adversaries Russia and China. \u201cTrump is unfit to be president,\u201d Bolton writes. And though he may not think Trump can foster a dictatorship, Bolton has warned: \u201cIf his first four years were bad, a second four will be worse.\u201d Trump has seemingly leaned into such predictions. He stoked alarm at a campaign rally earlier in March when \u2013 while musing about how foreign car production affects the US auto industry \u2013 he said: \u201cIf I don\u2019t get elected, it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath for the whole \u2013 that\u2019s going to be the least of it. It\u2019s going to be a bloodbath for the country.\u201d His use of the word \u201cbloodbath\u201d recalled provocative language Trump has used previously, including describing immigrants as \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\u201d. He told a rally in New Hampshire last year that he wanted to \u201croot out the communists, Marxists, fascists and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country that lie and steal and cheat on elections\u201d. After that remark, Biden attacked Trump for his use of the world \u201cvermin\u201d, saying Trump\u2019s language \u201cechoes language you heard in Nazi Germany\u201d as Adolf Hitler rose to power and orchestrated the murders of 6 million Jewish people during the Holocaust. In his interview with Le Figaro, Bolton said it was \u201cvery likely\u201d that Trump would act on his threat to pull the US out of the Nato military alliance if he were re-elected. In recent months, Trump has repeated his threat not to protect countries who he believes do not pay enough to maintain the security alliance, and he claimed that European members of the alliance \u201claugh at the stupidity\u201d of the US. \u201cTrump, when he has an idea, comes back to it again and again, then gets distracted, forgets, but eventually comes back to it and acts on it,\u201d Bolton warned. \u201cThat\u2019s why leaving Nato is a real possibility. A lot of people think it\u2019s just a negotiating tool, but I don\u2019t think so.\u201d"
