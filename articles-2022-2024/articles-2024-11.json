            "content": "The 2024 US election was heralded by both sides as one of the most crucial contests in recent American history, with Democrats in particular warning of the threat of a Donald Trump return to the White House. Both sides urged their supporters to come to the polls to save the nation. In the end turnout was high for a US presidential contest \u2013 almost matching the levels of 2020. But at the same time it is estimated that close to 90 million Americans, roughly 36% of the eligible voting age population, did not vote. That number is greater than the number of people who voted for either Trump or his opponent, the Democrat Kamala Harris. We\u2019re interested to hear from people who would have been eligible to vote in the 2024 US presidential election but did not. What were your reasons for not voting? Tell us about the political issues or other reasons that caused you to abstain. And if you previously turned out to vote but did not vote in this election, what was different this time around?"

            "content": "The Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, has said a video that claimed to show a Haitian immigrant who voted multiple times is \u201cfalse\u201d, \u201ctargeted disinformation\u201d and likely the work of a Russian troll farm. \u201cAs Americans we can\u2019t let our enemies use lies to divide us,\u201d said Raffensperger, who also asked that \u201cElon Musk and the leadership of other social media platforms \u2026 take this down.\u201d Meanwhile, Musk has deputised his followers on X to spot and report any \u201cpotential instances of voter fraud and irregularities\u201d. The election integrity community he spawned is rife with unfounded claims passed off as evidence of voter fraud. As Americans race towards the presidential election, claims of voter fraud \u2013 as well as real example of political violence \u2013 are growing, with burning vote boxes, attempts to steal ballots and online hoaxes all reported this week. Here is what else happened on Thursday: Kamala Harris election news and updates Kamala Harris said on Thursday that Donald Trump\u2019s comment that he would protect women \u201cwhether the women like it or not\u201d showed that the Republican presidential nominee does not understand women\u2019s \u201cagency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies\u201d. Harris, who has been receiving a slew of celebrity endorsements, got an A-list boost from pop star and movie actor Jennifer Lopez in Las Vegas, after basketball great LeBron James endorsed her earlier in the day. \u201cI like Hollywood endings. I like when the good guy, or in this case the good girl wins,\u201d said Lopez. The cast of Marvel\u2019s Avengers movies also came out in support of Harris. In a video posted first on Vanity Fair, actors Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Don Cheadle, Chris Evans, Danai Gurira and Paul Bettany playfully riffed on their respective characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe while encouraging viewers to vote for Harris. Donald Trump election news and updates Trump acknowledged that Elon Musk and Robert F Kennedy Jr could be \u201cinfluential figures\u201d in a potential second administration as he sat for a lengthy interview with conservative broadcaster Tucker Carlson in battleground state Arizona. Trump also called Liz Cheney a \u201cwar hawk\u201d who should be placed in the line of fire to \u201csee how she feels about it\u201d. The former congresswoman has become one of his most prominent Republican critics. Trump made stops in New Mexico, a traditionally Democratic state, and the swing state of Nevada. Trump predicted he would defy experts who said campaigning in New Mexico was futile. \u201cThey all said \u2018Don\u2019t come. You can\u2019t win New Mexico.\u2019 I said, \u2018Look, your votes are rigged. We can win New Mexico,\u2019\u201d Trump said. Trump\u2019s refusal to publicly acknowledge his defeat in 2020 and suggestion that if he loses this year, he will once again claim fraud, have changed the lives of many formerly low-key election offices and secretaries of state nationwide, who now regularly face threats and harassment, Chris Stein reported from Arizona. Elon Musk failed to show up to a required hearing in a Philadelphia case challenging his $1m-a-day sweepstakes. His absence would have risked contempt of court had the case continued in Pennsylvania court, but it was moved to federal court in response to a motion filed by Musk\u2019s attorneys, who did attend the hearing. No hearings were immediately scheduled in the federal case. Musk\u2019s get-out-the-vote effort for Donald Trump has come under renewed scrutiny after paid canvassers reported not knowing beforehand that they were being hired to support the former president. Workers recruited by Musk\u2019s America Pac to canvass in the battleground state of Michigan only discovered they were working for the Space X and Tesla entrepreneur to drum up voter turnout for Trump after signing non-disclosure agreements, Wired reported. Elsewhere on the campaign trail Practising witches from around the world gathered in Salem by the hundreds on Thursday night to honour Stormy Daniels at their annual \u201cmagic circle\u201d ceremony recognising loved ones who have died. Daniels \u2013 the adult film actor who allegedly had an affair with Trump and was at the centre of his May criminal trial that led to the former president\u2019s conviction on 34 felonies \u2013 was chosen to be honoured in the Halloween ceremony as the organisers believe that she has been the victim of a modern-day witch-hunt. White House press officials altered the official transcript of a call in which President Joe Biden appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity, according to two US government officials and an internal email obtained on Thursday by the Associated Press.

            "date": "2024-11-04T12:00:12Z",
            "content": "Elections offices in the US have hardened their security measures this year, anticipating potential violence based on experience since 2020 and during an ongoing rise in threats and harassment focused on election workers. Many offices have now trained their workers on de-escalation tactics. They have run drills for active shooters or other disturbances. They have a process for flagging the threats that could be criminal and seeking law enforcement help when needed. Hundreds of election offices have been reinforced with bulletproof glass and steel doors. Some have increased their security details or locked down their social media in case people come looking into their lives. And new laws and added enforcement of prohibitions on such harassment have added to the response to the increased hostility. Authorities are concerned about the rise of the rightwing election denial movement, which originated in 2020 following Trump\u2019s rejection of his defeat to Joe Biden. Trump\u2019s propagation of unfounded theories regarding the election mobilized large crowds to participate in \u201cStop the Steal\u201d protests, which reached a climax on 6 January 2021, when supporters stormed the US Capitol in an effort to impede Congress\u2019s confirmation of the election outcomes. Trump has not committed to accepting the outcome, claiming without evidence that Democrats will cheat to install his opponent, Kamala Harris. Michigan\u2019s secretary of state Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, said her concern for her personal safety increased after Elon Musk, the owner of X, attacked her online. Before she responded to his claims about Michigan voting and her office, she called her security team to \u201cmake sure my family was safe\u201d, she said on NBC. \u201cUnfortunately for all of us, standing up to bullies and fighting back against misinformation in this moment means putting ourselves in the metaphorical line of fire,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s quite unnerving. It\u2019s created a state of hyper-vigilance for all of us, but it doesn\u2019t deter us from speaking the truth and making sure citizens have the tools they need to cast their vote in this historical election.\u201d Adrian Fontes, the Democratic secretary of state in Arizona, recently revealed he wears a bulletproof vest, which came up in testimony as his office sought to keep the names of voters private in a lawsuit over an error in proof of citizenship practices in the state, saying he feared for their safety if made public. Some states have activated their national guard in preparation for election day. The Washington governor, Jay Inslee, noted an arson attack on a ballot drop box in his state when he called up the guard on Friday, saying their help could be needed to protect election infrastructure or respond to any unrest related to the election. The county sheriff in the area where the drop box fire occurred has increased patrols in response as well. In Washington DC, the police chief, Pamela Smith, said at a news conference on Tuesday that more than 3,000 police officers would work 12-hour shifts. Nevada\u2019s governor, Joe Lombardo, announced a \u201cprecautionary activation\u201d of the state\u2019s guard for the election, though he added he did not think members would need to be deployed. In several counties, panic buttons attached to lanyards have been provided for the primary poll worker to wear at every polling site. Managing security around elections involves weighing competing factors to ensure that people can safely vote, safely protest and safely work at election facilities. A heavy law enforcement presence can in itself deter voters from going to the polls. Those who threaten and harass over elections in part want to create fear around the process, so officials are cognizant to not let them succeed in elevating worry. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t see that planning and preparation as a guarantee that violence will happen,\u201d said Shannon Hiller, executive director of the Bridging Divides Initiative at Princeton University, which studies and tracks political violence. \u201cYou don\u2019t do a fire drill because you\u2019re sure a fire is happening next week, you do a fire drill in case a fire happens \u2026 We should understand that planning and preparation as helping us to feel more safe, not less.\u201d Maricopa county, Arizona, has some of the most visible security measures, spurred by a near-constant presence of threats. In 2020, large protests occurred outside the county\u2019s central tabulation center as votes were counted, creating an unsettling environment for workers. Few protested at the center during the 2022 midterms, after the county installed a permanent fence around the facility and beefed up law enforcement presence, including officers on horseback who strode around as a show of force. This year, the county\u2019s security measures have grabbed apocalyptic headlines. The permanent fence is also surrounded by a temporary chain-link fence then again by concrete barriers. The county sheriff confirmed there would be drones, though it was not yet clear if they would need to use snipers on rooftops, as the Wall Street Journal reported. \u201cAcross the state, election workers have gone through active-shooter drills and learned to barricade themselves or wield fire hoses to repel armed mobs,\u201d the Journal wrote in October of Arizona. \u201cAt the ready are trauma kits containing tourniquets and bandages designed to pack chest wounds and stanch serious bleeding.\u201d Maricopa county officials held a press conference focused on security measures the week before the election, the mere fact of which had them lamenting attacks on elections that had made these measures necessary. County supervisor Bill Gates said it was a \u201csad commentary on what\u2019s happened in this country in the last four years\u201d. Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts The county\u2019s elected officials who oversee voting, most of whom are Republicans, have stood up for the voting process and election results in the face of a pressure campaign from Trump and his allies, who are are pushing the idea that his victory is going to be a landslide. Their outspoken defense of the system has brought an avalanche of harassment and threats, which the officials have shared has taken a toll on them personally. But, Gates noted: \u201cPeople who create this chaos in our system had hoped to drive us apart, but in fact, if anything, it has brought us together here in Maricopa county. And I\u2019m very proud of that. And I think that anyone who thinks they\u2019re going to rattle the foundations of the democracy in this county been unsuccessful to this point, they\u2019re going to continue to be unsuccessful.\u201d The Maricopa county sheriff, Russ Skinner, said his officers were ready to step in at a moment\u2019s notice and work closely with elections officials, but that he was mindful not to intrude at polling places unless there is a public safety need to do so. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to disrupt the process, and certainly we don\u2019t want to influence the process, but I can tell you that you will have enough law enforcement,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cEvery agency is on board for the election and the days even following the election, to make sure that these locations are safe, that their communities are safe.\u201d The federal government has ramped up investigations and enforcement of threats against elections officials, creating a taskforce specifically focused on the issue that has brought charges in cases that cross state lines. Some state and local officials have also charged those who threaten election workers. The taskforce announced four more cases in late October, including one man who had threatened officials in two states and at the federal level over the course of nearly three years. Another man pleaded guilty who had sent threats to Arizona officials after the 2022 primaries, including a picture of a toy, Woody, from Toy Story \u201clying face down with an unidentified projectile in its back\u201d. Many states have added laws that seek to protect election workers from threats, intimidation and harassment \u2013 35 states and Washington DC now have laws aimed at election officials and poll workers after a wave of states enacted new laws since 2020, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. One of those states, Maryland, saw an incident during early voting in which a poll observer trailed an election worker, which the worker reported as intimidating and sought a peace order. \u201cI have an absolute ZERO tolerance for harassment or making threats against election officials. They have the highest level of integrity &amp; need to do their mission in a safe environment,\u201d Jared DeMarinis, Maryland\u2019s elections administrator, said on X. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful an incident has occurred.\u201d Read more of the Guardian\u2019s 2024 US election coverage: When do polls close?

            "content": "It may have felt like it would never happen, but the day is here. After months of anxiety-inducing uncertainty and a seemingly endless series of history-making events, the US presidential race is (finally) coming to a close. Americans \u2013 along with so many people around the world \u2013 are gathering around their televisions and phone screens to learn who will be the next president of the United States: Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. Even though Harris and Trump have presented fundamentally different visions for the future of the US and its role on the global stage, the race has remained neck and neck since Joe Biden shocked the country by abandoning his re-election bid in July. Results start rolling in on Tuesday night, giving the nation its first clues about which party will control not just the White House, but Congress as well. Here is an hour-by-hour guide on how to watch election night like an expert: * * * 6pm ET (3pm PT, 11pm GMT, 10am AEDT): polls start to close The first polls will close in eastern Kentucky and much of Indiana at 6pm ET. Democrats\u2019 expectations are low in the two Republican-leaning states: Trump is virtually guaranteed to win both, and Republicans are expected to easily hold most of the two states\u2019 House seats as well. Latest: Trump wins red states Kentucky and Indiana * * * 7pm ET (4pm PT, midnight GMT, 11am AEDT): polls fully close in six states, including Georgia Americans will get their first clues about the outcome of the presidential race at 7pm ET, when polls close in the battleground state of Georgia. Biden won Georgia by just 0.2 points in 2020, after Trump carried the state by 5 points four years earlier. This year, Trump appears to have a slight advantage over Harris in the Peach state, according to the Guardian\u2019s polling tracker, but a strong night for Democrats could put Georgia in their win column again. As Georgia starts to count its ballots, polls will also close in Virginia, where both parties hope to flip a House seat. Republicans are looking to expand their narrow majority in the House, and the results in Virginia\u2019s second and seventh congressional districts could give an early indication of the party\u2019s success. And the early results out of Florida \u2013 where most, but not all, polls close at 7pm \u2013 could offer revealing hints as well. Florida is particularly efficient at counting ballots, so its early results will be one of the first big tests of the night. In addition to Harris\u2019s long-shot hopes of flipping a state that Trump won twice, the Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is looking to unseat the Republican senator Rick Scott, who has maintained a polling advantage in the race. An upset win for Mucarsel-Powell in Florida could allow Democrats to maintain their Senate majority. Latest: Trump wins Florida Latest: Trump wins Georgia * * * 7.30pm ET (4.30pm PT, 12.30am GMT, 11.30am AEDT): polls close in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia Trump won North Carolina by one point in 2020 and three points in 2016, and a loss in this battleground state could doom the former president. Democrats also expect a victory in the North Carolina gubernatorial race, given the recent revelations about Republican Mark Robinson\u2019s disturbing internet activity. Meanwhile, the results in Ohio and West Virginia could decide control of the Senate. Republicans are expected to pick up a seat in West Virginia, where the independent senator Joe Manchin decided against seeking re-election; and the Democratic incumbent, Sherrod Brown, is facing a tough race in Ohio. If Republicans win both races, that would erase Democrats\u2019 current 51-49 advantage in the Senate. Latest: Trump wins West Virginia Latest: Trump wins Ohio Latest: Trump wins North Carolina * * * 8pm ET (5pm PT, 1am GMT, 12pm AEDT): polls fully close in 16 states, including Pennsylvania This will represent a pivotal moment in the presidential race. Whoever wins Pennsylvania\u2019s 19 electoral votes is much more likely to win the White House, a fact that both nominees acknowledged as they blitzed the battleground state in recent weeks. Pennsylvania will also host some of the nation\u2019s most competitive congressional races. If it is a good night for Republicans, they could flip the seat of the incumbent Democratic senator Bob Casey, who is facing off against the former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick. But if Democrats have an especially strong night, they may set their sights on Florida, where the final polls close at 8pm ET. Most polls will close in Michigan at 8pm ET as well, but voting in a handful of counties that observe central time will keep polls open for another hour. Latest: Trump wins Pennsylvania * * * 8.30pm ET (5.30pm PT, 1.30am GMT, 12.30pm AEDT): polls close in Arkansas There won\u2019t be much suspense in Arkansas, as Trump is expected to easily win the solidly Republican state. Arkansas does have the distinction of being the only state where polls will close at 8.30pm ET, but most Americans\u2019 attention will be on the results trickling in from battleground states by this point in the night. Latest: Trump wins Arkansas * * * 9pm ET (6pm PT, 2am GMT, 1pm AEDT): polls fully close in 15 states, including Michigan and Wisconsin This will be the do-or-die moment for Harris. In 2016, Trump\u2019s ability to eke out narrow victories in the \u201cblue wall\u201d states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin sent him to the White House, but Biden won all three battlegrounds four years later. Harris\u2019s most likely path to 270 electoral votes runs through Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin this year, so Trump could secure a second term if he can pick off even one of those states. Michigan and Wisconsin will also play a potentially decisive role in the battle for Congress. Democrats currently hold two Senate seats in the states that are up for grabs this year, and Republican victories in either race could give them a majority. Michigan\u2019s seventh congressional district, which became an open seat after Elissa Slotkin chose to run for the Senate rather than seek re-election, has been described as \u201cthe most competitive open seat in the country\u201d. In New York, where polls also close at 9pm ET, Democrats have the opportunity to flip several House seats that Republicans won in 2022. If they are successful, it could give Democrats a House majority. And after a much better than expected showing in the celebrated Selzer poll out of Iowa, Democrats hope to flip two House seats in the Hawkeye state, where polls will be closing as well. * * * 10pm ET (7pm PT, 3am GMT, 2pm AEDT): polls fully close in Nevada, Montana and Utah Harris hopes to keep Nevada in her column, as Democratic presidential candidates have won the state in every race since 2008. Trump previously led Nevada polls, but Harris has closed that gap in the final weeks of the race. Another two Senate races will come to a close at this point in the night as well. In Nevada, the Democratic incumbent, Jacky Rosen, is favored to hold her seat, but her fellow Democratic senator Jon Tester\u2019s prospects appear grim in Montana. If Republicans have not already clinched a Senate majority by the time Montana\u2019s polls close, this may be the moment when they officially capture control of the upper chamber. Latest: Trump wins Montana, Utah * * * 11pm ET (8pm PT, 4am GMT, 3pm AEDT): polls fully close in four states, including California While Harris is virtually guaranteed a victory in her home state of California, the state\u2019s House races carry important implications for control of Congress. Five House Republicans face toss-up races in California, according to the Cook Political Report, so the state represents Democrats\u2019 biggest opportunity to regain a majority in the chamber. Latest: Harris wins California * * * 12am ET (9pm PT, 5am GMT, 4pm AEDT): polls close in Hawaii and most of Alaska By the time polls close in Hawaii and most of Alaska, Americans should have a much better sense of who will be moving into the White House come January. But if 2020 is any indication, the nation may have to wait a bit longer to hear a final call on who won the presidential race. In 2020, the AP did not declare Biden as the winner of the presidential election until 7 November at 11.26am ET \u2013 four days after the first polls closed. And in 2016, it took until 2.29am ET the morning after election day to declare Trump as the winner. Given how close the race for the White House is expected to be, Americans might have to settle in for a long night \u2013 or even week \u2013 to learn who their next president is.

            "date": "2024-11-11T16:12:07Z",
            "content": "\u201cIt has been a rough week,\u201d said John Oliver on Sunday evening, days after the majority of American voters elected Donald Trump to a second term as president, \u201cwhich is, to put it mildly, not what I was personally hoping would happen. And honestly, in Trump\u2019s victory speech, he couldn\u2019t seem to believe it either.\u201d Oliver played a clip from Trump\u2019s characteristically rambling victory speech, in which he boasted: \u201cWe overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible, and it is now clear that we\u2019ve achieved the most incredible political thing \u2026 Look what happened. Is this crazy?\u201d \u201cYeah, it is crazy,\u201d Oliver answered. \u201cIt\u2019s really fucking crazy. He\u2019s basically one sentence away from saying, \u2018I mean, you guys saw what I did, right? And you still voted for this. That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u2019 \u201cI know being a shambling verbal mess is part of Trump\u2019s brand,\u201d he added, \u201cbut it is still incredible to see an incoming president ad-lib a victory speech with the same energy as the best man who didn\u2019t realize he had to give a toast.\u201d Oliver then looked into the blame game entertained by those disappointed by Kamala Harris\u2019s loss. \u201cPeople are pointing the finger in all directions, from Latino voters to young men to Joe Rogan,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can basically play your own \u2018wheel of blame\u2019 and generally make sure it lands on whoever you were mad at in the first place. And I\u2019ll be honest, I get the appeal. It is fun to blame people. Trump was literally just elected president again on a platform of doing exactly that.\u201d Oliver jokingly blamed the election on Katy Perry, citing her performance at Harris\u2019s final rally on the eve of election day, where she covered Whitney Houston\u2019s 1986 classic The Greatest Love of All. \u201cWhy would you try to cover Whitney Houston?!\u201d he exclaimed, referring to the rendition as a \u201cdrunk bachelorette karaoke night performance\u201d. Others have attributed Trump\u2019s victory to inflation and frustration with the cost of living, even as macro indicators point to a strong economy. \u201cIt is not news that Trump\u2019s overt white supremacy and misogyny appeal to many of his voters,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cIt\u2019s also not news that many like to hide that by claiming all they\u2019re really worried about is the economy. But clearly for others, there is a willful denial going on about him. Because Trump lies so constantly, people have a sense that you can pick and choose what things he actually believes and create a version of him that suits you. And that can be the case even when his intentions are very clear.\u201d The host then looked ahead to Trump\u2019s second term, starting with a chart of potential Trump administration appointees that \u201clooks like a choose your fighter screen where the only thing they\u2019re fighting is the arc of the moral universe. It looks like an advent calendar where every circle opens up to a tiny piece of literal shit. It looks like a game board for Guess Who? Oops, all assholes. \u201cIf you are watching this right now and thinking, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m not actually ready for this either,\u2019 I totally get it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is understandable not to want yet another guy in a suit doom-squawking at you. So if you are too angry, depressed or worried to watch the rest of this show, no problem. I have been in each of those places this week, and they are all a correct reaction because, look, we did a show like this after the election in 2016 when no one expected Trump to win. \u201cThis time, though, his winning felt like a real possibility all year long, lots of people mobilized to stop it, but it happened anyway, which feels somehow worse,\u201d he continued. Trump will be sworn back into office on 20 January, and \u201cthat is very depressing\u201d, said Oliver. \u201cSo what do the rest of us do next? Well, for the next few days, I\u2019d say whatever you want. I am not gonna judge you for how you get through the next week. \u201cThere is no right reaction right now,\u201d he added. \u201cLots of us are grieving and grief has stages. We take different amounts of time for different people. The stage I\u2019m currently locked in is anger. I am mad for trans people who\u2019ve been threatened. I\u2019m disgusted at the prospect of mass deportation. I\u2019m furious at Biden for not dropping out earlier, and that the egos and inaction of two men older than credit cards themselves have led us to this point. I\u2019m mad that women have to hear \u2018your body, my choice\u2019 from rightwing dipshits. \u201cI\u2019m mad that Elon Musk is apparently sitting in on meetings with the president of Ukraine,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m mad about the myriad of damage Trump will do that cannot easily be undone, like setting back efforts to fight climate change and appointing more supreme court justices. And I\u2019m mad at the prospect of four more years of people saying, \u2018So is your job like so much easier with Trump as president?\u2019 No, it is not! No, it fucking isn\u2019t! Fuck you so much! \u201cSo whether you\u2019re angry right now, or despairing, or Googling \u2018new country no fascists how move\u2019, do what you\u2019ve gotta do. But try not to completely obliterate yourself in despair,\u201d he concluded. \u201cDespair doesn\u2019t help anything. If anything, it makes things worse.\u201d Oliver did not encourage false hope, but instead counting the small victories to avoid burning out \u2013 such as Delaware\u2019s election of the first openly trans member to the US House, or the rollback of abortion bans in several states and indicators that \u201cDemocratic policies are still popular even in a year that their candidate wasn\u2019t\u201d. \u201cYou might well be exhausted, confused, scared and running on fucking fumes right now,\u201d he added. \u201cWhich is fucking understandable, but you might be surprised just how far you can still get even on fumes.\u201d"

            "content": "The Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, has said a video that claimed to show a Haitian immigrant who voted multiple times is \u201cfalse\u201d, \u201ctargeted disinformation\u201d and likely the work of a Russian troll farm. \u201cAs Americans we can\u2019t let our enemies use lies to divide us,\u201d said Raffensperger, who also asked that \u201cElon Musk and the leadership of other social media platforms \u2026 take this down.\u201d Meanwhile, Musk has deputised his followers on X to spot and report any \u201cpotential instances of voter fraud and irregularities\u201d. The election integrity community he spawned is rife with unfounded claims passed off as evidence of voter fraud. As Americans race towards the presidential election, claims of voter fraud \u2013 as well as real example of political violence \u2013 are growing, with burning vote boxes, attempts to steal ballots and online hoaxes all reported this week. Here is what else happened on Thursday: Kamala Harris election news and updates Kamala Harris said on Thursday that Donald Trump\u2019s comment that he would protect women \u201cwhether the women like it or not\u201d showed that the Republican presidential nominee does not understand women\u2019s \u201cagency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies\u201d. Harris, who has been receiving a slew of celebrity endorsements, got an A-list boost from pop star and movie actor Jennifer Lopez in Las Vegas, after basketball great LeBron James endorsed her earlier in the day. \u201cI like Hollywood endings. I like when the good guy, or in this case the good girl wins,\u201d said Lopez. The cast of Marvel\u2019s Avengers movies also came out in support of Harris. In a video posted first on Vanity Fair, actors Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Don Cheadle, Chris Evans, Danai Gurira and Paul Bettany playfully riffed on their respective characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe while encouraging viewers to vote for Harris. Donald Trump election news and updates Trump acknowledged that Elon Musk and Robert F Kennedy Jr could be \u201cinfluential figures\u201d in a potential second administration as he sat for a lengthy interview with conservative broadcaster Tucker Carlson in battleground state Arizona. Trump also called Liz Cheney a \u201cwar hawk\u201d who should be placed in the line of fire to \u201csee how she feels about it\u201d. The former congresswoman has become one of his most prominent Republican critics. Trump made stops in New Mexico, a traditionally Democratic state, and the swing state of Nevada. Trump predicted he would defy experts who said campaigning in New Mexico was futile. \u201cThey all said \u2018Don\u2019t come. You can\u2019t win New Mexico.\u2019 I said, \u2018Look, your votes are rigged. We can win New Mexico,\u2019\u201d Trump said. Trump\u2019s refusal to publicly acknowledge his defeat in 2020 and suggestion that if he loses this year, he will once again claim fraud, have changed the lives of many formerly low-key election offices and secretaries of state nationwide, who now regularly face threats and harassment, Chris Stein reported from Arizona. Elon Musk failed to show up to a required hearing in a Philadelphia case challenging his $1m-a-day sweepstakes. His absence would have risked contempt of court had the case continued in Pennsylvania court, but it was moved to federal court in response to a motion filed by Musk\u2019s attorneys, who did attend the hearing. No hearings were immediately scheduled in the federal case. Musk\u2019s get-out-the-vote effort for Donald Trump has come under renewed scrutiny after paid canvassers reported not knowing beforehand that they were being hired to support the former president. Workers recruited by Musk\u2019s America Pac to canvass in the battleground state of Michigan only discovered they were working for the Space X and Tesla entrepreneur to drum up voter turnout for Trump after signing non-disclosure agreements, Wired reported. Elsewhere on the campaign trail Practising witches from around the world gathered in Salem by the hundreds on Thursday night to honour Stormy Daniels at their annual \u201cmagic circle\u201d ceremony recognising loved ones who have died. Daniels \u2013 the adult film actor who allegedly had an affair with Trump and was at the centre of his May criminal trial that led to the former president\u2019s conviction on 34 felonies \u2013 was chosen to be honoured in the Halloween ceremony as the organisers believe that she has been the victim of a modern-day witch-hunt. White House press officials altered the official transcript of a call in which President Joe Biden appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity, according to two US government officials and an internal email obtained on Thursday by the Associated Press.

            "date": "2024-11-03T09:00:40Z",
            "content": "The 60th US presidential election will decide the 47th president \u2013 widely held to be the most powerful job in the world \u2013 and 50th vice-president. The candidates and their supporters are describing it as the most important election of their lifetimes, with democracy and the American way of life at stake. Record amounts of money have been raised and spent on campaign ads and ground games. Media coverage in print, on TV, online and on podcasts has never been more intense \u2013 or more polarised. All 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for grabs, along with 34 of the 100 seats in the Senate, which together will decide the membership of the 119th US Congress. Thirteen state and territorial governorships and numerous other state and local elections will take place. Voters in 41 states will consider a total of 159 ballot initiatives. Ten states including Arizona, Colorado and Florida have abortion-related measures on the ballot. Florida, North Dakota and South Dakota are considering whether to legalise marijuana. How are people voting? It no longer makes sense to talk solely about \u201celection day\u201d. Tens of millions of people have voted early by mail or in-person, thereby avoiding long queues, potential bad weather or other inconveniences. Georgia\u2019s first day of early voting \u201cshattered records\u201d, according to state officials, while an \u201cunheard of\u201d 97,000-plus voted on day one in Wisconsin. Democrats encouraged people to vote by mail in 2020 to avoid exposure to Covid-19 during the pandemic and fought legal battles to expand absentee voting. Trump, by contrast, falsely claimed that the practice was rife with fraud (it is extremely rare), although Republicans have since changed their messaging and increasingly embraced it. With the exception of Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire, all states give voters the chance to cast a ballot in person at a polling place ahead of election day, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Most states begin counting those ballots on election day, and some require officials to wait until polls are closed to begin counting. Some states offer a version of early voting called \u201cin-person absentee\u201d voting, in which a voter can obtain and submit an absentee ballot in person at a polling place before election day. Most states offer some form of absentee voting, in which a voter requests a ballot in advance and returns it by mail. Some offer voters the option of returning absentee ballots to a secure dropbox. Eight states practice \u201call-mail\u201d elections in which all registered voters receive a ballot in the mail, whether or not they plan to use it. Federal law requires states to send absentee ballots to military voters and voters overseas. Most states allow officials to immediately process absentee ballots but some require them to wait until election day to begin processing ballots \u2013 which can slow the release of election results. On election day, which is 5 November this year, everyone else goes to polling places to cast their vote. Once ballots are tallied, results start being released. Who are the presidential candidates? Kamala Harris, 60, the current vice-president, won the Democratic party\u2019s nomination after Joe Biden ended his re-election bid. She is a former senator, California attorney general and San Francisco prosecutor and is bidding to make history as the first woman and first woman of colour to be elected president in America\u2019s 248-year history. Donald Trump, 78, the Republican nominee, is making make his third consecutive run for the White House. The businessman and reality TV star continues to repeat his false claim that Democrats stole the 2020 election from him. He is the first president to be impeached twice and convicted of a crime. Trump is also the oldest major party nominee in history and this summer survived two assassination attempts. Chase Oliver, 39, is the little-known candidate for the Libertarian party. Oliver ran for a Georgia state senate seat in 2022 and garnered 2% of the vote. The party, which prioritises small government and individual freedoms, typically gains 3% or less of the national vote but its members could yet prove crucial in swing states. Jill Stein, 74, a physician who ran under the Green party in 2016, is running again in 2024. She launched her current campaign accusing Democrats of betraying their promises \u201cfor working people, youth and the climate again and again \u2013 while Republicans don\u2019t even make such promises in the first place\u201d. Cornel West, 71, is running as an independent candidate. The political activist, philosopher and academic is making an effort to attract more progressive, Democratic-leaning voters. What are the paths to victory? Democrats have won the national popular vote in seven of the past eight presidential elections. But the Republicans George W Bush and Donald Trump won the White House by gaining more than 270 votes in the all-important electoral college. Each state counts its votes separately. With two exceptions \u2013 Nebraska and Maine \u2013 the winner of a state gets all of its electoral votes. Each state has a number of electors based on the number of congressional districts it has, plus two additional votes representing the state\u2019s Senate seats. Washington DC has three electoral votes, despite having no voting representation in Congress. This year the electoral college will probably come down to seven crucial battleground states \u2013 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Harris and Trump campaigns are eyeing multiple combinations that could put them over the top. Pennsylvania, which carries 19 electoral college votes, is the ultimate prize and has been the focus of much campaigning. Along with Michigan and Wisconsin, it forms a \u201cblue wall\u201d won by Barack Obama, lost by Hillary Clinton and won by Joe Biden. Trump is targeting rural blue-collar voters; Harris is aiming to turn out Black voters in big cities. Losses in these states might be offset by victories in Arizona, where Trump has made gains among Latino voters; Nevada, the most diverse swing state; and Georgia, long a red state which Biden narrowly flipped in 2020. Republicans have won North Carolina in every election since 2012 but Democrats are running close this time. Democrats currently control the Senate but face a tough map this year. Democrats and senators who caucus with them currently occupy seven of the eight most competitive seats, including Montana and Ohio, which generally lean Republican. The House is likely to hinge on 42 of the most competitive elections. Republicans could retain control by winning just 12 of the 26 seats rated as toss-ups by the Cook Political Report if they also win seats deemed \u201clikely\u201d or \u201clean\u201d Republican. What are the main issues that will decide the White House? Abortion. This is the first presidential election since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that enshrined the constitutional right to abortion. Many Republican-led states have since imposed total or near-total bans on the procedure. Harris has made reproductive rights and personal freedoms a rallying cry and backs a national law codifying access to safe abortion. Trump has struggled to find his footing on the issue, insisting that it is a state matter and belatedly ruling out a national ban. Constitutional amendments that would protect or expand abortion rights will appear on the ballot in 10 states, which Democrats hope will drive higher turnout. Democracy. Democrats have warned that Trump poses an existential threat to democratic norms, citing the 6 January 2021 insurrection, when a mob of his supporters attempted to overturn his election defeat. Harris has described her opponent as a fascist who has said he would be a dictator on day one and who would yield to foreign autocrats such as Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. Trump has sought to turn the tables by claiming \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that Harris is the true threat to democracy, citing alleged online censorship and the criminal cases against him. He has refused to commit to accepting the results of the 2024 election. A recent a Washington Post-Schar School survey of voters in seven swing states found that slightly more trust Trump to handle threats to democracy than Harris. Economy. The Economist magazine describes the US economy as the envy of the world, contending: \u201cThe American economy has left other rich countries in the dust.\u201d But despite strong growth, low unemployment and stabilising inflation, Biden and Harris have consistently trailed Trump in opinion polls. Harris\u2019s economic plans include tax cuts for most Americans, price-gouging bans, more affordable housing and a new child tax credit as well as efforts to boost domestic manufacturing. Trump has vowed to cut taxes, impose sweeping tariffs on imported goods and protect social security and Medicare. Immigration. This has been Trump\u2019s signature issue since he trundled down an escalator at Trump Tower in June 2015 to launch his presidential bid. This time, even as border crossings drop to 2020 levels, he has pledged what he calls the biggest deportation operation in US history. He has also used dehumanising language reminiscent of the Nazis to claim that undocumented immigrants are \u201canimals\u201d, have \u201cbad genes\u201d and are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\u201d. Harris has shifted to the centre on the issue, underlining her support for a bipartisan proposal in Congress that would have hired thousands of new border security agents and closed the border if crossings hit an average of more than 5,000 people a day over a week. What is the state of the race? Excruciatingly close. Harris and Trump are tied at 48% each for the popular vote, according to the final New York Times/Siena College national poll published on 25 October. After Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous performance in the 27 June debate, Trump held a four-percentage-point lead over Biden among registered voters, according to the Pew Research Center. Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris, who then surged to parity and a small lead over Trump amid a wave of energy and enthusiasm. In recent weeks the race has stabilised and an equilibrium has been restored. The national race is less important than swing states that will decide the electoral college. These too are tantalisingly close. As of 17 October, for example, the Guardian\u2019s poll tracker showed Trump narrowly leading in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin, Harris ahead in Nevada and Pennsylvania and a dead heat in North Carolina \u2013 but all could still go one way or the other. The election will provide another test for a polling industry battered by the 2016 and 2020 elections when it seemed to underestimate Trump\u2019s strength. Conversely, in the 2022 midterms, Democrats overperformed the polls and headed off the predicted \u201cred wave\u201d. Political analysts and commentators are understandably reluctant to stick out their necks and guess the outcome. Frank Luntz, a consultant and pollster, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t call it. Anyone who calls it is an idiot.\u201d But Allan Lichtman, a historian with a predictive method that has been right nine times out of 10, has declared he thinks Harris will win. Does the US have exit polls? Exit polls are surveys conducted with voters immediately after they have cast their ballots. Major news networks such as CNN, ABC and Fox News use them to make early projections about who is likely to win, though these are subject to revisions as actual vote counts come in. Traditionally, media outlets agree not to release exit poll data before all polls have closed to avoid influencing people still voting. Exit pollsters position interviewers at selected polling stations, chosen to represent a cross-section of the voting population. Voters leaving polling stations are asked to voluntarily complete anonymous questionnaires covering the candidate they voted for, key issues and demographic information. Interviewers typically phone in the results three times during the day. Exit poll data is analysed quickly to generate insights about the voter base such as who is winning certain demographic groups. Dearborn, Michigan, for example, will be studied closely for any evidence that the war in Gaza affected turnout of Arab and Muslim Americans. Exit polls include absentee voters by conducting phone, text and email surveys. In states with a high level of early in-person voters, exit polls are carried out weeks before election day as these voters leave the polling place. The results are then combined with data from election day. There is a strict embargo on exit poll data until 5pm ET on election day. Within the next hour some initial demographic information about voters and their policy views begins to emerge. Networks are not allowed to project a winner while voting is still taking place. The complete results are published after polling stations close in each state. When will we know who won the election? If the polls are wrong and one candidate has a clear lead over the other \u2013 think Ronald Reagan\u2019s 49-state landslide victory in 1984 \u2013 the result will be obvious within hours. But given the closeness of the elections in 2016 and 2020, a nail-biter that runs through the night and possibly days beyond is more likely. Prolonged court cases are also possible: Republican donors and conservative billionaires have given $140m to 50 \u201celection integrity\u201d groups ready to do battle. News organisations such the Associated Press (AP) often project a winner on election night based on an analysis of votes already counted, the number of outstanding votes and the margin between the candidates. (The AP says its accuracy rate for the past several general elections is above 99.9%.) The losing candidate typically concedes in the early hours of the next morning, signalling that the contest is in effect over. Officially, however, there is still work to do. Local officials finish counting ballots in the days after the election and send their results to state officials. They approve the results and send them to federal officials. Every state must name individuals known as electors by 11 December; they must meet in their respective state capitols to cast their votes for president and vice-president on 17 December. On 6 January the House and Senate will count and tally the electoral certificates in a joint session. The vice-president serves as the president of the Senate and formally presides over the receiving and counting of electoral ballots cast and announces the result. In this case, Harris will proclaim her own victory or defeat on the fourth anniversary of the insurrection at the US Capitol. The election could be a big payday for lawyers. In 2000, when the Republican George W Bush and the Democrat Al Gore were the candidates, polling day fell on 7 November but the result was not called until 12 December. All eyes were on Florida, where votes were subject to an automatic recount because of Bush\u2019s gossamer-thin margin of victory. The dispute went all the way to the supreme court, where justices voted to terminate the recount, prompting Gore to concede. In 2020 the AP declared Joe Biden the winner four days after election day \u2013 at 11.26am ET on Saturday 7 November. Trump had declared victory three days earlier, even as more than 1m ballots remained uncounted, and went on to lose more than 60 legal challenges. Few would bet against him mounting a similar effort this time. What happens after the race is decided? The president-elect forms a transition team to plan for the transfer of power. This works on setting up policy priorities, vetting candidates for key administration positions and coordinating with the outgoing administration. The president-elect and key members of their team begin receiving classified national security briefings to prepare for handling ongoing or emerging global threats. The 47th president will be inaugurated at noon on 20 January at the US Capitol. Big crowds will be expected to return next year after Biden\u2019s scaled-down pandemic version. The outgoing president typically attends the inauguration as a symbol of the peaceful transfer of power, although Trump boycotted in 2020. The new president begins work immediately, often signing a series of executive orders to reverse or continue certain policies and holding meetings with their team. *** Design, development and production: Rich Cousins, Pip Burkett and Bruno Haward."

            "date": "2024-11-25T19:00:12Z",
            "content": "In a region shadowed by Vladimir Putin\u2019s revanchist ambitions, Romania has been a pillar of pro\u2011western stability. Possessing a long border with Ukraine, the country has been a staunch ally to its neighbour under the outgoing president, Klaus Iohannis. As well as providing military aid, more than half a million refugees have been accommodated, and Ukrainian grain exports have been facilitated through the Black Sea port of Constanta. During the summer, President Iohannis at one point threw his hat into the ring to become Nato\u2019s new secretary general, a post eventually filled by the Netherlands\u2019 former prime minister, Mark Rutte. Disturbingly, this bulwark status is now in extreme jeopardy after one of the most remarkable election results in Romania\u2019s post-1989 history. The little\u2011known far-right independent C\u0103lin Georgescu, who topped the poll and now goes into a second-round runoff in December, is a virulent critic of Nato and aid to Ukraine, a vocal admirer of Donald Trump and has suggested Romanian foreign policy should take note of \u201cRussian wisdom\u201d. Mr Georgescu\u2019s brand of insular Christian nationalism shares similarities with Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Ahead of a crucial period after Mr Trump\u2019s re-election, his rise from nowhere risks undermining the fragile consensus underpinning European solidarity with Kyiv. Sunday\u2019s startling result is also significant on other grounds. A university professor who has praised Romania\u2019s fascist wartime leadership, Mr Georgescu achieved his first-place finish despite having been almost entirely ignored by mainstream media throughout the campaign. His rise, fuelled by viral TikTok videos and podcast appearances, echoes in some ways the tactics successfully deployed by Mr Trump in the US presidential election. Across democracies there appears to be a growing synergy between the populist far right and new social media, which is helping to normalise its extremist positions. Mr Georgescu\u2019s anti-establishment campaign exploited deep economic insecurities and resentments. Sunday\u2019s poll marked the first time in the post-communist era that a candidate from the ruling centre-left Social Democratic party failed to make the presidential runoff \u2013 the result of a toxic combination of the highest inflation rate in the EU, an economic slowdown, and allegations of government corruption. There are now fears that one shock will lead to another in this weekend\u2019s parliamentary elections, in which the far right also hopes to make historic gains. Mr Georgescu\u2019s second-round contest with a pro-Ukraine, centre-right candidate thus takes on crucial regional significance. Ukraine-sceptic, Moscow\u2011friendly governments hold power in Hungary and Slovakia, and pro-Russian parties are increasingly influential in Bulgaria. In Georgia and Moldova, pro-EU forces are engaged in an existential battle against attempts to bring both countries back into Russia\u2019s orbit. Ahead of a crucial period in which Kyiv will strive to set the terms of any future ceasefire negotiations with Russia, losing the support of another neighbour would be a bitter blow. As president-elect Trump prepares to prosecute an \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda from January, the internationalist values at stake in Ukraine\u2019s struggle to resist Mr Putin\u2019s illegal invasion need more than ever to be robustly defended. The possibility of a lurch to the nationalist right in Romania over the next two weeks should set alarm bells ringing across the EU. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "date": "2024-11-02T04:56:17Z",
            "content": "Kamala Harris and Donald Trump held duelling rallies within miles of each other in swing state Wisconsin\u2019s largest city, Milwaukee, on Friday night. Milwaukee is home to the most Democratic votes in Wisconsin, but its conservative Republican suburbs are a critical area for Trump as he tries to reclaim the state he narrowly won in 2016 but lost in 2020. Earlier, Trump continued to attack Liz Cheney at a rally in Warren, Michigan, where he also lamented the state of his hair. \u201cIt looks not so good today \u2026 not a good hair day for me, ay ay ay.\u201d After his campaign rhetoric earlier tipped over from hateful to violent \u2013 when he suggested Cheney should be shot at with \u201cnine barrels\u201d and the guns \u201ctrained on her face\u201d \u2013 the attorney general\u2019s office in Arizona, where Trump made the remark, opened a \u201cdeath threat investigation\u201d. In Pennsylvania, a neck-and-neck race is hurtling toward the finish line of the 2024 election with no clear frontrunner. The victor of Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes, the most of any battleground state, will probably win the electoral college and determine the trajectory of the country for the next four years. Here\u2019s what else happened on Friday: Kamala Harris election news and updates Harris told her crowd at the Wisconsin State Fair Park Exposition Center that with four days to go, there was still work to do, but \u201cwe like hard work\u201d. Minutes beforehand, during a raucous warmup, the rapper Cardi B referred to Trump as \u201cDonnie Dunk\u201d and told the crowd: \u201cTrump says he\u2019s going to protect women whether they like it or not. Well, if his definition of protection is not the freedom of choice, if his definition of protection is making sure our daughters have fewer rights than our mothers, then I don\u2019t want it! I don\u2019t want it! I don\u2019t want it!\u201d Earlier, Harris said Trump\u2019s violent rhetoric about Cheney \u201cmust be disqualifying\u201d as far as his suitability for the presidency is concerned. \u201cRepresentative Cheney is a true patriot who has shown extraordinary courage in putting country above party.\u201d Cheney for her part warned the public against dictatorship and a presidential candidate who \u201cwants to be a tyrant\u201d. Republicans\u2019 latest offensive and misogynistic comments have boosted Democratic hopes of turning out women on election day in a contest where the rights of women have been a central issue for the Harris campaign. Donald Trump election news and updates At his Milwaukee rally on Friday, Trump called Harris a \u201clow-IQ person\u201d and vowed to save the economy \u201cfrom total obliteration\u201d in a 1.5-hour-long meandering speech that touched on the economy and foreign policy but also featured threats to curb press freedoms and a lengthy discussion of his own rhetorical style. \u201cI will stop the criminal invasion of this country,\u201d said Trump, promising to usher in a new \u201cgolden age\u201d. \u201cCan you imagine if Kamala won? You would go down to a 1929-style depression.\u201d Trump\u2019s supporters are laying the ground for rejecting the result of the election if he loses, according to warnings from Democrats as well as anti-Maga Republicans. As well as baseless and/or failed lawsuits, suspicions have been voiced over partisan polls run by groups with Republican links in battleground states that mainly show Trump leading \u2013 the idea being that if Trump loses, the polls can be proferred as \u201cevidence\u201d that he was cheated out of the win. The New York author and journalist Michael Wolff has released audio tapes that appear to detail how Trump had a close social relationship with the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein that he has long denied. Wolff says the recordings were made during a 2017 discussion with Epstein about writing his biography. Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges two years later. Trump\u2019s campaign said the claims, made on Wolff\u2019s podcast Fire and Fury, amounted to \u201coutlandish false smears\u201d. Elsewhere on the campaign trail A federal judge rejected an attempt by Elon Musk\u2019s America Pac to have charges of running an illegal lottery heard in federal court, instead of the courts of Pennsylvania, where Musk is running the sweepstakes to help Trump get re-elected. The case has been sent back to the Pennsylvania state court for a further hearing on Monday. Racism and misogyny; a firing squad death threat to a former congresswoman; the Republican candidate for president dressing up as a sanitation worker in the cab of a garbage truck. Donald Trump\u2019s final full week on the campaign trail was as unedifying as it was bizarre \u2013 Richard Luscombe sums it up. A valuable Republican voting bloc in Arizona is seeing a shift of its members towards Harris in numbers that Democrats believe could make the difference for them in an election where the latest polls have Trump slightly ahead. That bloc is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \u2013 the Mormons.

When the result is finally known, there will be a stampede of experts and prognosticators rushing to insist that, in effect, they knew it all along \u2013 that, hard though it was to glimpse through the fog of polls and shifting data, the eventual outcome was obvious. Even inevitable. That will be truer still if, when the voters\u2019 will is finally known, it turns out not to have been so close after all, with one of the two main candidates sweeping most of the swing states to rack up a healthy majority in the electoral college if not the popular vote. The funny thing is, if that happens \u2013 for either candidate \u2013 it would not entirely be a surprise. Even now, you can sketch out, in advance, a very plausible case for why Donald Trump could be about to retake the presidency. And you can do the same for why Harris might be on the brink of becoming the first woman to hold the world\u2019s most powerful office. So, much as Boris Johnson drafted two columns on the eve of the Brexit referendum \u2013 one advocating leave, the other remain \u2013 here, while the US\u2019s verdict is still unknown, is the story of how Trump, or Harris, pulled it off. Start with the scenario of a victorious Trump. To understand it might require a single number: 28. That\u2019s the percentage of Americans who tell pollsters they believe the country is on the right track. A measly 28%. In that environment, incumbent parties lose. And, for all the drama and buzz of her swift installation as candidate, her positioning as the face of change, Harris is a member of the incumbent party and a senior figure in the current US government. A nation that made clear long ago that it wanted to fire Joe Biden, largely over the cost of living and rising prices, as well as immigration, was bound to seize the chance to do the next best thing \u2013 and reject his deputy. If there was a way to avoid that fate, it would have required Harris to make a cleaner break from Biden than she was willing to. Whether it was personal respect for the man, or fear of rupturing her coalition, she didn\u2019t do what had to be done. In this narrative, a key moment will prove to be her October appearance on The View, when she was asked if, looking back over the past four years, she would have done anything differently from her boss. \u201cNot a thing that comes to mind,\u201d was her answer. At a stroke, she robbed herself of the mantle of change, and confirmed Trump\u2019s core message: vote Harris, get Biden 2. Should the need arise to explain a Trump win in 2024, incumbency in tough times will be the meat of it. But it won\u2019t be the whole story. Other factors, besides inflation and petrol prices, will have played their part, tied more to culture than politics. Trump\u2019s astonishing lead among men, especially those without a college degree \u2013 including some, albeit qualified, evidence of increased support among Black and Hispanic men, previously beyond the reach of the Republican party \u2013 points to an element of Trump\u2019s appeal that has endured for nearly a decade. Call it cultural defiance. It sees the wagging finger of all those who sit in judgment \u2013 whether that\u2019s the media, the universities, the \u201cwoke\u201d, foreign countries, especially European ones, or at its most loosely defined, women, especially educated women \u2013 and shows them a big, fat middle finger in response. This is what Trump\u2019s critics took so long to understand. What, for years, they thought would hurt him \u2013 scandal, two impeachments, multiple criminal prosecutions and convictions \u2013 only made him stronger, confirming him as an outlaw, a transgressor who crossed the very boundaries so many of his followers, chiefly men, itched to cross with him. That photo of him, bloodstained, seconds after dodging an assassin\u2019s bullet, urging his devotees to \u201cfight, fight, fight!\u201d \u2013 how, we may come to ask, did we ever think he could be beaten after that? After all, Harris was his ideal opponent. A liberal, accomplished, affluent woman from California, an avatar for the very cultural elite he and many millions of others despise. In case that impression of her were not sharp enough, she reinforced it with a parade of A-list stars campaigning for her in the final stretch, repeating the same mistake Hillary Clinton made in 2016. Finally, given that the US has hardly cured itself of racism or misogyny, it should not be a shock if, in the coming days, we see that a Black woman could not get elected to the White House. It may be 2024, but perhaps the US is still not ready. So much for a Trump win. How will we explain victory for Harris, if it comes? The answer may boil down to one word: women. Outraged by the supreme court\u2019s Dobbs ruling, overturning abortion rights in 2022, women confounded the pollsters in that year\u2019s midterm elections: there was no Republican red wave, despite soaring inflation, because women came out in big numbers to prevent it. Success in 2024 would mean that, once again, and with an intensity missed by most surveys, women in the US had quietly resolved to do the exact same thing to the man who shaped the supreme court, Dobbs\u2019s ultimate author: Trump. In that sense, and others, Trump\u2019s fate would have been sealed before the 2024 campaign even began. If he loses, it will surely be because he\u2019d become too toxic a figure to win: witness his place on the losing side of every election cycle after that first, narrow victory in 2016. What\u2019s more, the toxicity has only got worse recently, his authoritarian, fascistic tendencies laid barer than ever, whether in his threats to deploy the US military against \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d, meaning his liberal critics, or his reported desire to be surrounded by \u201cthe kind of generals that Hitler had\u201d, obedient to his every whim and diktat. For too many Americans, enough might just have been enough. Trump has torn through so many old-school verities of politics that it\u2019s become tempting to think none of them holds good any more. But on-the-ground organisation still matters. If they win, the Democrats will point to a machine that got their vote out in the critical states, precinct by precinct. Trump outsourced that task to Elon Musk, but there are some things even money cannot buy. A Trump defeat would further confirm another old rule: no politician can ever fully escape his record. This time, to take one example, he hoped to make inroads with Arab and Muslim Americans, distressed and furious at the plight of Palestinians in Gaza. But that would have required those same, crucial voters to forget what Trump had promised a decade ago: a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d, denying entry to the US to people from a long list of Muslim countries. Amnesia exists in politics, perhaps especially in the US. But there are limits. All these different elements are real, even if they can be combined into two very different narratives. Who will win the US election? No one knows. But even if we don\u2019t yet know the result, we can already understand it.

            "date": "2024-11-06T05:33:05Z",
            "content": "After months of angst and waiting, at the end of an election ride crazier than any in memory, after the assassination attempts and the bloodied ear, Joe Biden\u2019s shock departure and Kamala Harris\u2019s stunning arrival, after the childless cat ladies and the Springfield, Ohio, culinary dogs, after all the vitriol and the gathering sense of doom \u2013 at last, it was show time. Finally, tens of millions of anxious voters were done with the wildest campaign in their lifetimes and found themselves in that next stage of exquisite suffering that is the American way of democracy: the TV election night bubble. At least it was soothing to hear cable news rivals \u2013 as starkly divided as the presidential candidates they cover \u2013 find common ground as they opened proceedings. \u201cIt\u2019s election night in America, in one of the closest and most consequential presidential races ever,\u201d proclaimed CNN. \u201cThis is it, America! It\u2019s time for you to decide the most unprecedented election of our times,\u201d declared Fox News. As is traditional with US elections, the news of the first polls to close was as dramatic as watching paint dry. The first-in-the-nation states to wrap up voting were Indiana and Kentucky, both reliably in Trump\u2019s bag. At 7pm on the east coast the temperature began to rise, with polls closing in six states that control 60 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House. The first of the Big Seven battleground states to close its polling stations was Georgia. More than 5 million Georgians are projected to have voted, exceeding 70% turnout in what is turning out to be an exceptionally passion-filled race. Early exit polls from Georgia gave some troubling food for thought for the Harris campaign. While the vice-president did well with Black and young voters, edging up her margins on Biden\u2019s four years ago, the exit polls recorded a sharp swing among independent voters, who make up 31% of the Georgia electorate. Trump was recorded in the exit polls to be up by 54% to Harris\u2019s 30% among these voters \u2013 an eye-popping contrast to 2020, when Biden was favoured by 9% over Trump among independents. It was an early, and isolated, finding \u2013 how it pans out through the hours ahead could prove instructive. North Carolina, a state that has only gone Democratic in presidential races twice since 1976, is another of the battleground which both candidates have frantically sought and a must win for Trump. And North Carolina did become the first of the contested battlegrounds to be called, while votes in six other swing states were still being counted, as a win for Trump. As early counts came in, there were signs of Trump also narrowly edging ahead in key counties in Georgia. Should that razor-thin lead firm up, it would leave Harris having to win all three of the all-important Rust belt \u201cblue wall\u201d states \u2013 Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 to keep her hopes alive. Relatively early in the evening, the North Carolina governor\u2019s race was called for the Democrat, Josh Stein, over the embattled Republican lieutenant governor Mark Robinson, who CNN has linked to an online persona describing himself as a \u201cblack NAZI!\u201d. Robinson has denied the allegations. But the fear in the Trump camp is that his fall from grace may harm the former president\u2019s chances. As the night wore on, the Trump team expressed bullishness on their chances. Some had begun to talk about winning all three of the blue wall states \u2013 a phenomenon which, if it happened, would repeat how Trump tore down the wall in 2016. Florida continued its relentless march to the ultra-right on election night. As recently as 2016, Florida was seen as one of the pre-eminent battleground states. How different the Sunshine state looked on Tuesday, its 30 electoral college votes passing seemingly effortlessly to Trump. For the first time since 1988, the Miami region backed the Republican candidate. That fits the increasingly intense love affair between Trump and Cuban Americans in southern Florida. Whether it speaks of a wider drift of Latino voters from the Democratic party will be closely interrogated in coming days. Exit polls from Pennsylvania and Michigan both pointed to a similarly dramatic shift in the Hispanic vote towards Trump compared with four years ago, despite the controversy that erupted over the \u201cisland of garbage\u201d remark made by a Trump surrogate at his Madison Square Garden rally. Florida, one of 10 states with abortion rights on their ballot, also rejected an amendment that would have secured the right to an abortion up to fetal viability. That leaves standing the current state law, in which abortions are banned after six weeks, a point at which many women are not even aware they are pregnant. As the first polls closed on the eastern seaboard, Trump and Harris retreated into their caves to await the coming storm. Both professed to have boundless confidence, though upon what basis was left to the imagination. Trump, who voted in Palm Beach, Florida, near his Mar-a-Lago home-cum-club, had limped towards the finishing line, a final blitz of rallies across multiple battleground states leaving him sounding hoarse and looking haggard. No wonder \u2013 he has been at it for the past 721 days since he announced his presidential run, making Harris\u2019s 92-day sprint seem like a cake-walk. Even as he concluded his pitch for the presidency, Trump watered the seeds of potential election denial that he has planted in a chilling repetition of 2020. \u201cIf it\u2019s a fair election, I\u2019d be the first one to acknowledge it,\u201d he told reporters as he emerged from the polling station, that \u201cif\u201d reverberating ominously in the air. Harris spent election day at the Naval Observatory, the vice-president\u2019s residence in Washington, enjoying a few hours out of the public glare until Tuesday night, when she was poised to deliver remarks at Howard University, her alma mater, in the same city. As they awaited the people\u2019s will, each candidate nursed their unique claim to history-in-the-making. Harris, 60, was bidding to be the first woman and woman of colour to occupy the Oval Office. Trump, at 78, would be the oldest president in the same space. He would also be the first defeated president in 132 years to re-enter the White House, not to mention that most inconvenient truth \u2013 that he would be the first convicted felon to hold the most powerful job on earth. The first tentative clues as to where the country might be headed were gleaned shortly after 5pm eastern time when an initial flurry of national exit poll data gave pundits something to talk about. Yet, typically for this most infuriatingly hard-to-read election cycle, there was plenty of red meat for both sides to chew on. For Harris and her cohort of millions of terrified Americans, convinced that a second Trump presidency would usher in an era of authoritarian rule, there was the affirming result that voters placed \u201cdemocracy\u201d at the top of their list of concerns. At 35%, the category came in above even that perennial electoral priority, the economy, stupid (on 31%). Abortion came in third at 14% \u2013 a warning sign for Trump, having orchestrated the abolition of the right to an abortion in Roe v Wade. Meanwhile, immigration, the issue that above all others Trump has hammered on the campaign trail for months, with his hordes of murdering, drug dealing \u201cillegals\u201d swamping the country, came in a lackluster fourth on 11%. The Harris campaign will also have been heartened by a gaping gender gap revealed by exit polls, with the vice-president winning women by a whopping 12 points (55% to 43%). Trump was conversely ahead with men by nine points, but the telling difference is that women tend to vote in slightly larger proportions. Democracy, abortion, the relatively low standing of immigration, gender gap. So game over? Not so fast. Over in Trumpworld, there were plenty of other contrasting reasons to be cheerful. Though the economy came in second in the list of voters\u2019 issues, the figures beneath the headline were not good for Harris given her role as vice-president in the Biden administration. Asked how they rated the state of the US economy, two-thirds of voters in the exit poll said not so good or poor. Three-quarters said they had experienced moderate or severe hardship from inflation. Most punishingly for the Democratic candidate, asked whether voters felt better or worse off than four years ago \u2013 the exact same question with which Trump began every one of his Make Aamerica great again (Maga) rallies \u2013 45% said worse off, with only 24% better off and 30% no change. As a long night got into its stride, firm indications of the future that lies ahead remained elusive. That left plenty of room for anxieties to fester about what comes next. At 4.39pm on election day, before any state had closed its polling stations, Trump began cranking up his election denial playbook, just as he had done in 2020. \u201cA lot of talk about massive CHEATING in Philadelphia,\u201d he screeched on his platform Truth Social, alluding to a false claim that fake ballots had been distributed in the sate. \u201cLaw enforcement coming!!!\u201d \u201cThere is absolutely no truth to this allegation,\u201d a Philadelphia election official, Seth Bluestein, promptly retorted. Both sides have armies of lawyers at the ready, in anticipation of legal challenges on and after election day. And law enforcement agencies nationwide are on high alert for potential violence. It all points to much more angst and waiting ahead for beleaguered American voters \u2013 whatever, and whenever we know, the outcome.

            "date": "2024-11-28T07:00:36Z",
            "content": "Who knew that the laborious process of democracy, of simply voting over and over again, could be so exciting and so amusing? Edward Berger\u2019s drama is adapted with masterly flair by screenwriter Peter Straughan from the Robert Harris pageturner; Ralph Fiennes is on sumptuous form as the deeply troubled Cardinal Lawrence at the centre of a murky Vatican plot. The result is a high-camp gripper, like the world\u2019s most serious Carry On film. Fiennes\u2019 character is Italian in Harris\u2019s book, but Straughan makes him an Englishman: an unquiet soul who is theoretically on the verge of becoming the first English pope since Adrian IV, although no one is so vulgar or nationalistic as to point that out. With the ailing pope in extremis, Cardinal Lawrence arrives at His Holiness\u2019s death bed to find other ambitious cardinals, who have all cultivated an opaque, unreadable manner of cordially respectful friendship with each other, now manoeuvring to be considered the successor in the imminent conclave, or election. In this blue chip supporting cast Stanley Tucci plays Bellini, the liberal; Sergio Castellitto is pugnacious, reactionary Tedesco, a racist bigot; John Lithgow is Tremblay, whose blandly emollient manner is misleading; Lucian Msamati is the bullish Adeyemi; and Carlos Diehz is Benitez, an unknown figure who to everyone\u2019s polite consternation had been created Cardinal Archbishop of Kabul without anyone realising. Yet all of these men are upstaged by the late pontiff\u2019s confidante Sister Agnes, shrewdly played by Isabella Rossellini. Lawrence is deeply burdened by his own crisis of faith and by a suspicion of dark forces at work: the perennial sadness in Fiennes\u2019 eyes becomes an unfathomable dual-ocean of suppressed tears. The pope dies without granting Lawrence his wish to resign as dean of the College of Cardinals, and also without being able to reveal what he knew of dark secrets concerning one or more of these candidates; this means a corrupt figure may be about to become pope. Poor, self-effacing Lawrence finds himself as unofficial cheerleader for progressive Bellini in the voting rounds, but to his dismay sees his own vote count increasing each time. Should he have the humility to accept this mysterious destiny? But if the burden of authority means he is unable to expose this corrupt conspiracy, might not the prince of darkness be imposing a terrible temptation? Berger orchestrates marvellously tense, explosively dramatic scenes and with cinematographer St\u00e9phane Fontaine and production designer Suzie Davies contrives some spectacularly strange and dream-like tableaux. I can never quite get past a sense that there is something bizarrely sacrilegious in actually showing this voting process (similarly in Nanni Moretti\u2019s 2011 film We Have a Pope). As for Fiennes, there is great pleasure to be had in his performance; I myself have always rejected his supposed resemblance to a certain 1970s TV comedy actor, and yet in the extraordinary scene when he learns something startling about one of the cardinals and has to sit down, mouth slightly agape \u2013 well, I did see it. And so the conclave becomes a nail-biting horse race with a photo-finish; the distinguished novelist with whom I saw this film told me on the way out that the story is completely lifted from National Velvet. That\u2019s as may be; but what a performance from Fiennes. \u2022 Conclave is in UK and Irish cinemas from 29 November and Australia from 9 January."

            "content": "On Wednesday evening, I went to the Royal Festival Hall on London\u2019s Southbank Centre to hear the Icelandic pianist, V\u00edkingur \u00d3lafsson, play Brahms\u2019 Piano Concerto No 1, the tickets for which I\u2019d booked aeons ago, in ignorance of the future significance of the date. \u00d3lafsson\u2019s marvellous name conjures someone ruggedly bearded, a tame puffin or guillemot perhaps sitting on the shoulder of his tufty jumper, when in fact he looks more like one of the cast of Mad Men. But either way, to see him on stage is incredibly exciting. He plays with such fervour, leaning into the orchestra whenever his fingers are idle, his body like a flag in high wind. \u00d3lafsson\u2019s encore was immaculately well judged. \u201cThis is a prayer for the world,\u201d he said, before giving the crowd his version of Ave Maria, composed by his countryman Sigvaldi Kaldal\u00f3ns. Don\u2019t worry: this isn\u2019t one of those awful hopey, joy-is-a-strategy columns. We\u2019re where we are now because one lot of people is wholly unable to imagine how another lot of people thinks; it would be sensible of me not to make any assumptions about how you felt last Wednesday. But if you did (and do) feel glum, all I can say is that a sense of perspective is always useful. As I listened, I scrolled dates in my mind. Brahms composed his first piano concerto in 1858, following a period of great sorrow (the mental illness and death of his friend Robert Schumann), and here were 3,000 people drinking it in, rapt, 166 years later. The thought, almost as much as the music, lifted me up. No need even for a glass of something stiff in the interval. A prize-winning turkey To a party to celebrate another tonic: the publication of Box Office Poison, a hilarious history of Hollywood flops by Tim Robey. My favourite chapter is devoted to Doctor Dolittle, starring Rex Harrison and so many animals that the set, carefully upholstered with plastic, had regularly to be hosed down with ammonia to rid it of their waste. What a fiasco! Harrison was a famously unpleasant man, and I can\u2019t think of him being forced to promote the movie by riding a giraffe for the cover of Life without laughing out loud (the giraffe in question had previously held up shooting for days, having reportedly stepped on its own penis). But while the film was undoubtedly a turkey, it did manage to win two Oscars at the 1968 Academy awards. One was for visual effects, and may be credited largely to the construction of a giant pink sea snail, a monster prop that weighed eight tonnes and cost $65,000 to build. The following year, the same Oscar went to Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey, a decision on the part of the academy that was, as Robey puts it, the rough equivalent of \u201chanding consecutive literary prizes to Dan Brown and Aeschylus\u201d. Cabin fever In her budget speech, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, made reference to \u201cchildren in portacabins [sic] as school roofs crumble\u201d \u2013 cue a social media campaign by a trademark-patrolling Portakabin in which children described how warm they found these supposedly temporary buildings. Hmm. Again, some things never change, and maybe Portakabins are one of them. At my school, we had several, and now I think about it, they were quite toasty, though we all called them terrapins. The sixth-form terrapin, a luxurious quadruple-roomer with a kettle, smelled of Cup-a-Soup and the Body Shop\u2019s White Musk, and it was to us the ne plus ultra of educational accommodations: a sign that we had made it, and would soon be on our way out. \u2022 Rachel Cooke is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

BBC One and iPlayer from 10.40pm \u2013 US Election 2024 The BBC\u2019s overnight election coverage will be anchored from Washington DC by US chief presenters Caitr\u00edona Perry and Sumi Somaskanda who have, the BBC boldly states, \u201cunrivalled knowledge and experience of the US political landscape\u201d. They will be joined by special correspondent Katty Kay, social media investigations correspondent Marianna Spring and, on the graphics touchscreen, Christian Fraser. Clive Myrie will join them after he has presented News at 10 from outside the White House. At 6am, the programme combines with BBC Breakfast with Jon Kay in the studio and runs through to 9.30am. ITV \u2013 Harris v Trump: The Results Just as he did in 2016 and 2020, the charming, unflappable Tom Bradby anchors ITV\u2019s coverage. He also anchored ITV\u2019s UK election coverage in 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2024. In a recent interview with the Radio Times, Bradby admitted that \u201cthere aren\u2019t many white, male anchors left\u201d and while he didn\u2019t feel worried, perhaps he should. \u201cYou just put your head down, do a good job and try to be as nice as you can to everyone around you. As you get older, you think: \u2018Will I be remembered as somebody who was decent to work with?\u2019\u201d He\u2019ll be helped by correspondents Robert Moore and Anushka Asthana with a guest list that includes Sarah Palin. At 6am, Susanna Reid and Ed Balls take over with Good Morning Britain, live from Washington, with a guests including Stormy Daniels, Jon Sopel and Trump\u2019s Harris-supporting nephew Fred Trump III. Channel 4 \u2013 America Decides: US Presidential Election Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Matt Frei, Emily Maitlis and Jeremy Vine will present Channel 4\u2019s coverage from 10pm and they promise an undeniably impressive roster of guests. They include Boris Johnson, the former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, Michael Gove, David Miliband, Democrat Carol Moseley Braun \u2013 the first African American woman elected to the US Senate \u2013 and Republicans John Bolton and Sean Spicer, Trump\u2019s former White House press secretary. There\u2019s also \u2013 and why not? \u2013 Rufus Wainwright, Grayson Perry and Brian Cox. Channel 4 is partnered with CNN meaning, it says, it will be \u201cthe definitive way to watch the US election in the UK\u201d. Sky News \u2013 America Votes Sky News has joined forces with the US network NBC meaning it will have, it says, \u201cthe fastest and most accurate race projections\u201d of any broadcaster. It will come from NBC\u2019s Meet the Press studio in Washington DC and be anchored by Mark Austin and Yalda Hakim, helped by US correspondent Mark Stone with Lewis Goodall on the data screens. BBC Radio For those who don\u2019t like looking at people, Radio 4, 5 Live and the World Service combine for a 10pm-6am election night special live from DC presented by Nuala McGovern and Ros Atkins. At 6am, Justin Webb, presenting the Today programme from DC, takes over. Going out There are a number of in-person US election watch parties with Democrats Abroad UK staging an event in \u201cthe Westminster area of London\u201d, which runs from 7pm-11am; and Republicans Overseas UK having its post-election party in Chelsea. For those who expect line dancing, it\u2019s Honky Tonk Tuesday at Dropkick Murphys in Edinburgh where the frivolities will be followed by a live show of results through to 3am. The election watch party at the Cambridge Union, 9pm-6am, is open to members of the public, but probably no line dancing. For a more sober event, head to the US Election 2024 Breakfast organised by the Birmingham chambers of commerce between 8am-9.45am. Definitely no line dancing."

            "content": "Ireland\u2019s voters go to the polls on Friday 29 November, three weeks after the prime minister, Simon Harris, ended months of speculation by dissolving the coalition government before the end of its five-year term in March next year. Harris\u2019s centre-right Fine Gael is seeking an unprecedented fourth successive term in office \u2013 a prospect that looks possible despite a significant recent dip in the polls and a slight recovery in support for its opposition rival, Sinn F\u00e9in. Who are the main players and how are they polling? One of Ireland\u2019s two historic centre-right parties, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, has led every Irish government for the past century. At the last election, in 2020, the two longstanding rivals went into coalition together for the first time, joined by the smaller Green party. The two core partners agreed to rotate the post of prime minister, or taoiseach, midway through their term. In March, Fine Gael\u2019s leader, Leo Varadkar, resigned. Harris, known as the \u201cTikTok taoiseach\u201d for his media skills, took over, re-energising the party and overseeing a surge in the polls. Meanwhile, the popularity of the leading opposition party \u2013 the leftwing, republican Sinn F\u00e9in, which in 2020 won the popular vote and finished second in terms of seats behind Fianna F\u00e1il \u2013 has plunged over unclear immigration policies and a string of scandals. Two years ago Sinn F\u00e9in, led by Mary Lou McDonald, was on 36% in the polls in Ireland and, installed as the largest party in Northern Ireland\u2019s assembly, had high hopes of forming its first government in Dublin, paving the way for a possible referendum on Irish reunification. Polls in recent days suggest support for Fine Gael has fallen from 25% to about 20%, reflecting a series of missteps on the campaign trail, with Fianna F\u00e1il, led by the foreign minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin, on 21% and Sinn F\u00e9in recovering slightly to about 20%. None of the remaining smaller parties are forecast to exceed 5% and independents and others should collect about 21% of the vote. What\u2019s the system and how does it work? Pay attention, it\u2019s complicated. After changes recommended by the electoral commission, Ireland\u2019s new D\u00e1il, or lower house of parliament, will have 174 members, known as Teachta D\u00e1la or TDs, compared with 160 last time, representing 43 constituencies (up by four). Constituencies return three, four or five TDs. Nearly 700 candidates, including more than 170 independents, are standing \u2013 but none of the 20 parties in the race is fielding enough to win a majority on its own, meaning another coalition government is certain. Ireland uses a proportional representation electoral system with single transferable vote, meaning voters rank their preferred candidates \u2013 as many as they like \u2013 in order, marking their first choice with a 1, their second choice with a 2 and so on. The count then takes place over several rounds, with candidates needing to reach a particular vote share depending on their constituency to be elected. If a voter\u2019s number one pick has already reached that quota or is knocked out, their vote goes to their next choice. With 20 or more candidates in some constituencies, the counting \u2013 as it did in the previous 2020 election \u2013 could well take several days. Only then can possibly months-long negotiations begin on forming a new government and the D\u00e0il elect the new taoiseach. What are the main issues and what\u2019s the likely outcome? The cost of living remains a key concern for voters and, although falling interest rates and a recent \u20ac10.5bn giveaway budget may have cushioned the pain, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il are well aware that higher prices spell danger for incumbent parties. Healthcare funding is another big issue, as well as Ireland\u2019s continuing housing crisis, with young people in particular struggling with sky-high rents and 61% of Irish respondents (against 10% EU-wide) last year citing housing as one of the country\u2019s top two problems. Immigration and asylum is another hot-button topic, with a record number of arrivals this year and growing polarisation over the issue being increasingly fuelled by far-right actors leading to, at times, violent protests. Polls show almost two-thirds want tougher controls. Also being raised on the doorstep is a less vexed question: what to do with the \u20ac14bn of Apple\u2019s tax money coming Ireland\u2019s way thanks to a ruling by the highest EU court. Some urge spending on housing and infrastructure, others on education and poverty alleviation. Regardless of the recent decline in Fine Gael\u2019s fortunes, Sinn F\u00e9in would still need to finish a long way ahead of both Fianna F\u00e1il and Harris\u2019s party to cut off their path to re-election, since both have pledged to govern together again without it. When the results do eventually finally become clear after polls close at 10pm on Friday, experts say Ireland\u2019s two main centre-right parties should be in a position to form a new coalition with the Greens, another small centre-left party or a group of independents."

The two candidates have offered starkly different visions for the future of the nation. As the election enters the final stretch, the Guardian US is averaging national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring. Latest analysis: Nationally, Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. But in a fractured political landscape that has featured threats of retribution from Trump, accusations of fascism and racism from Harris, and warnings that democracy itself is on the ballot, the bigger picture \u2013 that uniformity, over a prolonged period \u2013 has seasoned observers scratching their heads. \u2013 Robert Tait, 2 November Read more Notes on data To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures. Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases. Our averages are an estimate of the support that the candidates have in key swing states and on the national stage. The election is decided by the electoral college, so these averages should not be taken as a likelihood of winning the election in November.

            "date": "2024-11-04T14:02:14Z",
            "content": "As many anxious US election watchers constantly refresh the forecast from 538 in the final days before polls close, their attention tends to focus on the presidential race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, but the polling website\u2019s forecasts of the battle for House and the Senate paint an even more worrying picture for Democrats. As of Saturday evening, 538 gives Trump a 50% chance of winning the presidential race, while Republicans have a comfortable 90% chance of regaining control of the Senate and a narrower 52% chance of maintaining their House majority. Those numbers reflect a reality that is chilling to left-leaning Americans: Republicans have a decent shot at winning not just the White House but full control of Congress. Even without majorities in both chambers of Congress, Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential race would give him significant control over US foreign policy and the makeup of the federal government, both of which he is seeking to overhaul. But a Republican trifecta in Washington would give Trump much more sweeping power to implement his legislative agenda. As the Guardian has outlined through the Stakes project, Trump\u2019s plans include extending tax cuts, rolling back landmark laws signed by Joe Biden and advancing a rightwing cultural agenda. One of Republicans\u2019 most oft-repeated campaign promises is that they will extend the tax cuts Trump signed into law in 2017, many of which are set to expire at the end of 2025. An analysis from the non-partisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that making the tax cuts permanent would cost $288.5bn in 2026 alone and disproportionately benefit the highest-income households. The highest-income 20% of Americans would receive nearly two-thirds of that tax benefit, compared with just 1% for the lowest-income 20% of Americans. Perhaps the most haunting possibility for Democrats is that Republicans would use their governing trifecta in Washington to enact a nationwide abortion ban. Trump has said he would veto such a policy, but his repeated flip-flopping on the issue has raised questions about that claim. Research has shown that existing abortion bans have forced doctors to provide substandard medical care, and they have been blamed for the deaths of at least four women: Josseli Barnica, Nevaeh Crain, Candi Miller and Amber Thurman. With majorities in both chambers, Republicans could also allocate vast resources to assist Trump\u2019s plan to deport millions of undocumented migrants, which has become a central plank of his re-election platform. While US courts have affirmed that presidents have much leeway when it comes to setting immigration policies, Trump will need Congress to appropriate extensive funds to carry out such a massive deportation operation. \u201cThe United States is now an occupied country,\u201d Trump said at a recent rally in Atlanta. \u201cBut on November 5, 2024, that will be liberation day in America.\u201d In addition to advancing Trump\u2019s agenda, Republicans would almost certainly be looking to unravel key portions of Biden\u2019s legacy, including the Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA marked the country\u2019s most significant response yet to the climate crisis and has spurred significant energy-related investments in many districts, prompting some Republicans to suggest that Congress should preserve some of the law\u2019s provisions while repealing others. That quandary reflects a potential problem for Republicans if they win full control of Congress: what will they do with the Affordable Care Act (ACA)? When Republicans last held a governing trifecta, during Trump\u2019s first two years in office, they tried and failed to repeal and replace the ACA. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, recently suggested that there would be \u201cno Obamacare\u201d if his party wins big on Tuesday, according to a video published by NBC News. But he seemed to caveat that statement by telling supporters: \u201cThe ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\u201d In recent years, both parties have experienced the pains of governing with narrow congressional majorities, and election experts widely expect the battle for the House and Senate to be especially close this year. During Biden\u2019s first two years in office, his legislative proposals were repeatedly blocked in the Senate despite Democrats holding a majority because of the concerns of two centrist members of their caucus, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. When Republicans held a 52-48 majority in the Senate in 2017, they still failed to repeal and replace the ACA because three members of their conference blocked the proposal. Two of those members \u2013 Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2013 are still in the Senate today and may be resistant to various components of Trump\u2019s agenda, particularly a potential abortion ban. Despite the potential challenges of narrow majorities, Trump has made clear at every turn that he will use his presidential power to its maximum effect if he wins on Tuesday. \u201cWith your vote this November, we\u2019re going to fire Kamala and we are going to save America,\u201d Trump said at his recent rally in State College, Pennsylvania. \u201cWe will never ever back down, and we will never surrender.\u201d The voters will have the final say on Tuesday to determine just how much power Trump and his party will have come January.

            "title": "US dollar weakens as election polls shift away from Donald Trump \u2013 as it happened",
            "date": "2024-11-04T15:10:55Z",
            "content": "There is the deep uncertainty over the US election result, with most respected probability models showing a 50/50 chance of Kamala Harris or Donald Trump triumphing. But what economists do mostly agree on is that a Trump victory would likely be inflationary. That would strengthen the US dollar. The dollar\u2019s decline on Monday \u2013 down 0.6% so far \u2013 has come in response to polls suggesting that Harris\u2019s odds are slightly better than previously thought. But it is still a toss-up. Rupert Thompson, chief economist at Iboss, a financial adviser, said: Trump remains the favourite at this stage although it remains far too close to call, particularly as the polls over the weekend showed some move back towards Harris. If Harris wins, the reaction might well be a collective yawn, except for the fact that any victory would no doubt be very close and subject to vehement challenge by Trump and his supporters. She would be very unlikely to gain a clean sweep (ie the Democrats control Congress as well as the Presidency) severely limiting her ability to enact her plans to cut taxes and increase spending. If Trump wins, the market reaction is more uncertain. Again, it will partly depend on whether he gains a clean sweep which is more likely for Trump than Harris. If he doesn\u2019t, this would constrain his room to cut taxes but not alter his ability to increase tariffs. A Trump victory is likely to lead to a rather stronger dollar and higher government bond yields because his plans to raise tariffs sharply would boost inflation and reduce the willingness of the Fed to reduce rates. Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy, wrote that \u201cwhatever the outcome\u201d this week is \u201clikely to prove volatile\u201d. We think the near-term effect of a Trump win would be a stronger dollar, especially if accompanied by Republican control of Congress, while a Harris win would lead to a weaker greenback. That would be in line with what happened immediately after the last two US elections.

JJ Wall Street is in wait-and-see mode ahead of tomorrow\u2019s US election: there is barely any movement on the major stock indices. Here are the opening snaps, via Reuters: S&amp;P 500 UP 0.84 POINTS, OR 0.01%, AT 5,729.64 NASDAQ DOWN 18.20 POINTS, OR 0.10%, AT 18,221.71 DOW JONES DOWN 45.20 POINTS, OR 0.11%, AT 42,006.99 The US dollar is on course for its biggest one-day fall since 24 September \u2013 six weeks ago. Since then the value of the dollar has risen by about 3% as traders have adjusted to what seemed increasingly likely to be a victory for Donald Trump. But it should be stressed that this is all conjecture by a lot of investors with different opinions, and mostly without any special insight into who will win the election. Some foreign exchange watchers are just waiting for that uncertainty to be gone\u2026 Donald Trump is expected to increase US government borrowing, prompting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. That has meant a Trump win has become associated with a stronger dollar. That has also meant that the stregnth of the dollar in recent weeks appears to have been closely tied to his prospects in tomorrow\u2019s presidential election. Recent polls suggest that Kamala Harris has found more momentum. Kit Juckes, a strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, an investment bank, has this handy graph showing the correlation between moves in betting odds for a Trump victory and the US dollar. The shift back in the dollar reflects the deep uncertainty over the outcome, Juckes said: The betting market, which had diverged from opinion polls which never showed a clear outcome, is correcting and that would tend to imply dollar weakness into the vote. Likewise, the futures positioning has switched to a decent-sized long dollar position as of last Tuesday. There is some room the for the market to get closer to flat, and the dollar to fall, but that too could be achieved by the end of today! A Trump \u2018clean sweep\u2019 and a Harris win without a clean sweep remains the two most likely outcomes, in our view, and equally likely. These are the most bullish and most bearish outcomes for the dollar, respectively. David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, a spreadbetting website, said: The greenback continues to pull back from the three month highs hit last week. The dollar index was trading above 104.00 last Monday, but it has lost around 1% since then. This comes despite some huge swings on Friday which came in the wake of an unexpectedly-large decline in US non-farm payrolls. The dollar weakness is also indicative of uncertainty ahead of tomorrow\u2019s presidential election, as investors trim their positions with the polls too close to predict a winner. Post Office redress scheme manager Simon Recaldin said that the current projection is that the Post Office will ultimately pay out around \u00a31.4bn to settle all claims regarding Horizon. Last week, chancellor Rachel Reeves said that the government has \u00a31.8bn set aside to cover all claims. The current redress schemes exclude applications from managers and assistants at branches run by subpostmasters, as they do not have a direct contract with the Post Office. Recaldin said that he understood that the government is currently considering whether to extend the criteria. He added that there is not enough money set aside to cover potential payouts if the eligibility criteria are extended to cover those staff who may have claims. He also repeated the view held by Nick Read, outgoing chief executive of the Post Office, that the organisation should not be handling the redress schemes. Recaldin, who has worked at the Post Office since January 2022, said that his view is that there is a \u201creal danger of a conflict of interest\u201d with the organisation operating as \u201cjudge, jury and witness\u201d. There was clear direction from the government that there has to be a degree of accountability here [for the Post Office], and that it was feet to the fire time. The Post Office expects to have paid out more than \u00a3650m in compensation to subpostmasters by next March, after the ITV series about the Horizon IT scandal resulted in a huge spike in claims, the inquiry has heard. Simon Recaldin, the head of the four redress schemes the Post Office runs, has said the organisation has so far paid out \u00a3302m. He said that there has been a \u201cclear acceleration\u201d in the number of claims made by Post Office owner operators this year and the organisation expects to pay out a further \u00a3500m in the financial year to the end of March 2026. Alan Bates, the central figure leading the drive for justice for hundreds of subpostmasters in the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office, has said he will once again consider taking legal action if all claims are not resolved by March next year. The inquiry saw documents from a Post Office board meeting in March that showed it had received 1,146 late applications to its redress schemes, with 697 coming following the airing of the damning drama in January that brought the plight of subpostmasters to national attention. The Post Office officially stopped taking applications for its schemes in late November 2020. However, it moved to continue taking \u201clate\u201d applications from the end of 2022. Recaldin said: I\u2019m very grateful for the TV drama to have raised the issue [and prompted more applications. The peak in activity is absolutely the result of the ITV drama. The Post Office has been heavily criticised for the way it has handled redress for subpostmasters, with former chair Henry Staunton saying that his view was the remediation department acted in a \u201cbureaucratic and unsympathetic\u201d way. The share price of NatWest Group has hit its highest level in 13 years after an upgrade from a broker. NatWest, formerly Royal Bank of Scotland, rose 3% on Monday to a height of \u00a33.89 per share, its highest since 2011 when the bank was dealing with the repercussions from an enormous government bailout. It came after Peel Hunt upgraded its price target from \u00a34.10 to \u00a34.50. Peel Hunt said NatWest\u2019s premium was justified by its current momentum, the scale of earnings upgrades, profitability and low direct exposure to some UK legal and regulatory issues which are causing uncertainty \u2013 notably the motor finance debacle that is rocking several lenders \u2013 according to Reuters. NatWest (or rather RBS) shares peaked at more than \u00a355 before the financial crisis of 2008, before crashing as low as 90p as the extent of its overreach became clear. It fell below \u00a31 again during the coronavirus pandemic, but has recovered particularly strongly during 2024, helped by higher interest rates. The Thames Water creditors have given other investors until 11 November to join them, as they revealed for the first time that they have a coordinating committee acting together. The \u00a31.5bn in rescue money would tide the company over until October 2025, but it would still need to sort out the longer-term need to raise money needed to put Thames Water on a sustainable financial footing. It is risky proposition: the lenders acknowledge that finding billions of pounds of new equity capital will require the company to battle with Ofwat, the regulator, to allow it to charge customers more. The creditor group\u2019s spokesperson said: This agreement will ensure the company remains liquid and will support efforts to identify new, strategic equity, execute a successful turnaround and build a more resilient Thames which can deliver for the customers and the environment in the long term. However, attracting billions in new equity capital relies on there being an investable final determination that addresses the gap between Ofwat\u2019s draft determination and the company\u2019s forecast costs. Thames Water lenders have called for more investors to join a \u00a31.5bn cash injection to try to help the struggling utility to survive for another year. The cluster of investment giants including BlackRock, Abrdn and M&amp;G, which drew up the funding plans, have already agreed to backstop the fundraise, which effectively guarantees Thames Water can keep operating until October 2025, PA reports. Thames Water, which provides water and sewerage services to London and the Thames valley in south-east England, has been struggling to win new backing over a months-long crisis. US hedge fund Elliott Investment Management, plus investment firms Apollo Global Management and Silver Point Capital are also among the 100 investors in the group. But the group, which collectively holds about \u00a312bn in so-called class A debt of Thames Water, issued the plea on Monday for more firms to take part in the deal, which would bring down costs for them. The statement is partly aimed at a secondary group of firms which also hold a portion of Thames Water\u2018s debt - thought to be about \u00a31 billion of riskier, class B bonds. The class B bondholders drew up a rival fundraising plan last week, but it was not endorsed by the utility company. However, the two groups of bondholders are at loggerheads, with the class B group claiming Thames was letting itself fall victim to \u201cvulture rates\u201d on its borrowing that would be unsustainable. A spokesman for the creditor group said the funding deal is \u201ca critical step in stabilising the company\u201d. This facility is open to all creditors and we want as many institutions as possible to support the company\u2019s turnaround efforts. Our creditor group is working intensively with the company to develop a plan that will ultimately lead to a restructuring that unlocks billions of pounds in new investment capital and helps deliver the improved service that customers and the environment deserve. We want to work constructively with all parties to give Thames the best opportunity to attract the new equity it needs and allow for a full recapitalisation and successful turnaround. The US dollar has fallen in value after US presidential election polls over the weekend shifted towards Kamala Harris. The dollar is down by 0.6% against a trade-weighted basket of currencies. The index fell to its lowest level in two weeks. The dollar had risen in value over the course of October as polls appeared to indicate a higher probability of Donald Trump winning the election. Under the \u201cTrump trade\u201d some investors think that the Republican\u2019s policies would push up inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Higher returns on US assets would then make the dollar more attractive. The pound rose by 0.4% against the US dollar on Monday to reach $1.2975, while the euro rose by 0.7% to $1.0910. In practice the election is too close to call with any certainty on the final day of the campaign. While Harris leads Trump in most national polls, Trump leads in several swing states \u2013 but by less than two percentage points. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at Ebury, a foreign exchange business, said: We think that Trump\u2019s emphasis on a lower tax economy could lead to higher disposable incomes and greater consumer spending in the near-term. US growth may be initially stronger in light of the aforementioned tax plans, provided he is able to pass any bills through Congress. On balance, we think that a Trump election win would be bullish for the US dollar. While the prospect of higher US inflation could have damaging ramifications for medium-term growth, we think that markets will primarily react by pricing in a higher terminal Federal Reserve interest rate. The increased risk of a US protectionism-induced slowdown in global growth could also lead to a worsening in risk appetite and increased safe-haven flows into the dollar, as would heightened geopolitical risks under the Trump administration. James Dyson, one of the richest men in Britain, has described Labour\u2019s budget as \u201cspiteful\u201d in its increases in inheritance tax. In a column published by the Times, Dyson said the changes were a \u201csingle ignorant swipe at aspiration\u201d, \u201ckilling off established family businesses, and any incentive to start new ones\u201d by imposing 20% tax on businesses and farms worth more than \u00a31m. Those taxes would likely impact Dyson\u2019s estate after he dies, as he is one of the largest landowners in Britain and is listed as the owner of Dyson Farming, the company that owns 36,000 acres of farmland (although his 900-word article does not refer to the inheritance tax bills that may be liable on his estate). The core of Dyson\u2019s argument is that family businesses make decisions that are better for the country, and that heirs should therefore not be taxed when they inherit assets. Dyson wrote: Family businesses are an antidote to the short-termism which is the blight of the British economy and of which everyone complains. Family businesses are in the blood: a shared journey between the business and the family across the generations. Britain will sorely miss them. The wealth of Dyson and his family was estimated this year at \u00a320.8bn, according to the Sunday Times. In Germany the manufacturing recession has been particularly marked \u2013 a major problem for the EU considering its massive size. Carmakers in particular have reported difficulties, and the automotive industry\u2019s troubles were also behind the fall in confidence from other businesses. Among the most notable strugglers is Volkswagen, which has told worker representatives that it may close three German factories \u2013 the first ever closures in its home market. S&amp;P Global, which compiles the PMI surveys, said: The respective rates of contraction remained sharp by historical standards, amid reports from panellists of headwinds to demand from economic and political uncertainty, high interest rates and troubles in the automotive sector. European manufacturing\u2019s downturn has lasted 28 months, according to today\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). The overall picture is of anb industry that is really struggling, with little sign of good news, according to economists. Melanie Debono, senior Europe economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, said there was \u201clittle to suggest the rut in industry is ending\u201d. Overall, the manufacturing PMI remains downbeat. It has underestimated growth in manufacturing in recent quarters so we doubt industrial production will have fallen as much as it suggests in Q4, but we look for a renewed fall in output nonetheless. By country, weakness is concentrated in Germany Yet it is a continent in two halves, said from Boudewijn Driedonks, partner at McKinsey &amp; Co, a consultancy. He said: Europe\u2019s manufacturing sector stands at a critical juncture, balancing newfound momentum in the south with deepening challenges in the north. Traditional powerhouses like France and Germany continue to experience declines, as northern Europe faces challenges to reclaim its competitive edge. Also, Italy is seeing output falling at a faster pace than in September. Spain is structurally on a different outlook. It is in solid expansion territory and is bumping up the overall number with its healthy order book. Greece \u2013 the second country with a PMI above 50 \u2013 is hiring and expanding output, but at the same time, is seeing new orders declining. A quick check-in on gilt markets: after a bit of turbulence last week following the UK budget, trading appears to have settled. The yield on UK benchmark 10-year bonds (aka 10-year gilts) is at 4.48%, up from 4.45% on Friday. That suggests that some investors have sold UK government debt today, but a move of three basis points (0.03 percentage points) is not particularly notable in bond market terms. Yields move inversely to prices. So for now \u2013 let\u2019s see what happens tomorrow in the US elections \u2013 there does not appear to be any sign of the bond market turmoil that followed the 2022 \u201cmini-budget\u201d of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng. But yields have certainly moved higher, reflecting higher borrowing from the UK government. More borrowing means more bond issuance, which generally makes prices fall. That raises the question of what the Bank of England will do in response. Markets appear to be thinking the Bank will be slower to cut rates. Andrew Wishart, senior UK economist at Berenberg, an investment bank, said: It is customary for the BoE to brush off changes in fiscal policy, but it would have to be tone deaf to do that this time around. Monetary policymakers will surely have to take notice of the Office for Budget Responsibility explicitly raising its interest rate assumptions 25 basis points above market pricing to account for the likely market reaction to the change in the fiscal stance. By raising the 10-year gilt yield from 4.32% at the pre-budget close to 4.46%, financial markets have done as they were told. It is time for the BoE to follow. Berenberg now thinks that the Bank will make one cut less, ending up at 4.25% bank rate in the second quarter of 2025, instead of 4.0% in the third quarter. Ryanair also had another pop at the UK government after chancellor Rachel Reeves announced increased air passenger duty at the budget last week. Sorahan said that it was a \u201cbackward step\u201d for the UK to raise taxes on air fares, which he said would hurt regional economies. Reeves said that the tax increase was brought in because the levy had not increased in line with inflation. The duty is also partly aimed at taxing aviation\u2019s carbon emissions, which have risen inexorably as carriers like Ryanair have grown. Ryanair is the biggest aviation carbon polluter in Europe, with emissions rivalling the largest coal plants. Sorahan said: The new government in the UK said they would stimulate growth, but they\u2019re making it more expensive [to fly]. The government missed a huge opportunity in cost [going up]. I think it\u2019ll have a big impact on the regions. However, Sorahan acknowledged that the duty increase will only kick in in 2026, so it was not directly linked to Ryanair\u2019s decision, announced last week, to cut UK flights by 10% next year. Ryanair believes that airline fares are more likely to rise than to fall in the next two years. Neil Sorahan, the Irish airline\u2019s finance chief, said that \u201cthe decline in fares appears to be moderating\u201d, and that they are planning for \u201cslightly lower growth which lead into slightly higher pricing\u201d. Consumers have had less money to spend because of the rapid increase in interest rates, said Sorahan. But the bigger picture is of a European industry that has more demand for flights than it can satisfy, he told the Guardian. Part of that is the Boeing delays but also issues with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines supplied to Airbus, he said: Fundamentally capacity remains constrained across Europe for some time to come. Fundamentally there\u2019s more risk to fares going up than fares going down in the next year or two. Ryanair\u2019s share price is down by 2.4% today in Dublin, after the no-frills carrier said cut back growth expectations. Neil Sorahan, Ryanair\u2019s chief financial officer, said that Boeing\u2019s delays to deliveries of new planes were holding it back. Boeing workers are voting on a new pay deal that \u2013 if they vote for it \u2013 would put an end to weeks of strike action. Speaking about the slower growth expectations, Sorahan said: This is on the back of the ongoing Boeing delivery delays. We hope they\u2019ll sort it out tonight. I hope there is a normal to get back to. I\u2019m hopeful the vote gets over the line tonight. Two big elections for me to watch this week. But even if Boeing\u2019s workers do accept the pay offer \u2013 the third to be put to a vote \u2013 it is \u201cslow to turn back on\u201d one of the most complex supply chains in the world, said Sorahan. It will be \u201ca few weeks, if not a few months\u201d before Boeing disruption is sorted, said Sorahan, and Ryanair does not expect to receive any new planes before January or even February. As to that other election, Ryanair does not fly to the US, but \u201cI\u2019m just hoping from a market perspective that there\u2019s a strong decision one way or another,\u201d Sorahan said. Europe\u2019s manufacturing production fell for the 19th month in a row in October, but with some tentative signs that the painful recession may be easing, according to the closely watched purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). The index rose slightly to 46 points in October, up from 45 in September, according to data company S&amp;P Global. However, that was still well below the 50 mark that denotes growth in the sector. European factories have been held back by the two heavyweights: France and Germany. France\u2019s reading was a meagre 44.5, while Germany\u2019s was even worse, at 43 \u2013 although that was an improvement from the dire state of the past few months. Manufacturing in Europe has struggled for two years as exports have waned, demand has fallen, and supply chain problems have held back companies from taking advantage when demand is there. The recession in German industry is particularly noteworthy, with the car industry under severe pressure from Chinese competitors and several chipmaking investments put on hold. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, which sponsors the survey, said: There is one bit of good news in these numbers: the recession in the manufacturing sector did not deepen further in October. Production dropped at a slower pace than in the previous month, and new orders fell less sharply. It is not encouraging that inventory drawdowns for purchased materials continue at an unusually high pace. The Covid-19 crisis is still leaving its mark here. The ongoing reduction in inventories is obviously related to the fact that companies purchased and stockpiled materials and intermediate goods at an unprecedented scale in 2021 and 2022. Sluggish global demand gives companies no reason to restock, which in turn weighs on the economy. Burberry is the biggest riser on the FTSE 350 this morning after a report that expensive puffer jacket brand Moncler is considering making a bid for the British fashion champion. Shares in Burberry are up by 5% after industry blog Miss Tweed yesterday reported that \u201cMoncler could be considering making a bid for London-listed Burberry to create an outdoor specialist giant\u201d. Among Burberry\u2019s most famous products are its trench coats, so a takeover would make a combined company a formidable force in the \u00a32,000-plus coat business. Burberry could be vulnerable to a takeover as newly installed chief executive Joshua Schulman tries to turn its fortunes around amid limp demand for luxury items \u2013 and to return it to the FTSE 100. The FTSE 100 in London is up by 0.4% in early trading on Monday. That\u2019s the best of an underwhelming bunch across Europe \u2013 likely as everyone holds their breath ahead of Tuesday\u2019s US election. The FTSE 100 also tends to benefit from higher oil prices thanks to the weight of Shell and BP in the index. Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.1%, while France\u2019s Cac 40 has edged up. Shares in Milan have fallen by 0.2%, while Spain\u2019s Ibex is up by the same amount. Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. Oil prices have risen 2% after the Opec oil cartel and associate countries said they would delay an increase in output by a month, as they try to sustain prices despite relatively low demand. The price of Brent crude oil futures, the North Sea benchmark, rose as high as $74.56, up more than a dollar as trading reopened after the weekend. The price of West Texas Intermediate, the North American counterpart, rose 2% to $70.88. Oil prices have fallen during the second half of the year as some of the world\u2019s largest economies have faltered, depressing demand. At the same time, while Israel\u2019s war in Gaza against Hamas has also spread to the Hezbollah armed group in Lebanon, it has not so far threatened oil supplies directly. That has kept prices relatively low. Some key members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) plus other large producers including Russia had planned to increase output, but on Sunday they said they would not go ahead with it. Reuters reported: The December hike was due to be 180,000 bpd, a small part of the total 5.86m barrels per day of output Opec+ is holding back, equal to about 5.7% of global demand. Opec+ agreed those cuts in separate steps since 2022 to support the market. Ryanair profits fall after summer fare cuts Ryanair profits dropped by 18% to \u20ac1.8bn in the six months to the end of September, as the no-frills airline was forced to drop fares. Fares fell by 7% over the summer, Ryanair said on Monday, although it added that downward pressure on prices appeared to be \u201cmoderating\u201d. The airline disappointed investors over the summer with a profit warning as it was forced to cut fares. Ryanair chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary said the company had offered \u201cmore price stimulation than originally expected\u201d, although that had resulted in improved market share. Overall traffic rose by 9% in the six months compared with the same period last year. O\u2019Leary said: Forward bookings suggest that third-quarter demand is strong and the decline in pricing appears to be moderating. We remain cautious on the third quarter\u2019s average fare outlook, expecting them to be modestly lower than the third quarter prior year. The airline also gave one of its regular digs at Boeing. The US planemaker, which supplies all Ryanair aircraft, has struggled with major delays, including an ongoing strike that has held back deliveries of its bestselling planes. Ryanair said that compensation for late deliveries did not make up for 5m in extra passengers it could have carried.

            "content": "Namibians are going to the polls with the longtime ruling party\u2019s parliamentary majority under threat if dissatisfied young people turn out in big numbers amid a wave of anti-incumbent sentiment globally. The Swapo party could also be forced to contest a second round in the presidential election for the first time since the sparsely populated southern African country became independent from South Africa in 1990. High unemployment and younger generations with no memory of Swapo\u2019s fight against South Africa\u2019s apartheid regime have eroded the party\u2019s support, drawing parallels to elections earlier this year in neighbours South Africa, where the African National Congress lost its majority, and Botswana, where the party that had ruled since 1966 was trounced. However, Namibia\u2019s opposition is fragmented, with analysts noting that young people would very likely have to turn out in large numbers to counter Swapo\u2019s support base in the country\u2019s rural but densely-populated north. \u201cDespite the fact that Swapo has been a party in decline, if the 2019 elections are anything to go by, I think they will still remain a dominant party,\u201d said Rui Tyitende, a lecturer at the University of Namibia. \u201cBut if young people [under 35], who comprise 42% of the electorate, show up at the polls, I think there will be a [presidential election] runoff, because they will not vote for Swapo. They are disillusioned.\u201d In 2019, Hage Geingob, who died in February, won the presidency for a second term with 56% of the vote \u2013 a steep drop from the 87% he had secured in 2014. Swapo secured 65% of the parliamentary vote. Panduleni Itula came second in 2019 as an independent presidential candidate, with 29% of the vote. He is running again, against the country\u2019s vice-president, the former foreign minister Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah. Nandi-Ndaitwah, who would be Namibia\u2019s first female president if she wins Wednesday\u2019s vote, needs more than 50% to avoid a second round vote. \u201cShe comes across as a stateswoman, a seasoned diplomat, very knowledgeable in terms of public policy, and also \u2026 not tainted by corruption,\u201d the political analyst Rakkel Andreas said of the 72-year-old Swapo candidate. Itula, a former Swapo member who returned to Namibia in 2013 after studying and working as a dentist in the UK for more than three decades, is running for a new party, the Independent Patriots for Change (IPC). \u201cWhat Itula represents is change, hope for change,\u201d said Andreas, pointing to high unemployment levels \u2013 in 2023, 19.4% of Namibians were out of work, according to the World Bank, rising to 40% of 18- to 35-year-olds. Without opinion polls, the outcome of the election in the country of 3 million people is hard to predict, said Graham Hopwood, the executive director of the Institute for Public Policy Research, a Namibian thinktank. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that this is going to be the closest election since independence,\u201d he said. \u201cMy personal view is Swapo has been the dominant party since 1990 and will still be a dominant party after this election, but we\u2019re just not sure how dominant it will be.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-29T11:39:14Z",
            "content": "Ireland is going to the polls with voters expected to choose either a second term for the incumbent centre-right coalition or a left-leaning rainbow coalition led by a resurgent Sinn F\u00e9in, the former political wing of the IRA. Opinion polls show a dead heat, with the two main government parties \u2013 Fine Gael, led by the taoiseach, Simon Harris, and Fianna F\u00e1il, led by the former PM Miche\u00e1l Martin \u2013 and Sinn F\u00e9in all hovering at about 20% of the vote. Priorities for all parties have never veered too far from housing, the cost of living crisis and to a minor extent immigration, leaving little between them in terms of distinguishing moments in a short, sharp, three-week campaign. Fine Gael claims a Sinn F\u00e9in government would spell economic risk in the face of Donald Trump\u2019s second term as president. Trump\u2019s threats of tariffs on EU exports and the promise to repatriate jobs are seen as a major peril for Ireland. Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s Martin, one of the most experienced political leaders in Ireland, has also been pushing economic stability while telling voters that housing and support are among his other priorities. On Friday, Martin said he was \u201ccautiously hopeful\u201d of the outcome of what he called a \u201cclose-fought\u201d election battle. Asked whether a fractured or unclear outcome could result in another poll being held in 2025, Martin said: \u201cI think that\u2019s something we clearly do not want to do, but it\u2019s in the hands of the people.\u201d Martin was speaking after voting with his family at his local polling centre in Ballinlough, Cork. With a threshold of 88 seats for a clear majority in the D\u00e1il, and no party in the previous election getting more than 38, a coalition is the likely outcome after Friday\u2019s vote. Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael have ruled out working with Sinn F\u00e9in, hoping to lock it out of power for another five years. On the last day of campaigning, the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, Mary Lou McDonald, appeared to have a renewed sense of confidence and signalled for the first time that she would be willing to talk to leftwing parties, the Social Democrats, Labour and the People Before Profit group, to form a leftist coalition were the right numbers to emerge when polling closes. \u201cWe started off with the big two, the two establishment parties [Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael], assuming that they had a home run, assuming that they would simply waltz back into government buildings. We never thought that was going to happen,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m asking people to come out and vote for that, not just for Sinn F\u00e9in but vote to change the government.\u201d She said this week\u2019s dead-heat polls showed \u201cthere is a world beyond Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael\u201d. Ireland uses a system of proportional representation called single transferable vote (PR-STV) allowing voters to rank candidates by preference. This means that \u201clending\u201d a second-preference vote has the power to translate into D\u00e1il seats. Harris said he expected a \u201cfascinating couple of days\u201d after he cast his vote, minutes after polling stations opened. The taoiseach said that where transfer votes went \u2013 a key part of the single transferrable vote system \u2013 would decide the make-up and stability of the next government. Echoing efforts by the Liberal Democrats and others in the UK who have urged tactical voting in general elections to ensure success for progressive parties, Sinn F\u00e9in is asking the public to lend their votes to it or to other parties on the left, rather than voice any unhappiness with incumbents by opting for one of the 171 independent candidates. After the 2020 general election delivered an inconclusive result, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, two parties forged from opposing sides of Ireland\u2019s civil war in the 1920s, agreed to set aside almost a century of animosity and share power. Sinn F\u00e9in won the popular vote in 2020 but a failure to run enough candidates meant it did not secure sufficient seats in the D\u00e1il to give it a realistic chance of forming a government. The independents could emerge as kingmakers this time around, as they did in the 1980s and 90s, with polls suggesting they could garner a 20% share of the vote. The Green party, the third party in the outgoing government with 12 seats in the D\u00e1il, is projected to lose seats but hopes to be invited into a coalition, while the Social Democrats (currently with six seats) and Labour (six seats) are jostling for the same position."

            "date": "2024-11-19T21:48:00Z",
            "content": "Ukraine\u2019s western allies have criticised the final G20 communique as inadequate for failing to highlight Russia\u2019s invasion of its neighbour in 2022 as the conflict enters its 1,000th day. The final agreed text from the summit in Brazil was significantly weaker than that of the previous year, only highlighting humanitarian suffering in Ukraine and the importance of territorial integrity. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accused G20 leaders of failing to act after his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, signed a decree easing Moscow\u2019s rules for using nuclear weapons. \u201cToday, G20 countries are sitting in Brazil. Did they say something? Nothing,\u201d Zelenskyy said at a press conference, accusing the G20 of failing to form a \u201cstrong strategy\u201d. Olaf Scholz, the chancellor of Germany, said he was disappointed that the communique did not make any reference to Russia\u2019s role in starting the conflict. \u201cIt is too little when the G20 cannot find the words to make it clear Russia is responsible,\u201d he said at his press conference. A spokesman for Keir Starmer, the UK\u2019s prime minister, said the shift in language was \u201cdisappointing but not surprising\u201d. Starmer himself used a more diplomatic tone, saying it was important to include language on sovereignty but conceding that directly blaming Moscow was difficult while Russia was still part of the discussions. Putin did not attend the summit in Rio de Janeiro for the third year running, but his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was at the meeting. The weaker language will be a blow to Starmer, who spoke repeatedly about \u201cdoubling down on support for Ukraine\u201d and said ahead of the summit that it was the top item on his agenda. Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, told reporters that G7 nations and \u201cadvanced economies\u201d felt a much stronger statement was needed to reflect the \u201cillegal invasion\u201d of Ukraine by Russia. He said the final wording reflected the broader perspective of the G20 has broader perspectives, but said: \u201cIt\u2019s not strong enough for me.\u201d Trudeau, whose government is bracing for a possible shift in relations following the re-election of Donald Trump, said the summit came \u201cat a particularly challenging time in the world, for geopolitics but also for citizens all around the world\u201d, because of inflation, war and climate change. In such circumstances, finding consensus on the G20 statement at the summit has proved especially challenging. Communiques are typically issued at the end of a meeting, but Brazil\u2019s president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, came under fire for approving a final text a day early, while leaders of France, Germany and the United States were allegedly not in the room. \u201cThe communique was closed by President Lula. It fell short of the position we could have had,\u201d the French president, Emmanuel Macron, told reporters on Monday night. \u201cThis does not change anything in France\u2019s position: it is a war of aggression launched by Russia against Ukraine, and our priority today is to obtain a lasting peace.\u201d In London, a No 10 spokesman said the lack of explicit language about Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was \u201cnot unexpected, given the G20 brings together a range of countries who have differing views. Not least it includes representatives of the Russian government in attendance. We would compare it to the G7 statement at the weekend, which reiterated our strong and unwavering support for Ukraine, and I think as that statement said, Russia remains the sole obstacle to a just and lasting peace.\u201d Starmer said he had used \u201cevery opportunity\u201d both in the main sessions and in bilateral meetings during the summit to make clear \u201cwhat we need to do to double down\u201d."

            "date": "2024-11-18T16:34:13Z",
            "content": "The Kremlin has accused Joe Biden\u2019s outgoing US administration of wanting to escalate the conflict in Ukraine by allowing Kyiv to use long-range missiles for strikes inside Russia, vowing an \u201cappropriate and palpable\u201d response. The decision, first reported on Sunday, to allow Ukraine to conduct strikes with US-made weapons deep into sovereign Russian territory has not been formally announced by the White House, but a German government spokesperson said on Monday that Berlin had been informed. \u201cIt is clear that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps to continue to add fuel to the fire and to further inflame tensions around this conflict,\u201d Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters. \u201cThis decision is reckless, dangerous, aimed at a qualitative change, a qualitative increase in the level of involvement of the United States.\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement that the use of long-range US-supplied missiles against its territory would \u201crepresent the direct involvement of the United States and its satellites in hostilities against Russia.\u201d It added: \u201cRussia\u2019s response in such a case will be appropriate and palpable.\u201d Biden, currently in Rio de Janeiro for his final G20 Summit, has yet to comment on the decision, which marks a significant shift in US policy. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had long pushed for authorisation from Washington to use the 190-mile range Army Tactical Missile System, known by its initials Atacms, to hit targets inside Russia. Peskov said Putin had expressed his position clearly in September when the Russian leader warned that the move to let Kyiv use longer-range weapons against targets inside Russia would mean Nato would be directly \u201cat war\u201d with Moscow. Putin had said Moscow would \u201ctake the appropriate decisions based on the threats that we will face\u201d and previously suggested Moscow could supply long-range weapons to other countries with the aim of attacking western targets. \u201cIf someone thinks it is possible to supply such weapons to a war zone to attack our territory and create problems for us, why don\u2019t we have the right to supply our weapons,\u201d Putin told a press conference in St Petersburg in June. Russian officials similarly pledged that Moscow would respond to Biden\u2019s decision, though they did not elaborate on what that response might entail. Leonid Slutsky, the chair of the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic party of Russia, said the US was now directly participating in the military conflict in Ukraine. \u201cThis will inevitably entail the toughest response from Russia, based on the threats that will be posed to our country,\u201d he said. There were further Russian threats issued in state media, with the prominent propagandist Dmitry Kiselyov saying the west was directly entering the war \u201cwith all the ensuing consequences for their own territories and those inhabiting them\u201d. Kiselyov said: \u201cThe response could be anything. Anything.\u201d On Monday, the Kremlin rejected a reported peace proposal from the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, to be put forward at the G20 summit in Brazil, to freeze hostilities at the current positions of both parties. \u201cAny option involving the freezing [of the conflict] along the line of engagement is unacceptable for Russia in any case,\u201d Peskov said, adding that Putin had declared Russia\u2019s demands for ending the war in June when he said Ukraine would have to drop its Nato ambitions and withdraw all its troops from all the territory of four regions claimed by Russia. The US decision is being justified by the presence of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia against Ukraine. Briefings to US journalists said permission to use the missiles would be limited to the Kursk region, where Ukraine launched an incursion into Russia in the summer. Several western officials praised the US decision to permit Ukraine\u2019s use of long-range missiles. \u201cUkraine should be able to use the arms we provide in order not only to stop the arrow but also to be able to hit the archers,\u201d the EU\u2019s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, said before a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, described Biden\u2019s decision as \u201cimportant\u201d and \u201cessential\u201d. She said in Brussels: \u201cThe decision from the American side, and I would like to emphasise that this is not a rethink but an intensification of what has already been delivered by other partners, is so important at this moment.\u201d A German government spokesperson said, however, that Germany was sticking with its decision not to supply Kyiv with long-range Taurus missiles. The decision by the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to withhold its most powerful missile has been a significant point of contention in Germany. \u201cThe chancellor\u2019s decision is unchanged,\u201d the German government spokesperson told a regular news conference in Berlin. Last week, Scholz held a telephone conversation with Putin about the war in Ukraine, in a move that drew criticism from Kyiv. The UK on Monday refused to say whether its ongoing support for Ukraine would include allowing UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles to be fired at targets in Russia. Meanwhile, France said it was still considering whether to allow Ukraine to use its long-range Scalp missiles inside Russia. Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, the minister for Europe and foreign affairs of France, said: \u201cWe openly said this was an option that we would consider if it was to allow to strike a target from where Russia is currently aggressing Ukrainian territory. So nothing new on the other side.\u201d But there was also criticism in Europe from Hungary, seen as Putin\u2019s closest EU ally. \u201cThe pro-war mainstream has launched its last, desperate attack on the new reality\u201d,\u201d the Hungarian foreign minister, P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, wrote on Facebook, referring to the recent victory of Donald Trump. \u201cThe hawkish politicians ousted from power refuse to take note of the will of the people. This is not only undemocratic, but also extremely dangerous,\u201d Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 added. Trump\u2019s team are yet to officially comment on Biden\u2019s move. The president-elect\u2019s son Don Jr criticised the decision, writing on X: \u201cThe military industrial complex seems to want to make sure they get world war three going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives. Gotta lock in those $trillions. Life be damned! Imbeciles!\u201d Elon Musk, a close Trump ally, claimed on his social media platform, X, that Russia would \u201crespond reciprocally\u201d to the US approval. Some Russian officials openly voiced hopes that the incoming Trump administration would overturn the decision after taking office in late January. \u201cThese guys, Biden\u2019s administration, are trying to escalate the situation to the maximum while they still have power and are still in office,\u201d the Russian lawmaker Maria Butina said. \u201cI have a great hope that Trump will overcome this decision if this has been made because they are seriously risking the start of world war three, which is not in anybody\u2019s interest.\u201d"

While there was a lull in the levels of conflict globally during the Covid-19 pandemic, experts say there has been a rising trend of violence for at least a decade, while many longstanding crises continue unabated. Hugo Brennan, research director at Verisk Maplecroft, said recent conflicts have had far-reaching impacts on businesses, economic growth and food security, with supply chains disturbed by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which endangered grain exports to the Middle East and Africa, and attacks by Houthi rebels from Yemen on Red Sea shipping. \u201cConflict risks are increasing, they have for the last few years and global businesses need to think about that. You can look at international media and think: \u2018I don\u2019t have a factory in Sudan, it does not affect me,\u2019 but because of the supply chain impacts, a conflict in a faraway place can impact you,\u201d he said. According to the report, the equivalent of 6.15m sq km (2.4m sq miles) is afflicted by fighting between or within states, meaning 4.6% of the world\u2019s landmass is now affected by conflict compared with 2.8% in 2021, with the number of deaths in conflict rising by 29%. In total, 27 countries, including Ecuador, Colombia, India, Indonesia and Thailand, have experienced a significant increase in risk since on the CII since 2021. The report identified a \u201cconflict corridor\u201d covering the Sahel and Horn of Africa, from Mali to Somalia, where it said violence had doubled in the past three years. It said 86% of Burkina Faso was now embroiled in conflict, while Sudan and Ethiopia have seen large-scale outbreaks of violence. Angela Rosales, CEO of SOS Children\u2019s Villages International, which helps children separated from their families, said 470 million children worldwide are affected by wars, including in Ukraine, Sudan, Gaza and Lebanon, with serious impacts that go beyond death and injury. \u201cChildren in conflict-affected areas are at risk of losing family care if their homes are destroyed, parents are killed or if they become separated when fleeing violence,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are especially vulnerable to exploitation, enslavement, trafficking and abuse.\u201d Prof Clionadh Raleigh, president of civilian harm monitor Acled (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data), said that while new conflicts were emerging, with a 27% rise in violent events since the Ukraine war, older conflicts were also persisting. \u201cThere are far fewer conflicts ending or becoming less intense and there are far more of them cropping up,\u201d she said, highlighting that in countries such as Myanmar, with numerous armed rebellions involving smaller groups, it was difficult to reach an all-encompassing peace settlement. \u201cThese smaller conflicts, they tend to be able to evolve, and they\u2019re very flexible to the political system they find themselves in. So they can be very difficult to end.\u201d Raleigh said she was concerned that violence would only increase, partly because of tensions between Iran and Israel but also because there is a trend of perpetrators of coups and assassinations, or militias using violence to impose power, being able to act without facing consequences. Iain Overton, executive director of Action on Armed Violence, a charity that monitors civilian harm, said there are trends of rising violence if compared with 2010, which included highs during the middle of the decade in Syria and Iraq. He noted that compared to the mid-2010s, when much of the violence involved non-state armed groups who relied on small arms and improvised explosives, there was a more recent rise in violence involving clashing states. \u201cThe 2020s are going to be defined as the decade of the airstrike and particularly the drone strike,\u201d said Overton."

            "date": "2024-11-28T17:33:48Z",
            "content": "A military vehicle mowed down a woman in the Mozambican capital, Maputo, as protests have gripped the southern African country weeks after an election that the opposition said was rigged. Videos of the incident on Wednesday that have been widely shared on social media showed an armoured vehicle speeding down a busy street into a makeshift wooden barricade attended by protesters and then driving over the woman. She sustained head injuries but was not in danger of dying, the director of the emergency department at Maputo central hospital said on Thursday. Mozambique\u2019s armed forces said in a statement that they \u201caccidentally ran over a citizen\u201d and would take responsibility for her medical care at the hospital. \u201cThe [armed forces] deeply regrets what happened,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe incident will be rigorously investigated to ensure that this type of situation does not happen again.\u201d Police shot and killed two protesters on Wednesday in the northern city of Nampula after a crowd that had barricaded a road and burned tyres confronted officers sent to break up the protest, an activist said. Mozambique has been gripped by weeks of protests after elections in which Daniel Chapo, the presidential candidate of the Frelimo party which has ruled the southern African country since 1975, secured 70.7% of the vote, according to official results. The opposition leader Ven\u00e2ncio Mondlane, who captured the imagination of many young voters, was said to have won just 20.3% of the vote. He has since fled abroad and called for people to block traffic from 8am to 4pm from Tuesday to Friday. On Thursday, Mondlane\u2019s supporters across the country continued to heed his call. On the highway leading from Maputo to South Africa\u2019s border, women cooked pap, a staple maize porridge, plucked chickens and chopped lettuce for a salad. On the road to the capital city\u2019s international airport there was a festive mood, with some protesters sitting on chairs around a steaming pot of pap and fish, while others chanted, sang and danced. At least 10 children have been killed by security forces since late October, according to Human Rights Watch. The Centre for Democracy and Human Rights, a local civil society group, said last week it knew of 65 people killed by police. Ancha Bai, 30, an informal mobile money agent protesting in the city centre, said: \u201cWe want change in the country. We want to be free and \u2026 we no longer want to study just to stay at home with a diploma.\u201d A philosophy graduate who did not want to be named said: \u201cWe\u2019re fed up with this corrupt and oppressive regime. Frelimo has already stolen [the election], but enough is enough. If I have to die, I\u2019ll die here. I\u2019d rather die in the protests than starve at home.\u201d On 19 October, Elvino Dias, a lawyer, and Paulo Guambe, a film-maker and opposition party Podemos official, were shot dead by unknown attackers. The deaths, for which no one has yet been arrested, fit a pattern of what human rights researchers have said are targeted killings of opposition figures without anyone being brought to justice. The embassies of the US, UK, Canada, Norway and Switzerland said in a joint statement: \u201cWe strongly condemn the escalation of violence against civilians \u2026 This included an incident on 27 November in which a Mozambican security forces vehicle sped towards a group of people and brutally ran over a person.\u201d Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"

            "title": "The Guardian view on a genocide probe call: sense in Gaza\u2019s senseless conflict | Editorial ",
            "date": "2024-11-18T19:34:10Z",
            "content": "As an Israeli airstrike killed at least 30 people in a northern Gaza residential block, Pope Francis called for an investigation into whether genocide is being carried out under the cover of war. The staggering death toll in Gaza \u2013 an estimated 44,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children \u2013 underscores the urgency of his call for accountability. While the pope has criticised Israel\u2019s war before, this marks his first public call for a deeper investigation of the conflict ignited by Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack last year that killed 1,200 people. Legal scrutiny of the conflict requires access to Gaza, which has been sealed off for 13 months in defiance of the international court of justice\u2019s calls to permit entry to investigate a plausible risk of genocide. The pope did not give a definitive judgment on whether the situation legally qualifies as the \u201ccrime of crimes\u201d. Others, including noted scholars, have been less circumspect. A UN committee last week said that Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza fit the definition of genocide, with widespread civilian deaths and harsh conditions deliberately forced on Palestinians. However, while the UN plainly stating its case might feel satisfying, it could backfire by further angering Israelis. Numerous Jewish Israelis reject the label of genocide, though many are likely shielded from the full picture. The UN pointed out that Israeli media had reported the death toll of just about 1,000 Palestinian civilians, including fewer than 50 children, obscuring the broader reality. While a callous belief in collective punishment persists, it cannot erase the reality of war crimes. The question remains whether any court will hold Israel \u2013 or Hamas \u2013 accountable. Last week, Human Rights Watch accused Israeli authorities of war crimes and crimes against humanity and of the \u201corganized, violent displacement\u201d of Palestinians. The report warned that if such actions were to become permanent, they would constitute ethnic cleansing. Meanwhile, concerns grow over the deliberate starvation of Gaza, and reports in Haaretz suggest the Israeli military plans to turn the enclave into occupied, fortified zones. With roads and bases now occupying a quarter of Gaza, the rising religious right in Israel is openly eyeing Palestinian land for settlement. Donald Trump\u2019s return to power bodes ill for both Palestinians and Israelis. For Palestinians, his early appointments signal little hope for allies in addressing their plight. For Israelis \u2013 particularly those striving for a nation free from ruling over another people \u2013 hope also remains elusive. Before leaving office, Joe Biden might urge the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to conclude the war in Lebanon, framing Iran\u2019s weakened position as a justification for claiming victory. Yet, Mr Biden\u2019s record of setting \u201cred lines\u201d that Mr Netanyahu repeatedly ignored casts doubt on his ability to wield leverage effectively. Despite being Israel\u2019s primary arms supplier, the US has failed to secure a ceasefire or hostage deal in Gaza, exposing Mr Biden\u2019s lack of influence. Israel\u2019s unchecked war has unified Arab and Iranian positions on Palestine \u2013 unthinkable under the first Trump White House \u2013 and fuelled the far-right minister Bezalel Smotrich\u2019s push to annex West Bank settlements. Sanctioning extremists in the Israeli cabinet \u2013 a step supported by European allies \u2013 could help and would be difficult for Mr Trump to reverse. Ultimately, Mr Biden\u2019s Middle East legacy risks being defined by the failure of the US-led international order to uphold its founding ideals, overshadowed by wars that undermine those very principles. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 November 2024. An earlier version suggested the international court of justice found there was a \u201cplausible genocide\u201d in Gaza; it has been amended to refer to a plausible risk of genocide, reflecting that the ICJ rather considered there to be a \u201creal and imminent risk of irreparable harm\u201d to the Palestinians\u2019 plausible right to be protected from genocide."

            "date": "2024-11-15T17:19:01Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump has tapped three of his personal criminal defense lawyers for top roles at the Department of Justice, underscoring how the president-elect is shaping the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency to serve his interests. Trump announced on Thursday he was nominating Todd Blanche and Emil Bove to be the US deputy attorney general and the principal associate deputy attorney general respectively. Bove will serve as the acting deputy attorney general while Blanche is awaiting confirmation to the second-highest role in the justice department. Trump has long made it clear he sees the role of the justice department as to defend him, and frequently lashed out at Jeff Sessions, one of his attorneys general during his first term, for not doing enough to protect him amid Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference. While the justice department is led by political appointees who set its priorities, a hallmark of the agency is its political independence \u2013 it is supposed to enforce the laws of the United States without political considerations. Blanche and Bove, both former federal prosecutors, defended Trump in the New York hush-money case as well as the federal election subversion cases against him. During Trump\u2019s weeks-long hush-money trial earlier this year, both men seemed to direct their arguments as much to Trump as to the jury, understanding that their goal was to defend Trump in the public eye as much as in a courtroom. The president-elect also announced he was nominating Dean John Sauer, who successfully convinced the supreme court that Trump and other presidents were entitled to presidential immunity for official acts, to be the solicitor general. The solicitor general represents the United States government in cases before the US supreme court and has been called the \u201c10th justice\u201d on the court. Sauer is a former solicitor general of Missouri, who infamously said during an oral argument earlier this year it would be hypothetically legal for the president to order a Seal team to assassinate a political rival. Taken in concert with his nomination of Matt Gaetz, a Florida congressman who is a fierce Trump loyalist, the picks show that Trump is filling the justice department with officials who will have few qualms about carrying out his requests. Trump has pledged to use the department to prosecute political enemies, a tactic deployed by dictators. \u201cThese selections show Donald Trump intends to weaponize the justice department to seek vengeance,\u201d said Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who is the outgoing chair of the Senate judiciary committee. \u201cDonald Trump viewed the justice department as his personal law firm during his first term, and these selections \u2013 his personal attorneys \u2013 are poised to do his bidding. \u201cThe American people deserve a justice department that fights for equal justice under the law. This isn\u2019t it.\u201d During his first term, the justice department played a key role in trying to check some of Trump\u2019s most authoritarian efforts. Top officials threatened to resign en masse after the 2020 election, when Trump and an ally in the department, Jeffrey Clark, pushed to have the department declare there was mass voter fraud. Sessions enraged Trump by appointing Mueller to investigate contacts with Russian interference during the first presidential election. Trump on Thursday also nominated Jay Clayton, the former chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to be the US attorney for the southern district of New York. That role is one of the most prized in the justice department because it oversees Wall Street and has traditionally brought some of the nation\u2019s most high-profile cases. (It is currently handling the corruption case against Eric Adams and the sex-trafficking case against Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, among others.) Clayton was nearly installed in the job in 2020 after the then attorney general, William Barr, forced out Geoffrey Berman, who was overseeing investigations of several people close to Trump. Berman\u2019s removal was widely seen as political interference and he initially refused to step down, only agreeing to do so once he was assured that his deputy would take over the role. Clayton must still be confirmed by the Senate."

            "content": "Peter Hegseth, the military veteran, former Fox &amp; Friends chat host and Donald Trump\u2019s pick to head the US Department of Defense, reportedly paid a woman who accused him of sexual assault \u2013 an encounter that he insists was consensual. According to the Washington Post, the unnamed woman was paid an unknown sum after signing a nondisclosure agreement. In a statement to the outlet, Hegseth\u2019s attorney said that Hegseth was \u201cvisibly intoxicated\u201d at the time of the incident and police who had looked into the woman\u2019s claim had concluded that \u201cthe complainant had been the aggressor in the encounter.\u201d In the statement, Hegseth\u2019s lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, said his client had agreed to pay an undisclosed amount to the woman because he feared that revelation of the matter \u201cwould result in his immediate termination from Fox\u201d. The claim against Hegseth came to light this week after a friend of the accuser supplied the Trump transition team with \u201ca detailed memo\u201d outlining the claim that Hegseth sexually assaulted a 30-year-old conservative group staffer in his room after drinking at a Monterey, California, hotel bar in October 2017. Hegseth was a speaker at a conference of the California Federation of Republican Women conference when the encounter that led to the investigation took place. Police have said a complaint was filed four days after the alleged encounter, and the complainant had bruises to her thigh. Hegseth made a payment to the woman after she threatened litigation in 2020, his attorney confirmed. \u201cMr Hegseth is completely innocent,\u201d Parlatore said. \u201cNot only did she take advantage of him, but we believe she then extorted him knowing that at the height of the #MeToo movement the mere public allegation would likely result in his immediate termination from Fox News.\u201d Earlier this week, after the claim was revealed the Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said: \u201cHegseth has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed. We look forward to his confirmation as United States Secretary of Defense so he can get started on Day One to Make America Safe and Great Again.\u201d Hegseth\u2019s path to Senate confirmation has been complicated over concerns about his inexperience and extreme views. This article was amended on 18 November 2024. An earlier version said that Peter Hegseth was a current Fox &amp; Friends host. He left the role last week."

            "content": "The family dynamics of Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of defense, have burst out into the open after an email from his mother criticizing her son over his treatment of women and calling him an \u201cabuser of women\u201d was leaked to a newspaper. A 2018 email from Penelope Hegseth accused her son of routinely mistreating women and displaying a lack of character. \u201cYou are an abuser of women \u2013 that is the ugly truth and I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around, and uses women for his own power and ego,\u201d Penelope Hegseth wrote in the email obtained by the New York Times. \u201cYou are that man (and have been for years) and as your mother, it pains me and embarrasses me to say that, but it is the sad, sad truth,\u201d she added, advising her son to \u201cget some help and take an honest look at yourself\u201d. Penelope Hegseth told the New York Times she had written the message \u201cin anger, with emotion\u201d while her son was going through an acrimonious divorce from his second wife, Samantha, the mother of three of his children, and had immediately apologized to her son in a second email. She rejected her earlier characterization of her son to the outlet. \u201cIt is not true. It has never been true,\u201d she said. She added: \u201cI know my son. He is a good father, husband.\u201d She said that publishing the contents of the first email was \u201cdisgusting\u201d. The release of the letter comes ahead of Hegseth\u2019s confirmation hearings in the Senate after Trump takes office on 20 January, in which the veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars will come under scrutiny. Hegseth, a former Fox &amp; Friends host, is already facing questions over payments he reportedly made to a woman who accused him of sexual assault \u2013 an encounter that he insists was consensual. Hegseth\u2019s attorney has said his client was \u201cvisibly intoxicated\u201d at the time of the incident in a Monterey, California, hotel in 2017 and police who had looked into the woman\u2019s claim had concluded that \u201cthe complainant had been the aggressor in the encounter\u201d.

            "date": "2024-11-13T08:03:49Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump has chosen the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as the next US ambassador to Israel and a Fox News host to be his new defense secretary. Huckabee has a track record of hardline, occasionally provocative, pro-Israel rhetoric and previously said Israel has a rightful claim to the West Bank, which he refers to by its Hebrew and biblical name of Judea and Samaria. The territory is claimed by Palestinians as part of a putative future state but is dotted with multiple Israeli settlements that are not recognised under international law. Huckabee has refused to call the settlements by that name, insisting that they be called \u201ccommunities\u201d or neighbourhoods. He has also denied that the West Bank, seized by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 six-day war, is under military occupation. Posting on his Truth Social network, Trump predicted Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, would \u201cwork tirelessly to bring about peace in the Middle East\u201d. \u201cHe loves Israel and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him,\u201d wrote Trump, who called Huckabee \u201ca great public servant.\u201d Later on Tuesday, Trump said he was nominating a Fox News host, the army veteran Pete Hegseth, to lead the world\u2019s largest and most powerful military, in an appointment that stunned the Pentagon and the broader defense world. Hegseth, a former army national guard captain who is well-known in conservative circles, has no experience in government and is untested on the global stage. Hegseth\u2019s appointment as defense secretary could bring sweeping changes to the military, as he has made it clear on his show and in interviews that, like Trump, he is stridently opposed to \u201cwoke\u201d programs that promote equity and inclusion. He has also questioned the role of women in combat and advocated pardoning service members charged with war crimes. A staunch conservative who embraces Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies, the 44-year-old Hegseth has pushed for making the military more lethal. During an interview on The Shawn Ryan Show podcast, he said allowing women to serve in combat damaged that effort. Also announced on Tuesday was Trump\u2019s pick of the former director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Ratcliffe, a close ally of Trump, served as director of national intelligence at the end of his first term. Ratcliffe was confirmed as the country\u2019s top spy in May 2020, eight months before Trump left office. A former member of the House of Representatives and US attorney for Texas, he received no support from Senate Democrats during his confirmation. As director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe was accused by Democrats and former intelligence officials of declassifying intelligence for use by Trump and his Republican allies to attack political opponents, including Joe Biden, then Trump\u2019s rival for the presidency \u2013 a charge Ratcliffe\u2019s office has denied. Additionally, the president-elect had picked real estate investor and campaign donor Steve Witkoff to be his special envoy to the Middle East. Witkoff is a real estate investor, landlord, and founder of the Witkoff Group, which he started in 1977. Continuing his Tuesday evening appointments, Trump announced Governor Kristi Noem of South Dakota would head the homeland security department, a key role overseeing the nation\u2019s immigration system. Immigration enforcement has been a central focus of Trump\u2019s agenda, with commitments to tighten border control and implement a large-scale deportation initiative across the country. On social media, Trump described Noem as \u201cvery strong on border security\u201d, highlighting her decision as governor to deploy national guard troops to the Texas-Mexico border. Huckabee\u2019s appointment is likely to signal a return to the explicitly pro-Israel posture of Trump\u2019s first administration, when he relocated the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in a move decried by Palestinians as damaging to peace prospects. While Israel claims Jerusalem as its indivisible capital, Palestinians lay claim to the eastern part of the city as their future capital. Speaking to CNN in 2017, Huckabee \u2013 who has paid several visits to Israeli settlements \u2013 made his position clear. \u201cThe only people who have ever had Yerushalayim [Jerusalem\u2019s Hebrew name] as a capital have been the Jews,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody else has ever made this city a capital, ever. So it shouldn\u2019t even be controversial.\u201d He was equally uncompromising on the issue of West Bank, declining to use the term. \u201cI think Israel has title deed to Judea and Samaria,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain words I refuse to use. There is no such thing as a West Bank. It\u2019s Judea and Samaria. There\u2019s no such thing as a settlement. They\u2019re communities, they\u2019re neighbourhoods, they\u2019re cities. There\u2019s no such thing as an occupation.\u201d Huckabee\u2019s zealous support of Israel has occasionally offended Israelis and Jewish groups. He drew criticism in 2015 during an abortive presidential bid after accusing Barack Obama of marching Jews \u201cto the door of the oven\u201d by signing a nuclear deal with Iran. The comment drew a rebuke from Ron Dermer, Israeli ambassador to Washington at the time, and the Anti-Defamation League, an advocacy group dedicated to combating antisemitism. Nevertheless, Huckabee was unrepentant. \u201cThe response from Jewish people has been overwhelmingly positive,\u201d he said. Huckabee\u2019s daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the current Arkansas governor, served as White House press secretary in Trump\u2019s first presidency."

            "date": "2024-11-05T19:51:18Z",
            "content": "Meta announced Monday that it would allow US national security agencies and defense contractors to use its open-source artificial intelligence model, Llama. The announcement came days after Reuters reported an older version of Llama had been used by researchers to develop defense applications for the military wing of the Chinese government. Meta\u2019s policies typically prohibit the use of its open-source large language model for \u201cmilitary, warfare, nuclear industries or applications, [and] espionage\u201d. The company is making an exception for US agencies and contractors as well as similar national security agencies in the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, according to Bloomberg. \u201cThese kinds of responsible and ethical uses of open source AI models like Llama will not only support the prosperity and security of the United States, they will also help establish US open-source standards in the global race for AI leadership,\u201d Nick Clegg, Meta\u2019s president of global affairs, wrote in a blog post. Among the government contractors Meta is opening up Llama to are Amazon Web Services, Anduril, Booz Allen, Databricks, Deloitte, IBM, Leidos, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Oracle, Palantir, Scale AI and Snowflake. The company emphasized the need to develop AI that is more advanced than that of China \u2013 a key talking point that many members of the US Congress bring up when discussing whether and how to regulate AI. \u201cIn a world where national security is inextricably linked with economic output, innovation and job growth, widespread adoption of American open-source AI models serves both economic and security interests,\u201d Clegg wrote. \u201cOther nations \u2013 including China and other competitors of the United States \u2013 understand this as well, and are racing to develop their own open-source models, investing heavily to leap ahead of the US.\u201d Two Chinese researchers associated with the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) were able to access and use an older version of Llama to develop a chatbot that helped to gather and process military intelligence, according to Reuters. The researcher\u2019s use of Llama was \u201cunauthorized\u201d, according to a statement Meta provided Reuters. US regulators have repeatedly expressed their desires to beat other countries, namely China, to developing the most advanced AI for national security reasons. Last week, the White House published its first memo on how the federal government plans to address AI national security policy. Among the priorities the White House listed was the need to \u201charness AI to achieve national security objectives\u201d and accelerate the procurement of AI capabilities from the private sector. \u201cAdvances at the frontier of AI will have significant implications for national security and foreign policy in the near future,\u201d the memo reads. The tech industry has long supplied AI technology to US and international defense and national security agencies. In 2018, Google workers successfully opposed the company\u2019s participation in a Pentagon project, called Project Maven, that uses AI to better decipher drone videos. Tech workers have protested these defense contracts with more fervor in the last year, particularly as many questioned their employer\u2019s work with the Israeli government. However, with the government demand for AI models sky-rocketing, tech firms are likely to be more motivated than ever to bid for these national security contracts."

            "content": "Rand Paul, a Republican senator of Kentucky, has criticized Donald Trump\u2019s proposed use of the US military to conduct mass deportations of immigrants when he returns to the White House. While Paul still supports Trump\u2019s plans to expel millions of immigrants from the US, the lawmaker has opposed using the US military to do so, arguing that law enforcement would be better suited. The mass deportation plans have been widely condemned by civil rights groups and Democrats as cruel and potentially hugely damaging to the US economy. They may also affect many US citizen children, who may have one or both parents vulnerable to deportation. During a Sunday interview with CBS News\u2019s Face the Nation, Paul was asked how immigration authorities should carry out mass deportations. \u201cWhat we know now about the immigration authorities who would have to be charged with rounding these individuals up, there are just 6,000 agents, 41,000 detention beds to carry out the assignment of rounding up millions of undocumented people, potentially. How do you suggest they implement it?\u201d asked the CBS News anchor Margaret Brennan. Paul criticized plans to use the military for deportation as \u201cillegal\u201d, adding: \u201cIf they send the army into New York and you have 10,000 troops marching carrying semi-automatic weapons, I think it\u2019s a terrible image, and I will oppose that.\u201d Paul did not directly respond to questions on whether use of the military to conduct deportations would impact his Senate vote to confirm Trump\u2019s pick to run the Department of Homeland Security: the South Dakota governor, Kristi Noem. He replied: \u201cI will not support and will not vote to use the military in our cities. I think it\u2019s a terrible image.\u201d In a post to Truth Social, Trump confirmed plans to call for a national emergency and utilize the military resources for deportations of undocumented immigrants. Tom Fitton, head of the conservative watch group Judicial Watch, wrote that the Trump\u2019s administration was \u201cprepared to declare a national emergency\u201d and would \u201cuse military assets\u201d to carry out mass deportations. Trump replied to Fitton\u2019s message with: \u201cTRUE!!!\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-18T18:53:35Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration would declare a national emergency and use the US military to carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. In an early morning social media post, Trump responded \u201cTRUE!!!\u201d to a post by Tom Fitton, the president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, who wrote on 8 November that the next administration \u201cwill use military assets to reverse the Biden invasion through a mass deportation program\u201d. Since his decisive victory, Trump has said he intends to make good on his campaign promise to execute mass deportations, beginning on the first day of his presidency. But many aspects of what he has described as the \u201clargest deportation program in American history\u201d remain unclear. Trump has previously suggested he would rely on wartime powers, military troops and sympathetic state and local leaders. Such a sprawling campaign \u2013 and the use of military personnel to carry it out \u2013 is almost certain to draw legal challenges and pushback from Democratic leaders, some of whom have already said they would refuse to cooperate with Trump\u2019s deportation agenda. Through personnel announcements, the president-elect has put together a team of loyalists and hardliners to implement a second-term immigration crackdown. Tom Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in his first administration, was named \u201cborder czar\u201d with a wide-ranging remit. In a short social media post announcing the position, Trump said Homan would be \u201cin charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin\u201d. Also returning for a second term is Stephen Miller, a chief defender of the last administration\u2019s most controversial immigration policies, including the use of family separation as a means of deterrence. Miller was named White House deputy chief of staff for policy and a homeland security adviser, giving him far-reaching influence over immigration policy. Rounding out the team, he nominated the South Dakota governor, Kristi Noem, a loyalist with a long record as an immigration hardliner, to be his next secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Experts and advocates say a deportation campaign on the scale Trump has outlined would raise legal and logistical challenges, not to mention the soaring costs and infrastructure needed to detail and deport millions of people, many of whom have lived in the country for at least a decade, contribute to the workforce and share a household with US citizen family members. Trump and Miller have described plans to federalize state national guard personnel and deploy them for immigration enforcement, including sending troops from friendly Republican-governed states into neighboring states with governors who decline to participate. Miller has also advocated for building large-scale detention \u201ccamps\u201d and tents. In his first post-election interview, Trump told NBC News that he had \u201cno choice\u201d but to implement a mass deportation plan, regardless of cost. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of a price tag,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2013 really, we have no choice. When people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries, and now they\u2019re going to go back to those countries because they\u2019re not staying here. There is no price tag.\u201d According to an estimate by the American Immigration Council, deporting 1 million people a year would cost more than $960bn over a decade. Trump at various points claimed he would deport at least 15 million \u2013 and even as many as 20 million \u2013 people who are in the US illegally, but the figure is unverified. There were an estimated 11 million people living in the United States without authorization as of 2022, according to an analysis by Pew Research. Migration to the US border reached record levels in 2022 and 2023 before dropping dramatically in 2024, following stepped-up enforcement by Mexico and an asylum clampdown by the Biden administration. It is unclear who the Trump administration would target for deportation. His campaign trail rhetoric often failed to distinguish between immigrants who have lawful status and those in the country illegally. And throughout the campaign, Trump claimed that immigrants crossing the US southern border in recent years were driving up crime, even though violent crime is down across the country and studies show immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than US citizens. During the campaign, Trump\u2019s team repeatedly refused to rule out deporting Dreamers, young adults brought to the US as children, hundreds of thousands of whom are allowed to live and work in the US under an Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca). Questions remain about how the raids would be conducted and where people would be detained. Civil liberties advocates have already raised concerns about people with lawful status or even US citizens being swept up in a sprawling dragnet. Meanwhile, advocates have pushed back against Trump\u2019s assertion that he enters office with a mandate to carry out mass raids. They point to data that has found most people do not support mass deportations, especially when respondents are informed about the potential impacts on the economy, the workforce and American families. \u201cThe term strategy is clear, foment fear, panic and chaos into our communities, because as bullies, this is what they thrive on,\u201d Greisa Mart\u00ednez Rosas, the executive director of United We Dream Action, a network of groups that advocate for Dreamers said during a post-election debrief. She added: \u201cTrump may be re-elected, but he does not have a mandate to come into and rip apart our communities.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-20T03:09:12Z",
            "content": "The governor of the Northern Mariana Islands says an $800m US military upgrade plan which includes a new airfield in the Pacific territory \u201chas to happen\u201d amid concern over China\u2019s recent missile tests in the region. Tinian, home to about 3,500 people, is one of the three main islands of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, an unincorporated US territory. During the second world war, the US launched a nuclear bomb against Japan from Tinian, and now a major rehabilitation of a deserted airfield and other military upgrades are under way on the island. The development is part of a broader strategy by Washington to beef up its Indo-Pacific security presence amid growing tensions in the region. \u201cThe world is changing in the Indo-Pacific and we need to acknowledge that. We need to face reality,\u201d said Arnold Palacios, governor of the Northern Mariana Islands, who added the defence base development on Tinian \u201chas to happen\u201d. \u201cThat needs to happen with the way the situation is,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cDo I wish that we don\u2019t have to have military bases? I think everybody in this world would like to see peace, but the best deterrent is to have a good defense and to be prepared.\u201d Palacios pointed to concerns over China\u2019s recent missile test over the Pacific Ocean and deployment of forces around the waters of Taiwan. \u201cThat\u2019s the first chain of violence. We\u2019re the second chain of violence. If something happens, we will be impacted,\u201d he said. It is not yet clear how the incoming Trump administration will adjust Biden\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy, but recent appointments have suggested a hawkish policy towards China. The Indo-Pacific plan, released in 2022, seeks to strengthen the position of the US in the region amid a \u201cchanging strategic landscape\u201d, specifically the \u201cmounting challenge\u201d posed by China. Located about 2,414km (1,500 miles) south of Tokyo, Tinian has an area of 101 sq km (39 sq miles). During the second world war, it served as a base for B-29 Superfortress bombers that took part in the bombing of Tokyo in March 1945 and the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Tinian is known in the region for its pristine beaches, cattle ranches and hot peppers, which grow abundantly throughout the island. It is dotted with historical sites that attract tourists interested in the second world war. Over the next few years, the US Department of Defense plans to invest close to $800m in Tinian to build up defense operations. Work began in 2022 and the first phase of the project, which includes the updated runway, is due to be completed in 2025. The US air force is restoring over 1.85m sq metres (20m sq feet) of degraded pavement to create \u201ca rejuvenated runway\u201d, said Lt Cmdr Michelle Tucker, spokesperson for the Joint Task Force-Micronesia. The taskforce is a newly formed command overseeing military operations in the Pacific. Tucker said air force engineers are conducting \u201crehabilitation work\u201d on Tinian to allow the US to \u201crapidly deploy and sustain forces in diverse environments\u201d. Neighbouring island Guam is at the core of the US military\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy and home to air force, naval and marine bases. Tucker said the Northern Marianas Islands are part of the US and \u201ccritical to US defense and power projection across the region\u201d. Given Tinian\u2019s strategic location, Tucker said the island is considered a backup site to \u201cmeet mission requirements\u201d for the US military to support bases in Guam or other Pacific locations. \u201cThe construction work on Tinian is part of a broader initiative to expand facilities and general port and airport options throughout the Indo-Pacific region,\u201d Tucker said. The US is leasing two-thirds of the land on Tinian for defense and military development. In addition to the $384m airport rehabilitation project, the defense department has also contracted $409m for operations and training developments including equipment, facilities and other related projects to support the military on the island. The defense department also plans to build a training site for combat skills on Tinian. Tucker said a proposed military training complex will include multiple ranges, landing zones and base camps to provide service members realistic joint combat training in a tropical environment. The US is also exploring possibilities for waterfront and wharf improvements at Tinian harbour berths \u201cto accommodate various navy vessels\u201d, Tucker said. Michael Walsh, visiting researcher at the Lasky Center for Transatlantic Studies at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, said it made sense for the US military to build up its capability on Tinian as part of a \u201cnetwork\u201d across the region. \u201cWhat is planned has the potential of being very valuable in terms of strategic signalling and deterrence effect,\u201d he said, while also noting it \u201ccould also be easily neutralised by China in the event of the outbreak of a major confrontation\u201d. Palacios said defense development on Tinian is needed in the current environment. \u201cWe hope that things will get dialled down and everybody finally figures out that we need to all get along in the region. We cannot afford to be afraid.\u201d"

Here are today\u2019s major developments: The defence minister, Richard Marles, has announced closer military cooperation with Japan and the United States. Marles, who is acting prime minister, said Japan\u2019s amphibious rapid deployment brigade would now be regularly deployed to Darwin, where it would work with Australian and US forces. Bushfires have destroyed at least one home and killed livestock in Victoria\u2019s west. The state\u2019s emergency management commissioner said soaring temperatures and high winds on Saturday caused 80 fires, five considered significant. A 68-year-old man who went missing after diving into the Nepean River south of Penrith on Saturday has been found dead. A 20-year-old pilot and his two teenage passengers have been identified as the three people killed in a light plane crash in eastern Victoria on Saturday evening. The plane was seen circling in east Gippsland before crashing into a paddock and bursting into flames. And the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has hailed \u201cinclusive trade and investment\u201d at the Apec forum in Peru where leaders are attempting to push against the protectionist policies favoured by US president-elect Donald Trump. Wild weather continues to pummel NSW and Victoria A severe thunderstorm warning has been issued for damaging winds and large hailstones over central parts of New South Wales. Communities in Parkes, Nyngan, Young, West Wyalong, Cobar and Brewarrina are being urged to move cars under cover, secure loose items, stay away from fallen power lines and remain indoors. Severe thunderstorms are no longer occurring in the Riverina district, where a warning has been cancelled. The Bureau of Meteorology said the storms would continue over the \u201cnext several hours\u201d. A surface trough ahead of a vigorous cold front is producing severe thunderstorms over southern NSW. This activity is expected to shift quickly towards the east this afternoon and evening. Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging winds with large hailstones possible in the warning area over the next several hours. In Victoria, heavy rainfall and damaging winds are hitting the north-east ranges, and damaging winds also possible for the south-west coast. Flash flooding is possible, with isolated fall totals expected to hit 80mm and peak gusts exceeding 100 km/h at Warrnambool, Portland, Corryong, Bright, Falls Creek and Omeo. Children rescued after multiple sail boats capsize in Victoria Dozens of children have been rescued after their sailing boats capsized in strong wind at Port Melbourne this morning. More than 60 people, mainly children, competing in a regatta set sail in boats from Williamstown when strong winds forced them overboard into rough waters. Police were called to assist the children, who were stranded in shipping channel waters just after 11.15am. The channel was swiftly closed while police on jetskis, a Life Saving Victoria rescue chopper and the St Kilda coast guard launched a rescue. The children, all wearing lifejackets, were safely brought back to land. PM \u2018very confident\u2019 Australian exporters won\u2019t be slugged with heavy US trade tariffs Anthony Albanese is seeking to reassure Australian exporters about the fate of their businesses under an incoming US Trump administration. He insists he is confident they will be spared up to 20% tariffs that the president-elect is threatening to impose. The prime minister told ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday that he did not expect any US move to slap tariffs on incoming goods to include imports from Australia. I\u2019m very confident. We will put forward Australia\u2019s national interest. I don\u2019t want to pre-empt those decisions, but we\u2019ll advocate for Australia\u2019s national interest. That\u2019s my job to do so, because one in four jobs in Australia is trade-dependent, and that\u2019s why we benefit from it. Homeless support workers forced to turn away people fleeing violence or living in cars due to cost-of-living crisis, report finds Homelessness services are being forced to turn people away and leave phone calls unanswered, according to a report outlining the impact of Australia\u2019s housing and cost-of-living crises. As AAP reports, a Homelessness Australia and Impact Economics report makes an \u201curgent\u201d call to the government to beef up support for frontline services. Here\u2019s how Homelessness Australia\u2019s chief executive, Kate Colvin, put it: The housing crisis has just become an absolute housing emergency and homelessness support services are just buckling under pressure. Colvin said they had been unable to identify how many people were being turned away because services were so under pressure. She said deciding who received a bed each night was a distressing situation for support workers: Do you say yes to the mum with two small kids who has no where to go that night, or to another mum who has a car? And then there\u2019s a young guy, only 20 years old, who has run away for a violent home, who do they say no to in that situation? US defence secretary says trilateral training with Australian and Japanese troops will strengthen each nation The US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, says Japan\u2019s decision to join \u201cannual trilateral amphibious training\u201d with Australia and the US in Darwin will further strengthen the capabilities of all three nations. Here\u2019s what Austin said at a press conference in Darwin earlier today: Today, more than ever, we\u2019re taking concrete actions that will deepen our trilateral cooperation. The three of us are here to see the results first-hand. Darwin is a focal point for our expanding trilateral relationship, and our bond is delivering real security, deterrence and interoperability. We will continue to grow our trilateral intelligence sharing and to increase our surveillance and reconnaissance activities. \u2018Violent altercation\u2019 broke out on Newcastle nightlife strip before man, 22, stabbed to death, police allege NSW Police will investigate an alleged altercation that broke out before a 22-year-old man died from \u201csignificant stab wounds\u201d in Newcastle in the early hours of Sunday morning. Officers were called to Beaumont Street in Hamilton, a suburb of Newcastle, about 2.40am after reports of a stabbing. NSW police superintendent Kylie Endemi said the man was a Newcastle resident: We know so far that a violent altercation did occur between this young man and a group of people on Beaumont Street at Hamilton. The circumstances leading up to that altercation and what transpired during that incident are still very much under investigation. So far, no one has been charged. Endemi called for anyone who saw the altercation on a busy nightlife strip to contact police or crime stoppers. Officers have been working extremely hard throughout the day, obtaining evidence and information to assist us in identifying what led to this young man\u2019s death. Please come forward and help our investigators find out who is responsible for this terrible incident. David Crisafulli stares down LNP division on abortion and nuclear power The Queensland premier, David Crisafulli, has told Liberal National party members the party \u201cdoes not exist for culture wars\u201d in an address seeking to stare down potential division about his positions on abortion rights and nuclear power. Crisafulli\u2019s speech to the LNP state council meeting in Rockhampton on Sunday was his first opportunity to speak directly to the organisational wing and party members since last month\u2019s state election victory. Despite the election success, LNP sources say there remains consternation in the ranks about the way the party handled divisive issues, including abortion and nuclear power, where the views of the grassroots membership \u2013 and the private views of many MPs \u2013 are at odds with Crisafulli\u2019s promises not to change existing laws. The premier did not directly mention either issue. But his speech to members hinted at \u201cscare campaigns\u201d by Labor during the election and said these would not work in four years if the party kept its word. One thing I can guarantee you about me \u2026 that is my word counts for something and I value a culture when you say you\u2019re going to do something you do it, and when you say you won\u2019t do something, you won\u2019t do it. That\u2019s how we keep faith. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do in the next four years. A 20-year-old pilot and his two teenage passengers have been identified as the three people killed in a light plane crash in eastern Victoria. The plane was seen circling at Tinamba West in east Gippsland before crashing into a paddock and bursting into flames at about 5.45pm on Saturday, Victoria Police said. The three people onboard were boys aged 15 and 16 from Tongala in central Victoria and the pilot from Tinamba West, police said. Edge Aviation founder and chief flying instructor Lorraine MacGillivray said the pilot worked as a flight instructor. She spoke to AAP: I saw a couple of the family members and like you\u2019d expect, with any families, they are devastated and trying to come to terms with what\u2019s occurred. In communities in regional areas like this, there are a lot of people that know each other and stuff like that, so there\u2019s a significant ripple effect, I understand going through those communities. MacGillivray said it would be inappropriate to speculate on the cause of the crash and the tragedy had also affected the aviation community. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is investigating the crash, describing the plane as an \u201camateur-built light aircraft\u201d. \u2013 AAP The defence minister, Richard Marles, is holding a press conference in Darwin, where he is announcing closer military cooperation with Japan and the United States. Marles, who is acting prime minister while Anthony Albanese is in South America for international summits, said Japan\u2019s amphibious rapid deployment brigade will now be regularly deployed to Darwin, where it will work with Australian and US forces. This is a very important statement to the region, and to the world, about the commitment that our three countries have in working with each other. This is going to build interoperability between our three countries. Marles said the increased cooperation between the three nations would \u201cprovide an assertion of the global rules-based order, which all of our countries are so deeply committed to\u201d. \u2018Watch and act\u2019 fire warnings for residents in Chetwynd and Kadnook Two out-of-control bushfires in Victoria have forced townships to evacuate and destroyed at least one home as parts of Australia\u2019s east remain on alert for fires, wild winds and storms. Firefighters were on Sunday morning working to contain the fires in Victoria\u2019s west, with flash flooding and heavy rainfall possible in the state\u2019s north-east, south-east New South Wales and north-east Tasmania. Residents of the Australian Capital Territory and potentially parts of Sydney are expected to be battered over the next 48 hours. In Victoria, \u201cwatch and act\u201d fire warnings were in place for residents at Chetwynd and Kadnook near the Grampians and 10 communities in the Otway ranges at the start of the Great Ocean Road, including Lavers Hill, where it remained unsafe to return. Victoria\u2019s emergency management commissioner, Rick Nugget, said it was an \u201cincredibly challenging day\u201d for the state, particularly in the west and south-west. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has provided an update on this weekend\u2019s bushfires across the state, urging households to prepare their fire plan ahead of summer. Posting to X, she thanked everyone involved in protecting Victorians through \u201cchallenging conditions\u201d. A Total Fire Ban has been declared for the Wimmera until midnight tonight. The Great Ocean Road has reopened this morning after being closed in both directions. Multiple \u2018watch and act\u2019 warnings remain in place across the state and today, and a \u2018severe weather warning\u2019 is also in place for heavy rainfall and damaging winds in north east. Allan warned if Victorians hadn\u2019t prepared for summer \u2013 \u201cnow is the time to do so\u201d. I implore you to make a fire plan today. Yesterday we saw conditions uncommon for November - you never know when you may need it. Injuries during first weekend of schoolies at Surfers Paradise Thousands of teenagers celebrating schoolies on the Gold Coast are as \u201csafe as they can be\u201d, Queensland\u2019s police minister says, as the marathon of parties and excessive drinking gets under way. But there have been some injuries during the first weekend of festivities at Surfers Paradise. Gold Coast Safety Response was visited by almost 10,000 school leavers picking up a wristband for events on Saturday, the first day of celebrations. Queensland Ambulance Service said 16 patients have been assessed so far at an emergency treatment centre, one of whom was taken to hospital. Police minister Dan Purdie told the media there was \u201cno safer place for our young people to be in Surfers Paradise\u201d while at the celebrations on Saturday evening. School leavers will also flock to the Sunshine Coast, Airlie Beach and Byron Bay during the nationwide celebrations, which run until 1 December. Pill testing will go ahead at the Gold Coast event after the Liberal National government backtracked on plans to dump the service. \u2013AAP. A severe thunderstorm warning has been issued for southern New South Wales, including damaging winds and large hailstones as a \u201cvigorous cold front\u201d moves east. The Bureau of Meteorology: A surface trough ahead of a vigorous cold front is producing severe thunderstorms over southern NSW. This activity is expected to shift quickly towards the east this afternoon and evening. Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging winds and large hailstones in the warning area over the next several hours. Locations which may be affected include Griffith, Narrandera, Lake Cargelligo, Lockhart and Darlington Point. The State Emergency Service has advised residents to secure loose items, move cars away from trees and stay indoors and away from windows. A 68-year-old man who went missing after diving into the Nepean River south of Penrith on Saturday has been found dead. Police were called to Nortons Basin at Mulgoa, about 20km south of Penrith, about 11am on Saturday. They were told the man had jumped into the river to retrieve his fishing rod but didn\u2019t resurface. A search was launched on Saturday before being called off at 5.30pm. The search, including police divers, resumed at 9am on Sunday. The man\u2019s body was discovered at 10.40am. A report will be prepared for the coroner. Man in his 20s dead after stabbing in Newcastle A man has died after being stabbed in Newcastle this morning. NSW Police say they were called to Beaumont Street in Hamilton about 2.40am and found a man in his 20s with stab wounds. NSW Ambulance paramedics treated the man before he was taken to hospital, where he later died. The man is yet to be formally identified. Police have established a crime scene and commenced an investigation, with the assistance of the State Crime Command\u2019s homicide squad. Police have asked anyone with information to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. Outer-suburb university students to get new study hubs to boost participation University students living in fast-growing Australian outer suburbs will have greater access to campuses after the federal government unveiled the first 10 suburban study hubs. The Universities Accord recommended the hubs to boost participation among underrepresented groups outside major capital cities by providing support and campus-style resources closer to home. Currently, 41 are operating regionally, supporting about 4,500 students, with five more expected to open by the first semester of 2025. Victoria will have new hubs in Broadmeadows, Epping and Melton, while NSW will welcome centres in Macquarie Fields and Kurri Kurri. Elizabeth in South Australia, Strathpine in Queensland, Sorrell in Tasmania and Western Australia\u2019s Armadale, Ellenbrook and Mandurah will also have hubs. All 10 are expected to welcome students by mid-2025. The minister for education, Jason Clare, said almost one in two young people in their 20s and 30s had a university degree but not in Australia\u2019s outer suburbs or regions. That\u2019s why we are doubling the number of University Study Hubs, to bring universities closer to them. We know they work. The evidence is they increase the number of people going to uni and finishing a uni degree. Now for the first time, we are putting these University Study Hubs in the outer suburbs. Measles alert after infectious case visits Sydney service station, pub and medical centre NSW Health has urged people in Sydney\u2019s inner west to be alert for symptoms of measles after a confirmed case visited several locations while infectious. The acting director of public health at the Sydney local health district, Dr Isabel Hess, said people who had been to the below destinations should be aware of symptoms. Metro Petroleum Enmore Road, 379 Enmore Rd, Enmore, on Thursday 7 November 2024 between 6.15am and 7am.

Hess said people who had visited these locations should watch for \u201cfever, sore eyes and a cough, usually followed three or four days later by a red, blotchy rash that spreads from the head and face to the rest of the body\u201d: It can take up to 18 days for symptoms to appear after an exposure, so it\u2019s important for people who visited these locations to look out for symptoms up until 28 November 2024. Anyone who develops symptoms should call ahead to their GP or emergency department and say that they may have measles to ensure they do not spend time in the waiting room with other patients. Liberals concede defeat in Black byelection in Adelaide\u2019s south Labor has won South Australia\u2019s Black byelection after a massive swing against the Liberals, which were trying to hold the Adelaide seat after former opposition leader David Speirs\u2019 resignation. The result adds to the majority of Peter Malinauskas\u2019 government. It is a blow to the Liberals and new opposition leader, Vincent Tarzia, after the party suffered a byelection loss in Dunstan earlier in 2024. Labor\u2019s Alex Dighton had received 60% of the two-candidate preferred vote against the Liberals\u2019 Amanda Wilson at the close of counting on Saturday night. Tarzia conceded defeat, telling the party faithful that \u201cunfortunately, it hasn\u2019t been our night\u201d after Labor\u2019s \u201ceffective, short, hard\u201d campaign. We\u2019ve got to be better, we\u2019ve got to be united, we\u2019ve got to be focused, we\u2019ve got to be disciplined and we\u2019ve got 16 months to turn it around. Japanese forces to train with Australian and US troops in NT Japanese troops will join US Marine rotations in the Northern Territory as the three nations deepen defence ties in a bid to counter China\u2019s military strength. The acting prime minister, Richard Marles, will on Sunday host the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, and the Japanese defence minister, Nakatani Gen, for the trilateral ministers\u2019 meeting in Darwin \u2013 the first to be held in Australia. Marles, also defence minister, said after annual \u201c2+2\u201d talks with his Japanese counterpart in September, both nations looked to how they could build greater familiarity between their defence forces: We have spoken to Japan about having their amphibious rapid deployment brigade doing training with our own defence force, with our own army, and with the US Marines. Having a more forward-leaning opportunity for greater training with Japan and the US together is a really fantastic opportunity. AAP Hundreds of Victorians call for help as storms lash state Wild weather has led to more than 70 requests for help from the Victorian State Emergency Service in Shepparton, in the state\u2019s north-east. The state\u2019s emergency management commissioner, Rick Nugent, has just provided details at a press conference: Storms with hail and lightning have started to impact across the state. 70 requests for assistance have been received in Shepparton alone and that relates to building damage, fallen trees and downed power lines. Over 200 requests for assistance have been received over the last 24 hours right across the state. A severe weather warning is in place for the state\u2019s north-east. Keris Arndt, a senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, said conditions could worsen. We have seen significant storm activity through parts of central Victoria and Shepparton in particular. These storms are moving eastwards and a band of rain is starting to impact the ranges. We are expecting that rain to increase this morning and become quite heavy. Bushfire in Victoria\u2019s west to turn \u2018dynamic\u2019 as winds increase, warns CFA A bushfire near Kadnook in Victoria\u2019s west will be difficult to extinguish, says the Country Fire Authority (CFA) chief officer, Jason Heffernan. Hundreds of firefighters remain on the ground across Victoria seeking to suppress those fires that started yesterday. Heffernan said the Kadnook fire was burning in blue gum plantations with undulating terrain, making it challenging for firefighters to contain. It is not safe to return. Firefighters are conducting assessments, particularly around dangerous trees. So we do ask the community to refrain from getting into that area. It will be dynamic this afternoon when those winds continue to pick up. Heffernan said he expects the blaze near Chapple Vale, which has burnt more than 700 hectares, to continue to burn for \u201cquite some time\u201d. Bushfires have destroyed at least one home and killed livestock in Victoria\u2019s west, authorities have confirmed. The state\u2019s emergency management commissioner, Rick Nugent, said soaring temperatures and high winds on Saturday caused 80 fires, five of which are considered significant. We still have two fires that are not yet under control. Watch and act warnings remain in place for those two fires. In Chapple Vale, over 700 hectares has been burnt. In Kadnook, where 1250 hectares has been burnt. Nugent confirmed one home had been destroyed in the Kadnook fire. We also believe possibly two more homes have been lost and we will continue to do assessments and confirm in due course. There are stock and agricultural losses in those areas and our teams will continue to make assessments of the impact throughout the day. A community fire refuge is also activated for our community in the Lavers Hill area. The Great Ocean Road was closed from around 10:30pm until 4am, due to the risk of fire and smoke impacting on people travelling in that area. Greens lash PM for not guaranteeing 2035 emission target release before election The Greens have criticised the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, for not guaranteeing the release of the government\u2019s 2035 emission reduction target at a major climate summit and before the next federal election. In an interview with ABC\u2019s Insiders this morning, Albanese was asked whether his government could match the UK\u2019s 2035 commitment to cut emissions by 81% on 1990 levels. He replied: I\u2019ll leave each nation state to do their [nationally determined contribution] and to put forward their targets. We have got a target that we introduced when we came into office. As part of the Paris Agreement, Australia is due to submit its 2035 target at some stage next year. When asked whether the target would be revealed before the next federal election, which is due by late May, Albanese said: Our focus is on achieving the 2030 target. 2030 comes before 2035. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, has issued a statement calling on the government to reveal the 2035 target at the COP29 summit in Azerbaijan: With Donald Trump now US [president-elect] and Peter Dutton spruiking nuclear here, Labor must stop lifting emissions and join the UK in pushing for strong action by 2035, otherwise we won\u2019t stop global warming. The only 2035 target consistent with a safe climate is net zero. At the climate summit, Labor must match and raise the UK\u2019s climate ambition and give voters peace of mind that this government takes climate change seriously. NSW emergency services are continuing search for a man who disappeared after jumping into the Nepean River, south of Penrith. Police were called to the Nortons Basin at Mulgoa, about 20km south of Penrith, about 11am on Saturday. They were told the 68-year-old man jumped into the river to retrieve his fishing rod but didn\u2019t resurface. The search was suspended about 5.30pm on Saturday and resumed at 9am today. So far, the search involves police, the state emergency service, fire and rescue and paramedics. Police divers are expected to assist later today. Billionaire mining magnate backs fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty as \u2018only solution\u2019 to climate crisis and rising energy costs The Australian billionaire mining magnate, Andrew Forrest, has backed a global push for a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty, declaring the perpetrators of the climate crisis will be \u201cmore and more exposed to the wrath of society\u201d. The push for a treaty to end fossil fuel development has slowly gained momentum, with support from 14 countries, including Colombia and several vulnerable island states, the European parliament, the World Health Organization, 25 banks and more than 3,000 scientists. Forrest announced he was backing the treaty while attending the Cop29 UN climate summit in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku. He has become a vocal investor in and advocate for clean energy and called for countries and businesses to aim for \u201creal zero\u201d greenhouse gas emissions by eliminating fossil fuels, Forrest said global emissions continued to rise despite nearly 200 countries supporting a transition away from fossil fuels at last year\u2019s Cop28 summit in Dubai. I stand in solidarity with the Pacific Island nations and pledge my support to them, both as a business leader and philanthropist. Devastating hurricanes and flooding across the world are causing unprecedented economic damage and mortality, all due to our warming oceans \u2026The only solution that can bring our energy costs down and decarbonise the planet at the same time is to stop burning fossil fuels. The fortnight-long UN climate summit is due to finish on Friday. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, is attending the second week. Read more about his role here: Warning for heavy rainfall, damaging winds and potential flash flooding in north-east Victoria The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe weather warning for the north-east of Victoria, with forecasts of heavy rainfall and \u201cdamaging to locally destructive wind gusts\u201d: Heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding is forecast with areas of rain and thunderstorms for the northeast of Victoria from Sunday morning. Six-hourly rainfall totals of 30 to 60mm are likely, with isolated totals up to 80mm possible. 24-hourly rainfall totals of 60 to 80mm are likely, with isolated falls of 100mm possible. A separate severe thunderstorm warning will be issued if very dangerous thunderstorms with intense rainfall are detected. In the alpine region, 131 km/h wind gusts were recorded at Mount Hotham and Mount Buller this morning. Falls Creek recorded a 104km/h gust at 7.20am. It\u2019s a different story in the state\u2019s west, where bushfire \u201cwatch and act\u201d warnings are in place. Rudd\u2019s US appointment \u2018sign of how seriously we take this relationship\u2019, PM says The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has now repeated his declaration that Australia\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Kevin Rudd, won\u2019t be going anywhere. On Sky News, Albanese agreed that Rudd would still be in the job a year from now. On ABC\u2019s Insiders, Albanese went further: He\u2019s Australia\u2019s appointment. It says something about the importance of the United States that we have appointed a former prime minister. That\u2019s a sign of how seriously we take this relationship, which is a relationship between our peoples, based upon our common values. Anthony Albanese says Kevin Rudd will remain Australia\u2019s ambassador to Washington and is doing \u201ca very good job\u201d. Asked on Sunday if Rudd would still be in the job a year from now, Albanese responded: \u201cYes.\u201d The work that he did with Aukus was a difficult task to get that through the Congress and the Senate. But when I was there, one of the things that struck me was just how extensive the links that Kevin Rudd had developed \u2026 at the US Congress and the Senate. He said Rudd had been \u201ca very good ambassador\u201d and \u201ccontinues to do the job\u201d: He has developed relationships across the political spectrum in the United States, as I expect any ambassador to do, and that\u2019s why he received praise from people such as Tony Abbott, as well as Malcolm Turnbull, as well as Peter Dutton, for the job that he\u2019s been doing. Trump promises PM \u2018perfect friendship\u2019 but tariff exemption for Australia not discussed The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says he didn\u2019t directly ask the incoming US president, Donald Trump, to exempt Australia from a new tariffs regime. Trump has flagged tariffs of between 10 and 20% on imports to the US and up to 60% on Chinese goods. Here\u2019s the exchange on ABC\u2019s Insiders with host David Speers a short time ago: David Speers: \u201cDid you ask Donald Trump in your phone call to give Australia an exemption from any tariffs?\u201d Anthony Albanese: \u201cNo, I pointed out, though, to [president-elect] Trump, that the United States has a trade surplus with Australia. It\u2019s had that trade surplus since Truman was president. So both the United States and Australia benefit from the trade between our two countries.\u201d Speers: \u201cWould it be a perfect relationship, as he called it, if he slapped tariffs on Australia?\u201d Albanese: \u201cHe said we\u2019re going to have a perfect friendship. I\u2019m very confident that the relationship with the United States will stay strong.\u201d Free trade and climate action push not aimed at Trump, says PM The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says his comments in support of free trade and taking action to address climate change were not directed at the US president-elect, Donald Trump. Here\u2019s what Albanese told ABC Insider\u2019s host, David Speers, a short time ago: [My comments were] squarely aimed at one thing \u2013 Australia\u2019s national interest. We\u2019re a trading nation and I support free and fair trade. One-in-four Australian jobs depends on trade. 75% of our trade occurs with Apec nations. Climate change is something that we have to deal with. It\u2019s in Australia\u2019s national interests [to do so]. I see climate change as not just a challenge, which it is, but also an opportunity and a particular opportunity for Australians. Anthony Albanese has renewed election-timing speculation with an off-the-cuff remark declaring it would occur in May next year. In an interview with Sky News on Sunday, Albanese was asked about media reports that he had spoken to the West Australian premier, Roger Cook, about shifting WA\u2019s election date,now fixed for 8 March. Describing it as \u201ca completely nothing story\u201d, Albanese initially gave an unclear response, saying the government would \u201cgo to an election sometime between [then and] May\u201d. He then became definitive: We have a budget scheduled for March and the election will be in May. Pressed to confirm the May date, he returned to more generic language. Well, that\u2019s when it\u2019s due. Or it could be beforehand. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has hailed \u201cinclusive trade and investment\u201d at the Apec forum in Peru where leaders are attempting to push against the protectionist policies favoured by US president-elect Donald Trump. We\u2019ll hear from the PM on ABC Insiders shortly. When speaking at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders summit, which assembles 21 of the world\u2019s largest economies, Albanese said Apec leaders consistently \u201cspoke about the importance of free and fair trade between our economies to lift up the living standards of people throughout this region\u201d. Albanese also said he had a \u201cfriendly\u201d private discussion with the US president, Joe Biden, at the meeting, who he described as \u201cin good form\u201d. Albanese confirmed he did not speak to China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping. Asked about work to lift trade tariffs with China, Albanese said: I\u2019m not a commentator \u2026 but what I\u2019ve done with China is work in the way that we said we would before the election. Whether it\u2019s coal, barley, wine, other products, including seafood and others, people are in employment in Australia today because of our trade. There are several emergency fire warnings in Victoria\u2019s western district this morning after soaring temperatures in the mid-30s on Saturday. A \u201cwatch and act\u201d alert has been issued for those living in Chapple Vale, Crowes, Gellibrand Lower, Johanna, Johanna Heights, Lavers Hill, Stalker, Wangerrip, Wattle Hill, Yuulong and Wattle Hill to the Great Ocean Walk. Here\u2019s the guidance emergency services issued just after midnight: Don\u2019t wait, leaving now is the safest option \u2013 conditions may change and get worse very quickly. Emergency services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay. By choosing to stay, you and your family may be at risk of serious injury or death. A watch and act message has also been issued for the towns of Chetwynd, Connewirricoo, Kadnook: If you left Chetwynd, Connewirricoo or Kadnook it is Not Safe to Return. Be aware of potential dangerous bushfire and tree hazards. A pilot and two passengers have died after a light plane crashed into a paddock and caught alight, AAP reports. Emergency services were called to the crash in Tinamba West in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland on Saturday afternoon. Police were told the aircraft was circling the area before it crashed and set on fire. The pilot and two passengers, who were the only occupants onboard, died at the scene. They are yet to be formally identified The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is investigating the crash of the \u201camateur-built light aircraft\u201d and is calling for witnesses or anyone with photos or video of it to come forward. Hello and welcome to another day of the Australia news live blog. Pour yourself a cup of strong coffee, and let\u2019s get into it. Much of the world\u2019s attention today is in Peru, where the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) is hosting leaders from around the world. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is there pushing back against protectionist policies. He\u2019ll speak with ABC Insiders this morning. We\u2019re also keeping a close eye on active bushfire warnings across Victoria\u2019s west after soaring temperatures on Saturday. We\u2019re also watching another big international forum: the Cop29 UN climate summit in Azerbaijan. Our environment editor, Adam Morton, is there, and we will have updates from him this morning."

            "title": "Far-right militia targets US military over baseless hurricane \u2018weather weapon\u2019 claims",
            "date": "2024-11-19T12:00:47Z",
            "content": "A vigilante militia notorious for its patrols on America\u2019s border with Mexico has threatened to take on the US military in recent weeks, with its founder baselessly claiming that Hurricane Helene was deliberately caused by a government energy weapon that needs to be destroyed, according to private and public Telegram chats. Veterans on Patrol\u2019s (VOP\u2019s) conversations reveal that members believe the outlandish conspiracy theory that the US government caused the hurricane with weather manipulation technology, that the US military is spraying the American people with poisons, and that members should be willing to destroy government facilities in order to stop these activities. The chats, provided to the Guardian by the Global Project on Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), raise the prospect of the conspiracy-fueled militia group engaging in renewed violence under the incoming Trump administration. GPAHE co-founder Heidi Beirich told the Guardian: \u201cVOP is one of the most dangerous militia groups out there now \u2026 with their recent targeting of military efforts to help with hurricane relief efforts in North Carolina, and their insane conspiracy theories, this is a recipe for disaster.\u201d The Guardian requested comment from VOP via an email to an address posted in their Telegram chats. In early October, the main account on VOP\u2019s public Telegram \u2013 probably run by the group\u2019s founder, Michael \u201cLewis Arthur\u201d Meyer \u2013 has been depicting Helene as an \u201cact of war perpetuated by the United States military\u201d, with the goal of ensuring that \u201cthe lithium mines are secured and the planned Ashville Smart City comes to fruition\u201d. The false claim that the federal government was seizing land from property owners in North Carolina in order to establish lithium mines circulated widely among the far right in the wake of Helene. The idea that smart cities are being created as a means of social control has a longer history among rightwing conspiracy theorists, and has even been linked to previous natural disasters. In 2023, following wildfires in Hawaii, Canada and the Canary Islands, conspiracy theorists on social media went viral after linking the disasters to an international conference on smart cities. Those claims were further amplified by the likes of the far-right broadcaster Alex Jones and Trump ally Charlie Kirk. In the aftermath of Helene\u2019s catastrophic impact on North Carolina, the federal disaster management agency, Fema, had to alter its work patterns due to fears over militia threats. One man was eventually arrested and faces charges of \u201cgoing armed to the terror of the public\u201d. On 30 October, in VOP\u2019s main Telegram channel, the account holder posted a poll that read: \u201cThe US Military destroyed multiple communities and murdered hundreds by steering Weather Weapon Helene into Appalachia country, what should we do?\u201d The answers offered were \u201cTarget military equipment and destroy the [directed energy weapons] easily accessible by the public\u201d; \u201cDestroy power and water lines that feed military bases\u201d; \u201cLocate all Top Brass bold enough to walk in public and detain them for murder\u201d; \u201cALL 3 ABOVE\u201d. Some 72% of 49 respondents to the poll in the chat opted for all three. Later the same day, the main account wrote: \u201cVOP News is openly requesting the public to provide the locations of all USMIC equipment used to control the weather.\u201d It added: \u201cWe intend to destroy this equipment in order to save lives.\u201d The account claimed: \u201cWe will not use violence against the puppet soldiers or murder the innocent like they do. But there are more than a few of us who are crazy enough to tear these weapons down just as we did the cartel water stations across the Arizona desert.\u201d This is a reference to a 2020 incident in which the group destroyed several migrant desert watering stations in Arizona\u2019s Pima county, claiming that they were used by cartel scouts. In response, Pima county sheriff\u2019s office has an open warrant for Meyer\u2019s arrest over the alleged vandalism. Although national media attention has moved on from the hurricane, VOP appears to have adopted the belief that it was a military attack on domestic targets into their belief systems, and this may have intensified their anti-government posture, with Donald Trump and Republicans being portrayed as complicit in the events. The day after Trump was re-elected, the main account posted that \u201cthe US Military is currently poisoning the skies of Western North Carolina after it has already destroyed this area with Weather Weapon Helene\u201d. The account claimed that \u201cAmerican children are dying from fentanyl pouring across the border, bioweapons jabbed in their arms, and the poisons being absorbed that come straight from the US military\u201d, with the referenced \u201cbioweapon\u201d being the Covid-19 vaccine. The account has repeatedly pointed to Trump\u2019s role in producing the Covid-19 vaccine as a reason that he cannot be trusted. Members of the group have now melded their claims about the hurricane \u2013 and plans to strike equipment they believe to be used for controlling the weather \u2013 with long-held beliefs that \u201cdirected energy weapons\u201d and \u201cstratospheric aerosol injections\u201d or chemtrails are being wielded by the government against the American people. On Sunday, in a post headed \u201cMILITARY TREASON ALERT\u201d, the main account posted that the US air force was \u201cspraying poisons\u201d and \u201cbombarding Western North Carolina\u201d, adding that \u201cuntil these Weather Weapons are eliminated, freedom and liberty are illusions\u201d. Beirich, the GPAHE founder, said: \u201cGiven the group\u2019s general distrust of Trump and government agencies, we may well see more threats and possible targeted violence against government assets in the near future \u2013 particularly if Trump\u2019s plans to use the military in his deportation plans aren\u2019t up to snuff for VOP.\u201d VOP was formed in Pima county, Arizona, around 2015 as a self-described veterans\u2019 advocacy group, though founder Meyer has acknowledged he is not a veteran. While the group initially assisted homeless veterans in the Tucson area, setting up temporary shelters and distributing supplies to those in need, from 2018 it refocused on vigilante patrols at the southern border, with Meyer spinning conspiracy narratives fueled by his apocalyptic Christian nationalist beliefs. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), VOP\u2019s activities are founded on \u201canti-government and anti-immigrant ideas\u201d, and the group has pushed \u201canti-Indigenous, antisemitic, anti-Catholic and anti-Mormon falsehoods\u201d under Meyer, who is a self-proclaimed pastor. From 2018, Meyer drew attention on social media and recruits to the organization by claiming Mexican cartels were orchestrating human trafficking operations at the southern border, a narrative that meshed with \u201cQAnon\u201d and \u201cPizzagate\u201d conspiracy theories, which were then gaining currency on the far right. The organization conducted unofficial desert patrols, and Meyer claimed to be in a \u201cchess match\u201d with the cartels. They have frequently falsely claimed to have found evidence of such trafficking: in one case in 2018, they claimed to have found a human trafficking site which authorities determined was simply an abandoned homeless encampment. Their activities drew criticism from law-enforcement agencies, who stated that the group\u2019s actions were interfering with legitimate investigations and potentially compromising real criminal cases. The organization has since been known for using social media to promote various unsubstantiated claims about activities along the border. Their beliefs have led them into confrontations with property owners and law enforcement agencies. In 2018 and 2019, Meyer was arrested several times for trespassing and other charges arising from the group\u2019s unauthorized presence on private and public lands. Despite these legal challenges, VOP has continued to maintain an active presence in southern Arizona, though with diminished public attention compared with its peak period. The group sparked controversy during a brief operation in Spokane, Washington, earlier this year, near where Meyer\u2019s second-in-command, Shawna Martin, lives. In Spokane the group again made false claims about trafficking activities near homeless encampments. Local authorities and homeless advocacy groups objected to their presence, accusing VOP members of harassing and filming vulnerable individuals without consent. At that time, Meyer also spoke of building a \u201cbeautiful compound\u201d in nearby Washtucna. Telegram posts indicate that Meyer has been on the ground in North Carolina since soon after Hurricane Helene."

            "content": "North Korea\u2019s UN envoy has said Pyongyang will accelerate a buildup of its nuclear weapons programme just days after it test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time this year at a moment of rising tensions with the west. Kim Song, North Korea\u2019s ambassador to the UN, said during a security council meeting on Monday that Pyongyang would accelerate the programme to \u201ccounter any threat presented by hostile nuclear weapons states\u201d. Early on Tuesday, South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the North had fired several short-range ballistic missiles toward the sea east of the Korean Peninsula. Japan\u2019s coast guard said the projectile wsa believed to be a ballistic missile, and broadcaster NHK reported it appeared to have landed outside Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone in the ocean. The security council meeting was convened to address Pyongyang\u2019s testing of an intercontinental ballistic missile on Thursday meant to demonstrate North Korea\u2019s growing prowess at developing missiles that could deliver more powerful nuclear warheads potentially to the mainland US. The US and Ukraine have warned that North Korea has nearly 8,000 soldiers stationed in the Kursk region of Russia who could go into combat in Ukraine in the coming days, and both countries have warned that those troops will become legitimate military targets if they take part in fighting. \u201cThe nuclear threat of United States against [North Korea] has already reached critical point in terms of its scale and danger,\u201d Kim said. \u201cDue to reckless moves of the United States, the potential situation is approaching the brink of war.\u201d During the meeting, the US accused China and Russia of \u201cshamelessly\u201d protecting Pyongyang at the UN from \u201ccloser scrutiny of its sanctions-violating activities\u201d, and said Pyongyang had been \u201cemboldened to continue advancing its unlawful ballistic missile, nuclear and WMD programmes\u201d. North Korea is believed to be seeking Russian missile and space technology as part of a deal to provide troops in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. But US officials have not said what they believe Vladimir Putin has provided to North Korea in exchange. \u201cRussia and China have shamelessly protected Pyongyang from any reprisal, or even condemnation of its actions,\u201d said Robert Wood, the deputy US ambassador to the UN. Putin greeted North Korea\u2019s foreign minister in a surprise meeting in the Kremlin after the US warnings about North Korean soldiers approaching Ukraine. Footage was broadcast showing Putin meeting Choe Son Hui, the North Korean envoy, with whom he shook hands for a full minute. The meeting took place on Russia\u2019s National Unity Day, a national holiday, and Choe said he brought \u201csincere, warm, comradely greetings\u201d from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. The meeting was not previously scheduled and may have been prompted by the warnings by the west about the North Korean troops preparing to fight. The US and South Korea announced a new memorandum of understanding to develop cooperation on civil nuclear energy, strengthening their \u201cadministration of export controls on civil nuclear technology\u201d, the US Department of Energy said in a statement. The department claimed that the announcement would help combat the climate crisis and protect critical supply chains, while \u201ccreating billions of dollars worth of new economic opportunities\u201d."

Depending on when you go, it might have live music, arts events, yoga, gardening, fitness sessions, a book club, quizzes, backgammon, philosophy group meetings and more. The club opened in 1913, originally as a private gentlemen\u2019s club. In recent years, a community interest company (CIC) has run a startlingly busy and popular social calendar. Supporters say the CIC has transformed the club which, a decade ago, had 70 or 80 members, hardly any of them young. Today it has more than 1,000 members, spanning generations. The problem has been that the CIC does not own the building, which is called Rowan Lodge. The owner is the Carlton Social and Bowling Club Building Company Ltd, which was set up when the club opened in 1913. Its stated purpose is to provide a building for the club. Both the Carlton Social and Bowling Club CIC (the operators) and the Carlton Social and Bowling Club Building Company (the building owners) are run by local people. Earlier this year, the building company served an eviction notice on the CIC, saying it intended to run a new business from the premises. That prompted a vocal and well-supported Save Our Club campaign, which included the raising of \u00a338,000. Justin Anderson, the acting chair of the CIC, said the club was an irreplaceable community asset and they could not allow it to be destroyed. Three months on from launching the campaign, Anderson said they had succeeded in bringing about a boardroom shake-up of the building company, which meant the eviction notice had been stopped. \u201cIt\u2019s happened quickly and it\u2019s a lot to take in,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything we have done is lawful and in accordance with the building company\u2019s own articles. We have written to Companies House to inform them of our actions, which we believe are the start to righting historic wrongs and will ultimately put the club\u2019s ownership back where it should be \u2013 in the hands of the members.\u201d Anderson said it was \u201ca really exciting moment \u2026 and we can look forward to the future with confidence\u201d. The campaign had been supported by Sacha Lord, the night-time economy adviser to the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham. Lord said the club was one of the most \u201cperfect examples\u201d of how to serve the community. \u201cIt has a diverse offering that stems past being just a pub, just a club,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the beating heart of Whalley Range.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-26T17:32:30Z",
            "content": "Justin Trudeau has called an emergency meeting with provincial premiers across Canada after the US president-elect, Donald Trump, threatened a 25% tariff on the United States\u2019 northern neighbour. Trump posted on social media that he would \u201csign all necessary documents\u201d to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% tariff on all goods products coming into the United States, adding the levy would remain in place until \u201csuch time as drugs, in particular fentanyl, and all illegal aliens stop this invasion of our country!\u201d The Canadian prime minister said on Tuesday he had held a \u201cgood\u201d conversation with Trump shortly after the social media post, working to tamp down fears of an immense economic hit to Canada. He did not say if Canada would impose retaliatory tariffs, as it did during a previous round of trade hostilities during Trump\u2019s first presidency. \u201cWe talked about how the intense and effective connections between our two countries flow back and forth,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe talked about some of the challenges that we can work on together.\u201d Given the United States, Canada and Mexico renegotiated a trade pact in 2018 and have deeply intertwined supply chains, a levy of 25% would prove devastating to Canada\u2019s economy. The United States remains Canada\u2019s biggest trading partner, with nearly C$600bn in goods exported to the US last year. Canadian ministers reacted with measured skepticism over the key claims made by Trump on immigration and drug trafficking. While a small but growing number of migrants are using Canada as a way into the US, far more people enter through Mexico. Canada\u2019s immigration minister, Marc Miller, likened the 23,000 interceptions by US officials at the northern border last year to a \u201csignificant weekend at the Mexico border\u201d, where 1,530,523 \u201cencounters\u201d were recorded last year. When it comes to the movement of fentanyl across the continent, so little enters the US through its northern border that the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) does not even mention Canada in a report from 2020, instead citing Mexico, China and India. \u201cThe amount of fentanyl that crosses the US-Canadian border is basically homeopathic!\u201d wrote Toronto-based journalist John Michael McGrath on X, critiquing people who \u201csanewash\u201d Trump\u2019s demands. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a serious demand! You don\u2019t have to be stupid in public!\u201d But the rightwing premier of the oil-rich province of Alberta said Trump had valid concerns over illegal activities at the shared border. \u201cWe are calling on the federal government to work with the incoming administration to resolve these issues immediately, thereby avoiding any unnecessary tariffs on Canadian exports to the US,\u201d Danielle Smith said in a social media post. \u201cThe vast majority of Alberta\u2019s energy exports to the US are delivered through secure and safe pipelines which do not in any way contribute to these illegal activities at the border,\u201d said Smith, whose relations with Trudeau are icy. For Trudeau, the tariff saga is likely to revive bitter memories of the trade feud with the US during Trump\u2019s first term, when Canadian officials worked to minimize damage to the prized relationship with the US. At one point, Trump said he was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d with the negotiations, singling out Canada\u2019s chief negotiator, the then foreign minister Chrystia Freeland, who now serves as finance minister and deputy prime minister. The threat of Trump\u2019s tariffs pushed Canada\u2019s main stock exchange down on Tuesday and Candace Laing, the head of Canada\u2019s chamber of commerce, warned that \u201cbeing America\u2019s \u2018nice neighbour\u2019 won\u2019t get us anywhere\u201d in a sign of the potential shift in relations between the longtime allies. \u201cTo [Trump], it\u2019s about winners and losers \u2013 with Canada on the losing end,\u201d said Laing in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cCanada\u2019s signature approach needs to evolve: we must be prepared to take a couple of punches if we\u2019re going to stake out our position. It\u2019s time to trade \u2018sorry\u2019 for \u2018sorry, not sorry.\u2019\u201d Trevor Tombe, an economist who authored a report on the consequences of US tariffs on Canada\u2019s economy, warned a recession was likely if Trump followed through on the 25% tax. Canada\u2019s premiers have also warned a trade war would cause immense damage to their respective economies. Trudeau said provincial leaders will meet on Wednesday in an emergency meeting, calling for a \u201cTeam Canada\u201d approach. The Ontario premier, Doug Ford, who oversees Canada\u2019s largest provincial economy, called Trump\u2019s threats \u201cunfair\u201d and said it was \u201cinsulting\u201d to compare Canada to Mexico when it came to immigration and potent drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s like a family member stabbing you right in the heart,\u201d Ford told reporters Tuesday. He also warned that if the president makes good on his promise, Canada might have little choice: \u201cWe have to retaliate.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-24T14:58:36Z",
            "content": "Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, will meet his European counterparts in Geneva on Friday after the collapse of a deal last week under which Iran would have limited its uranium enrichment to 60% purity, just below the threshold to make nuclear weapons. The offer was regarded by Iran as a first step to rebuilding confidence between it and the west over what it insists is its civilian nuclear programme. There are growing fears that wider tensions in the Middle East could result in Tehran redoubling efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon and trying to declare it necessary for its national self-defence. The talks on Friday, for which the European side has low expectations, will end a two-year hiatus in which there have been no direct detailed talks on the lapsed nuclear deal. Representatives from the EU, France, Germany and the UK will attend, butChina, Russia and the US \u2013 the other original signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal \u2013 will not. It appears Iran is placing a greater store by the meeting than the European side. Late last week the EU, UK and US rejected an Iranian offer to cap enrichment at 60% purity, instead forcing through a motion at a regular meeting of the board of the UN nuclear inspectorate, the IAEA, that again censured Iran for failing to cooperate with the inspectorate in line with its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The motion required IAEA officials to prepare a comprehensive report within three months on Tehran\u2019s compliance with its obligations under the nuclear deal over the past five years. This report is regarded as the first step to a motion at the UN requiring the retention of all UN sanctions on Iran when the 2015 nuclear deal expires next October. The IAEA backed the censure motion by 19 votes to three, with 12 abstentions. Iran admits it has been steadily withdrawing its cooperation from the IAEA inspectorate since the 2018 decision by Donald Trump to pull the US out of the agreement. Iran had signed up to the original deal in 2015 monitoring its nuclear programme in return for the west lifting economic sanctions. On Saturday Iran responded to the IAEA censure motion by saying it was pressing ahead with its nuclear programme at a faster pace. The speaker of its parliament, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, confirmed on Sunday that Iran had activated new and advanced centrifuges in response to the IAEA vote. Iran said it would fire up about 5,000 new generation centrifuges and increase the enrichment capacity. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, accused European powers of trying to politicise the IAEA and its director general, Rafael Grossi, who had travelled to Iran before the board meeting. Araghchi suggested the diplomatic path with Europe had not reached a dead end, saying talks towards a revival of the nuclear deal could resume. He said a complete restoration of the 2015 deal was not on the cards, and instead he provided an outline pointing to a future agreement. Iran has previously voiced disappointment that Europe has not broken with the US and pressed ahead with lifting economic sanctions. It seems unlikely that even an outline deal could be reached before Trump\u2019s inauguration, even though substantial progress was made in talks between Europe and Iran in Vienna in 2022. Iranian cooperation with Russia in Ukraine, and its support for the so-called axis of resistance across the Middle East, also damages the efforts of any European diplomat that argues the nuclear file can be kept separate from Iran\u2019s wider destabilising behaviour. In a joint statement on Saturday, the UK France, Germany and the US welcomed the passage of the IAEA motion, adding that it noted with serious concern Iran\u2019s announcement that instead of responding to the resolution with cooperation, it planned further expansion of its nuclear programme \u201cin ways that have no credible peaceful rationale\u201d."

            "content": "Proposed cuts to England\u2019s most beautiful landscapes pose an \u201cexistential threat\u201d, the managers of the National Landscapes Association have warned. These 46 regions, including the Chilterns, the Cotswolds, the Wye Valley and the north Pennines, used to be known as areas of outstanding natural beauty but were renamed this year as \u201cnational landscapes\u201d. They cover 15% of England, including 20% of the coastline. However, those who run the parks have said the environment secretary, Steve Reed, has given no assurances about the budget for the national landscapes. The day-to-day spending budget of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) will be cut by 2% in the financial year 2025-26. It is understood this will be spread across departments, and the national landscapes teams have been told to expect a 12% cut. Sarah Gibson, the manager of the Tamar Valley national landscape, said: \u201cWe are being told we have to prepare for budget cuts. Funding for national landscapes is woefully inadequate. We are under significant pressure from degrading nature, development and decreasing funding. But we are charged with providing nature recovery.\u201d She said in an impossible situation, the valley was facing a 20% reduction in core services as a result of proposed budget cuts. This month, the national park chiefs warned that their areas were at risk of becoming \u201cpaper parks\u201d with no visitor centres or rangers, as Defra considered cutting budgets to unsustainable levels. National landscapes are even more at risk than national parks as they cover almost double the area and experience significantly higher levels of pressure from farming and development. The value of the landscape is equal in law and yet they receive 16% of the core funding of national parks and have experienced financial cuts of more than 40% since 2010. Gibson said: \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to accept these places can just carry on unprotected. It\u2019s really important to the communities that we look after these places. At the Tamar Valley we have 17 special species that we are safeguarding and doing more work to protect like the greater horseshoe bat, salmon, dormouse, marsh fritillary butterfly.\u201d John Watkins, the chief executive of the National Landscapes Association, said: \u201cGovernment has high expectations of National Landscapes as the backbone of nature recovery to meet its international commitments and legal targets. But the situation has never been more dire.\u201d The fragile ecosystems in these areas include degraded peatland, eroding coastlines and ancient woodlands, all of which require management and restoration as well as protection from overgrazing and development. National landscapes are at \u201ccrisis point\u201d, Watkins said, adding further cuts will mean reductions to core teams so there will not be sufficient staff to apply for external funding and nature restoration efforts will grind to a halt. Many landscapes\u2019 teams are in single figures, meaning cuts of this scale are existential. Watkins said: \u201cTwenty-five years ago, the New Labour government was advised by the Countryside Commission to increase funding for national landscapes to \u00a319m [\u00a335m in today\u2019s money], but they didn\u2019t heed that advice. Twenty-five years later, we are in the same situation with a new Labour government, but with the threat of further cuts in the face of a nature and climate crisis. We are calling on the government to truly invest in nature.\u201d The national landscapes managers are asking for a recommitment to current funding of \u00a335m a year for national landscapes partnerships. This includes funding for a scheme called farming in protected landscapes, which is under threat and crucial to these areas that are often overgrazed. This scheme offers help to farmers to transition to more nature-friendly ways of farming. They are also asking for additional investment of \u00a311m a year to rebuild national landscapes\u2019 capacity and position the association to help deliver the legally binding environment act targets that require the government to halt the decline of nature by 2030. A Defra spokesperson said: \u201cOur national landscapes, alongside national parks, play an important role and we will empower these special places to become greener, wilder and more accessible. We are currently considering the best approach and will work closely with the National Landscapes Association on this.\u201d"

            "content": "Many people have likely had the experience where they are in need of a psychologist, therapist or addiction specialist, and struggle to find one covered by their insurance. But despite some insurance plans\u2019 seemingly expansive directory, call after call ends in frustration. Perhaps the doctor is not accepting new patients, phone numbers are inaccurate or disconnected, or the doctor dropped your insurance ages ago. Maybe the doctor doesn\u2019t even exist. This phenomenon has a name \u2013 the \u201cghost network\u201d. And a new class action lawsuit alleges that Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield of New York maintains a ghost network so narrow attorneys for patients called it \u201cjust staggering\u201d. \u201cA lot of people have encountered that kind of issue and they\u2019re not talking about it, because mental health care is not something people are willing to talk about,\u201d said Jacob Gardener, an attorney with Walden Macht Haran &amp; Williams LLP, the law firm that filed the suit. Attorneys for the plaintiffs, who are not named to protect their privacy, said they replicated the experience of a patient trying to find a mental health provider in the insurance company\u2019s directory. They called the first 100 providers listed in Anthem\u2019s directory but could only make appointments with seven. Some no longer accepted the insurance, others were listed with erroneous specialties or wrong phone numbers, or were not accepting patients within the next six months. The alleged \u201cghost network\u201d in the new lawsuit occurred in a plan for people in the Federal Employee Health Benefits plan. Attorneys said the insurer engaged \u201cin a deceptive advertising campaign intended to lure people\u201d to their plans. The suit comes at a time when experts say the US is in a mental health crisis. A recent report by the Pew Charitable Trusts argues the crisis is in fact three overlapping crises: a youth mental health crisis with reports of rising depression and suicide, a substance use crisis often described in overdose deaths, and a crisis of serious mental illness driving homelessness and incarceration. The suit\u2019s findings join studies conducted by academics, the US Senate finance committee and the US Government Accountability Office, all of which have found the majority of mental health providers in examined insurance networks were not available for appointments. \u201cThese are deceptive business practices and these insurance companies should be held accountable in courts,\u201d said Democratic senator Tina Smith of Minnesota. Smith introduced a bill to fine insurance companies for inaccurate directories, among other provisions. Smith said insurers are \u201cnot following the letter and the spirit of the mental health parity law\u201d, which requires companies to cover mental health to the same degree they cover physical health. Additionally, provisions of the No Surprises Act require insurers to review their provider networks every 90 days, and for bills acquired as a result of inaccurate listings to be paid as if they were in-network. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of sad to think we would have to pass a law to say, \u2018You really have to do this and we will put penalties on you if you don\u2019t,\u2019 but I think that is another important step we need to take,\u201d Smith said. The US Senate finance committee examined ghost networks in Medicare Advantage plans, private insurance available to Medicare beneficiaries, a public health insurance program for elderly and disabled Americans. The plans have been widely scrutinized for unscrupulous business practices. More than 80% of providers were \u201cghosts\u201d \u2013 unreachable, out-of-network or unavailable for appointments. In a 2020 study, academics in Louisiana studied the problem in Medicaid, the public insurance program for low-income and disabled people. Only 25% of more than 2,600 providers were accepting new patients. A 2017 study focused on psychiatrists who treated children and adolescents in five US cities \u2013 they were only able to make appointments with 17% of providers listed. A 2015 study across three US cities found 22% of phone numbers for adult psychiatrists were wrong and 21% were not accepting new patients. \u201cWe\u2019re in a mental health crisis and health plans need to step up,\u201d said Sue Abderholden, the executive director of NAMI Minnesota, or the National Alliance on Mental Illness. She said the problem of ghost networks is, in part, a problem of workforce dynamics. A recent ProPublica investigation found that, for many mental health providers, being in insurance networks is just not worth it. Low pay and insurance policies, such as clawback provisions that allow insurers to dip directly into bank accounts, make remaining in-network unworkable. \u201cAs a result there are fewer practitioners who are paneled with insurance, which of course affects patient access,\u201d said London Breedlove, a licensed psychologist and director of professional affairs at the Washington State Psychological Association. \u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t necessarily know that as a consumer. If you have a commercial health plan and go to your insurance website and say, \u2018I want a provider\u2019 and put in your zip code, it looks like there are a lot of people taking patients.\u201d More than half of Americans live in a mental health provider shortage area \u2013 and the problem is expected to grow more acute by 2036. \u201cWe see in our state there\u2019s a significantly higher percentage of patients who have to go out-of-network to access vital mental health resources,\u201d said Breedlove. For those that do accept insurance, mental health providers are generally paid only $0.76 for every $1 paid to primary care providers, who cover physical health. Breedlove is advocating for a bill in Washington state that would peg insurance reimbursement rates for mental health care to inflation. With this cost-of-living adjustment, she hopes insurance will become more attractive to her colleagues. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have enough people in your network to have an adequate network then you have to pay them more to recruit them,\u201d said Abderholden. \u201cWhen that starts happening, we will see better access because we won\u2019t have people dropping out of the field. We will have people making enough to cover their student loans.\u201d"

I have just been made redundant, along with three other PAs at my practice. This is happening across the country. The NHS has invested in training and employing thousands of us for 20 years, only to now pull the rug out from under us and end our careers, losing skilled workers from a system that is under strain. And for what? The cases mentioned in your editorial (21 November) where errors were made are sad, but not unique to the PA role. I was a team leader of 12 allied health professionals and worked hard to provide excellent patient care. The system has been using us as a cheaper resource because it has been able to get away with it, and then framed it that we are the problem. The emotional and financial impact of this on PAs is huge. What\u2019s more, it will make access to primary care appointments worse. Name and address supplied \u2022 Physician associates can be a huge asset to the NHS if trained, regulated and supervised appropriately. In the last five years of my time as a GP, our team benefited hugely from having two full-time PAs, supervised by the GPs. They bring a high level of skill after intensive two-year, medical-based training, with supervised learning in healthcare settings, usually on top of biomedical science degrees or similar. Our patients value them. Due to rising demands on our services and the increasing complexity of care, we have increased the size of our team, but could not afford (or find) GPs, hence the addition of other professionals trained to diagnose and manage simple problems. We should welcome the review commissioned by Wes Streeting (Wes Streeting orders review of physician associates\u2019 role in NHS, 20 November), but be aware that some of the antagonism from the medical establishment seems protectionist rather than in the best interests of patients. Dr Charles Heatley Retired GP, Sheffield \u2022 The dispute about the role of physician associates in the NHS is rooted in dogma. Whether the person delivering treatment is a medical doctor is not the issue. What matters is that anyone delivering healthcare is trained and qualified to do so, practises within the correct guidelines and has access to support and guidance whenever a situation arises that falls outside the routine. This should apply to PAs, resident doctors and experienced consultants alike. In cardiothoracic surgery, surgical PAs (known as surgical care practitioners) have worked alongside surgeons for two decades, with substantial evidence that they have enhanced care quality and the training of resident doctors. There is no reason why such a model cannot apply in other specialties. Samer Nashef Consultant cardiac surgeon, Royal Papworth hospital, Cambridge \u2022 I am puzzled by the need for physician associates when we already have well-trained nurses in speciality roles. In the 1990s, I trained several senior nurses to become expert in gastroscopy (passing fiberoptic telescopes to examine the gullet and stomach). They would do this in a theatre adjacent to mine. I attend my local hospital twice a year to have a similar telescope passed into my bladder by a urology specialist nurse. There are others such as specialist asthma and diabetes nurses. Why duplicate professions needlessly? Dr Giles Youngs Retired consultant gastroenterologist, Drinkstone, Suffolk \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

Dr Elaine Lockhart, a consultant paediatric liaison psychiatrist who works in NHS child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), describes the frustrating but rewarding daily battle to meet the soaring demand and to help those most in need. At a time when children\u2019s mental health is supposed to be a public policy priority, waiting times for children\u2019s and adolescent mental health services are unacceptably long. Some children wait more than two years to be treated. And that delay can have stark consequences for their mental health and their life chances. Some of our most vulnerable children are ending up in crisis, needing urgent referrals and emergency care when they should have been treated effectively months before and allowed to enjoy what they will miss out on: their childhood. As a psychiatrist for children and young people, it is deeply frustrating to see children so unwell that they require an emergency response, when we know that early intervention and treatment can transform their lives and prevent their illness getting worse. Late and delayed treatment has many unwanted and distressing effects on their lives. Take a child with untreated anxiety \u2013 something that can be distressing and painful for anyone. The very activities and pleasures of childhood that should protect them, enrich their lives and offer resilience start to disappear. Friendships become harder to maintain, absence from school can lead to isolation and they can fall behind in their learning, causing even more anxiety and affecting their development. Missing out on day-to-day life reinforces their difficulties and can make them feel even more unwell. You have to wonder why, when the urge to protect our youngest in society is so instinctive and overwhelming, the resources to reduce the waiting lists and recruit more psychiatrists haven\u2019t already been provided? I\u2019m often asked what it\u2019s like to be a psychiatrist. Like most of my colleagues in the profession, I can honestly say it is a wonderful job and a privilege to work with children and young people. My job is to understand the whole child, the wider context of the family and the environment in which they live. It is incredibly interesting, engaging and highly collaborative work. Our best work involves a multi-disciplinary team of highly motivated, skilled colleagues, which I\u2019ve been lucky to have had throughout my consultant career. I learn something new every day from the children and families I work with. To see young people recover and thrive because of my input is deeply motivating and fulfilling. Imagine what we could achieve with the right resources and funds to build a mental health service fit for the children and young people of today. Prevention and early intervention would be a daily reality rather than a hoped-for future, and crisis referrals for children would be rare, rather than the frequent occurrence they are today. \u2022 Dr Elaine Lockhart is a consultant paediatric liaison psychiatrist"

            "content": "Chris Peterson wasn\u2019t surprised that Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election. But he was surprised by how quickly he and his wife started asking one another: should we try to have another baby before a possible nationwide abortion ban takes effect? Or should we give up on having a second child? Peterson and his wife, who live in North Carolina, are thousands of dollars in debt because their first child needed to spend weeks in the hospital after being born prematurely. They had wanted to pay off that debt and wait a few years before having a second baby. But now, reproductive rights are again in the balance \u2013 Trump has said he would veto a nationwide abortion ban, but his allies are emboldened to push through more restrictions. Peterson is terrified of what is to come, and that his wife might not be able to get the medical care she needs if they decide to conceive again. \u201cWe should be happy thinking about expanding our family,\u201d said Peterson, who is, like his wife, in his late 30s. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be worried that we\u2019re going to have medical complications and I might end up being a single father.\u201d Peterson is not the only American who, in the weeks after the US election, is rethinking plans around having children. On 6 November, the number of people booking vasectomy appointments at Planned Parenthood health centers spiked by 1,200%, IUD appointments by more than 760% and birth control implant appointments by 350%, according to a statement provided to the Guardian by Planned Parenthood. Traffic to Planned Parenthood\u2019s webpages on tubal ligation, vasectomies and IUDs has also surged by more than 1,000% for each. After the election, the Guardian heard from dozens of people in the US reconsidering whether to have children. Most pointed to fears over the future of reproductive healthcare, the economy and the climate in explaining their concerns. \u201cI hesitate to bring more children into a world with an uncertain ecological future, assuming that the incoming administration pulls out of the Paris climate accord and ceases to support green energy transition,\u201d a 34-year-old Minnesota mother of one wrote to the Guardian in response to a callout inviting readers to share their thoughts about post-election family planning. Trump pulled the US out of the historic agreement during his first administration; doing so again \u2013 which Trump has promised to do \u2013 could \u201ccripple\u201d the it, according to the UN secretary general. \u201cWe have two children and I have desperately wanted a third \u2013 but now I am fearful of being able to get adequate care if I get pregnant,\u201d wrote another woman who lives in Louisiana. \u201cI can\u2019t risk leaving my two children behind if [I] die because I can\u2019t get adequate care here. It feels like a dystopian novel, and yet here we are.\u201d These worries are not necessarily new. In 2023, a Pew Research Center survey found that 47% of 18- to 49-year-old US adults say they are unlikely to ever have kids \u2013 a steep jump from 2018, when 37% said the same. Of the people who are unlikely to have kids, 38% said \u201cconcerns about the state of the world\u201d were a major part of their decision-making. Roughly a quarter pointed to fears about the environment. Working in disaster relief, Catherine regularly sees the effects of the climate crisis up close. \u201cI\u2019m in Washington DC right now and flowers are blooming. It\u2019s November. This should not be happening,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cWhile I have always wanted kids, that choice has become tinged with a level of despair and anger that I didn\u2019t have two years ago.\u201d She continued: \u201cWhy would I bring a child into this world that is dying?\u201d Earlier this year, Catherine got a copper IUD, which can block pregnancy for more than a decade. Like developed countries around the world, the United States is in the midst of a fertility slump. In 2023, the US fertility rate fell by 3% and reached a historic low. But this decline is not evenly distributed across the political spectrum. After Trump won the presidency in 2016, births in Republican-leaning counties rose sharply compared to those that leaned Democratic. Today, Democrats are likelier than Republicans to be childfree \u2013 a trend that, the Washington Post has hypothesized, is likely also related to the rightward drift of big-family white Protestants. That the outcome of the 2024 election has spurred such fear and hesitation around having children is apt \u2013 not only are US political parties on diverging paths when it comes to babies, but the election itself was in many ways a referendum on families and fertility. While Kamala Harris made support for abortion rights a key plank in her platform, Donald Trump promised \u201cbaby booms\u201d and pledged to give people \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d. Trump\u2019s vice-president-elect, JD Vance, has built his political brand on pronatalism, a movement that urges people to have babies to benefit the greater good. Vance has a track record of deriding \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d and raising the alarm about the US fertility rate. \u201cWe want more babies because children are good,\u201d Vance once said. \u201cAnd we believe children are good, because we are not sociopaths.\u201d M, a Texan mother of three who asked to go by her first initial because she feels stigmatized for voting for Trump, hopes that Trump\u2019s victory will improve the economy to the point that she and her husband can afford to have a fourth child. \u201cI still have a child in childcare now \u2013 like daycare \u2013 and just seeing those costs rise year after year since 2020, it\u2019s been really hard for our family to consider having another baby,\u201d M said. \u201cThe possibility of that being alleviated through better economic policy or even just those costs being taken away somewhere else \u2013 whether it\u2019s groceries or utilities to whatever it is \u2013 that really makes it possible for us to consider having another kid.\u201d M, who opposes abortion, feels confident that she would be able to get adequate care if she had a miscarriage. (Since Roe v Wade fell, at least three women have died in Texas after doctors reportedly delayed treating them for miscarriages or gave them inadequate miscarriage care.) The climate crisis worries M less than making sure her kids have access to clean water and healthy, chemical-free food. Not everyone reconsidering having kids has totally ruled it out. N, a 26-year-old from New York, is for now only delaying her plans to have kids until after Trump leaves office. (She asked to go by her first initial because she previously had an abortion.) Ruth, who has a newborn at home and is married to an undocumented person, fears abortion bans and her husband being deported \u2013 but still wants to keep the conversation about having a second kid alive. \u201cWe want to be able to dream of having a family the way we want to, on our terms,\u201d said Ruth, who lives in Florida and asked to be identified by her middle name due to her husband\u2019s immigration status. \u201cMy husband being an immigrant \u2013 we feel that it shouldn\u2019t foreclose our options to build a family. We have just as much of a right to build a family on our terms as anyone else.\u201d"

            "content": "John Prescott, the former British deputy prime minister and stalwart of the New Labour movement, has died aged 86. Keir Starmer has condemned Kemi Badenoch for breaking what he said had been a cross-party consensus on reducing carbon emissions. (See 11.27am.) Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, has told the Covid inquiry that England\u2019s hospitals were within \u201chours\u201d of running out of some items of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the early months of the pandemic. (See 5.08pm.) Steve Reed, the environment secretary, has promised to reform the food system to ensure farmers are paid fairly for the food they produce, after many filled the streets of Westminster to campaign against inheritance tax changes. School leaders have said they lack the resources to manage a rising tide of challenging behaviour since the Covid pandemic, after figures revealed a significant rise in the number of pupils being suspended and expelled in England. Nigel Farage\u2019s group campaigning against the World Health Organization (WHO) is staffed by consultants who work with the nicotine products industry, the Guardian can reveal. Elon Musk has said UK MPs \u201cwill be summoned to the United States of America to explain their censorship and threats to American citizens\u201d in a fresh escalation of tensions between the world\u2019s richest man and Labour. This is what PA Media has filed from the Covid inquiry hearing this afternoon. England\u2019s hospitals were within \u201chours\u201d of running out of some items of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the early months of Covid, Matt Hancock has said. The former health secretary told the Covid inquiry some PPE was in very short supply during the first wave of the pandemic. He also said he believes vaccines should be mandatory for NHS and social care staff in any future pandemic, while masks should be worn in hospitals from day one. Lead counsel to the inquiry, Jacqueline Carey KC, asked Hancock: \u201cDo you accept that entering the coronavirus pandemic as we did, without a single gown, severely hampered the ability to provide safe and appropriate PPE for healthcare workers?\u201d Hancock replied: \u201cThe stockpile that we had was not as good as it needs to be in the future, absolutely.\u201d Asked if England ever ran out of PPE, he said: \u201cAs a whole? No, but individual locations did. \u201cWe came extremely close. We came within small numbers of items on a regular basis during April and May 2020 \u2013 by the second wave, we were in better shape.\u201d Asked about no more stock of gowns in April 2020, he said: \u201cGowns I think at one point we got to within six or seven hours of running out. \u201cWe were working incredibly hard to make sure that we didn\u2019t (run out). We nearly did.\u201d On the question of whether facemasks should be worn by hospital staff, visitors and workers in a future pandemic, he said: \u201cIt should be brought in immediately, and supplies need to be ready, preferably in each hospital, to make that possible.\u201d Furthermore, Hancock said, ensuring health and social care workers are fully vaccinated is a \u201creasonable step that should be expected\u201d and should be brought in to the NHS and social care at the same time. Vaccination as a condition of deployment came into effect in November 2021 and required Care Quality Commission-registered care home staff to be fully vaccinated in order to be deployed in care homes unless medically exempt from April 2022. Hancock said he regretted that decision as social care and the NHS should have had the rule at the same time, adding: \u201cIf you are employed to care for others, then you should take reasonable steps to ensure you are not harming those in your care. \u201cA clinically proven vaccine is a reasonable step that should be expected.\u201d King Charles has paid tribute to John Prescott. It is unusual for the monarch to issue a statement after the death of a politician, and this is a sign quite what an impact Prescott made during his long career. The king said: I am deeply saddened to learn of the death of Lord Prescott. I remember with great fondness his unique and indomitable character, as well as his infectious sense of humour. My thoughts and greatest sympathy are with Lord Prescott\u2019s wife, family and loved ones at such a difficult time, and I am sure that very many people will recognise and greatly appreciate Lord Prescott\u2019s decades of public service in front line politics, not least as the United Kingdom\u2019s longest serving deputy prime minister. Here is our obituary of John Prescott by Stephen Bates. The ongoing row about the prospect of SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn \u201cdouble jobbing\u201d risks becoming a distraction for the party, first minister John Swinney has warned. Flynn has faced a furious backlash amongst MSPs after he announced that he was planning to stand for the Holyrood seat of Aberdeen South and North Kincardine, currently held by his SNP colleague Audrey Nicoll, in the 2026 Holyrood elections. Flynn also confirmed he would aim to hold his Westminster seat until the next general election, due in 2029, but would not accept two salaries. The SNP has previously been highly critical of previous Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross for holding seats in both parliaments, and Flynn\u2019s colleagues are privately angry at the implication that a Holyrood position does not amount to a full-time job, as well as what many see as the high-handed way he\u2019s attempting to oust a respected female colleague. Asked about the escalating conflict after FMQs, Swinney said that Flynn was a \u201cgreat star\u201d but added: What I want to make sure is that the SNP is in no way distracted by internal issues. It\u2019s been a mantra of mine that I want us to look outwards not inwards. At the last Scottish parliament election, the SNP\u2019s national executive committee made a ruling that any MP standing for Holyrood would have to resign their Westminster seat. The NEC has until next spring to decide its candidates\u2019 rules, so this row could go on and on. Neal Lawson, a prominent Labour activist, has been told that he won\u2019t be expelled from the party over a tweet that backed tactical voting. Lawson is director of Compass, a leftwing group that campaigns for more pluralism in progressive politics. He has been cleared by Labour after a 17-month investigation into something he retweeted in May 2021, from the Lib Dem MP Layla Moran urging people to vote Green in a council ward where the Lib Dems weren\u2019t standing. Moran said pointed out that she had only won her parliamentary seat in 2017 as a result of the Greens standing aside. In a comment Lawson described this as \u201cproper grown up progressive politics\u201d from both Moran and the Greens. But Labour launched an investigation on the basis that he may have broken rules saying members should not support rival parties. The decision to launch disciplinary action against Lawson was seen by many in the party as an example of excessive control freakery. Even Keir Starmer was said to be surprised by the move. Under Starmer many leftwing Corbynites have been ruthlessly thrown out of the party, or blocked from standing as candidates, but Lawson is not part of that faction. At the time Lawson wrote an article for the Guardian saying he hoped \u201cLabour\u2019s persecutors and witchfinders\u201d would fail and that \u201cpluralism, that ugly but powerful word, is the force that will shape anything that is progressive\u201d. Today, in a news release, Compass said Lawson has been told he did not break party rules. The organisation said: Compass has long argued for tactical voting, closer cooperation between progressive parties and for a voting system that better reflects the latent progressive majority in this country. At the last election, Labour showed it also recognised the importance of tactical campaigning by ruthlessly targeting its resources in seats it could win and actively discouraging campaigning elsewhere. Thus they were inviting voters to do exactly what Mr Lawson was advocating - supporting the best placed progressive to win. A Compass spokesperson said: We welcome this decision and hope Labour can begin to recognise what Compass has been arguing for years: that no single faction or party can navigate the chaos of the 21st century alone. Labour must be an open tribe if it has any chance of tackling the turbulent challenges of the 21st century - if it fails, the far right is waiting in the wings. Supporters of assisted dying should give up trying to get Kim Leadbeater\u2019s private member\u2019s bill through the Commons, and instead get the government to commission a proper review into how legislation should work, Ed Balls, the former Labour cabinet minister has suggested. Speaking on his Political Currency podcast, Balls said legislation this significant should be introduced by the government, following proper consultation. MPs are due to vote on the bill at second reading a week tomorrow. Increasingly it looks as if the Commons will vote against. Even if it passes, experts say it will never become law unless ministers allocate extra time for it \u2013 which so far they have declined to promise. Explaining his stance, Balls said: I would vote against this bill if I was in parliament now at the second reading, but not because I\u2019m opposed to action on assisted dying at all. But I don\u2019t think parliament can cross the massive threshold of conceding the principle that it is acceptable for doctors and the courts to cooperate in the taking of somebody\u2019s life \u2013 unless you are absolutely sure you know how it will work in practice, legally, and in terms of resources and in terms of the difficult cases. And I just don\u2019t feel that that\u2019s where we are. There isn\u2019t yet enough solidity, and the government has to kind of engage in this more. What should happen is after the opening speeches, there should be a statement in the house or publicly or from Downing Street to say \u2018We think Kim Leadbeater has done a brilliant job of raising this issue, we don\u2019t think yet we\u2019ve got to a place where we can see a way forward. What the government is now going to do is start some kind of review process.\u2019 Could be a Royal Commission, could be judge-led, it could be a small panel expert-led to report with a fixed date, next year. At that point, Kim Leadbeater says, \u2018Look, you know, I\u2019ve got as far as I can with this bill.\u2019 She withdraws, the bill drops, the private members bill. We have that process, and then we come back, if it can be made to work with government legislation next year. That is the best way, and I think it may be the only way. George Osborne, who co-hosts the podcast with Balls, said that he was now in favour of assisted dying, having been opposed in the past, but that he also did not think Leadbeater bill would become law. The government has indicated that its proposed new law \u201cto bring the feudal leasehold system to an end\u201d will take longer than expected. The last government proposed leasehold reform, but it was accused of watering down its original plans and, by the time the election was called, its leasehold and freehold reform bill had not cleared parliament. A very basic version was rushed through parliament just before the dissolution. In the king\u2019s speech the government promised to publish a new, more extensive draft leasehold and commonhold reform bill that would implement Law Commission reform proposals that had been dropped by the Tories. The government said it wanted \u201cto bring the feudal leasehold system to an end, reinvigorating commonhold through a comprehensive new legal framework and banning the sale of new leasehold flats so commonhold becomes the default tenure.\u201d But today, in a written ministerial statement, Matthew Pennycook, the housing minister said the draft bill is not expected to be published until the second half of 2025. He said the process was more complicated than expected because he had been told that the Tory act, which was pushed through parliament by Michael Gove, contained \u201ca small number of specific but serious flaws\u201d that would have to be fixed by primary legislation. Pennycook went on: These serious flaws include a loophole which mean the act goes far beyond the intended reforms to valuation and that undermines the integrity of the amended scheme. In addition we must correct an omission that would deny tens of thousands of shared ownership leaseholders the right to extend their lease with their direct landlord given that the providers in question do not have sufficiently long leases to grant 990-year extensions. This government will not make the same mistakes as the last when it comes to reforming what is, without question, an incredibly complicated area of property law. While we intend to continue to work at pace, we will take the time necessary to ensure the reforms we pass are fit for purpose. Pennycook also said a white paper on commonhold reform would be published early next year. In Birmingham, MP Jess Phillips and former West Midlands mayor Andy Street are among those who have gathered to pay tribute to the victims of the 1974 pub bombings in the city, on the 50th anniversary of the atrocity in which 21 were killed and 220 injured. Survivors and families of the victims have today renewed their calls for a public inquiry into why no one has been brought to justice for the attacks, with Street saying he \u201cdeeply regrets that the previous government didn\u2019t get to award it\u201d. He told the BBC: Twenty-one people lost their lives and we still to this day do not know exactly what happened and who the perpetrators were. One of the principles of British justice is that you should get to a closure. You might now not be able to hold those accountable for it but I do still feel that that needs to be done. Following a one-minute silence at the memorial service outside New Street station, Phillips read out the names of the deceased and the Duchess of Edinburgh read out a message on behalf of King Charles. The king\u2019s message said: My wife and I would like to take this opportunity to say that you and all those affected by this dreadful attack remain very much in our thoughts. What happened on this day 50 years ago was one of so many dreadful tragedies in a devastating period that touched us all, many of us very personally. I must also express my sincere admiration for the people of Birmingham who have lived so courageously with the grief of that day and the days that followed. Asked about racial disparities in Covid deaths, Hancock told the inquiry that this was an issue he was alert to because he had already taken an interest in institutional racism in the NHS. But he also said some the \u201chard left stuff\u201d put out by NHS bodies to address this were not the right way forward. During evidence this morning Hancock was challenged when he claimed that the NHS was not overwhelmed during the pandemic. Jacqueline Carey KC , counsel for the inquiry, put it to Hancock: The fact that the nurses are being stretched to the ratios that we\u2019ve looked at and the potential adverse consequences for those who are in ICU does not in fact demonstrate the NHS was, in fact, overwhelmed. And Hancock replied: No, because people could get treatment. The treatment was not as good as in the same way that the waiting times for a knee operation was not as good as pre-pandemic. I\u2019m not saying that the NHS was perfect in the pandemic, and I\u2019m not saying that it wasn\u2019t severely pressured in many areas and that that pressure had consequences. The point of saying that it would be overwhelmed is that the system as a whole, withstood the pressure. As Martin Bagot reports in a story for the Mirror, Carey pushed back at this point, saying that if people were not getting the treatment they would normally get, they would think the system was overwhelmed. Bagot says the exchanges got testy, and that some relatives of people who died who were attending the hearing seemed to get distressed by what they were hearing. Hancock tells the inquiry that some hospitals refused to test their staff for Covid because they did not want to lose too many people off sick. He says that is an example of a \u201ccultural problem in the NHS\u201d in that not enough is done to tackle \u201cnosocomial infection\u201d (infection picked up during a medical procedure). Back at the Covid inquiry, Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, is being asked about PPE. He has just said that at one point the country was \u201cwithin six or seven hours\u201d of running out of gowns. Hancock was being asked about this chart, showing how long stocks of various types of PPE were expected to last before they ran out. Earlier in his evidence this afternoon Hancock said that, although individual hospitals may have run out of PPE, the country as a whole never ran out. Jacqueline Carey KC, counsel for the inquiry, put it to him that that was not any consolation to health staff who went without PPE. The flag at the Guildhall in Hull is flying at half-mast to mark the death of John Prescott, who was an MP for the city for 40 years. The city council has posted this on social media. Tributes from the council are here. And there is a good round-up of tributes to Prescott on the LabourList website too. David Lammy\u2019s announcement of sanctions against kleptocrats (see 1.19pm) came as crown dependencies and overseas territories (OTs) wrapped up a joint ministerial council in London at which resistance to the decade-old UK demand to set up public registers of beneficial ownership was once again raised. Public registers, by ending the secrecy surrounding the transfer of assets to tax havens, make it easier for campaigners to expose money laundering, as well as deter it taking place in the first place. The last missed deadline was for the end of 2023. The key OTs have found a series of reasons not to implement the measure including citing a 2022 European Court of Justice ruling saying the registers breach European privacy laws. None of the OTs are inside the EU but they argue they cannot afford to have stricter declaration laws than other countries or else funds will leave their jurisdiction.. As prime minister ahead of the G8 in Northern Ireland in 2016 David Cameron first set out the UK goal of setting up registers, but a succession of deadlines have been allowed to be missed with no action taken by the government to impose registers. The lack of the registers, as well as the presence in London of money laundering enablers, is the Achilles heel of the UK\u2019s efforts to become an international leader in the fight against corruption. Stephen Doughty the Foreign Office minister, has written to the OTs setting out his expectation that the registers will be set up, and has visited some of the territories to seek their cooperation. A spokesperson for the Cayman Islands government said it was continuing to work towards an \u201cenhanced beneficial ownership framework\u201d by the end of 2024,. A cross-party coalition of 40 MPs in a letter earlier this week called for ugent action against the overseas territories. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, claimed he was bringing the golden age of money laundering to an end when he announced sanctions against three high-profile kleptocrats and their key enablers. Lammy said the tide was being turned on corruption after a long period when the previous government allowed the role of London as a money laundering capital to continue. When Labour was in opposition Lammy stressed how much damage Britain\u2019s role in laundering corrupt money was causing the country\u2019s reputation in the global south, as well as the damage done to the international financial system,. The three main designations announced today cover: Dmitry Firtash who is known to have extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from Ukraine, hiding millions in the UK property market; Isabel Dos Santos, the daughter of Angola\u2019s former president who is accused abused her positions at state-run companies to embezzle at least \u00a3350m; and Aivars Lembergs, one of Latvia\u2019s richest people, who abused his political position to commit bribery and launder money. Firtash has already been sanctioned in other jurisdictions. The UK also sanctioned his wife, Lada Firtash, who has profited from his corruption and holds UK assets on his behalf, including the site of the old Brompton Road tube station, as well as Denis Gorbunenko, a UK-based financial \u2018fixer\u2019 who enabled and facilitated Firtash\u2019s corruption. Dos Santos was once dubbed \u2018Africa\u2019s richest woman\u2019. She has been subject to an Interpol Red Notice since November 2022 and just last month lost a case at the court of appeal regarding her worldwide asset freeze. The UK also said it was sanctioning her business partner Paula Oliveira, and her chief financial officer Sarju Raikundalia. The Foreign Office said both had helped Dos Santos funnel Angola\u2019s national wealth for her own benefit. It is not known how many assets they still have in the UK. Lammy said: These unscrupulous individuals selfishly deprive their fellow citizens of much-needed funding for education, healthcare and infrastructure - for their own enrichment. I committed to taking on kleptocrats and the dirty money that empowers them when I became Foreign Secretary and these sanctions mark the first step in delivering this ambition. The tide is turning. The golden age of money laundering is over. At FMQs today the Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay attacked John Swinney over today\u2019s Audit Scotland report which was damning in its criticism of the Scottish government\u2019s lack of long-term strategy over public finances. The report also criticised the SNP\u2019s short-term fixes, lack of transparency and warned that fundamental changes were needed to keep public services affordable. Swinney insisted that financial constraints on his budget were the result of UK Tory austerity, trotting out his favourite jibe about Findlay\u2019s future previous support for Liz Truss, and said next month\u2019s budget would involve \u201can honest conversation with the people of Scotland\u201d. Meanwhile the Scottish Greens\u2019 co-leader Lorna Slater pressed Swinney on whether the budget would introduce a public health levy on alcohol and tobacco, as health campaigners lobby his government to introduce one. Swinney said he couldn\u2019t pre-empt budget decisions, arguing the finance secretary was facing pressure from all sides with a budget under severe constraints thanks to inflation and hefty public sector pay deals. Downing Street has described unconfirmed reports that Russia may have fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into Ukraine as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. Asked about this at the morning lobby briefing, the PM\u2019s spokesperson said: As you will understand it is a rapidly developing situation and I don\u2019t want to get ahead of our intelligence services who are looking at these reports urgently, but if true, clearly this would be another example of grave, reckless and escalatory behaviour from Russia and only serves to strengthen our resolve. Martin Belam had more coverage of this story on today\u2019s Ukraine war live blog Keir Starmer has defended the government\u2019s decision to register 470 delegates to attend the Cop29 climate conference in Baku in Azerbaijan. During his Commons statement he was asked about the large number of people attending by the independent MP Shockat Adam who asked if the cost was justified, particularly given the cut to winter fuel payments. Starmer said the British contingent was small than it was at last year\u2019s Cop, and that there was \u201ca lot of negotiation\u201d to be carried out there. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely vital that we\u2019re doing that important work,\u201d he said. John Healey, the defence secretary, has been giving evidence to the Commons defence committee this morning. But he wouldn\u2019t confirm that Ukraine has started firing Storm Shadow missiles provided by Britain at Russia. Asked to confirm these reports, Healey said: I won\u2019t be drawn on the operational details of the conflict. It risks both operational security and in the end the only one that benefits from such a public debate is President Putin. Healey also said this was a \u201cserious moment\u201d for Ukraine and he said battle lines were now \u201cless stable than at any time since the early days of the full scale Russian invasion\u201d. UPDATE: Healey said: This is a serious moment that I come before the committee. Defence intelligence will reveal today that the front line is now less stable than at any time since the early days of the full scale Russian invasion in 2022. We have seen in recent weeks a very clear escalation from Putin and his forces. They have stepped up attacks on the energy system in Ukraine ahead of winter, they have stepped up attacks on civilian centres killing children, they have deployed at least 10,000 North Korean troops to the battle front line. And there are unconfirmed but media reports today of Russia firing a new ballistic missile into Ukraine which we know they have been preparing for months. While the Ukrainian actions on the battlefield speak for themselves, be in no doubt that UK government is stepping up our support for Ukraine, determined to continue doubling down our support for Ukraine. The Guardian columnist Martin Kettle has sent me this anecdote, which he describes as his favourite memory of the late John Prescott. Martin says: I was at a Labour conference in Blackpool in the 90s and I bumped into him back stage in the press room and he said: \u201cIs your fella Steve Bell here?\u201d I said, yes, Steve was. \u201cWell can you introduce me? He always draws me as Tony\u2019s dog, and I\u2019m not a fuckin\u2019 dog.\u201d Steve was sitting quite nearby, so I nervously made the introductions as the two big guys met up. Within a few seconds, Prescott\u2019s threatening manner vanished and he and Steve were in stitches about some joke or other. Then, as Prescott was leaving he turned and squared up to Steve and said. \u201cNo dogs, OK?\u201d Of course it made absolutely no difference whatever, and Steve kept on drawing him as a dog. Matt Hancock has told how he \u201cruffled some feathers\u201d protecting the NHS from political \u201cinterference\u201d during the Covid pandemic, PA Media reports. Giving evidence to the Covid inquiry, the former health secretary said part of his role was to \u201cshield\u201d the NHS from \u201cpeople being difficult in Number 10\u201d. He said: Within the running of the NHS, we were protected in a way because of the independence of the NHS. And therefore the people being difficult for Number 10, part of my job was to provide a shield from that. And I know that I ruffled some feathers in doing so, but my job was, ironically, also to protect the NHS from some of that. Hancock told the inquiry that interference from Number 10 caused \u201cincredible difficulties\u201d with regards to testing people for Covid. Hancock is giving evidence as part of the inquiry\u2019s third module investigation, focusing on the impact of the pandemic on the NHS. As PA reports, Hancock was asked by inquiry counsel Jacqueline Carey about his witness statements which suggested \u201cinappropriate political interference from Number 10\u201d, and whether that interference applied to the scope of these hearings. He replied: Well, of course some of it did. For instance, the biggest interference that caused difficulties was within testing, where some of the political appointees in Number 10 caused incredible difficulties. Hancock was almost certainly referring to Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser at the times. Earlier hearings have proviced copious evidence showing that relations between Hancock and Cummings were dire. Earlier today Hancock also claimed that former first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, caused \u201call sorts of difficulties\u201d as the pandemic unfolded. (See 10.26am.) Keir Starmer said that he condemned the jailing of 45 pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong by the Chinese authorities during his statement in the Commons. He was challenged to use the word condemn after Conservative MPs suggested that he was reluctant to sound too critical of China on this issue. In her response to Starmer\u2019s opening statement, Kemi Badenoch said that the activists were sentenced the day after Starmer held talks with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, at the G20 summit. She said she had not heard him condemn the sentences at the time, and she challenged him so do so \u201cunequivocally\u201d. In response, Starmer said \u201cMinister West\u201d (Catherine West, the minister for the Indo-Pacific\u201d made a statement on this and he said he was happy \u201cto repeat and affirm her position\u201d. Later Iain Duncan-Smith, one of the most China-criticial Tories and a former party leader, asked Starmer to be more explicit. Starmer replied: I said I condemned it a moment ago, and I\u2019m happy to say so. I just did and I will say it again. It is important that where we have these significant differences, particularly on issues of human rights, that we have frank, open discussions about them and that is why these matters have been raised repeatedly. Here are two more tribute to John Prescott. From the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock John Prescott was an intriguing mixture of ferocity and charm who attracted affection, respect and, sometimes, outrage. He was truly a political innovator in policies ranging from integrated transport to combating climate change and regional democratic and economic development to European co-operation. Vitally, he was also a very practical MP and minister who continually sought the best way to \u2018get things done\u2019 whether that meant bringing divergent people together or insisting on details of implementation. This central invaluable quality made him an essential figure in 10 years as deputy prime minister. From John Major, the former Conservative prime minister [Prescott] was an essential part of Labour\u2019s electoral success in the 1990s and \u2013 as deputy prime minister \u2013 continued to say what he thought in unmistakable terms. He never lost sight of the causes that first motivated him into politics, and remained a passionate advocate for all he believed \u2013 even if that meant the odd tussle with colleagues along the way. Although a political opponent, I much admired him as a man who never betrayed his core instincts. He was, in essence, a deep down genuine politician. The public saw that \u2013 and respected him for it. In his response to Kemi Badenoch in the Commons (see 11.27am), Keir Starmer also criticised her suggestion that he should not have attended the G20 in Brazil. Badenoch did not quite say he should have stayed at home, but she said being at the G20 was probably \u201ca lot easier\u201d than being in London when '\u201chard-working farmers were protesting outside the Downing Street gates at his cruel family farm tax\u201d. Referring to her comments, Starmer said: [Badenoch] references me being in Rio when the farmers were protested. G20 is the leading economies of the world, getting together to discuss questions of common issues on the economy and on security. If her implication is that the UK should not be there at leader level, that we should join Putin in avoiding that meeting, if that\u2019s the position of her party, then she should say so. Keir Starmer\u2019s statement to MPs about the G20 and Cop29 summits largely summarised announcments made while he was at those events. Kemi Badenoch, the new Conservative leader, responded. Normally exchanges like this are relatively tame, because the main parties often broadly agree on foreign policy issues, but Badenoch was very critical of Starmer\u2019s foreign policy positions, particularly on climate, and Starmer condemned her for breaking what had been a cross-party consensus on reducing emissions. Referring to Cop29, Badenoch said: Cop has not yet concluded, so we do not know what the final impact on the UK will be. But we do know the prime minister\u2019s rush to a further cut in our emissions [a reference to this announcement] is yet another example of politicians putting short term publicity above long term planning. When will he publish the plans to achieve this new target? Where this government does the right thing, we will back it. Yet, where it puts politics before people and press releases before practicality, we will hold them to account. It is time for politicians to tell the truth, and it is time the prime minister provided some substance to back this costly rhetoric. Badenoch pointed out that, by attending the G20 summit in Brazil, Starmer was out of London for the farmers\u2019 protests. And she ended: The prime minister\u2019s foreign policy is a pick and mix of empty platitudes, unilateral commitments that he could have announced at home, and dangerous precedents \u2013 rushing to give away the Chagos islands and paying for the privilege, an ill-judged suspension of export licences to Israel, damaging our defence and security industry and failing to set out a roadmap for spending 2.5% GDP on defence in a world that is becoming yet more dangerous. I hope the prime minister is up to the very real and serious challenges posed to our security and prosperity. In response, Starmer said that Badenoch\u2019s decision to abandon the cross-party consensus on reducing carbon emissions and the drive to net zero \u201cshows just how far the party opposite has fallen\u201d. He said: On Cop \u2026 I have to say, it is a shame that what used to be a cross-party issue not so many years ago \u2026 when Cop was in Scotland, there was a real unity across the house about the importance of tackling one of those central issues of our time. I think the fact that she has now taken the position she has of attacking the very idea of setting targets shows just how far the party opposite has fallen. On an issue like this, I was proud that under some of her predecessors we had that unity. It\u2019s a shame it\u2019s now been lost because of the position adopted by the opposition. Badenoch describes herself as a \u201cnet zero sceptic\u201d and in a recent interview she suggested that an adaption strategy might be a better solution to the climate crisis than just focusing on cutting carbon emissions. The former health secretary is answering questions on the NHS response to the pandemic Keir Starmer is in the Commons where he has made a statement to MPs on the two summits he has attended recently, the G20 and Cop29. But he started with a tribute to John Prescott, calling him \u201ca true giant of the Labour movement\u201d. He went on: John achieved that rare thing \u2013 he changed people\u2019s lives, and he set the path for us all to follow \u2026 He did it all in his own way, with humour, with pride, passion and total conviction. He truly was a one off. Starmer also said that there would be full tributes to Prescott in the Commons on another occasion. Steve Reed, the environment secretary, has announced a plan which he said would make farming more profitable. In his first speech since the thousands of farmers held a mass rally in Westminster on Tuesday to protest about the government\u2019s plans to extend inheritance tax to farms, he announced a new, farmer-led 25-year roadmap for the sector. He also said that, instead of reversing the inheritance tax changes in the budget, he would make changes to the supply chain to ensure farmers get a fair price for their produce. Recent research has shown that farmers get about 1p from the price of a block of cheese or a loaf of bread in the supermarket, and farmers make about a 0.5% return on their investments. Speaking at the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) conference, Reed said: I\u2019m not prepared to let so many farmers keep working so hard for so little. We need to work together to agree what we want British farming to look like in 25 years time. That means a plan to transition farming to new models that are more environmentally but also more financially sustainable for the long term. We will do this by developing a 25-year farming roadmap. This will be the most forward looking plan for farming in our country\u2019s history, with a focus on making farming and food production more profitable in the decades to come. It will not tell farmers what to do. It will be farmer led so they can tell the government what they need to make the success of this vital transition. Referring to the inheritance tax row, Reed went on: One of the things farmers were telling me last Tuesday is how little profit they make. How little money for all the hard work they put into producing the food for the rest of us to enjoy. The answer to that isn\u2019t to tell farmers they\u2019re not in it for the money, as I\u2019ve heard just last week. The answer is to make farming more profitable. The government will do precisely that. We will make the supply chain fairer so food producers and growers are not forced to accept unfair contracts. Reed concluded: I heard the anguish of the countryside on the streets of London earlier this week. We may not agree over the inheritance tax changes, but this government is determined to listen to rural Britain and end its long decline. The CLA conference is the where Reed told farmers last year, when he as shadow environment secretary, that Labour was not going to extend inheritance tax to farms. Victoria Vyvyan, president of the CLA, has accused the government of \u201ctaxing us out of existence\u201d and \u201cembroiling\u201d rural people in a \u201cstupid row about numbers\u201d. Today, addressing Reed before he gave his speech, she said: Secretary of state, you need to act. Last year, I asked you, were you to be elected, could we in this room count on you to go into bat for us at cabinet? And you said yes, and that\u2019s what I want to see from you. This isn\u2019t about party politics. It\u2019s not about personal party alignment. This is about the fact that you are the one who\u2019s sitting there at the cabinet, representing us, and you have to forget any differences that we might have, and you have to remember that you are our voice at the heart of government. Jacqueline Carey KC, lead counsel for the inquiry, asks about a minute of a meeting he had with health ministers from the devolved governments. She shows an extract on screen. The minutes refer to Jeane Freeman (JF), health minister in the Scottish government, asking for a reset in the relationship between the English and Scottish administrations. Carey asks if that related to anything related to the theme of module 3 \u2013 the impact of Covid on the NHS. Hancock says that was a reference to Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, \u201ccausing all sorts of difficulties\u201d. He says that is not relevant to this module. Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, has now started his evidence to the Covid inquiry. Asked if he thought the \u201cStay at home, protect the NHS, save lives\u201d messaging struck the right balance, Hancock says he thinks it did. Q: Do you think everything possible was done to keep healthcare workers safe? Hancock says: It was obviously extremely difficult to keep healthcare workers as safe as possible, because effectively the wards of the NHS became the front line in this deadly battle. Q: Do you think visiting restrictions, and restrictions on people being with loved ones when they were dying, were too strict? Hancock says: We were balancing incredibly difficult considerations on both sides. I think, on balance, we got those broadly right across the pandemic. But I entirely understand and feel very, very strong arguments on both sides. But Hancock says he thinks the guidance for funerals was applied in a stricter way than had been intended. Q: Do you accept that going into the pandemic with a low number of intensive care beds and high bed occupancy put the system under more strain? Of course, says Hancock. Q: Do you think now that the decision to suspend all non urgent elective care was the right one? Yes, says Hancock. We are inviting readers to share their memories of John Prescott. You can do so via this page. We will carry on reporting tributes to John Prescott as the day goes on, but there is other news happening today too and soon I will switch to the Covid inquiry, where Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, is giving evidence from 10am. He has already given evidence to the inquiry before, but the inquiry is now on module 3, focusing in particular on the impact of the pandemic on the NHS, and Hancock will be talking about that. We have also got John Healey, the defence secretary, giving evidence to the Commons defence committee from 10.30am this morning. Peter Mandelson was one of many people in the Labour party who feuded with John Prescott at various times when they were in government, and at one memorable photocall in the summer of 1997 Prescott compared him to a crab. Today, speaking on Sky News, Mandelson played down the extend of their disagreements, and pointed out that Prescott had supported his application to become Labour\u2019s communications director in 1985 \u2013 the job that turned out to be the launchpad for Mandelson\u2019s career. Mandelson said it was wrong to say Prescott was not New Labour. Some people say sometimes that he wasn\u2019t New Labour. But that\u2019s not true. He was New Labour. He was one very essential part of New Labour. He basically kept us anchored in our working class roots, our trade union history. And he was the bridge, essentially, between that and the modernisers in the Labour party, Tony, Gordon, me and the others. And he always wanted that project to work. It\u2019s not as if he was standing outside it and peering in. He was on the inside and making it work. He was, in many respects, the cement that kept New Labour together. Asked what he was like to work with, Mandelson replied: He was absolutely impossible. When I say he was sort of courageous, he was. When I say he was loyal, he was. When I say he was determined, he was. He was always determined to get his own way on any particular issue at any given moment. Right up until the point he\u2019d say, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll do this for you. You do this for me. As long as you cover this off I\u2019ll happily go along with it.\u2019 So he was a negotiator. He was a trade union negotiator. He was a broker. But at the end of the day he wanted it to work and the way in which he made it work was by being incredibly difficult for days on end and then finally sealing it, making work, agreeing it and off we went. Mandelson also recalled a surprise conversation earlier this year he had with Prescott. I was at home on a Sunday morning and the phone went and then suddenly I put it on and it was the face of John Prescott on my phone FaceTiming me from Hull. I mean, no advanced warning. No how do you do. It was, \u2018Hello, is that you?\u2019 \u2018Yes John it is me. What do you want?\u2019 He said \u2018I just want to say that I know it was difficult and we were bloody awful to you at times and I was, but actually you did good and I want to forgive you.\u2019 What am I being forgiven for here? It was just, \u2018I want to forgive you because you did good. And I know it wasn\u2019t easy at times and I know it was rough and I know I didn\u2019t help but now I understand.\u2019 And I said, \u2018John that\u2019s very kind of you. How do you suddenly understand this?\u2019 He said, \u2018Oh well somebody gave me this book of yours. I didn\u2019t read it before. It looked very boring. But I\u2019ve looked at it, I\u2019ve dipped into it and I\u2019ve seen what you went through \u2026 I feel rather sorry for you actually. And anyway, thanks very much.\u2019 It was a few minutes more \u2026 but that was it. That was the last time I spoke to him. Here are more tributes to John Prescott from Labour figures on social media. From Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s communications director in No 10 JP RIP \u2026 there was nobody else like him. Tony could not have had a better deputy. Labour could not have had a better campaigner. The government could not have had a better negotiator and - yes, often, peacemaker. Hull could not have had a better MP. Of course he was combative but he had an enormous heart and a great capacity for friendship. Even with his horrible illness in later years, the old JP was always there. Love to Pauline, Jonathan and David and nothing but fond memories of a total one off who will be missed by so many. From Yvette Cooper, the home secretary Such sad news about John Prescott. A campaigning Labour hero &amp; a remarkable minister who transformed lives - upgrading millions of council homes, coalfield regeneration, tackling climate change. Fierce &amp; warm hearted - there was no one like him. Thinking of Pauline &amp; family today From Ed Balls, the former adviser to Gordon Brown and later secretary of state for children From Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader I am really sad to hear that John Prescott has passed away. John was a huge figure and personality, from his seafaring union days to the highest offices in Government. I will be forever grateful for his personal and political support in the 2017 and 2019 elections. His endless warmth and iconic wit were loved on the campaign trail. My deepest sympathies to John\u2019s family at their loss. He will be greatly missed. From Hilary Benn, the Northern Ireland secretary 1/2 John Prescott was a political giant who made a unique contribution to the Labour and trade union movement he loved so deeply. Authentic, funny, tough, highly skilled and, at times, unpredictable, he often used the phrase \u201ctraditional Labour values in a modern setting\u201d. 2/2 In doing so, he would reassure and inspire Party members with whom he had a great bond. He will be much missed. All our thoughts are with Pauline and his family on this very sad day. From David Lammy, foreign secretary John Prescott was one of the giants of our party. Committed, loyal, Labour to his core. A relentless champion of working people who never forgot who he came into politics to fight for. Full of good humour and blunt common sense. Rest in peace Angela Rayner is often compared to John Prescott. They were both brought up working class, became Labour MPs after working in the trade union movement and have been frequently patronised or demonised by Tories and the media, partly on the grounds of class snobbery. And both ended up deputy PM. Here is her tribute to Prescott. Through his half a century of public service and a decade as deputy prime minister, John Prescott was driven by his Labour values to serve working people. Fiercely proud of his working class and trade union roots, he never lost sight of who he came into politics to serve. He used the chance he was given to change the lives of millions of working people. A giant of the labour movement and loyal friend, he will be remembered with huge fondness by all those who knew him. John was not only a Labour legend but an inspiration to me, and always so generous with his time and support. We will miss him greatly. Our thoughts and prayers are with Pauline, David, Johnathan and the rest of the family. Here is the full statement from John Prescott\u2019s family announcing his death. Prescott was living with Alzheimer\u2019s in his final years and his family have asked wellwishers minded to send flowers to donate to Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK instead. They say: We are deeply saddened to inform you that our beloved husband, father and grandfather, John Prescott, passed away peacefully yesterday at the age of 86. He did so surrounded by the love of his family and the jazz music of Marian Montgomery. John spent his life trying to improve the lives of others, fighting for social justice and protecting the environment, doing so from his time as a waiter on the cruise liners to becoming Britain\u2019s longest serving deputy prime minister. John dearly loved his home of Hull and representing its people in parliament for 40 years was his greatest honour. We would like to thank the amazing NHS doctors and nurses who cared for him after his stroke in 2019 and the dedicated staff at the care home where he passed away after latterly living with Alzheimer\u2019s. In lieu of flowers and if you wish to do so, you can donate to Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK. As you can imagine, our family needs to process our grief so we respectfully request time and space to mourn in private. Thank you. Here is a John Prescott picture gallery. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Caroline Davies. The former prime minister Gordon Brown has just been on the Today programme paying tribute to John Prescott. He said: John was a friend of mine, he was a colleague, but when you think of him, he was a colossus, he was a titan of the Labour movement. John Lennon talked about working class hero. It\u2019s difficult to fit that term, but I think John would like that. You\u2019ve got to look at his achievements. He was probably the first government minister to see the importance of the environment. Kyoto, that environmental treaty in 1997, you\u2019ve got to attribute that to John\u2019s hard work with Al Gore. Then he saw the importance, and he was a pioneer of regional policy. So the fact we have devolution and mayors owes a great deal to what John was thinking right throughout the 1980s and 90s when I was working with him. And then we mustn\u2019t forget that one of the great achievements of John as environment secretary was the repair and improvement of housing, 1.5m houses which would not have been repaired without John\u2019s determination that the social housing stock had to be remodernised. So you\u2019ve got to look at the practical achievements of someone who possibly surprised himself by the way that he managed to become deputy prime minister, but actually made a huge difference. Yorkshire has \u201clost one of its great political heavyweights,\u201d said Tracy Brabin, mayor for West Yorkshire. In a post on X she said: Deeply sad news to hear of John Prescott\u2019s passing. Yorkshire has lost one of its great political heavyweights. A true Northerner with unwavering authenticity. John\u2019s record speaks for itself: tackling regional inequalities, fighting for social justice and protecting the environment. We must all now build on his legacy and work tirelessly, as he did, to create a country that works for all. Lord Prescott\u2019s wife and two sons said he had been in a care home recently living with Alzheimer\u2019s. Hilary Evans-Newton, chief executive at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said: It\u2019s heartbreaking to hear that former deputy prime minister, Lord John Prescott, one of the most prominent political figures of our generation, has died with Alzheimer\u2019s. Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones during this difficult time. It\u2019s tragic how many lives are being lost to dementia, the leading cause of death in the UK. We\u2019re incredibly moved by Lord Prescott\u2019s family, who have asked for donations to Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, in lieu of flowers. As the UK\u2019s leading dementia research charity, we\u2019re accelerating progress towards a cure, so no one\u2019s life has to end this way. London mayor Sadiq Khan said Lord Prescott was a \u201ctrue giant\u201d of the Labour movement. Khan wrote on X: Sad to hear the news about John Prescott. A lovely man, proud trade unionist, brilliant campaigner and someone who committed his whole life to helping others. The last Labour Government simply couldn\u2019t have achieved all it did without him. A true giant of the Labour movement. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: I am deeply saddened by the news of John Prescott passing away and my thoughts and prayers are with his friends and family. John Prescott will be remembered as a towering figure in British politics and his unwavering tenacity on the causes he championed should be a lesson to us all. His influence on our modern society will still be felt for years to come and his legacy remembered far into the future. Recalling the moment John Prescott punched a protester who threw an egg at him in 2001, Tony Blair told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that he answered \u201cwell, John is John\u201d at a subsequent press conference. Someone smashed an egg on his head, and he turned up, and he turned around, and he punched the guy and laid him out. This caused a huge sort of fracas, obviously... We had to give a press conference in the election campaign the next day, and some people were saying, well, look, he\u2019s deputy prime minister - you know, you can\u2019t have a deputy prime minister thumping a voter. And then there were other people who said, yeah, but you know... he had this egg slammed in his head, and he turned around and whacked the guy, and a lot of people think, well, fair enough. A long debate ensued, Blair said, adding: \u201cFinally, at the press conference, when I was asked about that, I just said, well, John, is John. And so was that supposed to be an answer? I said, Yeah, that\u2019s an answer, that\u2019s as much as you can say.\u201d Ed Miliband, the energy secretary and former Labour leader said Lord Prescott was a \u201ctitan of the Labour movement\u201d. Miliband wrote on X: I am deeply saddened to hear of the death of John Prescott. He was a titan of the Labour movement, a unique and irreplaceable fighter for justice. He fought for social and economic equality all his life, championed the cause of the environment and showed how politics could change lives for the better. John represented the best of Labour values and I will always be grateful for the support he provided to me as Labour leader. I extend my deepest condolences to Pauline, Jonathan and David. Former Conservative Party leader Lord Hague said Lord Prescott was a \u201cformidable debater\u201d. Posting on X, Hague said: John Prescott was one of the great figures of our political era\u2014passionate, loyal, and full of life. I will never forget our many lively exchanges across the despatch box. John was a formidable debater, unflinching in his commitment to his values, and he had a unique ability to speak directly to the concerns of the people he represented. It was a point of pride for both of us that we hailed from Rotherham; although it shaped us in different ways, we shared a certain bluntness in our exchanges\u2014though in true Yorkshire fashion, John usually got straight to the point faster than I did! John\u2019s legacy as a voice for working people and a relentless advocate for Labour will endure. My thoughts are with his family and loved ones at this very sad time. Sir Tony Blair\u2019s tribute continued: I relied on him many times: when in difficulty, under attack; and less well known when I needed someone whose gut instinct I trusted better than my own. To say we were partners would never capture the nature of our relationship. There was nothing formal about it. We met and talked regularly. Rules of protocol were cast aside. Debates were had which could be fierce. But once concluded, the common line was kept. The truth is for all the difficulties and the differences and the jokes about us both and our \u2018odd couple relationship\u2019, we had developed a genuine admiration, respect and affection for each other. Underneath what could be a fierce exterior, and a manner some undoubtedly found intimidating, beat a loving, kind and compassionate human heart. John was as good a friend as you could ever hope to have, with a deep sensitivity, even vulnerability. He will deservedly occupy a special place in the pantheon of the Labour leadership; he will be mourned by his many friends and fans around the world and for me personally, today is a day of profound sadness but also immense pride in having known him and worked with him: a great man and great servant of country and party. Labour former prime minister Sir Tony Blair said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the death of Lord Prescott, and described his deputy as \u201cone of the most talented people I ever encountered in politics\u201d. Blair said: Although we all knew that the end was approaching and was inevitable, I am devastated by John\u2019s passing. He was one of the most talented people I ever encountered in politics; one of the most committed and loyal; and definitely the most unusual. There was nothing about John which fitted conventional wisdom. He was from proud traditional working class stock yet understood instinctively and completely the aspirations of that class and their desire to better themselves. He was liberal and tolerant, yet instantly intolerant of any overly liberal middle class dismissal of the misery suffered by poor inner city communities from crime and drug abuse. He could talk in the bluntest and sometimes bluest language, but it concealed a first rate intellect which meant he thought as deeply about issues as much as he cared about them. It is no exaggeration to say the Labour Party could never have won three consecutive full terms without John. He was a commanding presence. He represented the wing of the party which was not New Labour, but he did it in a way which never reduced the effectiveness of our appeal and indeed extended it, broadening the base of our support. He had extraordinary accomplishments: he revived many of Britain\u2019s inner cities, was responsible for the refurbishment of thousands of council homes, the revival of British shipping, completed the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, established the Coalfield Communities Trust to breathe life back into villages and towns affected by the closure of mines; and was Britain\u2019s lead negotiator for the Kyoto climate treaty, the world\u2019s first attempt to agree a global response to climate change. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, the BBC\u2019s political editor Chris Mason described John Prescott as a piece of \u201cblunt grit\u201d among the \u201cslick middle class polish of New Labour.\u201d He told listeners Prescott was \u201cproudly working class, proud of his trade union background, and proud to bind his party\u2019s past with its present.\u201d Mason quoted former prime minister Tony Blair in his memoirs, recalling of Prescott that \u201che could be maddening, he could be dangerous, he could be absurd, he could be magnificent, [but] never dull, placid, uneventful, forgettable.\u201d Jon Trickett, the MP for Normanton and Hemsworth, wrote on X a short while ago: John Prescott was a Labour giant. I knew him well. V sad to hear of his passing. Mining communities owe him a debt for settling the enormous claim for industrial injuries. In my constit over 10000 families received compensation which amounted to \u00a3100m plus Thank you my mate. Here is Keir Starmer\u2019s tribute on X in full: He wrote: \u201cI am deeply saddened to hear of the death of John Prescott. John was a true giant of the Labour movement. He was a staunch defender of working people and a proud trade unionist. During a decade as deputhy Prime Minister, he was one of the key architects of a Labour Government that transformed the lives of millions of people across the nation. So much of John\u2019s work set the path for those of us fortunate enough to follow. From leading climate negotiations to fighting regional inequality, his legacy will live on well beyond his lifetime. Across the Labour Party and the union movement he will be remembered for his conviction, courage and strength of character. His passion , force of personality and pride in his working-class roots was key to his authenticity \u2013 an honesty that was recognised and respected across the political divide and across the nation. On behalf of the Labour Party, I send my condolences to Pauline and all his family, to the city of Hull which he served as MP for forty years, and to all those who knew and loved him. May he rest in peace. British prime minister Keir Starmer says he is \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d to hear that Prescott has died, and called him a \u201ctrue giant of Labour\u201d. In a statement on X, he said, \u201cI am deeply saddened to hear of the death of John Prescott. John was a true giant of the Labour movement. On behalf of the Labour Party, I send my condolences to Pauline and his family, to the city of Hull, and to all those who knew and loved him. May he rest in peace.\u201d Former US vice-president Al Gore, who worked with John Prescott on the Kyoto protocol climate change agreement in 1997, said he had \u201cnever worked with anyone in politics \u2013 on my side of the pond or his \u2013 quite like John Prescott\u201d. Gore said in a statement: He possessed an inherent ability to connect with people about the issues that mattered to them \u2013 a talent that others spend years studying and cultivating, but that was second nature to him. He fought like hell to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol and was an unwavering champion of climate action for decades to come. I\u2019m forever grateful to John for that commitment to solving the climate crisis and will miss him as a dear friend.\u201d Maria Eagle, the Labour MP for Liverpool Garston, described John Prescott as a great Labour deputy leader. She recalled his work for the relatives of those who lost their lives in the sinking of the MV Derbyshire in 1980. In a post on X, she wrote: \u201cI\u2019ll always remember what he did for the MV Derbyshire families, insisting on work that led to the vindication of their deceased relatives, who they felt had been blamed for the sinking.\u201d When Labour won the election in 2007 with Blair as PM, Prescott, in addition to being made deputy PM, was put in charge of a new \u201csuper ministry\u201d covering the environment, transport and the regions. In that role he was credited with a number of successes, including helping to negotiate the international Kyoto Protocol on climate change and creating regional development councils as well as reforms to the transport system. East Hull MP Karl Turner has released a statement on Prescott\u2019s death. Turner has known Prescott all of his life, he said, and knows \u201cfirst-hand the impact that he had on many thousands of people across the city and the country.\u201d Prescott played an instrumental role in negotiating the Kyoto protocol on climate change, Turner recalls. Times radio breakfast host Stig Abel described Prescott on X as, \u201cOne of the most colourful, memorable politicians of our lifetimes. A man everyone can conjure in their minds immediately, and you can\u2019t say that about many politicians any more.\u201d Born in Prestatyn in Wales on 31 May 1938 the son of a railwayman, Prescott left school at the age of 15 to work as a trainee chef and then as a steward on the Cunard Line before entering politics. In a private letter in 2007, Blair said his former deputy\u2019s role \u201csmoothing out problems, sorting out colleagues and troubleshooting\u201d had been an \u201cintegral part of getting things done\u201d. The former prime minister said: \u201cThe completely unique Prescott blend of charm and brutality \u2013 made always more effective by the unpredictability of which would be predominant \u2013 got you through the decade, kept the government together and above all, gave me a lot of fun. I was lucky to have you as my deputy.\u201d Over a parliamentary career spanning more than half a century, Prescott served for 10 years as deputy prime minister after Labour\u2019s 1997 general election landslide. At times short-tempered, he once famously punched a protester who threw an egg at him during an election campaign visit to north Wales in 2001. But during much of his time in office, he acted as a mediator in the often turbulent relationship between Tony Blair and his chancellor, Gordon Brown. He also oversaw the environment, transport and the regions, a brief that included helping to negotiate the international Kyoto protocol on climate change. Prescott was a loyal supporter of Blair in office but subsequently critical of parts of New Labour\u2019s legacy, denouncing Britain\u2019s involvement in the Iraq war. He also strongly defended Jeremy Corbyn during his time as party leader in the face of fierce criticism. In their statement, Prescott\u2019s family said that representing Hull for 40 years in parliament was the former deputy PM\u2019s \u201cgreatest honour\u201d. The statement reads, in part: John spent his life trying to improve the lives of others, fighting for social justice and protecting the environment, doing so from his time as a waiter on the cruise liners to becoming Britain\u2019s longest serving deputy prime minister. John dearly loved his home of Hull and representing its people in parliament for 40 years was his greatest honour. We would like to thank the amazing NHS doctors and nurses who cared for him after his stroke in 2019 and the dedicated staff at the care home where he passed away after latterly living with Alzheimer\u2019s. In lieu of flowers and if you wish to do so, you can donate to Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK. As you can imagine, our family needs to process our grief so we respectfully request time and space to mourn in private. Thank you.\u201d The former British deputy prime minister John Prescott has died aged 86, his family announced on Thursday morning. His family said he had \u201cspent his life trying to improve the lives of others, fighting for social justice and protecting the environment\u201d. \u201cWe are deeply saddened to inform you that our beloved husband, father and grandfather, John Prescott, passed away peacefully yesterday at the age of 86,\u201d they said. \u201cHe did so surrounded by the love of his family and the jazz music of Marian Montgomery. Prescott served in Parliament for 40 years, eventually becoming deputy prime minister under Tony Blair. After leaving office along with Blair in 2007, he became increasingly critical of the New Labour legacy, denouncing Britain\u2019s involvement in the Iraq War. More shortly."

            "date": "2024-11-15T22:22:32Z",
            "content": "Brendan Fannings\u2019s report has just come through so I\u2019ll sign off. Not the best game for the neutral, but Ireland get back to winning ways. They scored three tries and were outstanding in the opening 20 minutes, but they rode their luck at times and can thank their stingy defence for keeping the Pumas at bay. I\u2019ll be back on the tools for England v South Africa tomorrow. If this opening game of the weekend is anything to go by, we\u2019re in for a cracking weekend. Sure, Argentina were decent, but I can\u2019t help but feel that they missed a great chance with Ireland slightly off their game. Are we guilty of moaning too much in rugby? Perhaps so, says Niall Mullen: \u201cI know the cliche is that rugby players respect the officials. But, my lord, do the fans love banging on about the refs. Is TMO chat more or less tedious than VAR chat?\u201d I can\u2019t stand either, to be fair. I thought Paul Williams did a decent job handling what was a messy affair for large parts. Joe McCarthy is our player of the match. Here\u2019s what he had to say after the final whistle: I just want to say a big thanks to the crowd here. The atmosphere was feckin amazing today. We\u2019re really sorry we disappointed you last week and we really wanted to show how much it means to us. So we really appreciate your support, it means the world to us. We came out of the blocks live. We know how good they are. We knew they\u2019d be super tough. The lads were unbelievable to dig in today. It wasn\u2019t perfect but there\u2019s a lot to work on. Next games \u2013 Fiji and Australia \u2013 will be massive. Peter McDonald sent this in earlier: \u201cWhy are Ireland conceding so many penalties? Apart from the obvious, of course! Technique? Over-enthusiasm? Bad habits? Failure to adapt to new laws or the refs\u2019 interpretation thereof? \u201cIreland are my team and having spent 60-plus years hoping, for a win or two in the 5/6 Nations, I\u2019m enjoying the current run of success, which it appears to me is under threat from the penalty count.\u201d Good question Peter. One that will need a proper answer this week. They got away with one. On another day, they\u2019d have lost it given their ill discipline. How cruel for the Pumas! They went all of 50 metres but ran out of puff. They just couldn\u2019t keep the ball moving through the hands and a tiny spill around the fringe was the final act of this gripping contest. That was a tremendous effort from Argentina but I think on balance the Irish deserve their win. They lacked discipline and were largely toothless on attack, but their defence was the difference here. Plus, scoring three tries to one tells a story on its own. I think relief, rather than joy, will be the overwhelming emotion in the Irish camp this evening. There\u2019s a knock on and Ireland win it! 80+2 min: Argentina are keeping it narrow and are 10 out. 14 phases. 80th min: We\u2019re in the rd now. Argentina are on the ball on half-way but Ireland\u2019s defence is not fading. That is until a burst from Gonzalez and now Delguy has it and they\u2019re into the 22. Can they do it? 79th min: More than 20 phases now. They\u2019re not finding gaps and eventually Oviedo, who has been magnificent throughout, gets over the ball and wins a penalty on the deck. Argentina will get one more crack at this. Albornoz finds touch upfield. Kodela\u2019s yellow remains a yellow, but that\u2019s immaterial to this contest. 77th min: Ireland\u2019s maul makes ground but then stalls so they go down the line. Lowe beats his man on the left wing in contact and recycles. Prendergast finds runners off his shoulder with short passes. O\u2019Mahony carries stiffly. McCarthy too. O\u2019Mohany again. They\u2019re keeping it narrow as the clock ticks down. Keenan is well tackled by Prendergast keeps the move alive. They\u2019re camped inside Argentina\u2019s 22. Is that the game? Just as Argentina found a foothold in these closing minutes, their veteran front rower hurled himself into the breakdown, lost his feet and found the head of an Irishman with his shoulder. 75th min: Albornoz kicks high from half-way and forces a 50-50 contestable. It lands on Ireland\u2019s side but we\u2019re going to go back for a potential shoulder to head. Kodela is the guilty party. 73rd min: Outstanding steal from Carrerars who spotted that Osborne was isolated after a busting run through midfield. Argentina\u2019s skilful back was sharp on defence, wrapped his arms around the ball and came up with the steal inside his own 22. Argentina will now get the line-out on half way and perhaps one more chance to keep the game inside Ireland\u2019s red zone. 72nd min: Prendergast hoists a high kick \u2013 after Argentina\u2019s clearance following that turnover didn\u2019t find touch \u2013 and Albornoz, not for the first time, takes a very composed mark under pressure. He kicks it out around half-way. But why didn\u2019t Ireland take the easy three points. If they lose or draw this they\u2019ll be filled with regret. Anyway, they have the line-out throw on half-way. 70th min: 10 phases but Ireland don\u2019t look like getting over the line. Argentina push them back. Just about every man in green has a dart. They keep it narrow until Prendergast almost finds an edge. A huge counter ruck has Argentina stealing the ball. That got up to around 17 phases but Argentina held firm! 68th min: Ireland get a gimme penalty after an Argentine player strays off-side after Carreras\u2019 clearing kick looked to have relieved pressure. That is what they call coach killers. Ireland turn down the easy three points and choose to tap and go from 10 out. Why on earth didn\u2019t they take the three? 67th min: Excellent from Ireland. Prendergast with a double-pump finds Lowe but he knocks on in contact. Earlier Doris steamrolled over the gainline but lost his footing just as he made the burst through the gap. Ireland\u2019s first phases strike play has been impressive. It\u2019s what\u2019s happened afterwards that has not been up to much. Cian Healy comes on to become Ireland\u2019s joint-most capped player of all time. 65th min: Now Ireland win the scrum penalty with young Clarkson getting the back slaps. Prendergast kicks to touch and now Ireland have a serious chance to reestablish daylight with a line-out just outside of Argentina\u2019s 22. 65th min: Ireland back in possession after Argentina knock on as Albornoz\u2019s pass to Mallia doesn\u2019t stick. Earlier Morni collected a smart off-load in contact and cantered over the gainline, but Ireland scrambled well and then started to force Argentina backwards. That made things scrappy and the ambitious pass from Albornoz proved the move\u2019s undoing. Credit to Ireland\u2019s defence. They haven\u2019t been at their best but that is one aspect of their game that has worked tonight. 64th min: Argentina\u2019s scrum creaks but they win the scrum penalty on their own 22. Looked to me like Ireland' had the better of things, but what do I know about scrums? Albornoz kicks it long and Ruiz, on for Montoya, will throw around half-way. Other changes for Ireland. Baird and Osborne come on for Ryan and Henshaw. 63rd min: Albornoz clears and Lowe runs it back. Argentina\u2019s defence push Ireland back to half-way so Gibson-Park hoists a high kick. There\u2019s a spill inside Argentina\u2019s 22 so we\u2019ll get a scrum. Sam Prendergast comes on to make his debut at the age of 21, replacing Crowley who had a top game. What a moment for the young lad. Can he be the hero Ireland need? 61st min: Better from Ireland off that scrum who played a string of loops \u2013 not quite Sexton, but not far off \u2013 as they went down the backline. But Argentina\u2019s defence held so Ireland kick ahead. It\u2019s fielded but the clearance doesn\u2019t go long from a Pumas boot. Ireland get another throw inside opposition territory. McCarthy returns. They need to turn this momentum into points. 59th min: Kelleher misses his jumper and Argentina come away with the ball. But there\u2019s a spill so Ireland have it back. It\u2019s really messy from both sides with neither being able to string together a cohesive move. So we\u2019ll go back for the scrum with Ireland feeding between the 22 and half-way with a short blind side to Ireland\u2019s left. 58th min: Irish fans find their voice. They recognise that this game could slip away from their boys and they could do with a lift. Albornoz does well to field a kick from Crowley and takes a good mark. But his clearing kick skews off his boot and now Ireland have a chance to launch from a line-out inside Argentina\u2019s half. 56th min: It\u2019s messy ball for Argentina but they keep hold of it. Albornoz drops into the pocket and he has all the time in the world to take aim with a drop-goal. But he slices it wide. That was a bad miss from right in front. Also, I\u2019m not sure it was necessary. 55th min: Hansen plucks a high ball from the skies under great pressure. That was class. Albornoz follows suit and wins the penalty as Crowley got his timing wrong and took his opposite number out in the air, just going too early with his tackle before Albornoz\u2019s feet touched the ground. Ireland will now have to defend another line-out in their red zone. 53rd min: Ireland need a lift and Crowley tries to give it to them with a run back from a long Pumas kick. He can\u2019t get through. Hansen then chucks a pass to nobody and it\u2019s a line-out for Argentina on half-way. Ireland look ragged to be honest. Where is that famous cohesion and continuity? He hasn\u2019t missed yet. Another three points for the Pumas 10 means it\u2019s just a three point game. It had to be. McCarthy is off-side in the red zone and the referee had had enough after Ireland\u2019s ninth penalty. Argentina couldn\u2019t find the gap after the line-out but Albornoz will get a chance to take three off the deficit with this kick at the poles. 48th min: Another line-out win for Argentina gives them ball around half-way. A high kick tests Keenan and Ireland have a a knock-on advantage. Those high kicks really are a 50-50. Oh, another penalty against Ireland as Lowe clattered a man off the ball. So soft! Ireland\u2019s discipline has been really poor. Argentina kick to the corner and will get the throw around Ireland\u2019s 22. Momentum has tangibly shifted. Stunner! Wow, what a try that is from the Pumas full-back. Argentina\u2019s attack was going nowhere so Albornoz kicked it high. Hansen knocked on so Argentina had another go. Still, the Irish defence held until Mallia screamed onto the ball off a blind angle and he was away. One more lightning step left Hansen for dead and he had too much pace for Lowe to catch him. Albornoz kicks the extras and we have a game on. 43rd min: Argentina\u2019s attack can\u2019t make any ground. Ireland\u2019s defencve is too strong and too organised. But there is a penalty conceded by Ryan so Albornoz kicks into Ireland\u2019s 22 where the Pumas will have the line-out. Oh but they spill it. Poor from Argentina. Crowley gets it and clears with a thumping boot. Great exit play. 41st min: Gibson-Park slams a long raking clearance. Argentina win the line-out and then Bertranou boxes around half-way but that goes up and not very far. Still, the Pumas win the ball and now they\u2019re building through the phases. Ireland\u2019s midfield is rock solid. Ringrose is having a great game on defence. The players are making their way back onto the park. Argentina have yet to fire a shot. We\u2019ve not seen their backline at all and they\u2019ve barely had any joy at the breakdown. Ireland, with three tries, are in control thanks largely to Crowley at 10. Brent Lindsay isn\u2019t happy with the way this game has been officiated: \u201cAnother terrible decision with the TMO coming in to overblown any minor incident. In the words of AFTV \u201cwhen\u2019s it gonna end Robbie\u201d Brent is referring to the two yellow cards, but I must say that I thought both were the right call. And I\u2019m glad that neither was upgraded to a red. Ireland\u2019s defence once again holds and Argentina can\u2019t crack through. Wonderful work from the home side, especially Henshaw and Ringrose who kept the Pumas runners at bay. Oviedo made a break but couldn\u2019t sticth together the telling move. A scrappy 40 but Ireland are good value for their big lead. 40th min: Another penalty in the red zone. Ireland get one final warning. Rather than maul Argentina chose to go down the line. Albornoz\u2019s cross-field kick to the corner can\u2019t find a teammate, but the bouncing ball causes all sorts of chaos. No time for the line-out so Argentina will tap and go. 39th min: Argentina\u2019s maul splinters so Montoya charges alone. He bounces Lowe but Ireland\u2019s defence regroups. There\u2019s another penalty. The Pumas keep it with the forwards. They\u2019re targeting the fringe of the ruck. Ireland hold them up but there was that penalty advantage. Albornoz goes to the corner again. Time for one more maul. 37th min: The Pumas win the line-out and go through the phases with a few short carries from the big boys. They make ground and then win the penalty. With the advantage they chance their arm and Cinti almost gets through but Ringrose makes a momentum-stopping hit so we go back for the penalty. Albornoz kicks to the corner. One last shot before half-time. 35th min: Argentina lose the ball after van der Flier nips in to steal it from Cinti who charged over the gainline. Ireland send it down the line before Lowe hoofs a clearance that finds touch. 34th min: Gibson-Park dallies on the ball at the base of the ruck and is clattered by Montoya who forces the knock-on. Scrum to Argentina on Ireland\u2019s 22. A bit lapse that from a veteran scrum-half. They would not be denied! McCarthy barrels over from close range after Lowe, off the back of a neat move from the line-out, found the gap in the line. It looked simple but that was slick interplay with Henshaw involved in the build up as well. Crowley slots the extras. 31st min: Ireland set the maul from the line-out and several backs also add their weight. But Argentina hold so Ireland have to go through the hands. The Pumas defence is brilliant but so is Ireland\u2019s skill on the ball. Ringrose throws a dummy that no one buys. Doris with a carry but it\u2019s Argentina who come away with the ball! Remarkable defence! Bertranou box kicks but it\u2019s not long. So Ireland will get another line-out inside the red zone, albeit a little further back. 28th min: Ireland claim the restart and they set an attack inside Argentina\u2019s 22. Kelleher with a strong carry. Henshaw attacks the midfield channel. Porter slips a tackle. Hansen finds Henshaw in the left tram. 10 phases now. Good from Ireland but Argentina hold firm. Ringrose to Henshaw. Half a chance. Gibson-Park is taken out without the ball and that\u2019s a penalty. Needless from the Pumas. They were keeping Ireland at bay. Crowley again nudges to the corner and the crowd responds. Bealham back on. His got his kicking boots on tonight! Argentina stay within touching distance despite not quite clicking just yet. 26th min: Argentina concede a free-kick at the scrum. Crowley lifts a high kick into the heavens but there\u2019s an obstruction call as Kelleher found himself in front of the ball carrier. We\u2019re inside Ireland\u2019s half so Albornoz points to the sticks. 24th min: Gibson-Park smokes a box kick that provides some relief after the restart. Argentina have the line-out around half-way. Ruiz has to throw as Montoya is off for a blood check. Lowe gets low a little later and wins a turnover on the ground. Another box from Gibson-Park is brilliantly claimed by Isgro and Gonzalez spills it in contact so it\u2019ll be an Irish scrum on half-way. Clarkson comes on to make his debut as Bealham is in the sin-bin and we need a complete front-row. Bealham\u2019s yellow remains yellow. Lucky, but perhaps the right call. Crowley nails the drop goal! The attack was going nowhere so he figured he\u2019d have a go. And he slotted it over. What a game he\u2019s having. 21st min: Ireland make a mess of the line-out and they\u2019re pushed back beyond Argentina\u2019s 22. They still have the ball and Porter charges into contact. Crowlety drops into the pocket\u2026. 19th min: Oviedo makes a stiff tackle on Ryan, but he tips him over the horizontal so it\u2019ll be a penalty. Crowley nudges it into the corner and Ireland will have a chance five metres from the line. That\u2019s a sweet strike from Albornoz. The deficit is now just 6. Definite croc-roll and Bealham is sin-binned! This might get upgraded to red. This\u2019ll be an anxious wait. Potential croc-roll from Bealham. They\u2019ll take a look on the big screen. 17th min: Argentina clear their lines with a big hoof from Albornoz. Crowley, full of confidence, opts to run it back and makes metres. Gibson-Park hoists a box that Hansen chases, but the winger knocks on as he climbs. 15th min: Ireland spill the ball from that scrum. Argentina opt to clear with a kick but Henshaw is running back into the maw soon enough. Ringrose straightens and gets over the gainline. Bealham with another carry. Better continuity this from Ireland. Ryan now and Beirne gets it in the left tram, he\u2019s riding two tacklers, reaches out and tries to dot down, this will be a stunning try! But NO! He\u2019s knocked it on over the line! Excellent defence from Moroni, back on the field, who made grounding a challenge. Goal-line drop-out. 13th min: Ireland win the ball back after Petti claimed the restart. But the Irish kept him up and then made the ball unplayable from the maul. Scum for the home side just on Argentina\u2019s 22. Argentina are on the board with a simple nudge over the poles. Moroni\u2019s yellow card will remain a yellow. Right call. \u201cAt what point are we going to just accept collisions happen in rugby? Two guys going low for a ball is not foul play. No hint of a head injury as Crowley didn\u2019t go for an HIA. Terrible, it\u2019s killing the game.\u201d That\u2019s from Brent Lindsay. I disagree. Have to make the game as safe as possible. 11th min: Argentina get great ball off the scrum but Beirne hammers Gonzalez with a monster hit that stops the momentum. But Henshaw strays off-side so Argentina have a free hit inside Ireland\u2019s 22. Nothing doin\u2019, as there\u2019s a spill, so they come back for the penalty. 9th min: Argentina finally get some possession and they make inroads. Matera charges over the gainline, but a ball carrier isolated and Ireland pinch it back. Then there\u2019s a knock-on so Argentina have the scrum feed inside Ireland\u2019s 22 on the left with a short blind side. Good platform to strike. And another! That is brilliant from Ireland. It started with Henshaw bursting through a half gap and they flooded through. They went through the phases and Ringrose found a gap himself. Gibson-Park floated a ball into the right tram where Beirne could have gone for the line himself, but a cute inside ball found Hansen who hit it at pace and barrelled over. Wonderful rugby. Crowley scores! What a mad start to this game. Ireland get great go-forward after a slick strike move from a clean line-out. Kelleher got close but not quite there. Crowley kept the move alive and straightened with a step and slid over. The extras are added off his boot and Ireland are up and running. What a swift turnaround. Moroni thought he\u2019d grabbed the opening score after Argentina pounced on a mistake from Crowley, but earlier in the move, when possession was turned, the inside centre clattered Ireland\u2019s fly-half with a head on head collision. It\u2019ll go to the bunker but I think he\u2019ll be OK. Both players were upright. Unbelievable! Moroni pounces on a loose ball and he dots down for a try! But they may bring it back as there is head on head contact by Moroni on Crowley earlier in the move. 2nd min: Argentina bobble from the opening kick and their first clearing kick is charged down. So is their second and Hansen has it inside the 22. Argentina\u2019s exit was such a mess there! Hansen again on the ball, he floats one over the top for Keenan on the right wing. Down the left with Dorris in the tram but stout resistance from the Pumas turns possession. And we\u2019re off! Crowley kicks off. Ireland in emerald green. Argentina in their blue and white hoops. OK, I\u2019m going to stick my neck out. Argentina to nick it by a score! The teams are out and ready for the anthems. Not long to go now. I agree. This Pumas side is special. They\u2019ll give Ireland a fright if they click. This is the 20th meeting of the two sides. Ireland lead 13-6 and have never lost to the Pumas at home. Their last match was a one-sided affair with Ireland running out 53-7 winners in Dublin. Argentina\u2019s last win in this contest was in 2015 World Cup quarterfinals when they scored four tries in a 43-20 triumph in Cardiff. Andy Farrell has said that some of his players were \u201clucky\u201d to get selected again after their show against the All Blacks. Here are his pre-match thoughts: The week has been good, there have been some lessons that we need to transfer now. It\u2019s the perfect assignment. It\u2019s a top drawer opponent on top form. The improvement they\u2019ve made over the past 18 months has been phenomenal. He also had some gushing words for Sam Prendergast \u2013 \u201ca confident kid\u201d \u2013 who, by some reports, is Farrell\u2019s ideal 10 once he gets some miles in the legs. The TNT live feed has just flicked on and they\u2019ve kicked off with a speech from Theodore Roosevelt: It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. It\u2019s a good speech, to be fair. Argentina\u2019s coach, Felipe Conteponi, marks his return to Dublin tonight. As a playmaker, he represented Leinster for six years between 2003 and 2009, before returning as the province\u2019s attack coach for four seasons in 2018. He\u2019s been fantastic as the Pumas coach, giving them a new identity and a harder edge, encouraging them to attack from anywhere while causing chaos at the breakdown. Look out for Argentina\u2019s ability to shift the point of contact at breakneck speed. One second they\u2019re going right, the next they\u2019re moving left. This strategy was a handful for the Springboks, All Blacks and Wallabies. Can Ireland deal with it? Pablo Matera returns to the back row after serving a suspension and he\u2019ll play an important part in the Pumas quest to disrupt Ireland\u2019s ball. Elsewhere, the electric Santiago Carreras returns after an injury to take his place on the bench. Guido Petti replaces Franco Molina at lock while there is one backs change as Matias Moroni comes in for Matias Orlando Argentina: Juan Cruz Mallia; Rodrigo Isgro, Lucio Cinti, Matias Moroni, Bautista Delguy; Tomas Albornoz, Gonzalo Bertranou; Thomas Gallo, Julian Montoya (capt), Joel Sclavi; Guido Petti, Pedro Rubiolo; Pablo Matera, Juan Martin Gonzalez, Joaquin Oviedo. Replacements: Ignacio Ruiz, Ignacio Calles, Francisco Gomez Kodela, Franco Molina, Santiago Grondona, Gonzalo Garcia, Santiago Carreras, Justo Piccardo. Miraculously, as if he\u2019s defying the laws of nature, Cian Healy is still playing rugby at the elite level. The 37-year-old prop will equal Brian O\u2019Driscoll\u2019s record for most number of caps in an Irish shirt tonight when he comes off the bench to represent his nation for the 133rd time. There\u2019s just one change to the team that lost to New Zealand with with Robbie Henshaw\u2019s replacing Bundee Aki - who does not make the squad - in midfield. On the bench, alongside Healy, prop Thomas Clarkson and the very promising fly-half Sam Prendergast are set to make their debuts. Ireland: Hugo Keenan; Mack Hansen, Garry Ringrose, Robbie Henshaw, James Lowe; Jack Crowley, Jamison Gibson-Park; Andrew Porter, Ronan Kelleher, Finlay Bealham; Joe McCarthy, James Ryan; Tadhg Beirne, Josh van der Flier, Caelan Doris (capt). Replacements: Rob Herring, Cian Healy, Thomas Clarkson, Ryan Baird, Peter O\u2019Mahony, Craig Casey, Sam Prendergast, Jamie Osborne. This weekend\u2019s rugby feast kicks off with the meeting of two camps in different moods. Ireland were poor, really poor, against New Zealand last week. Their celebrated cohesion was totally absent and they were well beaten at the Aviva, their first defeat on home soil since 2021. Argentina, however, were outstanding against Italy, clattering the Azzurri with six different players scoring tries in a 50-18 rout. The Pumas have already claimed big scalps this year having beaten New Zealand in Wellington, South Africa by a point and Australia by a record score. A win here tonight would send a clear message that Felipe Contepomi\u2019s side is a force to be reckoned with. Ireland simply have to be better and Andy Farrell will expect a statement. The breakdown will be pivotal. Ireland\u2019s approach requires fast ball but the Pumas are the masters at disrupting. This is where the game will be won or lost. Please do get in touch via email with any thoughts you might have. I\u2019d love to hear from you. Kick-off at 8:10 pm. Teams and other updates to follow."

            "date": "2024-11-03T16:58:52Z",
            "content": "Families bereaved by the Covid pandemic say they feel insulted by Kemi Badenoch\u2019s claim that the Partygate scandal was \u201coverblown\u201d. The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a \u201ctrap\u201d of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. She told the BBC\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: \u201cI thought that it was overblown. We should not have created fixed penalty notices, for example. That was us not going with our principles.\u201d Adding that the public was \u201cnot wrong to be upset about Partygate\u201d, Badenoch said: \u201cThe problem was that we should not have criminalised everyday activities the way that we did. \u201cPeople going out for walks, all of them having fixed penalty notices, that was what ended up creating a trap for Boris Johnson.\u201d Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch\u2019s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: \u201cMs Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.\u201d Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch\u2019s comments were \u201cinsulting and extremely painful\u201d. She said: \u201cIt is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.\u201d Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: \u201cI think she\u2019s trying to appeal to people who don\u2019t agree with lockdowns. She\u2019s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.\u201d Fulop also claimed Badenoch\u2019s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government\u2019s public health messages. \u201cAll the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it\u2019s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,\u201d she said. Fulop added: \u201cBadenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what\u2019s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I\u2019m quite mystified that she doesn\u2019t realise the impact that\u2019s had on families like mine and the wider public.\u201d Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: \u201cIt sounds as if she\u2019s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.\u201d Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: \u201cThe fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.\u201d Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch\u2019s remarks were \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. He said: \u201cResearch has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules. So as well as being offensive, it\u2019s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.\u201d He added: \u201cThere was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.\u201d Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC\u2019s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: \u201cFrom what key workers and working people have told us, It\u2019s hard to believe they judge it as \u2018overblown\u2019. The Covid-19 public inquiry has heard time and again how much hurt the Partygate revelations caused to people across the country. \u201cIt\u2019s now for the inquiry to establish the facts and for the public to make their own minds up on the legacy of rules being broken in Downing Street.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-20T06:00:29Z",
            "content": "Policymakers have been \u201cleft in the dark,\u201d by official jobs figures since the pandemic, which may have \u201clost\u201d almost a million workers according to the thinktank Resolution Foundation. In a report, the thinktank said the regular snapshot from the Office for National Statistics may have painted an \u201coverly pessimistic\u201d picture of the UK labour market since the pandemic. Principal economist, Adam Corlett, says in the report that response rates to the key Labour Force Survey (LFS) have collapsed, from 39% in 2019 to just 13% last year. There are concerns that workers may be less likely to respond to the survey than people who are economically inactive \u2013 potentially skewing the results. \u201cOfficial statistics have misrepresented what has happened in the UK labour market since the pandemic, and left policymakers in the dark by painting an overly pessimistic picture of our labour market,\u201d said Corlett. \u201cThe ONS Labour Force Survey appears to have \u2018lost\u2019 almost a million workers over the past few years compared to better sources.\u201d Ministers are expected to publish a Back to Work white paper within weeks, aimed at helping people back into the workplace \u2013 including by improving the service provided by Jobcentres, and joining up work and health support. The official jobs data has shown employment in the UK failing to recover to pre-Covid levels \u2013 a different pattern from other major economies. In particular, the number of people out of work because of health conditions has risen sharply. Resolution has constructed an alternative assessment, using tax and population data. This tracks the official figures closely until 2020, but then diverges sharply. It suggests the ONS may be underestimating the number of people in jobs by as much as 930,000. The analysis suggests that the working age employment rate may be back to the pre-pandemic level of 76%, instead of the 75% currently estimated by the ONS. Resolution Foundation urged the ONS to act swiftly to reconcile the official figures with alternative estimates. \u201cThe government faces a significant challenge in aiming to raise employment, even if the rate is higher than previously thought. But crafting good policy is made harder still if the UK does not have reliable employment statistics,\u201d said Corlett. The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, reiterated his concerns about the labour market data on Tuesday, after raising the issue at last week\u2019s Mansion House dinner. \u201cThe sample is now so small that it is not a statistically representative sample, that\u2019s the problem \u2013 so we don\u2019t know how much faith we can put into it,\u201d Bailey told MPs on the cross-party Treasury select committee. \u201cIt\u2019s an important issue: it\u2019s very important, and it\u2019s not just important for us, it\u2019s important for other aspects of public policy as well.\u201d The Bank\u2019s understanding of how much slack there is in the labour market is a key factor in setting interest rate policy. A spokesperson for the ONS said it is aware that other measures of employment may be giving \u201ca more accurate picture\u201d than the LFS, but insisted it is working to improve the figures. \u201cOur ongoing work to improve the LFS estimates by increasing the sample, reintroducing face-to-face interviews, increasing incentives for those taking part and re-weighting the data using the latest population information will all help to improve the quality of the survey,\u201d they said. The spokesperson added that the ONS is cooperating with outside experts, to see if more action needs to be taken."

            "date": "2024-11-07T11:00:14Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump will be propelled to the White House for a second term amid concerns about inflation kicked off by the pandemic, with a leading vaccine skeptic \u2013 Robert F Kennedy Jr \u2013 at his side, and proposals from conservative supporters to fundamentally restructure public health agencies central to pandemic-era ire. Covid-19 was never seen as the central issue of the 2024 presidential campaign season, but in the first post-pandemic presidential election, it reverberated as the anti-vaccine movement ascended to its greatest political heights ever. Even in his Wednesday morning acceptance speech, Trump alluded to changes he expects as his administration comes into focus. The vaccine skeptic and conspiracy theorist Robert F Kennedy Jr. is \u201cgoing to help make America healthy again\u201d, Trump told supporters, before adding: \u201cWe\u2019re going to let him go to it.\u201d Dr Howard Markel, a historian of medicine at the University of Michigan who has studied pandemics, said he was struck by widespread anger, and called the election\u2019s theme \u201cthe ghost of pandemic future\u201d. \u201cDid you ever think,\u201d Markel said he remarked to colleagues, \u201cwhen you were doing all this hard work and staying up all night that not like 1% or 10%, but like 50% of the country would be saying you destroyed their life and kept them inside, out of harm\u2019s way, during the pandemic?\u201d Although it never topped his agenda, the pandemic echoed throughout Trump\u2019s campaign. He adopted the slogan: \u201cMake America healthy again\u201d from Kennedy, answered supporters\u2019 recent questions about Covid-19 vaccine mandates in the military, and spoke with the popular podcaster Joe Rogan about polio vaccines. Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation\u2019s conservative playbook, repeatedly drew on anger about mask mandates. One prominent concern from experts is the damage that could be wrought by putting a vaccine skeptic at the helm of powerful federal health agencies. Trump has not announced a specific role for Kennedy in the administration, but Kennedy said he was \u201cpromised\u201d control over health policy. His influence appears to have increased amid repeated mentions of \u201cBobby\u201d in the lead-up to election day. Kennedy, who had been running as an independent candidate in the 2024 presidential election but dropped out and endorsed Trump in August, is a conspiracy theorist known for spreading unfounded claims. Some of those included the idea that HIV does not cause Aids and thoroughly debunked theories that vaccines are linked to autism. \u201cThe first issue on the table is vaccines,\u201d said Dr Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Even without changing public policy, Osterholm said, if authorities with the imprimatur of the federal government speak out against vaccines, \u201cthat discourages people who might otherwise be vaccinated, and at that point that\u2019s as bad as not having a vaccine at all\u201d. The effects are not theoretical. As recently as last week, the CDC released a report that found fewer than one in six healthcare workers had received updated Covid-19 vaccines in the 2023-24 respiratory virus season, and fewer than half had received flu shots. Childhood vaccinations have also dipped since the pandemic. In the US, for children born in 2020-21, the rates of children younger than two who had received all their vaccinations fell as the percentage who had received none grew. The largest declines were for children who received both flu shots (-7.8%). Vaccination hesitancy and misinformation both were cited as major reasons by researchers. \u201cWe forget what this country was like 50 years ago \u2013 how many children died every year from polio, pertussis, measles,\u201d said Osterholm. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see the return of diseases we have controlled for decades and with that many additional severe illnesses in hospitals and deaths \u2013 and that\u2019s just from the rhetoric, not even withdrawing vaccines.\u201d Kennedy has already recommended another vaccine skeptic and the current Florida surgeon general, Dr Joseph Ladapo, as secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), a massive federal agency that houses 13 divisions and 10 subagencies, including the CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the largest publicly funded biomedical and behavioral research agency in the world. Ladapo urged Floridians not to get the Covid-19 vaccine and allowed unvaccinated children to go to school amid a measles outbreak in the state. \u201cRFK Jr holds a series of false beliefs not supported by scientific evidence, and he\u2019s always a threat to vaccines,\u201d said Dr Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and a doctor at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Offit added that proposals in Project 2025 may hold a comparable threat. Currently, the CDC makes recommendations about which vaccines people should get and when, including for children; the CDC works in tandem with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which approves vaccines. Project 2025, the conservative playbook written in part by Trump\u2019s former director of the office of civil rights at HHS, proposes limiting the CDC\u2019s ability to make policy recommendations, such as producing vaccine schedules. \u201cTheir notion was: \u2018Let the parents and doctors decide\u2019 \u2013 the notion being that the parents and doctors are just as informed as the people sitting around making those decisions,\u201d said Offit. Put another way, by Osterholm: \u201cWe often say a physician who treats himself is a fool.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-15T11:53:38Z",
            "content": "The rising death toll from drug-resistant bugs is \u201cvery scary\u201d and people do not even realise it is happening, the UK\u2019s special envoy for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has said. Superbugs kill more than a million people each year but neither governments nor the public recognise the scale of the threat, doctors complain. The crisis is largely driven by the misuse of antibiotics \u2013 about 70% of which are given to livestock \u2013 which encourages the evolution of microbes too strong for modern medicine to handle. \u201cWe need to use antibiotics safely and appropriately,\u201d said Sally Davies, who stepped down as England\u2019s chief medical officer in 2019 to champion the UK\u2019s fight against superbugs. By 2050 it is projected that drug-resistant bugs will kill nearly 2 million people each year and play a role in the deaths of 8 million people. The figures put AMR in a similar ballpark to the Covid-19 pandemic, which the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates led to 4m excess deaths in 2020 and 10m in 2021. Data published on Thursday showed a rise in serious antibiotic-resistant infections in 2023 to 66,730 cases, above pre-pandemic levels. E coli caused 65% of cases in the UK over the past five years. \u201cSome people talk about [AMR] being a pandemic \u2013 it is,\u201d Davies said. \u201cIs it a slow-developing one, an insidious one, or what? I don\u2019t mind the words you want to use, but it\u2019s pretty awful.\u201d World leaders have taken little action to cut AMR-related deaths but they promised to reduce them by 10% by 2030 at the UN general assembly in September. Public health experts are frustrated by the lack of interest from governments and the lack of awareness among the public. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a lack of prioritisation \u2013 and that must be a failure of our communication,\u201d Davies said. \u201cThat\u2019s in part the name, \u2018antimicrobial resistance\u2019, AMR, in part the complexity, and the big bit that\u2019s hidden \u2026 they [doctors] don\u2019t tell people what they\u2019re dying of.\u201d Davies, who has previously served on the executive board of the WHO, lost her goddaughter to antimicrobial resistance two years ago. \u201cIt was horrible. She had cystic fibrosis, she knew she had AMR, and she knew she was going to die of it because it was infecting her lung transplant,\u201d she said. \u201cShe said to me: Sally, you\u2019ve worked on this for years, you must use my case [to raise awareness]. She was very brave.\u201d Doctors have urged people to play their part in fighting the rise of superbugs by only using antibiotics when prescribed them and then taking the full course. They also point to the large role that animal agriculture plays behind the scenes. The growing hunger for meat is increasing demand for livestock and use of antibiotics \u2013 some of which are used to treat animals that are not sick, sometimes as a substitute for keeping them in clean conditions, Davies said. \u201cThat drives the development of resistance,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich can then be on the meat when it\u2019s sold, and people pick it up that way. It can be passed to abattoir workers who go home to their families. And it definitely does get to farmworkers and their families.\u201d Most antibiotics are flushed out of an animal\u2019s body in its excretions, Davies said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got high-intensity farming, you\u2019re going to get antibiotics in the fields and in the runoff \u2026 That can get into the water table. But also, it turns out, wind coming along can pick up bacteria and bits of genes, take them up into the sky and clouds, and rain it down somewhere else.\u201d Antibiotic use in farm animals is correlated with antimicrobial resistance in humans, a study found last year. It found an \u201cextremely high\u201d E coli resistance of 73.3% to aminopenicillins, which are used in animals, but \u201cvery low\u201d resistance of 0.78% to glycylcyclines, which are banned in animal farming. For S aureus, the researchers found a resistance to the macrolides group of antibiotics of 56%, while resistance to vancomycin, a more recent antibiotic banned in animal farming, was just 0.22%. EU rules to encourage better farming practices have reduced the amounts of antibiotics given to animals, with little impact on the industry. In Denmark, a leading producer of pork, pigs consume one-fifth of the global average. In France, which is famous for its cheese, cows consume about one-quarter of the average. Alan Dangour, who leads the climate and health team at Wellcome, a nonprofit research organisation, said scientists discovering new treatments were in a race against the bugs. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that if we don\u2019t find another set of antibiotics or responses to bacterial infections, more and more people will be catching infections that are no longer responsive to the medicines we have,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s very dangerous. Imagine going back to a world before the invention of antibiotics, where people were dying left, right and centre from being cut \u2026 we don\u2019t want to go back to that world.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-21T17:18:19Z",
            "content": "John Prescott, the former British deputy prime minister and stalwart of the New Labour movement, has died aged 86. Keir Starmer has condemned Kemi Badenoch for breaking what he said had been a cross-party consensus on reducing carbon emissions. (See 11.27am.) Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, has told the Covid inquiry that England\u2019s hospitals were within \u201chours\u201d of running out of some items of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the early months of the pandemic. (See 5.08pm.) Steve Reed, the environment secretary, has promised to reform the food system to ensure farmers are paid fairly for the food they produce, after many filled the streets of Westminster to campaign against inheritance tax changes. School leaders have said they lack the resources to manage a rising tide of challenging behaviour since the Covid pandemic, after figures revealed a significant rise in the number of pupils being suspended and expelled in England. Nigel Farage\u2019s group campaigning against the World Health Organization (WHO) is staffed by consultants who work with the nicotine products industry, the Guardian can reveal. Elon Musk has said UK MPs \u201cwill be summoned to the United States of America to explain their censorship and threats to American citizens\u201d in a fresh escalation of tensions between the world\u2019s richest man and Labour. This is what PA Media has filed from the Covid inquiry hearing this afternoon. England\u2019s hospitals were within \u201chours\u201d of running out of some items of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the early months of Covid, Matt Hancock has said. The former health secretary told the Covid inquiry some PPE was in very short supply during the first wave of the pandemic. He also said he believes vaccines should be mandatory for NHS and social care staff in any future pandemic, while masks should be worn in hospitals from day one. Lead counsel to the inquiry, Jacqueline Carey KC, asked Hancock: \u201cDo you accept that entering the coronavirus pandemic as we did, without a single gown, severely hampered the ability to provide safe and appropriate PPE for healthcare workers?\u201d Hancock replied: \u201cThe stockpile that we had was not as good as it needs to be in the future, absolutely.\u201d Asked if England ever ran out of PPE, he said: \u201cAs a whole? No, but individual locations did. \u201cWe came extremely close. We came within small numbers of items on a regular basis during April and May 2020 \u2013 by the second wave, we were in better shape.\u201d Asked about no more stock of gowns in April 2020, he said: \u201cGowns I think at one point we got to within six or seven hours of running out. \u201cWe were working incredibly hard to make sure that we didn\u2019t (run out). We nearly did.\u201d On the question of whether facemasks should be worn by hospital staff, visitors and workers in a future pandemic, he said: \u201cIt should be brought in immediately, and supplies need to be ready, preferably in each hospital, to make that possible.\u201d Furthermore, Hancock said, ensuring health and social care workers are fully vaccinated is a \u201creasonable step that should be expected\u201d and should be brought in to the NHS and social care at the same time. Vaccination as a condition of deployment came into effect in November 2021 and required Care Quality Commission-registered care home staff to be fully vaccinated in order to be deployed in care homes unless medically exempt from April 2022. Hancock said he regretted that decision as social care and the NHS should have had the rule at the same time, adding: \u201cIf you are employed to care for others, then you should take reasonable steps to ensure you are not harming those in your care. \u201cA clinically proven vaccine is a reasonable step that should be expected.\u201d King Charles has paid tribute to John Prescott. It is unusual for the monarch to issue a statement after the death of a politician, and this is a sign quite what an impact Prescott made during his long career. The king said: I am deeply saddened to learn of the death of Lord Prescott. I remember with great fondness his unique and indomitable character, as well as his infectious sense of humour. My thoughts and greatest sympathy are with Lord Prescott\u2019s wife, family and loved ones at such a difficult time, and I am sure that very many people will recognise and greatly appreciate Lord Prescott\u2019s decades of public service in front line politics, not least as the United Kingdom\u2019s longest serving deputy prime minister. Here is our obituary of John Prescott by Stephen Bates. The ongoing row about the prospect of SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn \u201cdouble jobbing\u201d risks becoming a distraction for the party, first minister John Swinney has warned. Flynn has faced a furious backlash amongst MSPs after he announced that he was planning to stand for the Holyrood seat of Aberdeen South and North Kincardine, currently held by his SNP colleague Audrey Nicoll, in the 2026 Holyrood elections. Flynn also confirmed he would aim to hold his Westminster seat until the next general election, due in 2029, but would not accept two salaries. The SNP has previously been highly critical of previous Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross for holding seats in both parliaments, and Flynn\u2019s colleagues are privately angry at the implication that a Holyrood position does not amount to a full-time job, as well as what many see as the high-handed way he\u2019s attempting to oust a respected female colleague. Asked about the escalating conflict after FMQs, Swinney said that Flynn was a \u201cgreat star\u201d but added: What I want to make sure is that the SNP is in no way distracted by internal issues. It\u2019s been a mantra of mine that I want us to look outwards not inwards. At the last Scottish parliament election, the SNP\u2019s national executive committee made a ruling that any MP standing for Holyrood would have to resign their Westminster seat. The NEC has until next spring to decide its candidates\u2019 rules, so this row could go on and on. Neal Lawson, a prominent Labour activist, has been told that he won\u2019t be expelled from the party over a tweet that backed tactical voting. Lawson is director of Compass, a leftwing group that campaigns for more pluralism in progressive politics. He has been cleared by Labour after a 17-month investigation into something he retweeted in May 2021, from the Lib Dem MP Layla Moran urging people to vote Green in a council ward where the Lib Dems weren\u2019t standing. Moran said pointed out that she had only won her parliamentary seat in 2017 as a result of the Greens standing aside. In a comment Lawson described this as \u201cproper grown up progressive politics\u201d from both Moran and the Greens. But Labour launched an investigation on the basis that he may have broken rules saying members should not support rival parties. The decision to launch disciplinary action against Lawson was seen by many in the party as an example of excessive control freakery. Even Keir Starmer was said to be surprised by the move. Under Starmer many leftwing Corbynites have been ruthlessly thrown out of the party, or blocked from standing as candidates, but Lawson is not part of that faction. At the time Lawson wrote an article for the Guardian saying he hoped \u201cLabour\u2019s persecutors and witchfinders\u201d would fail and that \u201cpluralism, that ugly but powerful word, is the force that will shape anything that is progressive\u201d. Today, in a news release, Compass said Lawson has been told he did not break party rules. The organisation said: Compass has long argued for tactical voting, closer cooperation between progressive parties and for a voting system that better reflects the latent progressive majority in this country. At the last election, Labour showed it also recognised the importance of tactical campaigning by ruthlessly targeting its resources in seats it could win and actively discouraging campaigning elsewhere. Thus they were inviting voters to do exactly what Mr Lawson was advocating - supporting the best placed progressive to win. A Compass spokesperson said: We welcome this decision and hope Labour can begin to recognise what Compass has been arguing for years: that no single faction or party can navigate the chaos of the 21st century alone. Labour must be an open tribe if it has any chance of tackling the turbulent challenges of the 21st century - if it fails, the far right is waiting in the wings. Supporters of assisted dying should give up trying to get Kim Leadbeater\u2019s private member\u2019s bill through the Commons, and instead get the government to commission a proper review into how legislation should work, Ed Balls, the former Labour cabinet minister has suggested. Speaking on his Political Currency podcast, Balls said legislation this significant should be introduced by the government, following proper consultation. MPs are due to vote on the bill at second reading a week tomorrow. Increasingly it looks as if the Commons will vote against. Even if it passes, experts say it will never become law unless ministers allocate extra time for it \u2013 which so far they have declined to promise. Explaining his stance, Balls said: I would vote against this bill if I was in parliament now at the second reading, but not because I\u2019m opposed to action on assisted dying at all. But I don\u2019t think parliament can cross the massive threshold of conceding the principle that it is acceptable for doctors and the courts to cooperate in the taking of somebody\u2019s life \u2013 unless you are absolutely sure you know how it will work in practice, legally, and in terms of resources and in terms of the difficult cases. And I just don\u2019t feel that that\u2019s where we are. There isn\u2019t yet enough solidity, and the government has to kind of engage in this more. What should happen is after the opening speeches, there should be a statement in the house or publicly or from Downing Street to say \u2018We think Kim Leadbeater has done a brilliant job of raising this issue, we don\u2019t think yet we\u2019ve got to a place where we can see a way forward. What the government is now going to do is start some kind of review process.\u2019 Could be a Royal Commission, could be judge-led, it could be a small panel expert-led to report with a fixed date, next year. At that point, Kim Leadbeater says, \u2018Look, you know, I\u2019ve got as far as I can with this bill.\u2019 She withdraws, the bill drops, the private members bill. We have that process, and then we come back, if it can be made to work with government legislation next year. That is the best way, and I think it may be the only way. George Osborne, who co-hosts the podcast with Balls, said that he was now in favour of assisted dying, having been opposed in the past, but that he also did not think Leadbeater bill would become law. The government has indicated that its proposed new law \u201cto bring the feudal leasehold system to an end\u201d will take longer than expected. The last government proposed leasehold reform, but it was accused of watering down its original plans and, by the time the election was called, its leasehold and freehold reform bill had not cleared parliament. A very basic version was rushed through parliament just before the dissolution. In the king\u2019s speech the government promised to publish a new, more extensive draft leasehold and commonhold reform bill that would implement Law Commission reform proposals that had been dropped by the Tories. The government said it wanted \u201cto bring the feudal leasehold system to an end, reinvigorating commonhold through a comprehensive new legal framework and banning the sale of new leasehold flats so commonhold becomes the default tenure.\u201d But today, in a written ministerial statement, Matthew Pennycook, the housing minister said the draft bill is not expected to be published until the second half of 2025. He said the process was more complicated than expected because he had been told that the Tory act, which was pushed through parliament by Michael Gove, contained \u201ca small number of specific but serious flaws\u201d that would have to be fixed by primary legislation. Pennycook went on: These serious flaws include a loophole which mean the act goes far beyond the intended reforms to valuation and that undermines the integrity of the amended scheme. In addition we must correct an omission that would deny tens of thousands of shared ownership leaseholders the right to extend their lease with their direct landlord given that the providers in question do not have sufficiently long leases to grant 990-year extensions. This government will not make the same mistakes as the last when it comes to reforming what is, without question, an incredibly complicated area of property law. While we intend to continue to work at pace, we will take the time necessary to ensure the reforms we pass are fit for purpose. Pennycook also said a white paper on commonhold reform would be published early next year. In Birmingham, MP Jess Phillips and former West Midlands mayor Andy Street are among those who have gathered to pay tribute to the victims of the 1974 pub bombings in the city, on the 50th anniversary of the atrocity in which 21 were killed and 220 injured. Survivors and families of the victims have today renewed their calls for a public inquiry into why no one has been brought to justice for the attacks, with Street saying he \u201cdeeply regrets that the previous government didn\u2019t get to award it\u201d. He told the BBC: Twenty-one people lost their lives and we still to this day do not know exactly what happened and who the perpetrators were. One of the principles of British justice is that you should get to a closure. You might now not be able to hold those accountable for it but I do still feel that that needs to be done. Following a one-minute silence at the memorial service outside New Street station, Phillips read out the names of the deceased and the Duchess of Edinburgh read out a message on behalf of King Charles. The king\u2019s message said: My wife and I would like to take this opportunity to say that you and all those affected by this dreadful attack remain very much in our thoughts. What happened on this day 50 years ago was one of so many dreadful tragedies in a devastating period that touched us all, many of us very personally. I must also express my sincere admiration for the people of Birmingham who have lived so courageously with the grief of that day and the days that followed. Asked about racial disparities in Covid deaths, Hancock told the inquiry that this was an issue he was alert to because he had already taken an interest in institutional racism in the NHS. But he also said some the \u201chard left stuff\u201d put out by NHS bodies to address this were not the right way forward. During evidence this morning Hancock was challenged when he claimed that the NHS was not overwhelmed during the pandemic. Jacqueline Carey KC , counsel for the inquiry, put it to Hancock: The fact that the nurses are being stretched to the ratios that we\u2019ve looked at and the potential adverse consequences for those who are in ICU does not in fact demonstrate the NHS was, in fact, overwhelmed. And Hancock replied: No, because people could get treatment. The treatment was not as good as in the same way that the waiting times for a knee operation was not as good as pre-pandemic. I\u2019m not saying that the NHS was perfect in the pandemic, and I\u2019m not saying that it wasn\u2019t severely pressured in many areas and that that pressure had consequences. The point of saying that it would be overwhelmed is that the system as a whole, withstood the pressure. As Martin Bagot reports in a story for the Mirror, Carey pushed back at this point, saying that if people were not getting the treatment they would normally get, they would think the system was overwhelmed. Bagot says the exchanges got testy, and that some relatives of people who died who were attending the hearing seemed to get distressed by what they were hearing. Hancock tells the inquiry that some hospitals refused to test their staff for Covid because they did not want to lose too many people off sick. He says that is an example of a \u201ccultural problem in the NHS\u201d in that not enough is done to tackle \u201cnosocomial infection\u201d (infection picked up during a medical procedure). Back at the Covid inquiry, Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, is being asked about PPE. He has just said that at one point the country was \u201cwithin six or seven hours\u201d of running out of gowns. Hancock was being asked about this chart, showing how long stocks of various types of PPE were expected to last before they ran out. Earlier in his evidence this afternoon Hancock said that, although individual hospitals may have run out of PPE, the country as a whole never ran out. Jacqueline Carey KC, counsel for the inquiry, put it to him that that was not any consolation to health staff who went without PPE. The flag at the Guildhall in Hull is flying at half-mast to mark the death of John Prescott, who was an MP for the city for 40 years. The city council has posted this on social media. Tributes from the council are here. And there is a good round-up of tributes to Prescott on the LabourList website too. David Lammy\u2019s announcement of sanctions against kleptocrats (see 1.19pm) came as crown dependencies and overseas territories (OTs) wrapped up a joint ministerial council in London at which resistance to the decade-old UK demand to set up public registers of beneficial ownership was once again raised. Public registers, by ending the secrecy surrounding the transfer of assets to tax havens, make it easier for campaigners to expose money laundering, as well as deter it taking place in the first place. The last missed deadline was for the end of 2023. The key OTs have found a series of reasons not to implement the measure including citing a 2022 European Court of Justice ruling saying the registers breach European privacy laws. None of the OTs are inside the EU but they argue they cannot afford to have stricter declaration laws than other countries or else funds will leave their jurisdiction.. As prime minister ahead of the G8 in Northern Ireland in 2016 David Cameron first set out the UK goal of setting up registers, but a succession of deadlines have been allowed to be missed with no action taken by the government to impose registers. The lack of the registers, as well as the presence in London of money laundering enablers, is the Achilles heel of the UK\u2019s efforts to become an international leader in the fight against corruption. Stephen Doughty the Foreign Office minister, has written to the OTs setting out his expectation that the registers will be set up, and has visited some of the territories to seek their cooperation. A spokesperson for the Cayman Islands government said it was continuing to work towards an \u201cenhanced beneficial ownership framework\u201d by the end of 2024,. A cross-party coalition of 40 MPs in a letter earlier this week called for ugent action against the overseas territories. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, claimed he was bringing the golden age of money laundering to an end when he announced sanctions against three high-profile kleptocrats and their key enablers. Lammy said the tide was being turned on corruption after a long period when the previous government allowed the role of London as a money laundering capital to continue. When Labour was in opposition Lammy stressed how much damage Britain\u2019s role in laundering corrupt money was causing the country\u2019s reputation in the global south, as well as the damage done to the international financial system,. The three main designations announced today cover: Dmitry Firtash who is known to have extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from Ukraine, hiding millions in the UK property market; Isabel Dos Santos, the daughter of Angola\u2019s former president who is accused abused her positions at state-run companies to embezzle at least \u00a3350m; and Aivars Lembergs, one of Latvia\u2019s richest people, who abused his political position to commit bribery and launder money. Firtash has already been sanctioned in other jurisdictions. The UK also sanctioned his wife, Lada Firtash, who has profited from his corruption and holds UK assets on his behalf, including the site of the old Brompton Road tube station, as well as Denis Gorbunenko, a UK-based financial \u2018fixer\u2019 who enabled and facilitated Firtash\u2019s corruption. Dos Santos was once dubbed \u2018Africa\u2019s richest woman\u2019. She has been subject to an Interpol Red Notice since November 2022 and just last month lost a case at the court of appeal regarding her worldwide asset freeze. The UK also said it was sanctioning her business partner Paula Oliveira, and her chief financial officer Sarju Raikundalia. The Foreign Office said both had helped Dos Santos funnel Angola\u2019s national wealth for her own benefit. It is not known how many assets they still have in the UK. Lammy said: These unscrupulous individuals selfishly deprive their fellow citizens of much-needed funding for education, healthcare and infrastructure - for their own enrichment. I committed to taking on kleptocrats and the dirty money that empowers them when I became Foreign Secretary and these sanctions mark the first step in delivering this ambition. The tide is turning. The golden age of money laundering is over. At FMQs today the Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay attacked John Swinney over today\u2019s Audit Scotland report which was damning in its criticism of the Scottish government\u2019s lack of long-term strategy over public finances. The report also criticised the SNP\u2019s short-term fixes, lack of transparency and warned that fundamental changes were needed to keep public services affordable. Swinney insisted that financial constraints on his budget were the result of UK Tory austerity, trotting out his favourite jibe about Findlay\u2019s future previous support for Liz Truss, and said next month\u2019s budget would involve \u201can honest conversation with the people of Scotland\u201d. Meanwhile the Scottish Greens\u2019 co-leader Lorna Slater pressed Swinney on whether the budget would introduce a public health levy on alcohol and tobacco, as health campaigners lobby his government to introduce one. Swinney said he couldn\u2019t pre-empt budget decisions, arguing the finance secretary was facing pressure from all sides with a budget under severe constraints thanks to inflation and hefty public sector pay deals. Downing Street has described unconfirmed reports that Russia may have fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into Ukraine as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. Asked about this at the morning lobby briefing, the PM\u2019s spokesperson said: As you will understand it is a rapidly developing situation and I don\u2019t want to get ahead of our intelligence services who are looking at these reports urgently, but if true, clearly this would be another example of grave, reckless and escalatory behaviour from Russia and only serves to strengthen our resolve. Martin Belam had more coverage of this story on today\u2019s Ukraine war live blog Keir Starmer has defended the government\u2019s decision to register 470 delegates to attend the Cop29 climate conference in Baku in Azerbaijan. During his Commons statement he was asked about the large number of people attending by the independent MP Shockat Adam who asked if the cost was justified, particularly given the cut to winter fuel payments. Starmer said the British contingent was small than it was at last year\u2019s Cop, and that there was \u201ca lot of negotiation\u201d to be carried out there. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely vital that we\u2019re doing that important work,\u201d he said. John Healey, the defence secretary, has been giving evidence to the Commons defence committee this morning. But he wouldn\u2019t confirm that Ukraine has started firing Storm Shadow missiles provided by Britain at Russia. Asked to confirm these reports, Healey said: I won\u2019t be drawn on the operational details of the conflict. It risks both operational security and in the end the only one that benefits from such a public debate is President Putin. Healey also said this was a \u201cserious moment\u201d for Ukraine and he said battle lines were now \u201cless stable than at any time since the early days of the full scale Russian invasion\u201d. UPDATE: Healey said: This is a serious moment that I come before the committee. Defence intelligence will reveal today that the front line is now less stable than at any time since the early days of the full scale Russian invasion in 2022. We have seen in recent weeks a very clear escalation from Putin and his forces. They have stepped up attacks on the energy system in Ukraine ahead of winter, they have stepped up attacks on civilian centres killing children, they have deployed at least 10,000 North Korean troops to the battle front line. And there are unconfirmed but media reports today of Russia firing a new ballistic missile into Ukraine which we know they have been preparing for months. While the Ukrainian actions on the battlefield speak for themselves, be in no doubt that UK government is stepping up our support for Ukraine, determined to continue doubling down our support for Ukraine. The Guardian columnist Martin Kettle has sent me this anecdote, which he describes as his favourite memory of the late John Prescott. Martin says: I was at a Labour conference in Blackpool in the 90s and I bumped into him back stage in the press room and he said: \u201cIs your fella Steve Bell here?\u201d I said, yes, Steve was. \u201cWell can you introduce me? He always draws me as Tony\u2019s dog, and I\u2019m not a fuckin\u2019 dog.\u201d Steve was sitting quite nearby, so I nervously made the introductions as the two big guys met up. Within a few seconds, Prescott\u2019s threatening manner vanished and he and Steve were in stitches about some joke or other. Then, as Prescott was leaving he turned and squared up to Steve and said. \u201cNo dogs, OK?\u201d Of course it made absolutely no difference whatever, and Steve kept on drawing him as a dog. Matt Hancock has told how he \u201cruffled some feathers\u201d protecting the NHS from political \u201cinterference\u201d during the Covid pandemic, PA Media reports. Giving evidence to the Covid inquiry, the former health secretary said part of his role was to \u201cshield\u201d the NHS from \u201cpeople being difficult in Number 10\u201d. He said: Within the running of the NHS, we were protected in a way because of the independence of the NHS. And therefore the people being difficult for Number 10, part of my job was to provide a shield from that. And I know that I ruffled some feathers in doing so, but my job was, ironically, also to protect the NHS from some of that. Hancock told the inquiry that interference from Number 10 caused \u201cincredible difficulties\u201d with regards to testing people for Covid. Hancock is giving evidence as part of the inquiry\u2019s third module investigation, focusing on the impact of the pandemic on the NHS. As PA reports, Hancock was asked by inquiry counsel Jacqueline Carey about his witness statements which suggested \u201cinappropriate political interference from Number 10\u201d, and whether that interference applied to the scope of these hearings. He replied: Well, of course some of it did. For instance, the biggest interference that caused difficulties was within testing, where some of the political appointees in Number 10 caused incredible difficulties. Hancock was almost certainly referring to Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser at the times. Earlier hearings have proviced copious evidence showing that relations between Hancock and Cummings were dire. Earlier today Hancock also claimed that former first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, caused \u201call sorts of difficulties\u201d as the pandemic unfolded. (See 10.26am.) Keir Starmer said that he condemned the jailing of 45 pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong by the Chinese authorities during his statement in the Commons. He was challenged to use the word condemn after Conservative MPs suggested that he was reluctant to sound too critical of China on this issue. In her response to Starmer\u2019s opening statement, Kemi Badenoch said that the activists were sentenced the day after Starmer held talks with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, at the G20 summit. She said she had not heard him condemn the sentences at the time, and she challenged him so do so \u201cunequivocally\u201d. In response, Starmer said \u201cMinister West\u201d (Catherine West, the minister for the Indo-Pacific\u201d made a statement on this and he said he was happy \u201cto repeat and affirm her position\u201d. Later Iain Duncan-Smith, one of the most China-criticial Tories and a former party leader, asked Starmer to be more explicit. Starmer replied: I said I condemned it a moment ago, and I\u2019m happy to say so. I just did and I will say it again. It is important that where we have these significant differences, particularly on issues of human rights, that we have frank, open discussions about them and that is why these matters have been raised repeatedly. Here are two more tribute to John Prescott. From the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock John Prescott was an intriguing mixture of ferocity and charm who attracted affection, respect and, sometimes, outrage. He was truly a political innovator in policies ranging from integrated transport to combating climate change and regional democratic and economic development to European co-operation. Vitally, he was also a very practical MP and minister who continually sought the best way to \u2018get things done\u2019 whether that meant bringing divergent people together or insisting on details of implementation. This central invaluable quality made him an essential figure in 10 years as deputy prime minister. From John Major, the former Conservative prime minister [Prescott] was an essential part of Labour\u2019s electoral success in the 1990s and \u2013 as deputy prime minister \u2013 continued to say what he thought in unmistakable terms. He never lost sight of the causes that first motivated him into politics, and remained a passionate advocate for all he believed \u2013 even if that meant the odd tussle with colleagues along the way. Although a political opponent, I much admired him as a man who never betrayed his core instincts. He was, in essence, a deep down genuine politician. The public saw that \u2013 and respected him for it. In his response to Kemi Badenoch in the Commons (see 11.27am), Keir Starmer also criticised her suggestion that he should not have attended the G20 in Brazil. Badenoch did not quite say he should have stayed at home, but she said being at the G20 was probably \u201ca lot easier\u201d than being in London when '\u201chard-working farmers were protesting outside the Downing Street gates at his cruel family farm tax\u201d. Referring to her comments, Starmer said: [Badenoch] references me being in Rio when the farmers were protested. G20 is the leading economies of the world, getting together to discuss questions of common issues on the economy and on security. If her implication is that the UK should not be there at leader level, that we should join Putin in avoiding that meeting, if that\u2019s the position of her party, then she should say so. Keir Starmer\u2019s statement to MPs about the G20 and Cop29 summits largely summarised announcments made while he was at those events. Kemi Badenoch, the new Conservative leader, responded. Normally exchanges like this are relatively tame, because the main parties often broadly agree on foreign policy issues, but Badenoch was very critical of Starmer\u2019s foreign policy positions, particularly on climate, and Starmer condemned her for breaking what had been a cross-party consensus on reducing emissions. Referring to Cop29, Badenoch said: Cop has not yet concluded, so we do not know what the final impact on the UK will be. But we do know the prime minister\u2019s rush to a further cut in our emissions [a reference to this announcement] is yet another example of politicians putting short term publicity above long term planning. When will he publish the plans to achieve this new target? Where this government does the right thing, we will back it. Yet, where it puts politics before people and press releases before practicality, we will hold them to account. It is time for politicians to tell the truth, and it is time the prime minister provided some substance to back this costly rhetoric. Badenoch pointed out that, by attending the G20 summit in Brazil, Starmer was out of London for the farmers\u2019 protests. And she ended: The prime minister\u2019s foreign policy is a pick and mix of empty platitudes, unilateral commitments that he could have announced at home, and dangerous precedents \u2013 rushing to give away the Chagos islands and paying for the privilege, an ill-judged suspension of export licences to Israel, damaging our defence and security industry and failing to set out a roadmap for spending 2.5% GDP on defence in a world that is becoming yet more dangerous. I hope the prime minister is up to the very real and serious challenges posed to our security and prosperity. In response, Starmer said that Badenoch\u2019s decision to abandon the cross-party consensus on reducing carbon emissions and the drive to net zero \u201cshows just how far the party opposite has fallen\u201d. He said: On Cop \u2026 I have to say, it is a shame that what used to be a cross-party issue not so many years ago \u2026 when Cop was in Scotland, there was a real unity across the house about the importance of tackling one of those central issues of our time. I think the fact that she has now taken the position she has of attacking the very idea of setting targets shows just how far the party opposite has fallen. On an issue like this, I was proud that under some of her predecessors we had that unity. It\u2019s a shame it\u2019s now been lost because of the position adopted by the opposition. Badenoch describes herself as a \u201cnet zero sceptic\u201d and in a recent interview she suggested that an adaption strategy might be a better solution to the climate crisis than just focusing on cutting carbon emissions. The former health secretary is answering questions on the NHS response to the pandemic Keir Starmer is in the Commons where he has made a statement to MPs on the two summits he has attended recently, the G20 and Cop29. But he started with a tribute to John Prescott, calling him \u201ca true giant of the Labour movement\u201d. He went on: John achieved that rare thing \u2013 he changed people\u2019s lives, and he set the path for us all to follow \u2026 He did it all in his own way, with humour, with pride, passion and total conviction. He truly was a one off. Starmer also said that there would be full tributes to Prescott in the Commons on another occasion. Steve Reed, the environment secretary, has announced a plan which he said would make farming more profitable. In his first speech since the thousands of farmers held a mass rally in Westminster on Tuesday to protest about the government\u2019s plans to extend inheritance tax to farms, he announced a new, farmer-led 25-year roadmap for the sector. He also said that, instead of reversing the inheritance tax changes in the budget, he would make changes to the supply chain to ensure farmers get a fair price for their produce. Recent research has shown that farmers get about 1p from the price of a block of cheese or a loaf of bread in the supermarket, and farmers make about a 0.5% return on their investments. Speaking at the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) conference, Reed said: I\u2019m not prepared to let so many farmers keep working so hard for so little. We need to work together to agree what we want British farming to look like in 25 years time. That means a plan to transition farming to new models that are more environmentally but also more financially sustainable for the long term. We will do this by developing a 25-year farming roadmap. This will be the most forward looking plan for farming in our country\u2019s history, with a focus on making farming and food production more profitable in the decades to come. It will not tell farmers what to do. It will be farmer led so they can tell the government what they need to make the success of this vital transition. Referring to the inheritance tax row, Reed went on: One of the things farmers were telling me last Tuesday is how little profit they make. How little money for all the hard work they put into producing the food for the rest of us to enjoy. The answer to that isn\u2019t to tell farmers they\u2019re not in it for the money, as I\u2019ve heard just last week. The answer is to make farming more profitable. The government will do precisely that. We will make the supply chain fairer so food producers and growers are not forced to accept unfair contracts. Reed concluded: I heard the anguish of the countryside on the streets of London earlier this week. We may not agree over the inheritance tax changes, but this government is determined to listen to rural Britain and end its long decline. The CLA conference is the where Reed told farmers last year, when he as shadow environment secretary, that Labour was not going to extend inheritance tax to farms. Victoria Vyvyan, president of the CLA, has accused the government of \u201ctaxing us out of existence\u201d and \u201cembroiling\u201d rural people in a \u201cstupid row about numbers\u201d. Today, addressing Reed before he gave his speech, she said: Secretary of state, you need to act. Last year, I asked you, were you to be elected, could we in this room count on you to go into bat for us at cabinet? And you said yes, and that\u2019s what I want to see from you. This isn\u2019t about party politics. It\u2019s not about personal party alignment. This is about the fact that you are the one who\u2019s sitting there at the cabinet, representing us, and you have to forget any differences that we might have, and you have to remember that you are our voice at the heart of government. Jacqueline Carey KC, lead counsel for the inquiry, asks about a minute of a meeting he had with health ministers from the devolved governments. She shows an extract on screen. The minutes refer to Jeane Freeman (JF), health minister in the Scottish government, asking for a reset in the relationship between the English and Scottish administrations. Carey asks if that related to anything related to the theme of module 3 \u2013 the impact of Covid on the NHS. Hancock says that was a reference to Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, \u201ccausing all sorts of difficulties\u201d. He says that is not relevant to this module. Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, has now started his evidence to the Covid inquiry. Asked if he thought the \u201cStay at home, protect the NHS, save lives\u201d messaging struck the right balance, Hancock says he thinks it did. Q: Do you think everything possible was done to keep healthcare workers safe? Hancock says: It was obviously extremely difficult to keep healthcare workers as safe as possible, because effectively the wards of the NHS became the front line in this deadly battle. Q: Do you think visiting restrictions, and restrictions on people being with loved ones when they were dying, were too strict? Hancock says: We were balancing incredibly difficult considerations on both sides. I think, on balance, we got those broadly right across the pandemic. But I entirely understand and feel very, very strong arguments on both sides. But Hancock says he thinks the guidance for funerals was applied in a stricter way than had been intended. Q: Do you accept that going into the pandemic with a low number of intensive care beds and high bed occupancy put the system under more strain? Of course, says Hancock. Q: Do you think now that the decision to suspend all non urgent elective care was the right one? Yes, says Hancock. We are inviting readers to share their memories of John Prescott. You can do so via this page. We will carry on reporting tributes to John Prescott as the day goes on, but there is other news happening today too and soon I will switch to the Covid inquiry, where Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, is giving evidence from 10am. He has already given evidence to the inquiry before, but the inquiry is now on module 3, focusing in particular on the impact of the pandemic on the NHS, and Hancock will be talking about that. We have also got John Healey, the defence secretary, giving evidence to the Commons defence committee from 10.30am this morning. Peter Mandelson was one of many people in the Labour party who feuded with John Prescott at various times when they were in government, and at one memorable photocall in the summer of 1997 Prescott compared him to a crab. Today, speaking on Sky News, Mandelson played down the extend of their disagreements, and pointed out that Prescott had supported his application to become Labour\u2019s communications director in 1985 \u2013 the job that turned out to be the launchpad for Mandelson\u2019s career. Mandelson said it was wrong to say Prescott was not New Labour. Some people say sometimes that he wasn\u2019t New Labour. But that\u2019s not true. He was New Labour. He was one very essential part of New Labour. He basically kept us anchored in our working class roots, our trade union history. And he was the bridge, essentially, between that and the modernisers in the Labour party, Tony, Gordon, me and the others. And he always wanted that project to work. It\u2019s not as if he was standing outside it and peering in. He was on the inside and making it work. He was, in many respects, the cement that kept New Labour together. Asked what he was like to work with, Mandelson replied: He was absolutely impossible. When I say he was sort of courageous, he was. When I say he was loyal, he was. When I say he was determined, he was. He was always determined to get his own way on any particular issue at any given moment. Right up until the point he\u2019d say, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll do this for you. You do this for me. As long as you cover this off I\u2019ll happily go along with it.\u2019 So he was a negotiator. He was a trade union negotiator. He was a broker. But at the end of the day he wanted it to work and the way in which he made it work was by being incredibly difficult for days on end and then finally sealing it, making work, agreeing it and off we went. Mandelson also recalled a surprise conversation earlier this year he had with Prescott. I was at home on a Sunday morning and the phone went and then suddenly I put it on and it was the face of John Prescott on my phone FaceTiming me from Hull. I mean, no advanced warning. No how do you do. It was, \u2018Hello, is that you?\u2019 \u2018Yes John it is me. What do you want?\u2019 He said \u2018I just want to say that I know it was difficult and we were bloody awful to you at times and I was, but actually you did good and I want to forgive you.\u2019 What am I being forgiven for here? It was just, \u2018I want to forgive you because you did good. And I know it wasn\u2019t easy at times and I know it was rough and I know I didn\u2019t help but now I understand.\u2019 And I said, \u2018John that\u2019s very kind of you. How do you suddenly understand this?\u2019 He said, \u2018Oh well somebody gave me this book of yours. I didn\u2019t read it before. It looked very boring. But I\u2019ve looked at it, I\u2019ve dipped into it and I\u2019ve seen what you went through \u2026 I feel rather sorry for you actually. And anyway, thanks very much.\u2019 It was a few minutes more \u2026 but that was it. That was the last time I spoke to him. Here are more tributes to John Prescott from Labour figures on social media. From Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s communications director in No 10 JP RIP \u2026 there was nobody else like him. Tony could not have had a better deputy. Labour could not have had a better campaigner. The government could not have had a better negotiator and - yes, often, peacemaker. Hull could not have had a better MP. Of course he was combative but he had an enormous heart and a great capacity for friendship. Even with his horrible illness in later years, the old JP was always there. Love to Pauline, Jonathan and David and nothing but fond memories of a total one off who will be missed by so many. From Yvette Cooper, the home secretary Such sad news about John Prescott. A campaigning Labour hero &amp; a remarkable minister who transformed lives - upgrading millions of council homes, coalfield regeneration, tackling climate change. Fierce &amp; warm hearted - there was no one like him. Thinking of Pauline &amp; family today From Ed Balls, the former adviser to Gordon Brown and later secretary of state for children From Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader I am really sad to hear that John Prescott has passed away. John was a huge figure and personality, from his seafaring union days to the highest offices in Government. I will be forever grateful for his personal and political support in the 2017 and 2019 elections. His endless warmth and iconic wit were loved on the campaign trail. My deepest sympathies to John\u2019s family at their loss. He will be greatly missed. From Hilary Benn, the Northern Ireland secretary 1/2 John Prescott was a political giant who made a unique contribution to the Labour and trade union movement he loved so deeply. Authentic, funny, tough, highly skilled and, at times, unpredictable, he often used the phrase \u201ctraditional Labour values in a modern setting\u201d. 2/2 In doing so, he would reassure and inspire Party members with whom he had a great bond. He will be much missed. All our thoughts are with Pauline and his family on this very sad day. From David Lammy, foreign secretary John Prescott was one of the giants of our party. Committed, loyal, Labour to his core. A relentless champion of working people who never forgot who he came into politics to fight for. Full of good humour and blunt common sense. Rest in peace Angela Rayner is often compared to John Prescott. They were both brought up working class, became Labour MPs after working in the trade union movement and have been frequently patronised or demonised by Tories and the media, partly on the grounds of class snobbery. And both ended up deputy PM. Here is her tribute to Prescott. Through his half a century of public service and a decade as deputy prime minister, John Prescott was driven by his Labour values to serve working people. Fiercely proud of his working class and trade union roots, he never lost sight of who he came into politics to serve. He used the chance he was given to change the lives of millions of working people. A giant of the labour movement and loyal friend, he will be remembered with huge fondness by all those who knew him. John was not only a Labour legend but an inspiration to me, and always so generous with his time and support. We will miss him greatly. Our thoughts and prayers are with Pauline, David, Johnathan and the rest of the family. Here is the full statement from John Prescott\u2019s family announcing his death. Prescott was living with Alzheimer\u2019s in his final years and his family have asked wellwishers minded to send flowers to donate to Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK instead. They say: We are deeply saddened to inform you that our beloved husband, father and grandfather, John Prescott, passed away peacefully yesterday at the age of 86. He did so surrounded by the love of his family and the jazz music of Marian Montgomery. John spent his life trying to improve the lives of others, fighting for social justice and protecting the environment, doing so from his time as a waiter on the cruise liners to becoming Britain\u2019s longest serving deputy prime minister. John dearly loved his home of Hull and representing its people in parliament for 40 years was his greatest honour. We would like to thank the amazing NHS doctors and nurses who cared for him after his stroke in 2019 and the dedicated staff at the care home where he passed away after latterly living with Alzheimer\u2019s. In lieu of flowers and if you wish to do so, you can donate to Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK. As you can imagine, our family needs to process our grief so we respectfully request time and space to mourn in private. Thank you. Here is a John Prescott picture gallery. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Caroline Davies. The former prime minister Gordon Brown has just been on the Today programme paying tribute to John Prescott. He said: John was a friend of mine, he was a colleague, but when you think of him, he was a colossus, he was a titan of the Labour movement. John Lennon talked about working class hero. It\u2019s difficult to fit that term, but I think John would like that. You\u2019ve got to look at his achievements. He was probably the first government minister to see the importance of the environment. Kyoto, that environmental treaty in 1997, you\u2019ve got to attribute that to John\u2019s hard work with Al Gore. Then he saw the importance, and he was a pioneer of regional policy. So the fact we have devolution and mayors owes a great deal to what John was thinking right throughout the 1980s and 90s when I was working with him. And then we mustn\u2019t forget that one of the great achievements of John as environment secretary was the repair and improvement of housing, 1.5m houses which would not have been repaired without John\u2019s determination that the social housing stock had to be remodernised. So you\u2019ve got to look at the practical achievements of someone who possibly surprised himself by the way that he managed to become deputy prime minister, but actually made a huge difference. Yorkshire has \u201clost one of its great political heavyweights,\u201d said Tracy Brabin, mayor for West Yorkshire. In a post on X she said: Deeply sad news to hear of John Prescott\u2019s passing. Yorkshire has lost one of its great political heavyweights. A true Northerner with unwavering authenticity. John\u2019s record speaks for itself: tackling regional inequalities, fighting for social justice and protecting the environment. We must all now build on his legacy and work tirelessly, as he did, to create a country that works for all. Lord Prescott\u2019s wife and two sons said he had been in a care home recently living with Alzheimer\u2019s. Hilary Evans-Newton, chief executive at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said: It\u2019s heartbreaking to hear that former deputy prime minister, Lord John Prescott, one of the most prominent political figures of our generation, has died with Alzheimer\u2019s. Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones during this difficult time. It\u2019s tragic how many lives are being lost to dementia, the leading cause of death in the UK. We\u2019re incredibly moved by Lord Prescott\u2019s family, who have asked for donations to Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, in lieu of flowers. As the UK\u2019s leading dementia research charity, we\u2019re accelerating progress towards a cure, so no one\u2019s life has to end this way. London mayor Sadiq Khan said Lord Prescott was a \u201ctrue giant\u201d of the Labour movement. Khan wrote on X: Sad to hear the news about John Prescott. A lovely man, proud trade unionist, brilliant campaigner and someone who committed his whole life to helping others. The last Labour Government simply couldn\u2019t have achieved all it did without him. A true giant of the Labour movement. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: I am deeply saddened by the news of John Prescott passing away and my thoughts and prayers are with his friends and family. John Prescott will be remembered as a towering figure in British politics and his unwavering tenacity on the causes he championed should be a lesson to us all. His influence on our modern society will still be felt for years to come and his legacy remembered far into the future. Recalling the moment John Prescott punched a protester who threw an egg at him in 2001, Tony Blair told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that he answered \u201cwell, John is John\u201d at a subsequent press conference. Someone smashed an egg on his head, and he turned up, and he turned around, and he punched the guy and laid him out. This caused a huge sort of fracas, obviously... We had to give a press conference in the election campaign the next day, and some people were saying, well, look, he\u2019s deputy prime minister - you know, you can\u2019t have a deputy prime minister thumping a voter. And then there were other people who said, yeah, but you know... he had this egg slammed in his head, and he turned around and whacked the guy, and a lot of people think, well, fair enough. A long debate ensued, Blair said, adding: \u201cFinally, at the press conference, when I was asked about that, I just said, well, John, is John. And so was that supposed to be an answer? I said, Yeah, that\u2019s an answer, that\u2019s as much as you can say.\u201d Ed Miliband, the energy secretary and former Labour leader said Lord Prescott was a \u201ctitan of the Labour movement\u201d. Miliband wrote on X: I am deeply saddened to hear of the death of John Prescott. He was a titan of the Labour movement, a unique and irreplaceable fighter for justice. He fought for social and economic equality all his life, championed the cause of the environment and showed how politics could change lives for the better. John represented the best of Labour values and I will always be grateful for the support he provided to me as Labour leader. I extend my deepest condolences to Pauline, Jonathan and David. Former Conservative Party leader Lord Hague said Lord Prescott was a \u201cformidable debater\u201d. Posting on X, Hague said: John Prescott was one of the great figures of our political era\u2014passionate, loyal, and full of life. I will never forget our many lively exchanges across the despatch box. John was a formidable debater, unflinching in his commitment to his values, and he had a unique ability to speak directly to the concerns of the people he represented. It was a point of pride for both of us that we hailed from Rotherham; although it shaped us in different ways, we shared a certain bluntness in our exchanges\u2014though in true Yorkshire fashion, John usually got straight to the point faster than I did! John\u2019s legacy as a voice for working people and a relentless advocate for Labour will endure. My thoughts are with his family and loved ones at this very sad time. Sir Tony Blair\u2019s tribute continued: I relied on him many times: when in difficulty, under attack; and less well known when I needed someone whose gut instinct I trusted better than my own. To say we were partners would never capture the nature of our relationship. There was nothing formal about it. We met and talked regularly. Rules of protocol were cast aside. Debates were had which could be fierce. But once concluded, the common line was kept. The truth is for all the difficulties and the differences and the jokes about us both and our \u2018odd couple relationship\u2019, we had developed a genuine admiration, respect and affection for each other. Underneath what could be a fierce exterior, and a manner some undoubtedly found intimidating, beat a loving, kind and compassionate human heart. John was as good a friend as you could ever hope to have, with a deep sensitivity, even vulnerability. He will deservedly occupy a special place in the pantheon of the Labour leadership; he will be mourned by his many friends and fans around the world and for me personally, today is a day of profound sadness but also immense pride in having known him and worked with him: a great man and great servant of country and party. Labour former prime minister Sir Tony Blair said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the death of Lord Prescott, and described his deputy as \u201cone of the most talented people I ever encountered in politics\u201d. Blair said: Although we all knew that the end was approaching and was inevitable, I am devastated by John\u2019s passing. He was one of the most talented people I ever encountered in politics; one of the most committed and loyal; and definitely the most unusual. There was nothing about John which fitted conventional wisdom. He was from proud traditional working class stock yet understood instinctively and completely the aspirations of that class and their desire to better themselves. He was liberal and tolerant, yet instantly intolerant of any overly liberal middle class dismissal of the misery suffered by poor inner city communities from crime and drug abuse. He could talk in the bluntest and sometimes bluest language, but it concealed a first rate intellect which meant he thought as deeply about issues as much as he cared about them. It is no exaggeration to say the Labour Party could never have won three consecutive full terms without John. He was a commanding presence. He represented the wing of the party which was not New Labour, but he did it in a way which never reduced the effectiveness of our appeal and indeed extended it, broadening the base of our support. He had extraordinary accomplishments: he revived many of Britain\u2019s inner cities, was responsible for the refurbishment of thousands of council homes, the revival of British shipping, completed the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, established the Coalfield Communities Trust to breathe life back into villages and towns affected by the closure of mines; and was Britain\u2019s lead negotiator for the Kyoto climate treaty, the world\u2019s first attempt to agree a global response to climate change. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, the BBC\u2019s political editor Chris Mason described John Prescott as a piece of \u201cblunt grit\u201d among the \u201cslick middle class polish of New Labour.\u201d He told listeners Prescott was \u201cproudly working class, proud of his trade union background, and proud to bind his party\u2019s past with its present.\u201d Mason quoted former prime minister Tony Blair in his memoirs, recalling of Prescott that \u201che could be maddening, he could be dangerous, he could be absurd, he could be magnificent, [but] never dull, placid, uneventful, forgettable.\u201d Jon Trickett, the MP for Normanton and Hemsworth, wrote on X a short while ago: John Prescott was a Labour giant. I knew him well. V sad to hear of his passing. Mining communities owe him a debt for settling the enormous claim for industrial injuries. In my constit over 10000 families received compensation which amounted to \u00a3100m plus Thank you my mate. Here is Keir Starmer\u2019s tribute on X in full: He wrote: \u201cI am deeply saddened to hear of the death of John Prescott. John was a true giant of the Labour movement. He was a staunch defender of working people and a proud trade unionist. During a decade as deputhy Prime Minister, he was one of the key architects of a Labour Government that transformed the lives of millions of people across the nation. So much of John\u2019s work set the path for those of us fortunate enough to follow. From leading climate negotiations to fighting regional inequality, his legacy will live on well beyond his lifetime. Across the Labour Party and the union movement he will be remembered for his conviction, courage and strength of character. His passion , force of personality and pride in his working-class roots was key to his authenticity \u2013 an honesty that was recognised and respected across the political divide and across the nation. On behalf of the Labour Party, I send my condolences to Pauline and all his family, to the city of Hull which he served as MP for forty years, and to all those who knew and loved him. May he rest in peace. British prime minister Keir Starmer says he is \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d to hear that Prescott has died, and called him a \u201ctrue giant of Labour\u201d. In a statement on X, he said, \u201cI am deeply saddened to hear of the death of John Prescott. John was a true giant of the Labour movement. On behalf of the Labour Party, I send my condolences to Pauline and his family, to the city of Hull, and to all those who knew and loved him. May he rest in peace.\u201d Former US vice-president Al Gore, who worked with John Prescott on the Kyoto protocol climate change agreement in 1997, said he had \u201cnever worked with anyone in politics \u2013 on my side of the pond or his \u2013 quite like John Prescott\u201d. Gore said in a statement: He possessed an inherent ability to connect with people about the issues that mattered to them \u2013 a talent that others spend years studying and cultivating, but that was second nature to him. He fought like hell to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol and was an unwavering champion of climate action for decades to come. I\u2019m forever grateful to John for that commitment to solving the climate crisis and will miss him as a dear friend.\u201d Maria Eagle, the Labour MP for Liverpool Garston, described John Prescott as a great Labour deputy leader. She recalled his work for the relatives of those who lost their lives in the sinking of the MV Derbyshire in 1980. In a post on X, she wrote: \u201cI\u2019ll always remember what he did for the MV Derbyshire families, insisting on work that led to the vindication of their deceased relatives, who they felt had been blamed for the sinking.\u201d When Labour won the election in 2007 with Blair as PM, Prescott, in addition to being made deputy PM, was put in charge of a new \u201csuper ministry\u201d covering the environment, transport and the regions. In that role he was credited with a number of successes, including helping to negotiate the international Kyoto Protocol on climate change and creating regional development councils as well as reforms to the transport system. East Hull MP Karl Turner has released a statement on Prescott\u2019s death. Turner has known Prescott all of his life, he said, and knows \u201cfirst-hand the impact that he had on many thousands of people across the city and the country.\u201d Prescott played an instrumental role in negotiating the Kyoto protocol on climate change, Turner recalls. Times radio breakfast host Stig Abel described Prescott on X as, \u201cOne of the most colourful, memorable politicians of our lifetimes. A man everyone can conjure in their minds immediately, and you can\u2019t say that about many politicians any more.\u201d Born in Prestatyn in Wales on 31 May 1938 the son of a railwayman, Prescott left school at the age of 15 to work as a trainee chef and then as a steward on the Cunard Line before entering politics. In a private letter in 2007, Blair said his former deputy\u2019s role \u201csmoothing out problems, sorting out colleagues and troubleshooting\u201d had been an \u201cintegral part of getting things done\u201d. The former prime minister said: \u201cThe completely unique Prescott blend of charm and brutality \u2013 made always more effective by the unpredictability of which would be predominant \u2013 got you through the decade, kept the government together and above all, gave me a lot of fun. I was lucky to have you as my deputy.\u201d Over a parliamentary career spanning more than half a century, Prescott served for 10 years as deputy prime minister after Labour\u2019s 1997 general election landslide. At times short-tempered, he once famously punched a protester who threw an egg at him during an election campaign visit to north Wales in 2001. But during much of his time in office, he acted as a mediator in the often turbulent relationship between Tony Blair and his chancellor, Gordon Brown. He also oversaw the environment, transport and the regions, a brief that included helping to negotiate the international Kyoto protocol on climate change. Prescott was a loyal supporter of Blair in office but subsequently critical of parts of New Labour\u2019s legacy, denouncing Britain\u2019s involvement in the Iraq war. He also strongly defended Jeremy Corbyn during his time as party leader in the face of fierce criticism. In their statement, Prescott\u2019s family said that representing Hull for 40 years in parliament was the former deputy PM\u2019s \u201cgreatest honour\u201d. The statement reads, in part: John spent his life trying to improve the lives of others, fighting for social justice and protecting the environment, doing so from his time as a waiter on the cruise liners to becoming Britain\u2019s longest serving deputy prime minister. John dearly loved his home of Hull and representing its people in parliament for 40 years was his greatest honour. We would like to thank the amazing NHS doctors and nurses who cared for him after his stroke in 2019 and the dedicated staff at the care home where he passed away after latterly living with Alzheimer\u2019s. In lieu of flowers and if you wish to do so, you can donate to Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK. As you can imagine, our family needs to process our grief so we respectfully request time and space to mourn in private. Thank you.\u201d The former British deputy prime minister John Prescott has died aged 86, his family announced on Thursday morning. His family said he had \u201cspent his life trying to improve the lives of others, fighting for social justice and protecting the environment\u201d. \u201cWe are deeply saddened to inform you that our beloved husband, father and grandfather, John Prescott, passed away peacefully yesterday at the age of 86,\u201d they said. \u201cHe did so surrounded by the love of his family and the jazz music of Marian Montgomery. Prescott served in Parliament for 40 years, eventually becoming deputy prime minister under Tony Blair. After leaving office along with Blair in 2007, he became increasingly critical of the New Labour legacy, denouncing Britain\u2019s involvement in the Iraq War. More shortly."

            "date": "2024-11-21T16:22:59Z",
            "content": "School leaders have said they lack the resources to manage a rising tide of challenging behaviour since the Covid pandemic, after figures revealed a significant rise in the number of pupils being suspended and expelled in England. The figures from the Department for Education (DfE) showed more pupils were being suspended repeatedly, and for longer periods, than before the pandemic struck in 2020 and schools were closed for most children over extended periods. The number of suspensions issued by schools has nearly doubled, with 346,000 in the autumn term of 2023, compared with 174,000 before the pandemic in autumn 2019. Over the same period the number of children permanently excluded from school rose by nearly a third, from 3,167 in 2019 to 4,168 in autumn last year. The figures support reports from teachers that behaviour among older children has continued to deteriorate since the pandemic, with the suspension rate in secondary schools jumping by a third between 2022 and 2023. At the same time schools are struggling to deal with sustained increases in pupils persistently absent, while the numbers of children on free school meals, or with mental health difficulties or other special needs, are also at record levels. Pepe Di\u2019Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the school system was \u201cteetering on the brink of collapse\u201d because of funding and support shortages, and urged the government to address the problems. Di\u2019Iasio said: \u201cThere is clearly a very serious problem facing schools with rising incidents of challenging behaviour \u2026 This has become a great deal worse since the pandemic where many children experienced disruption to their education and isolation that are continuing to have a lasting impact. \u201cIn many cases, schools simply do not have the resources to provide the level of specialist support required to prevent behavioural issues from escalating and so we see this ending up with suspensions and permanent exclusions being used as a last resort.\u201d He added: \u201cFunding pressures have meant that many schools have had to cut back on pastoral support, and there are serious shortages in teachers and specialist support staff such as educational psychologists. \u201cThere are also long waiting times to assess and identify the support required for children with the most complex special educational needs. The whole system is teetering on the brink of collapse and the government must show urgency in addressing these problems.\u201d Stephen Morgan, the education minister, said the previous Conservative government had allowed suspensions and exclusions to \u201cspiral out of control shamefully,\u201d harming the life chances of children. \u201cWe have reached crisis point but this government is determined to turn the tide on poor behaviour, break down barriers to opportunity and ensure every child can achieve and thrive,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already announced a significant \u00a31bn investment in [special education], committed to providing access to specialist mental health professionals in every school, and our new regional improvement teams will work with schools to spread the highest standards of behaviour across our classrooms. \u201cBut we know there is more to do, and are looking closely at how we can go further to support teachers and drive up standards for all our children.\u201d The exclusion rate for pupils eligible for free school meals was six times higher than those not eligible, while the peak age group for exclusions was in year 9 \u2013 the cohort whose transition between primary and secondary school was interrupted by the pandemic. Headteachers and school leaders are adamant that exclusions are only used as a last resort, while suspensions are necessary to protect the learning environment for other children. Schools cited \u201cpersistent disruptive behaviour\u201d as a factor in half of all exclusions and a third of exclusions, while verbal abuse and threatening behaviour towards an adult was the next most common at 16%, followed by physical assaults on other pupils at 13%. The number of individual pupils suspended increased by 28% to 171,000. While nearly half were suspended for only one day or less, 12,600 were suspended for more than two weeks in the course of a single term \u2013 an increase of 37% in the space of one year. If the high levels of exclusions and suspensions continue into spring and summer 2024, it will surpass 2022-23 \u2013 when 787,000 suspensions were issued \u2013 as the worst school year since current records began in 2006. The Department for Education has been approached for comment."

            "content": "The outgoing US ambassador to Australia, Caroline Kennedy, has labelled her cousin Robert F Kennedy Jr\u2019s views on vaccines \u201cdangerous\u201d. After a speech to the National Press Club in Canberra, Australia on Monday, Caroline Kennedy took aim at a number of Trump administration appointees including Tulsi Gabbard, warning that her appointment would \u201cobviously \u2026 be of great concern\u201d. Donald Trump has nominated RFK Jr to oversee US health agencies, despite his propagation of anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, and Gabbard to be director of national intelligence, despite her being a vocal supporter of Russia. Caroline Kennedy told reporters that as an ambassador, she\u2019s \u201cnot supposed to comment on politics and now you\u2019re asking me to also comment on family\u201d. \u201cBut, yes, I think Bobby Kennedy\u2019s views on vaccines are dangerous \u2026 but I don\u2019t think that most Americans share them. So we\u2019ll just have to wait and see what happens. \u201cBut certainly he\u2019s \u2013 you know, I grew up with him. So, I have known all this for a long time and others are just getting to know him.\u201d She noted her uncle Ted Kennedy \u201cspent 50 years fighting for affordable healthcare in the Senate\u201d, work that the former president Barack Obama built on with the Affordable Care Act. \u201cMy Aunt Eunice started the Special Olympics and the national institute of maternal and child health is now named after her. \u201cSo I would say that our family is united in terms of our support for the public health sector and infrastructure and has the greatest admiration for the medical profession in our country, and Bobby Kennedy has got a different set of views.\u201d Asked about Gabbard \u2013 a vocal supporter of Russia who Democratic lawmakers have said \u201cposes a threat to US national intelligence\u201d \u2013 and whether Australia should trust the US with sensitive intelligence, Caroline Kennedy replied that \u201cthere are thousands of people who work in our intelligence agencies and work closely with Australia and we have no more trusted or capable ally and that\u2019s going to continue\u201d. \u201cSo let\u2019s see what happens with President Trump\u2019s appointments. They have been \u2026 making waves, headlines \u2026 let\u2019s just calm down and wait and see what happens. \u201cBut obviously that would be of great concern and we\u2019ll see who \u2026 actually gets confirmed.\u201d Asked if the appointment of Mike Huckabee as ambassador to Israel could pave the way to annexation of the West Bank, Kennedy said she \u201ccan\u2019t speculate\u201d on the Trump administration\u2019s Middle East policy. \u201cBut obviously I was present at a campaign rally in 2008 where Governor Huckabee got a mobile phone from God almighty and he talked with him on the phone in front of a large audience. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Trump\u2019s election has caused consternation in Australia, which hopes to be exempted from tariffs due to the US trade surplus with its Indo-Pacific ally, and is increasingly entwined militarily with the US due to the Aukus alliance for the acquisition of nuclear submarines. Kennedy, a usually media-shy ambassador, delivered the off-the-cuff answers after a speech arguing that Aukus was necessary as a deterrent to maritime disruption, citing Philippine and Vietnamese ships \u201crammed and sunk by Chinese coastguard vessels\u201d. \u201cThe long delays and higher prices that are resulting from the Middle East conflict are insignificant compared to the global consequences of a conflict in this region. \u201cAukus is an existential investment in Australia\u2019s sovereignty and way of life and you can\u2019t put a price on that.\u201d Kennedy noted the Aukus alliance had \u201cbipartisan support\u201d in the US, including among the incoming Republican Congress majority. On international efforts to combat climate change, Kennedy argued \u201cthe green energy transition is under way\u201d and supported by the private sector. She said efforts were \u201cmulti-faceted\u201d but conceded they might not be as \u201cfast\u201d under the Trump administration."

            "date": "2024-11-16T21:29:03Z",
            "content": "Red squirrels will soon disappear from England unless the government funds a vaccine against squirrelpox, one of the biggest groups set up to protect the species has warned. Conservationists say the English population of non-native grey squirrels has exploded this year, triggered by warmer winters which enable mating pairs to feed and breed all year round, and estimate that 70% are carrying squirrelpox, a virus which is lethal only to red squirrels. \u201cWe\u2019re facing a huge surge of grey squirrels,\u201d said Robert Benson, founder of Penrith and District Red Squirrel Group, which covers 600 square miles of Cumbria. \u201cWe think they are breeding three or four times a year, and having four or five kits each time, leading to a massive expansion in grey squirrel numbers: 15 or 20 young grey squirrels are moving through the countryside [each year], from each breeding pair.\u201d Benson founded his group 40 years ago when the first grey squirrel was spotted in the region and recently took on an eighth full-time ranger to try to control the local grey squirrel population, helped by teams of part-time volunteers. \u201cRed squirrels are already under extreme pressure, because the grey squirrels will out-compete them for feed and for territory,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already lost them from every county in mainland England, apart from Cumbria and Northumberland.\u201d Squirrel protection groups in those regions desperately need help from the government to control the local grey squirrel population, he said. \u201cWe are at the coal face. England is under extreme threat, and in due course, Scotland will be threatened in the same way.\u201d He said his group is just one of the many conservation groups across Cumbria and Northumberland working to make sure the red squirrel survives: \u201cUnless we can manage to control that grey surge, the chances are, in two or three years, the red population will begin to disappear.\u201d The government needs to urgently invest in developing a vaccine against squirrelpox, while there is still a \u201cviable population\u201d of red squirrels alive who can benefit. If that doesn\u2019t happen soon, he said, \u201cwe won\u2019t have red squirrels in England, and probably in the United Kingdom, because Scotland too will go, in time \u2026 Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] and Natural England have to take seriously the threat to our red squirrels\u201d. He added: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the work we do, the red would already have disappeared from this part of the world.\u201d For the past two winters, he has been finding pregnant and lactating female grey squirrels in December, January and February. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing it now, in November. They shouldn\u2019t be breeding at this time of year, but they are.\u201d Grey squirrels have a natural advantage over red squirrels because they find it easier to digest the tannins found in acorns, a widespread food source which reds struggle to eat. When squirrelpox is present in the local squirrel population too, the disappearance of reds accelerates and they are replaced by grey squirrels up to 25 times faster. \u201cEvery time a red gets squirrelpox, it dies, and it\u2019s a slow painful death,\u201d said Benson. He said grey squirrels also cause a \u201chuge amount of damage\u201d, especially to growing timber, and feed on song birds and their eggs. \u201cThey cause damage to property too, by getting into lofts and outhouses, chewing through plumbing and electrics. Yet I\u2019m afraid that the conservation of red squirrels seems to be a low priority for the government.\u201d Defra and Natural England were contacted for comment."

            "content": "The former acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has criticized Robert F Kennedy Jr\u2019s nomination by Donald Trump as secretary of the country\u2019s health and human services (HHS), calling his false vaccine theories \u201ccruel\u201d. In a new interview on ABC, Richard Besser, who led the CDC during Barack Obama\u2019s administration, called Kennedy\u2019s push to falsely link vaccines to autism a \u201ccruel thing to do\u201d, adding, \u201cThere are things we do for our own health, but there are things we do that are good for ourselves, our families and our communities and vaccination falls into that category. \u201cHaving someone who denies that in that role is extremely dangerous,\u201d Besser said about Kennedy. \u201cWe need to, as a nation, address chronic diseases in children and one of the dangerous things about RFK Jr is that there are bits of things he says that are true and they\u2019re mixed in \u2026 It makes it really hard to sort out what things you should follow because they\u2019re based on fact and which things are not,\u201d he continued. Besser went on to say that experts should address chronic diseases \u2013 including autism \u2013 but to \u201ckeep [on] lifting the idea [that] that has something to do with vaccinations is really a cruel thing to do\u201d. In a separate interview on Sunday, Deborah Birx, the former White House coronavirus response coordinator under Trump\u2019s administration, said that Kennedy would require a team that has \u201creally come out of the industry\u201d in order to manage the HHS. \u201cI think the most important thing is what team he would bring with him, because you\u2019re talking about really a large \u2026 corporation with a highly diverse group, which you have to really bring together and, frankly, eliminate some of the duplication set between these agencies to really become more cost effective,\u201d said Birx. \u201cHaving a management person at his side, a chief of staff, perhaps that has really come out of industry that would know how to bring and look and bring those individuals together that are running the other agencies because \u2026 HHS is probably one of our most complicated departments,\u201d she added. Birx also agreed that there was no scientific evidence that vaccines cause autism, saying: \u201cI\u2019m actually excited that in a Senate hearing he would bring forward his data and the questions that come from the senators would bring forth their data. \u201cThat hearing would be a way for Americans to really see the data that you\u2019re talking about, that we can\u2019t see that causation right now,\u201d she said. Kennedy has previously said that \u201cthere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective.\u201d However, following Trump\u2019s re-election, Kennedy said that he \u201cwon\u2019t take away anybody\u2019s vaccines\u201d. His nomination has been widely criticized by health experts who condemned him as a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d to public health."

            "date": "2024-11-29T12:00:07Z",
            "content": "In deep blue Colorado, one of the only states that did not shift right in the 2024 presidential election, vaccine advocates see openings for Robert F Kennedy Jr. An environmental lawyer and the nation\u2019s most prominent propagator of vaccine misinformation, Kennedy is now the embodiment of where left meets right \u2013 the scion of a political dynasty who first ran as a Democratic presidential candidate and is now slated to join president-elect Trump\u2019s administration as the nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services. If confirmed, Kennedy would lead a sprawling health and science agency with oversight over everything from publicly funded basic research to insurance programs that cover 137 million Americans\u2019 healthcare. But his agenda is decidedly more \u201ccrunchy\u201d than the traditional Republican nominee, and includes experimental and even risky propositions: \u201cpsychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, hyperbaric therapies, chelating compounds, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, vitamins, clean foods, sunshine, exercise, nutraceuticals and anything else that advances human health and can\u2019t be patented by Pharma\u201d, he said in a social media post. \u201cYou could walk down any street in Boulder and bring up nutraceuticals and psilocybin,\u201d said Lindsay Diamond, a vaccine advocate who volunteers in local hospitals answering parents\u2019 vaccine questions, about parents in a town where Democrats just swept local elections. \u201cThat\u2019s casual coffee conversation for a lot of people in Boulder.\u201d The overwhelming majority of US parents vaccinate their children. A recent study from the Centers for Disease Control on Prevention (CDC) found that more than 90% of parents had vaccinated their children with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, a shot that has been the subject of misinformation for decades. The childhood disease hospitalizes about one in five unvaccinated people who catch it. But advocates also worry that the state\u2019s focus on wellness, and a well-founded distrust of chemical and pharmaceutical companies, could make people vulnerable to misinformation, especially at a time when a vaccine skeptic could have one of the world\u2019s biggest microphones as a cabinet secretary. The same CDC study shows how vaccination rates \u2013 key to preventing outbreaks \u2013 can be eroded. Researchers found small declines from 2018-2018 to 2020-2021 \u2013 perhaps due to the many and profound disruptions of the pandemic, but perhaps due to vaccine misinformation, researchers said. And Kennedy\u2019s agenda reflects one more typically thought of as left-leaning \u2013 associated with wellness, openness to nontraditional health treatments and \u201cslow food\u201d. In Colorado, people like Diamond are concerned about the ways Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine rhetoric could make inroads in left-leaning communities. \u201cThings like obesity and making sure children are exercising and eating healthy foods \u2013 that feels more pressing for people certainly around here,\u201d said Diamond, adding that because people of childbearing age have lived through the modern era of vaccinations, the overwhelming majority do not have personal experience with polio or measles, and therefore have no \u201cmuscle memory\u201d. Colorado is considered one of the healthiest states in the nation. It leads the country in educational attainment and, while not the richest state, has among the lowest in rates of economic hardship (only New Hampshire fares better). Both are highly correlated with health outcomes, which likely helps explain Colorado\u2019s high performance on other broad-based measures of health, such as life expectancy at birth. Colorado performs similarly well on specific health measures, such as having one of the nation\u2019s lowest obesity rates in the nation \u2013 a statistic locals credit to the easy access to the outdoors and culture of fitness. Diamond\u2019s concerns about the audience for unfounded wellness information have been echoed in articles on national health and wellness influencers, some of whom have surprised followers by announcing their support for Trump and their opposition to other scientifically proven medications, such as GLP-1 weight loss drugs. She fears that many left-leaning residents, especially those with good access to healthcare, are vulnerable to the \u201cmedical freedom\u201d movement, especially when it is wrapped around a wellness agenda that promises to combat chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. \u201cThey start going to a yoga studio, they start going to a CrossFit studio, and all the sudden that new wave of health information starts coming in,\u201d she said. People of color are often the focus of vaccine information campaigns, with the traditional public health understanding being that lower vaccination rates are because of distrust of the scientific establishment due to a history of racist abuse and experimentation. \u201cWhen the pandemic hit, I kept hearing, \u2018Latinos are vaccine-hesitant,\u2019\u201d said Julissa Soto, a commissioner of the office of health equity for the Colorado department of public health and environment. \u201cI knew it was not hesitancy \u2013 I knew it was access.\u201d \u201cI said to the state health department: \u2018I\u2019m going to organize one clinic and based on the numbers I bring, you guys are going to stop labeling us as vaccine-hesitant,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to open your eyes to access to care.\u201d In a one-day event after a Spanish-language Catholic mass, Soto\u2019s clinic vaccinated 1,279 people. Some studies on vaccine hesitancy, and anecdotal reports of progressive Waldorf schools as a bastion of anti-vaccine fervor, show how highly educated and white communities can also be vulnerable to vaccine misinformation. \u201cWe analyzed multiple studies that looked at parental intention or views of beliefs surrounding the MMR vaccine for their children, and we did observe from the studies almost a two-pronged association,\u201d said Mike Goates, a life sciences librarian at Brigham Young University in Utah who co-authored a review of studies on MMR vaccine hesitancy in the journal Vaccines. \u201cOne of the groups appeared to be predominantly white, higher education, higher income \u2013 that those parents compared to other groups tended to have higher levels of hesitancy,\u201d said Goates, who added these parents tended to be well connected on social media. Like many states nationally, Colorado is also facing a surge of vaccine-preventable diseases such as pertussis, colloquially known as whooping cough, now that people have dropped most pandemic-era precautions. Although the overwhelming majority of people survive the disease, it can be harrowing for new parents to watch, as more than a third of infants need to be hospitalized for treatment. Alexis Burakoff, Colorado\u2019s deputy state epidemiologist, said that it was \u201chard to know whether [vaccine hesitancy] plays a role in national and Colorado trends right now\u201d, as pertains to whooping cough. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing increases across the state concentrated in what we call the Front Range,\u201d said Burakoff, about Colorado\u2019s most populated corridor including cities such as Denver and Boulder. \u201cAgain, unsurprisingly, we\u2019re seeing circulation in schools and childcare settings, which is what you would expect.\u201d For Diamond, she is looking forward to continuing her work with parents in prenatal hospital clinics, where she sees hesitancy as a spectrum. Sometimes, people are just worried about the number of vaccines; others want to space out the administration of vaccines to their children. \u201cThis follows white wealth and privilege,\u201d said Diamond. When vaccination comes under attack, \u201cmy fear, as somebody who cares deeply about immunization, is: what happens to the programs that serve underserved populations?\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 30 November 2024. It now correctly states that Brigham Young University is in Utah, not Colorado, as it originally said."

            "content": "Donald Trump said late on Thursday that he wants the vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr \u201cto take care of health\u201d, including \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d if the former president wins back the White House in this election, as he spoke on the election campaign trail in Nevada. Earlier in Arizona he told the conservative broadcaster Tucker Carlson that the former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, who is now campaigning for his Democratic rival Kamala Harris, should have rifles \u201cshooting at her\u201d and \u201ctrained on her face\u201d. This spurred Cheney to respond on X early on Friday: \u201cThis is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant.\u201d She added, with hashtags, \u201cWomen will not be silenced\u201d and \u201cVote Kamala\u201d. In his sit-down with Carlson in Arizona, Trump acknowledged that Elon Musk and Robert F Kennedy Jr could be \u201cinfluential figures\u201d in a potential second administration. Trump also insulted Harris. He called Cheney a \u201cwar hawk\u201d who should be placed in the line of fire to \u201csee how she feels about it\u201d. Carlson asked Trump to address speculation that he would hire Musk, the Tesla boss who has endorsed him and poured tens of millions of dollars into a Super Pac supporting his campaign, and Kennedy, who ran for president as an independent before ending his campaign and endorsing Trump in August. \u201cYou think Bobby Kennedy and Elon Musk will be influential figures, without being specific about what those roles will be in your administration?\u201d Carlson asked. \u201cYeah, I do,\u201d Trump replied. The encounter with Carlson came as Trump looked to seize the advantage in a state with a historical Republican tilt that he lost when Joe Biden defeated him four years ago. Polls have lately showed him with a slight advantage in Arizona, and the conversation with Carlson was billed as a fundraiser for Hurricane Helene recovery efforts \u2013 an issue of importance in North Carolina, another swing state. Carlson, a former conservative commentator on Fox News who has become even more overtly political since his firing last year, was a friendly interviewer, delivering a tribute to Trump before a crowd of supporters in a 19,000-capacity indoor arena in Glendale, a suburb of Arizona\u2019s capital and largest city, Phoenix. He then sat down with the former president for a conversation that served largely to give him space to promote his candidacy and plans for a second administration. The former president spent much of the interview hurling invective at his opponents, calling Harris \u201ca low IQ individual\u201d and \u201cdumb as a rock\u201d. Of Cheney, whose father, the former vice-president Dick Cheney, was an architect of the US invasion of Iraq, which he also criticized, he said: \u201cShe\u2019s a radical war hawk. Let\u2019s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. Let\u2019s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face.\u201d But Trump dodged other attempts by Carlson to nail down his policies, including his feelings on the FBI and CIA, which the commentator said \u201cworked against you on behalf of the Democratic party from the minute you got elected in 2016 and they\u2019re still doing it \u2026 What will you do about that?\u201d Trump was more willing to talk about his assertion that \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d, as he calls his political opponents, are truly dangerous. Harris has seized on his usage of the term, and his proposal to deploy the military against them, to argue that he is a fascist who is seeking \u201cunchecked power\u201d. \u201cWe do have an enemy from within. We have some very bad people, and those people are also very dangerous. They would like to take down our country. They\u2019d like to have our country be a nice communist country or fascist in any way they can, and we have to be careful of that. But they\u2019re the greatest con artists, because [as] soon as I said an enemy from within, they said \u2026 oh, he\u2019s saying an enemy from within. These are sick puppies, I\u2019m telling you,\u201d Trump said. He also appeared to lay the groundwork for claiming fraud, should he lose Tuesday\u2019s presidential election. Polls have him and Harris within their margins of error in the swing states that will decide the presidency, but Trump told Carlson he\u2019s clearly ahead, and implied only \u201ccheating\u201d could stop him from winning. \u201cI think we\u2019re leading by a lot, and \u2026 we can keep that cheating down, because there are a bunch of cheats. If we can keep that cheating down, we\u2019re going to have a tremendous victory \u2026 I think it\u2019ll go down as one of the greatest victories of all time.\u201d On Wednesday, the co-chair of Trump\u2019s transition team Howard Lutnick, downplayed the possibilities of either Musk or Kennedy ending up in Trump\u2019s second cabinet during an interview with CNN. Musk would probably \u201chelp\u201d the government rather than work for it, while Kennedy, a conspiracy theorist and opponent of vaccines, would be given health data, but not be put in the running to lead the health and human services department. Trump now appears to be contradicting that idea in relation to Kennedy. RFK Jr dropped out of his own presidential campaign in August and endorsed Trump. In Nevada late on Thursday Trump said: \u201cRobert F Kennedy Jr, we have, and he\u2019s going to work on health and women\u2019s health and all of the different reasons, because we\u2019re not really a wealthy or a healthy country,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I told Bobby, Bobby, I want you to take care of health.\u201d There is speculation he may be given influence over children\u2019s health, too, which would particularly alarm proponents of vaccines."

            "content": "Matildas winger Cortnee Vine will prioritise her mental health and take a break from football after an \u201coverwhelming\u201d rise to prominence over the past few years. For the second consecutive international window the 26-year-old made herself unavailable for selection and was again a notable absentee from interim coach Tom Sermanni\u2019s 36-woman squad for Australia\u2019s upcoming friendlies against Brazil and Taiwan. Through her management company, Vine posted a statement shortly after the squad was announced on Friday, confirming she intends to focus on her own wellbeing for the immediate future. \u201cI\u2019m sure many people can appreciate that my life has dramatically changed over the past two years,\u201d Vine said. \u201cDue to these very new and sometimes overwhelming experiences, I\u2019ve discovered that identifying, managing and prioritising my mental health has become something I have needed to work very hard on. \u201cLike many who face mental health challenges, I have my good days and my difficult ones, but every day is a lesson in learning to find the right balance. For now I need to focus on taking care of myself, which is why I am taking some time off.\u201d Vine was a star of the A-League Women before she was catapulted into the national spotlight by winning a call-up to the Matildas squad for the Women\u2019s World Cup on home soil. Her life changed and she became a national hero when she scored the winning penalty in Australia\u2019s quarter-final shootout win over France in Brisbane. After the World Cup, she snubbed interest from overseas clubs to remain at Sydney FC and, as one of few Matildas plying their trade in Australia, became one of the faces of the competition. In June, after another successful A-League Women season, she was finally tempted by the National Women\u2019s Soccer League in the US and signed for North Carolina Courage. Despite playing an integral part in the Matildas\u2019 qualification for the Paris Olympics, Vine pulled out of the team for qualifiers in February last year for personal reasons, before returning to make her Games debut against Germany in Marseille. Since arriving in North Carolina, she has played five times, and scored one goal. Vine gave no indication of when she may return to football, but when she does, she believes she will be better for having had a break. \u201cI truly appreciate everyone\u2019s support and concern, and I\u2019m confident I\u2019ll return stronger than ever,\u201d she said. Sermanni said he was in regular contact with Vine, but she had chosen not to be considered for selection this time. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a chat before the last window. We\u2019ve had a chat within the last week. She\u2019s good, but she\u2019s just not available for these upcoming games,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2024-11-11T16:30:05Z",
            "content": "I read your editorial on the proposed reforms to the Mental Health Act with interest (6 November). The act serves as the balancing point between the state\u2019s negative duty not to interfere with individual liberty without good reason and its positive duties to prevent harm to vulnerable people and the wider public. The criteria for detention represent the threshold at which both of those duties are triggered: detention under the MHA is also a gateway to rights to proactive care and support both during and after detention. We may argue about whether the existing criteria for detention strike the right balance between the state\u2019s positive and negative duties, but it is at least the same balance for everyone. The draft bill sets a much higher threshold for detention unless a person has committed a crime, and while this will lead to fewer people suffering the trauma and indignity of being detained, it will also mean fewer people receiving the positive support and protection of the state \u2013 that is unless they commit a crime. Even leaving aside the unexplored equalities implications of such a perverse incentive, it can surely be neither less restrictive of the individual nor more caring of the state to force people into the criminal justice system in order to receive the help they need. Michael Chalmers Associate director of mental health law, North London NHS foundation trust \u2022 As a social worker, I couldn\u2019t agree more that the outcome of the proposed reforms to the Mental Health Act will depend on resources. I am employed by an NHS trust to work with people for three years after they experience a first episode of psychosis. If staff in my trust did everything that we are already supposed to, it would be a fantastic place to receive care. We cannot. There are not enough beds, caseloads are too high, staff retention is too low, advertised posts often remain unoccupied and well-meaning but misguided attempts at system reform create administrative burdens without improving the quality of care. Small pockets of the system receive higher levels of funding. These teams tend to deliver better quality care as a result. The staff are not more skilled, they simply have been given adequate resources. There is no point banning the use of police cells as a place of safety unless additional assessment suites are provided in hospital settings to meet that need. Staff who are rushed off their feet cannot build the kind of relationships with patients that make family involvement or collaborative care planning meaningful. It is one thing to legislate for higher standards, another to secure the resources to meet those standards. Richard Braham Ilminster, Somerset \u2022 Your editorial is full of the hope and values that we need to offer positive and effective mental health services to people with serious mental illness, as are the amendments in the bill. So it pains me to call out the naivety of these changes being sought at a time when services are so deteriorated that it takes the horror of the Nottingham attacks to begin the process (NHS England\u2019s review of assertive outreach provision 2024) of recognising the vast hole. If we are to move towards a more humane Mental Health Act, we first need to provide full community provision for the people whose lives are lived in and out of psychiatric wards. Dr William Hall NHS consultant psychiatrist in rehabilitation, Bristol \u2022 As a parent of adults with severe mental illness, I would like to see easier access to treatment and care. Already, most people with severe illness are left to live, at best, impoverished lives in the \u201ccommunity\u201d. I don\u2019t recognise the narrative of people\u2019s rights being removed by hospital admissions. Already, people\u2019s rights are removed by not having access to good, timely treatment and care, under section if necessary. If the threshold for admission rises even further, I can only see this leading to more misery, deaths and criminalisation. Name and address supplied \u2022 The National Autistic Society has campaigned on this for many years now. The Tories pledged to reduce the number of autistic people in mental health wards back in 2015 when they made up 38% of patients. The latest figure is 68% of patients. This is shocking and needs to change. Placing people with autism on such wards is so harmful, due to patients being prescribed medications and being subjected to restraint. As an autistic adult, it is frightening to think I could be sectioned for a lack of understanding about my behaviour \u2013 especially during a meltdown, when I lose control.

            "title": "TikTok to block teenagers from beauty filters over mental health concerns",
            "date": "2024-11-26T23:01:42Z",
            "content": "Teenagers are facing wide-ranging new restrictions over the use of beauty filters on TikTok amid concern at rising anxiety and falling self-esteem. Under-18s will, in the coming weeks, be blocked from artificially making their eyes bigger, plumping their lips and smoothing or changing their skin tone. The restrictions will apply to filters \u2013 such as \u201cBold Glamour\u201d \u2013 that change children\u2019s features in a way that makeup cannot. Comic filters that add bunny ears or dog noses will be unaffected. The billion-user social media company announced the changes during a safety forum at its European headquarters in Dublin. The effectiveness of the restrictions will depend on people using the platform under their real age, which is not always the case. There has been widespread concern that the beauty filters \u2013 some provided by TikTok, others created by users \u2013 have resulted in a pressure on teenagers, particularly girls, to adopt a polished physical appearance with negative emotional repercussions. Some young people have described how after using filters they found their real face ugly. TikTok also announced it was tightening its systems to block users under 13 from the platform, which could mean that thousands of British children are turfed off the platform. Before the end of the year, it will launch a trial of new automated systems that use machine learning to detect people cheating its age restrictions. The moves come with tougher regulation of underage social media use in the UK looming in the new year, under the Online Safety Act. The platform already removes 20m accounts every quarter worldwide for being underage. Chloe Setter, TikTok\u2019s lead on child safety public policy, said: \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that this will give us the ability to detect and remove more and more quickly.\u201d People wrongly blocked will be able to appeal. \u201cIt can obviously be annoying for some young people,\u201d said Setter, but she added that the platform will take a \u201csafety-first approach\u201d. Ofcom said in a report last December that from June 2022 to March 2023 about 1% of TikTok\u2019s total UK monthly active user base were removed for being underage. The regulator has previously warned the effectiveness of TikTok\u2019s age restriction enforcement is \u201cyet to be established\u201d. It is due to start strictly enforcing over-13 age limits for social media users next summer, requiring \u201chighly effective\u201d age checks. The new \u201cguardrails\u201d around beauty filters and age verification are part of a wave of adjustments to online safety being announced by social media platforms before tougher regulations are enforced in the coming months, with potential heavy fines for breaches of online safety rules. Last week Roblox, the gaming platform with 90 million daily users, announced it would restrict its youngest users from accessing the more violent, crude and scary content on the platform after warnings about child grooming, exploitation and the sharing of indecent images. Instagram, which is run by Meta, launched \u201cteen accounts\u201d for under-18s to allow parents greater control over children\u2019s activities, including the ability to block children from viewing the app at night. Andy Burrows, the chief executive of the Molly Rose Foundation, which was set up to focus on suicide prevention, said: \u201cIt will not escape anyone\u2019s attention that these shifts are being announced largely to comply with EU and UK regulation. This makes the case for more ambitious regulation, not less.\u201d He called for TikTok to be fully transparent about how its age assurance measures will work and their effectiveness at reducing the number of under-13s on the platform. Burrows added: \u201cTikTok should act quickly to fix the systemic weaknesses in its design that allows a torrent of harmful content to be algorithmically recommended to young people aged 13 or over.\u201d The NSPCC described the age protection move as \u201cencouraging\u201d but \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg\u201d. \u201cOther social media sites must step up and find effective ways to assess the ages of their users,\u201d said Richard Collard, the charity\u2019s associate head of policy for child safety online. \u201cOfcom and the government also have an important role to play in compelling tech bosses to deliver age-appropriate experiences for all their users.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-12T02:22:16Z",
            "content": "A coroner\u2019s court has heard that it took just three minutes for homeless and mentally unwell man Joel Cauchi to fatally stab six people and injure 10 more in a frenzied attack in a Bondi Junction shopping centre on 13 April. On Tuesday morning, the New South Wales state coroner heard Cauchi, 40, who grew up in Toowoomba in Queensland, had been sleeping rough in Maroubra on the morning of the attack, which ended when he was shot and killed by police inspector Amy Scott. Cauchi was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a teenager. He had received mental health treatment until 2020, and had stopped taking medication for his schizophrenia in 2019, counsel assisting Dr Peggy Dwyer SC told the court. His mental health deteriorated between then and April. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Dwyer told the court that Cauchi arrived at about 7.30am at the Kennards storage unit he rented in Waterloo, where he slept and charged his phone before leaving and returning to collect a large knife which he placed in his backpack. He entered Westfield shopping centre shortly after 3.30pm, beginning the attack at 3.32pm and 57 seconds when, after \u201cfidgeting\u201d in line at a bakery, he removed the knife from his backpack and fatally stabbed Dawn Singleton, 25. He then fatally stabbed Jade Young, 47, and Yixuan Cheng before attacking Ashlee Good, 38, from behind. The court heard that the mother turned and saw him then attacking her nine-month-old baby, who was in a pram, and received another stab wound when she intervened to \u201cundoubtedly\u201d save the life of her infant. Cauchi immediately continued his attack, killing security guard Faraz Tahir, a 30-year-old Pakistani citizen, then Pikria Darchia, 55. Five minutes and 43 seconds after the attack began, Cauchi was shot dead by Scott, who was on duty nearby. Just over a minute passed between her arrival at Westfield and shooting him dead. Dwyer said no alarm sounded within Westfield Bondi until about one minute after Cauchi was shot. \u201cIt\u2019s presently unclear why it took so long for the alarm to sound,\u201d she said. At the directions hearing for the inquest into the mass stabbing event, state coroner Teresa O\u2019Sullivan acknowledged the pain and loss caused that day. \u201cAt the outset, I offer my sincere condolences to the family and loved ones who are here in court today as well as those who can\u2019t be here with us in person. It\u2019s important to me and my assisting team \u2026 that you feel safe, you feel heard and you feel cared for throughout this coronal proceeding,\u201d she told the court. The court heard that Cauchi collected large knives, including a Ka-Bar USMC utility fixed blade knife \u2013 and that in early 2023, the police were twice called to Cauchi\u2019s family home, where he told officers that his knives had been stolen by his father. Investigations revealed Cauchi\u2019s father had confiscated the knives because of concerns around his son\u2019s mental health. The court heard that Cauchi\u2019s parents recognised their son from the CCTV footage shown on 6pm news on the evening of the stabbing. They called police and have assisted with investigations since. Dwyer said the inquest, set down for five weeks from 28 April 2025, will centre on six issues, including Cauchi\u2019s background, his mental health conditions and treatment in Queensland, and interactions with police before 13 April. A precise chronology of events that day will be investigated, as will the nature of the response from Westfield\u2019s owners, Scentre Group, and its security subcontractors, Glad Group and Falcon Manpower Solution. A further issue, she anticipated, will be the type of alarm that was activated and whether it was appropriate. The alarm used was so loud that it impaired first responders\u2019 capacity to communicate with each other, she said. Dwyer said while an inquest is mandatory after any death in the course of a police operation, she did not anticipate any criticism of Scott\u2019s use of force. On the contrary, she said the officer\u2019s actions \u201cclearly saved lives\u201d after Cauchi \u201cposed an immediate and ongoing deadly threat to citizens\u201d. Dwyer paid her respects and expressed her deep condolences to the families of those who lost their lives that day on behalf of the bar. She said the event \u201cshocked our community\u201d and has caused \u201cunspeakable grief for the families and loved ones of those who were killed and injured\u201d. She said national and international experts, including an expert in active armed offenders from London\u2019s New Scotland Yard, will appear. Also expected to give evidence are treating doctors and mental health experts. Dwyer said gaps in the healthcare Cauchi received \u201cexposed him and the community to the risk of harm\u201d. She said she expects to hear there is a strong need for sustainable serviced housing for mentally ill people, and that such a service could have assisted in preventing the decline in Cauchi\u2019s mental health. While she said the events of 13 April were very rare and she was \u201cconscious to avoid stigmatising\u201d those living with a mental illness, she said a mental illness can be \u201ccatastrophic \u2013 as it was in this case\u201d. She said the inquest would be trauma-informed and as respectful as possible. \u201cThankfully in this country tragedies like this are rare \u2013 but when they do happen, they happen quickly and they cause chaos,\u201d she said. She added she hopes the inquest will highlight weak spots and deficiencies in procedures and prevent future deaths. \u201cIf there are flaws in systems, parties are asked to help the assisting team to identify them,\u201d she said. The coroner said she may make recommendations in relation to any matter relating to the deaths, with a view to improving the public safety. Outside the court, two of Tahir\u2019s brothers spoke about the importance of being at the court proceedings. \u201cWhat has happened cannot be changed, but we pray and hope that through the investigation, they are able to come up with better plans and better equipment for security guards,\u201d Muzafar Ahmad Tahir said through an interpreter."

Anxiety is not an unreasonable response, and you should not feel diminished for being worried,\u201d said Lee Knifton, a Mental Health Foundation director. The potential changes augured by the Trump presidency \u2013 economic and social upheaval, threats to human rights, the prospect of racial divisiveness \u2013 can create or exacerbate feelings of anxiety, foreboding and loss of control. Even if we are not directly involved, watching traumatic world events unfold that cause actual or portents of harm or suffering, whether to ourselves, loved ones or complete strangers, can affect our mental health, the foundation says. It is worth trying to pause, reflect and see if perspectives settle after the initial shock and despair, it says. Try to accept events may be out of your control and influence. \u201cTime is important. It\u2019s useful to see how things land,\u201d said Knifton. If the feelings of gloom persist there are ways to cope, the foundation says, however helpless things may seem. One strategy is to limit your news consumption and reduce social media use, especially if it puts you in low spirits. Avoid long scrolling sessions. Another strategy is to find ways to connect and engage with others. Don\u2019t bottle things up, and remember many others share your feelings. Volunteering and activism are practical ways to find a sense of agency and esteem, often expressed as a desire to make a difference. The beneficial mental health effects of volunteering are well documented. A 2023 study by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations found 75% of respondents reported that volunteering was good for their mental health and wellbeing. Nine out of 10 respondents reported that volunteering \u2013 with a charity, community group, or school or civic institution \u2013 made them feel they were making a difference. Seventy-four per cent said it brought them into positive contact with people from different backgrounds, and 68% that it made them feel less socially isolated. Getting involved in political and civic activism can help lessen the feelings of being voiceless or having little control. The foundation recommends exploring involvement with political, civic or social groups, or seeking out public events and debates. Get involved in local civic causes Politicians and activists often say they were inspired to start by local injustices encountered in their own lives or neighbourhoods. This could be campaigning against the closure of a school or library, opposing controversial planning decisions, or proactively setting up services where none exist, such as self-help groups for parents, or sports teams for children. Volunteering Charities are often crying out for volunteer expertise. Reach Volunteering is a national charity offering a range of opportunities for people with professional and technical skills \u2013 it might be finance, legal, IT, building work, education or cookery \u2013 and links them with voluntary roles at a wide range of good causes, from local community groups to food banks and hospices. Political, social and environmental activism Joining a local political party or activist group can open opportunities to discuss and debate pressing local and international issues. It may give you a voice in the drawing up of local or national policies, and offer opportunities for you to get your point across through elected roles as well as marches, demonstrations, and petitions. Donating financially to good causes close to your heart is another way to show solidarity."

            "content": "Certain events happen during every presidential campaign. The parties crown their candidates. The candidates debate on live TV, with millions watching. Tens of millions head to the polls. And at some point in this process, Jamie Dimon will be tipped as the next treasury secretary. Sure enough, the veteran boss of JPMorgan Chase \u2013 Wall Street\u2019s de facto ambassador to the world \u2013 was, indeed, linked with the role this time around as the Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigns mulled their options in the final stretch of the 2024 presidential election. But as the world came to terms with his victory, and Trump started to piece together his administration, the president-elect made clear in a social media post that Dimon \u201cwill not be invited\u201d to join. The people who did get the invite underline why Dimon \u2013 one of the most prominent leaders in corporate America, and head of America\u2019s biggest bank \u2013 did not. Considering him for a post might be a time-honored tradition, but this is not business as usual. Trump values reputation, establishment and star power. But not as much as he values getting his way. Howard Lutnick, a longtime friend and co-chair of his transition team, remarked during the campaign that Trump \u201cpicked unfortunately\u201d last time around. Industrial giants and former military generals did not wholeheartedly embrace his agenda. Not this time. Trump has picked Lutnick, for starters \u2013 CEO of the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald \u2013 as his commerce secretary, tasked with delivering his policy on tariffs and trade. While Lutnick was reported to have directly lobbied to run the treasury, that job went to the financier Scott Bessent, after days of jostling and speculation. With both appointments, Trump is said to have been wary of appointing a candidate who did not ardently believe in the tariffs and tax strategy at the center of his economic plan for the US. Economists have warned that the introduction of steep tariffs could reignite inflation. Budget experts have warned that Trump\u2019s wider plans could add as much as $15tn to US debt over 10 years. The president-elect wants to keep such caution outside the tent \u2013 and has pulled together a band of staunch loyalists to drive through it. During Bessent\u2019s campaign for the treasury job, he loudly made the case for tariffs, dismissing economists\u2019 warnings as \u201cfundamentally incorrect\u201d in a column for Fox News. Not long after a line was very publicly drawn under the talk of Dimon as treasury secretary, the Wall Street titan appeared on stage at a summit in Lima, Peru. He wished Trump well, \u201cbut I just want to tell the president also: I haven\u2019t had a boss in 25 years, and I\u2019m not about ready to start\u201d. The boss preparing to return to the White House in January has made up his mind. He does not seem prepared to hire anyone who might try to change it \u2013 on the economy, or any other key facet of his agenda. Presidential administrations are rarely a broad church. Trump appears to be building a narrow pew."

            "date": "2024-11-16T12:01:03Z",
            "content": "A top adviser to the US president-elect, Donald Trump, has said the UK should align itself with the American \u201cfree enterprise\u201d economic model instead of the \u201cmore socialist\u201d European system, as speculation mounts over the terms of a potential transatlantic trade deal. Stephen Moore, a senior economic adviser to Trump, said if the UK moved towards the US model of \u201ceconomic freedom\u201d there would be more \u201cwillingness\u201d by the incoming administration to agree to a trade deal between the two countries. His comments come as Keir Starmer faces competing demands over future trade deals with Washington and Brussels. Some have told the prime minister to pick a side in trade talks between the US and EU while others have suggested he could strike deals with both major players. Speaking to BBC\u2019s Today programme, Moore said: \u201cThe UK really has to choose between the Europe economic model of more socialism and the US model, which is more based on a free enterprise system. I think the UK is kind of caught in the middle of these two forms of an economic model. I believe that Britain would be better off moving towards more of the American model of economic freedom. \u201cIf that were the case, I think it would spur the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to the free trade agreement with the UK. I think it would make sense for both Britain and the United States.\u201d Previous efforts to agree a UK-US trade deal have been scuppered by rows over agricultural standards, particularly fears over allowing chlorinated chicken or hormone-fed beef on to British supermarket shelves. Moore said: \u201cI think we have the best agriculture centres in the world. So I wouldn\u2019t see that as a problem from this side of the ocean, but I do understand that in Britain. I know the last time I was in London, that was a big issue with many of the British folks I talked to.\u201d Trump has proposed a blanket tariff of at least 10% on all imports, as well as further retaliatory tariffs against countries that place tariffs on US imports. Moore said the blanket tariff was a \u201cfairly popular position with many American voters\u201d but suggested some countries might be exempt. The prospect of tariffs has already hampered the UK government, which has staked its success on economic growth. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs cut its UK economic growth forecast for 2025 to 1.4% from 1.6%, citing potential higher US tariffs. \u201cI do think we have a special relationship with Britain and I think most Americans, I think Donald Trump, views Britain in a very different way, certainly from China or other countries that we view in a more adversarial way,\u201d he said. Referencing the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was passed under Trump to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, Moore said: \u201cWe have a US, Mexico and Canada trade deal. So, it\u2019s certainly possible that with this uniform tariff that he\u2019s talked about, that because of our special relationship with our North American neighbours, that we might exempt them. So your question is, might we exempt Britain? Maybe, I don\u2019t know the answer to that.\u201d On Tuesday, Peter Mandelson, who is tipped to become the new British ambassador in Washington, told the Times that the UK \u201cmust have our cake and eat it\u201d and forge trade ties with the EU and US. \u201cWe cannot come out of the largest export market, difficult enough as it is to trade freely there, having left the European Union. But we still trade. It\u2019s our biggest export market still. We can\u2019t leave that. \u201cAnd we have to mitigate the sort of barriers and risks that we\u2019ve taken on as a result of Brexit in the European market. And transatlantic trade and investment is huge for us.\u201d Andy Haldane, the former Bank of England chief economist, echoed a similar message, saying on Tuesday that the government could show the UK was \u201copen for business at a time when so much else of the world is looking inward \u2013 whether to the EU, or the US\u201d."

            "date": "2024-11-18T18:20:02Z",
            "content": "China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has heaped praise on Keir Starmer\u2019s economic policy, as the UK prime minister used their first meeting to raise concerns about sanctions on MPs and the treatment of the pro-democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai. During their conversation at the G20 summit in Rio, the first meeting between the UK and China\u2019s leaders in six years, Starmer said he would be keen to host a full bilateral meeting with Xi and the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, in Beijing or London as soon as possible, aimed at turning the page on frosty UK-China relations. In a marked change of tone from previous years, Xi said Starmer was \u201cfixing the foundations\u201d of the UK economy, echoing the prime minister\u2019s own slogan. He said the pair would \u201cbreak new ground\u201d in the relationship. But the prime minister also raised human rights concerns with the Chinese president about sanctions on British Conservative MPs and the deterioration of Lai, a British citizen and Hong Kong democracy activist. Starmer promised a \u201cstrong UK-China relationship\u201d and said the pair had agreed there should be no more \u201csurprises\u201d between the two countries. Chinese officials bundled British journalists out of the meeting when Starmer raised the plight of Lai, who is being held in Hong Kong. \u201cThe world has entered a new period marked by turbulence and transformation,\u201d Xi said in the meeting. \u201cThe new UK government is working to fix the foundations of the economy and rebuild Britain and has set the vision of Britain reconnected. And China is further deepening reform across the board to advance Chinese modernisation.\u201d Starmer said the pair had acknowledged they wanted \u201crelations to be consistent, durable, respectful and, as we have agreed, avoid surprises where possible\u201d. \u201cA strong UK-China relationship is important for both of our countries and for the broader international community,\u201d he said at the top of the meeting. \u201cThe UK will be a predictable, consistent, sovereign actor committed to the rule of law.\u201d He proposed a full bilateral meeting with Li in Beijing or London, and for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to meet her counterpart, He Lifeng, which is expected to happen in Beijing in January. \u201cI\u2019m keen that my chancellor should meet with Vice-Premier He for the upcoming economic financial dialogue early next year to explore more investment projects and a more level playing field to help our businesses,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased that my foreign secretary and foreign minister Wang met recently to discuss respective concerns including on human rights and parliamentary sanctions, Taiwan, the South China Sea and our shared interest in Hong Kong. We are concerned by reports of Jimmy Lai\u2019s deterioration.\u201d More than 100 senior politicians from 22 countries have called on China to release Lai before his trial that restarts in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Held in custody since December 2020, Lai faces a range of sedition and foreign collusion charges that include meeting politicians in the US. Signatories to the appeal include the chairs of a range of foreign affairs committees and prominent MPs from across Europe, Canada and Australia and the Balkans. The signatories point out that Lai is 77, a British citizen and was declared as being arbitrarily detained by a UN panel last week. In a statement, they claim he has been held inhumanely in solitary confinement in a maximum-security prison for four years, and call for his immediate release \u201cbefore it is too late\u201d. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, recently met Jimmy Lai\u2019s son Sebastian to promise to do all he could to secure his release. Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, said Starmer the UK\u2019s world standing risked \u201cbeing weakened\u201d if Starmer was not robust with China. \u201cWhile it is important to have a constructive diplomatic dialogue with China, the prime minister should have been stronger in raising our concerns over human rights, the repressive nature of the national security laws imposed on Hong Kong, and the security, safety and wellbeing of British nationals, like Jimmy Lai, who should be freed from custody,\u201d she said. The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who is also under sanctions from Beijing, condemned Starmer\u2019s attempt to resuscitate relations. \u201cPresident Xi has no regard for the UK and is trashing all the rules-based order around the world \u2013 from human rights to the WTO, China just ignores what it is told,\u201d he said. No British prime minister had met Xi since Theresa May visited Beijing in 2018 in the midst of a trade push during Brexit negotiations, though Boris Johnson spoke to the Chinese president during the pandemic. Since then, relations have significantly cooled because of cyber threats, a human rights crackdown in Hong Kong and the sanctions against MPs. Lammy visited China last month in the first signal that the new Labour government saw a renewal of better ties as a diplomatic priority."

            "title": "From higher tariffs to lower taxes, will Donald Trump\u2019s economic plan pay off?",
            "date": "2024-11-08T13:19:58Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s the economy, stupid. So said James Carville when he was advising Bill Clinton in his 1992 presidential campaign and the phrase is as true now as it was 32 years ago. Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris this week for the same reason he lost to Joe Biden in 2020: millions of Americans were unhappy about the economic record of the incumbent party. Two out of three voters this week thought the US economy was on the wrong track \u2013 and that spelled trouble for Harris. The question is whether they will feel any differently at the end of Trump\u2019s second term in the White House, when it ends in 2029. Looking at some of the policies proposed by the president-elect, it is by no means certain that they will. Trump is not a man to undersell himself and while campaigning said he had created during his first term the \u201cgreatest economy in the history of our country\u201d. While clearly hyperbole, Trump\u2019s record in the first three years of his presidency was impressive. The US economy grew strongly, inflation averaged about 2%, 6.7m jobs were created and the unemployment rate fell to 3.5%. Then, in the fourth year of his presidency the economy was hit by the Covid 19 pandemic. Lockdowns meant 20 million Americans lost their jobs and the unemployment rate shot up to 15%. A deep recession in 2020 pulled down the average growth rate to 2.3% across Trump\u2019s first term. So what is Trump proposing for the economy when he replaces Biden in January? 1. Lower taxes Trump loves cutting taxes, and reductions for business and individuals are priorities for his second term. While plans are sketchy he has promised to cut corporation tax for companies that make their products in the US, from 21% to 15%. This is part of the president-elect\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda, with one of the world\u2019s most competitive tax regimes designed to prevent US companies outsourcing production overseas and to persuade foreign manufacturers to move to the US. He wants to make permanent the income tax cuts made in 2017 but which are due to expire next year. With the US on course to run a 7% of GDP budget deficit this year, critics have said tax cuts worth up to $7.5tn over the next 10 years are unaffordable, given that the US national debt is already 122% of GDP. Trump says he has a way of paying for them. 2. Tariffs Trump says he will pay for the tax cuts by imposing tariffs on foreign goods entering the US and has floated the idea of a 60% to 100% levy on Chinese products and a 10%-20% levy on goods from the rest of the world. The Tax Foundation, a US thinktank, has estimated a 10% universal tariff would raise $2tn over 10 years, while a 20% tariff would raise $3.3tn \u2013 well short of what would be needed to fully offset the revenue losses of making the 2017 tax cuts permanent. The impact of the tariffs will be to raise prices in the shops and reduce the spending power of US consumers. Some estimates suggest the losses for the average US household could be between $2,500 and $3,900. Those who voted for Trump on the basis that he will deliver lower inflation and faster growth in living standards could be in for a shock. 3. Drilling and the environment The centrepiece of Joe Biden\u2019s industrial strategy was the Inflation Reduction Act, which was designed to stimulate green growth through a system of tax incentives and subsidies. Trump has criticised the act for being too expensive, and plans to ban offshore wind projects and give the go-ahead for the resumption of large-scale oil and gas drilling. While analysts expect longstanding tax credits for onshore wind to remain in place, America under Trump is not going to be in the vanguard of the fight to achieve net zero. Trump has summed up his energy policy in three words: \u201cDrill, baby, drill.\u201d 4. Interest rates, the dollar and the Federal Reserve The US economy is operating at close to capacity and unemployment is low. Tax cuts will increase demand, while higher tariffs will push up prices. Higher inflation will be the result and that will mean America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, will be more cautious about cutting interest rates. If US borrowing costs stay higher for longer, the US dollar will rise on the currency markets, offsetting some of the impact of tariffs by making imports cheaper. If his first term is any guide, Trump will put pressure on the Fed to cut rates. The US central bank reduced US borrowing costs by 0.25 points on Thursday but its chair, Jerome Powell, clearly expects trouble. Asked if he would step down if Trump asked him to go, and if he could be legally ordered to do so, Powell replied \u201cno\u201d and \u201cnot permitted under the law\u201d. 5. Migration and deregulation Trump says he will begin immediately the deportation of the estimated 11 million people living in the US without legal status, although he has given few details of how they would identify the individuals involved. He also plans to complete the project launched in his first term: the building of a wall along the border between the US and Mexico. If successful, these policies would reduce the supply of low-cost labour and push up business costs. Trump favours business deregulation, including dismantling the safeguards put in for artificial intelligence, ending the \u201cpersecution\u201d of the crypto industry, and making Elon Musk the head of a government efficiency commission with the task of cutting \u201cred tape\u201d. 6. What does it all add up to? Trump only has four years as president so will be in a hurry to move forward with his tax cuts, import tariffs, energy policy and deregulation. But the chances are that lower taxes will have a sugar rush effect, with their impact fading as dearer imports and higher interest rates slow the economy. The risks of it going wrong are high. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 November 20214. Figures from the Tax Foundation of the estimated income from 10% and 20% universal tariffs have been calculated over 10 years, not annually as an earlier version said."

            "date": "2024-11-07T06:13:06Z",
            "content": "Two million people in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state could face starvation within months because fierce conflict and trade blockades have led to a \u201ctotal economic collapse\u201d and the imminent risk of famine, a senior UN official has warned. Rakhine state, which borders Bangladesh in the west, is on the brink of disaster, as people\u2019s incomes crater, rice cultivation plummets, and military-imposed trade restrictions lead to severe food shortages and hyperinflation, according to forthcoming research from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which accuses the military of inflicting \u201ccollective punishment\u201d on civilians. Some people have resorted to eating rice bran, normally used as animal feed, to stave off hunger. Kanni Wignaraja, UN assistant secretary general and regional director for the UNDP told the Guardian the situation was unprecedented in Myanmar. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen this [before] \u2013 such a total \u2026 economic collapse. \u201cIf this projects into 2025, which seems very likely, then you\u2019re going to see close to 2 million people at starvation point,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of the households we surveyed are cutting rations now to a single meal a day \u2013 some even less.\u201d There has also been increased borrowing, she said, though even money lenders have little to loan. UNDP\u2019s research suggests that more than half of households in Rakhine, about 1.4 million people, will have seen their monthly income plunge from 66,600 kyat ($31.70) to about 46,620 kyat ($22.21) after the escalation in fighting late last year. This is barely enough to cover the cost of rice, without even factoring in other food items or expenses related to their rent or shelter, transport or health needs. Food prices soar ten-fold Myanmar has been gripped by a spiralling conflict and economic crisis since the military seized power in February 2021. The coup was met with determined resistance from the public, and many took up arms to fight for the return of democracy. Older, ethnic armed groups that have long sought greater autonomy have also fought against the junta, sometimes in coordination with newer groups. The conflict in Rakhine state, on Myanmar\u2019s border with Bangladesh, re-erupted late last year, and the state remains gripped by intense fighting between the military and the Arakan Army, an ethnic Rakhine group that wants an autonomous state. The UNDP report said restrictions put in place by the military were \u201cclearly aimed at isolating Rakhine from the rest of the country and exacting \u2018collective punishment\u2019 on an already vulnerable population\u201d. Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing has previously rejected the accusations, blaming instead the Arakan Army for \u201cdestroying the socio-economic life of residents, education and health sector\u201d. The interior ministry has been contacted for further comment. The situation is especially desperate for the 511,000 displaced people in Rakhine, including Rohingya, who rely on aid from humanitarian agencies and the community. Access was \u201cseverely limited\u201d for aid agencies, Wignaraja said, hampered by military-imposed bureaucratic hurdles, such as requirements for special permits, as well as the intensity of the conflict. Basic health programmes such as immunisation campaigns have stopped, HIV patients cannot access antiretroviral medicines. In July, more than three dozen children were confirmed to have died during a diarrhoea outbreak, according to the UNDP. The real number of deaths could be higher. Even paracetamol is essentially unobtainable because it is so expensive. A single blister \u2013 a strip of 12 capsules - is sold at between 6,000 to 7,000 kyat ($2.86-3.33). The conflict has brought the construction sector, a major source of employment, to a standstill, and driven hundreds of thousands of people from their homes. At the same time, the cost of essential foods such as rice and cooking oil has skyrocketed nearly ten-fold in the worst-hit areas, according to UNDP. It has predicted that only 97,000 tons of rice will be produced this year, enough to cover just 20% of the population\u2019s needs. This is down from 282,000 tons last year, which even then met only 60% of the need. The number of trade routes bringing supplies into Rakhine has fallen to two from 8-10 routes that existed prior to October 2023. Wignaraja said this fall was due to a mix of factors including military-imposed restrictions, the intensity of the conflict, the collapse in demand as incomes have disappeared and the growth in illegal economic activities. \u2018This is much larger than a famine\u2019 To avert the very worst scenario, UNDP has called for all restrictions to be lifted so commercial goods can flow in and out of Rakhine, including through Myanmar\u2019s borders with India and Bangladesh, and for unimpeded access for aid workers. Funding was needed to urgently to allow operations to expand, UNDP\u2019s report said. However, Wignaraja said the crisis in Myanmar had reached a point where day to day relief work could not do more than \u201cstave off hunger maybe till the next day\u201d. \u201cThis is also much larger than a famine. It\u2019s a political disaster and a collapse,\u201d she added. \u201cIt needs an all-out politically mediated settlement \u2013 which has to be the rest of the world coming together, [it] could be led by the immediate regional players and Asean [Association of Southeast Asian Nations], with the UN support.\u201d The lack of international attention given to Myanmar, she said, was \u201cvery, very troubling given the intensity of what\u2019s going on\u201d. The number of Rohingya taking dangerous boat journeys to try to reach Indonesia last month rose sharply compared with the same period last year. At least 395 Rohingya refugees, including 173 children, arrived in Indonesia by boat in October, compared with 49 recorded in the same month in 2023, according to UN figures cited by Save the Children. Wignaraja said the situation for Rohingya in Rakhine state was \u201cabsolutely desperate\u201d. \u201cEverything that the general population faces, you can extend that 10 times or more to the Rohingya population,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen people are desperate, they\u2019re going to try everything,\u201d said Wignaraja. \u201cOnce you put your children on a boat you know you have lost all other hope,\u201d she said."

            "content": "Global stock markets fell and bond prices have jumped after reports that Ukraine had fired a US-made long-range missile into Russia for the first time and Vladimir Putin approved changes to Moscow\u2019s nuclear doctrine. Investors dashed into safe-haven currencies such as the US dollar, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc on Tuesday, after the RBC-Ukraine news outlet reported that Kyiv had carried out its first strike on Russian territory using western-supplied missiles. Moscow said later that Ukraine had fired six US-made Atacms missiles at Russia\u2019s Bryansk region, after Joe Biden\u2019s decision last weekend to relax restrictions on their use. Senior US and Ukrainian officials confirmed that US-made Atacms missiles had been fired into Russian territory. Earlier on Tuesday, Putin signed a decree lowering the threshold for using nuclear weapons. The revised doctrine declares that a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack. Concerns that the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has passed its 1,000th day, was escalating hit stock markets in Europe. The Stoxx 600 share index dropped over 1% to its lowest since August. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index was down 0.5% in afternoon trading, towards the three-month low hit last week, at 8,070 points. New York opened in the red, with the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 large US companies dropping by 0.8%, and the broader S&amp;P 500 losing 0.4%. Wall Street\u2019s fear index, the Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s CBOE Volatility Index, jumped by almost 10%. Markets were \u201crattled\u201d that Ukraine had fired US-supplied long-range missiles into Russia, hurting the euro, said Fawad Razaqzada, a market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com. Razaqzada said: \u201cThe big worry here is how Russia is going to respond now. President Vladimir Putin\u2019s approval of an updated nuclear doctrine [broadens] the conditions under which Russia might deploy nuclear weapons, including in response to a large-scale conventional attack on its territory. \u201cUse of atomic weapons is unthinkable, but we are getting close to very dangerous territories.\u201d In the foreign exchange markets, the pound slipped by a third of a cent against the US dollar, to $1.265, while the euro lost 0.25% against the Swiss franc and the dollar. \u201cGeopolitical does not matter for financial markets until it does,\u201d said Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies. \u201cWhen US equipment is striking Russia and Russia mentions nuclear, you have to pay attention.\u201d UK, US and eurozone governments were also a popular safe-haven, which pushed down the yield, or interest rate, on the debt. Investors were also unsettled that two undersea cables in the Baltic have been mysteriously severed. The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said on Tuesday that sabotage was suspected. There are also signs that the market rally prompted by Donald Trump\u2019s election win two weeks ago has fizzled out, leading to a drop in share prices at the end of last week. Analysts have said that the president-elect\u2019s policies on trade tariffs and mass deportations of illegal immigrants would cause disruption to some industries and also push up prices."

            "date": "2024-11-27T12:25:48Z",
            "content": "The food delivery company Just Eat Takeaway is to delist from the London Stock Exchange to cut costs, in a further blow to the UK\u2019s international financial standing. Just Eat will now only be listed on the Amsterdam stock market, where the company is headquartered. The company said the London delisting resulted from restarting a review into where its shares should be listed. It cited the \u201cadministrative burden, complexity and costs associated with the disclosure and regulatory requirements of maintaining the LSE listing\u201d, low liquidity and the trading volumes of its shares on the London market. Europe\u2019s largest meal delivery company has been grappling with the end of the pandemic-fuelled boost to online food orders and tough competition from other delivery services. The decision to delist comes only weeks after Just Eat announced it was selling its US arm, Grubhub, at a considerable loss, only four years after buying the US app in a multibillion-dollar tie-up after the first Covid lockdowns. Giving the required 20 business days\u2019 notice of its delisting, Wednesday\u2019s announcement means the company\u2019s shares will trade for the last day in London just before Christmas, on 24 December. Given the festive stock market closure over the following two days, the delisting will take effect from 8am on 27 December. After that date it will be possible for investors to trade the company\u2019s shares only on Euronext Amsterdam. Just Eat said it did not expect the London delisting to have an effect on its shareholders who hold their shares in Amsterdam. Just Eat advised its investors who hold the company\u2019s shares in London to consult their own investment advisers and brokers on what to do about their shareholding, including how they could convert their holdings into shares that can be traded in Amsterdam. A spokesperson for Just Eat said the London delisting was part of its \u201cstrategy to accelerate growth\u201d as the company looked at \u201cenhancing efficiencies\u201d, and the UK continued to be a key market. They added: \u201cWith our network now covering 97% of the UK population, we remain committed to continuing our investment and cementing our leadership position in the country.\u201d Just Eat delisted from the US tech-focused Nasdaq exchange in 2022, blaming the \u201ccomplexity and costs\u201d associated with maintaining the listing. At the time, the company used very similar wording to Wednesday\u2019s announcement to describe its reasons for getting rid of its third stock market listing. It said the decision to delist from the Nasdaq would lead to \u201csubstantial cost saving\u201d and a reduction in compliance requirements. Just Eat\u2019s decision to leave London is yet another disappointment for the UK\u2019s blue-chip index, coming weeks after the buy now, pay later company Klarna filed for its much-anticipated flotation in the US instead of Britain. Claire Trachet, the chief executive of the business advisory firm Trachet, said Just Eat\u2019s comments about low trading volumes of its shares on the LSE were a worry. \u201cThe biggest concern lies in the comments about liquidity and volume, especially considering that 15-20 years ago, London was the leading destination for both,\u201d she said. \u201cFor Just Eat, ultimately it seems that the cost of dual listing on the LSE has not delivered the expected rewards and therefore didn\u2019t merit the added cost.\u201d A recent survey of FTSE 350 companies found that British boards are sceptical about the recovery of the LSE. More than half (53%) of business leaders surveyed told the report published by the Chartered Governance Institute UK &amp; Ireland that they expected the City to continue to experience net delistings over the next five years."

By mid-morning on the New York stock exchange, company shares had climbed as high as $11.67, more than double the day\u2019s opening price. Unusual Machines also said Trump Jr, the oldest son of the president-elect, was among its investors. A filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission listed Trump Jr as the second-biggest shareholder. In a press release that described Trump Jr as \u201ca globally recognized business leader\u201d and \u201cbest-selling author\u201d, Evans said he would \u201cbring a wealth of experience\u201d. Trump, typically referred to as Don Jr, has spent most of his adult life working for his father\u2019s company, the Trump Organization, on real estate and branding. But he has risen to political prominence since his sister Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, distanced themselves from Donald Trump following his defeat by Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election and incitement of the January 6 attack on Congress by Trump supporters who tried in vain to overturn his loss. This year, Trump Jr was widely held to have helped steer the Ohio senator, JD Vance, onto the Republican ticket which defeated the Democratic ticket of the vice-president, Kamala Harris, and her running mate and Minnesota governor, Tim Walz. On Wednesday, Trump Jr said: \u201cThe need for drones is obvious. It is also obvious that we must stop buying Chinese drones and Chinese drone parts. I love what Unusual Machines is doing to bring drone manufacturing jobs back to the USA.\u201d That was in line with statements from his father the president-elect, who has long said he will impose hefty tariffs on Chinese imports. Unusual Machines, however, says in its SEC filing it \u201chas been heavily dependent on Chinese imports for our products and operations\u201d. Referring to brands of drones and equipment, it said: \u201cA substantial majority of Rotor Riot\u2019s products are manufactured, directly and indirectly, using Chinese vendors. Fat Shark\u2019s primary contract manufacturer is Shenzhen Fat Shark Technology Ltd \u2026 which is located in Shenzhen, China.\u201d Unusual Machines did not immediately comment further."

            "date": "2024-11-27T18:03:29Z",
            "content": "Delistings from the London Stock Exchange (LSE) are routinely described as a \u201cblow\u201d, but some hits are painless. The departure of Just Eat Takeaway is one. The delivery firm\u2019s life in London will mainly be remembered for a horribly timed and hubristic acquisition that impoverished the poor old shareholders. The only charitable spin to put on the $7.3bn (\u00a35.8bn) purchase of Grubhub, a US business, in 2021 is that Just Eat\u2019s directors, led by Jitse Groen, the chief executive, must have been suffering a collective case of lockdown fever. Swayed by the boom in demand for takeaways during the Covid pandemic, they grabbed Grubhub at a takeover premium of 40%, even though no easy cost savings were available. Last week. Grubhub was sold for a mere $650m. At least the deal was an all-share transaction \u2013 the US firm\u2019s investors got 30% of the combined entity. If cash had changed hands, the damage to Just Eat\u2019s share price would have been even worse. As it was, the top to bottom fall was almost 90%. One can note that Just Eat\u2019s shareholders foolishly voted for the Grubhub deal by a big majority, but it was still a shocker. Those investors will have to trade their shares exclusively on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange after Christmas, but that is what they have been doing already, more or less. The London quote is merely a secondary listing and attracts only 2% of the trading volume on an average day. In those circumstances, it is understandable that the company wishes to avoid what it calls the \u201cadministrative burden, complexity and costs\u201d of a London listing. The main lesson here is just that secondary listings don\u2019t work unless the company is enormous. Liquidity naturally tends to gravitate to one venue. Just Eat, worth a middling \u00a32.6bn these days, had already ditched the US Nasdaq listing that was inherited with the Grubhub deal, so London is not being singled out for special punishment. The UK, as Just Eat was keen to emphasise, will still be one of the firm\u2019s big markets for delivering pizzas and other stuff (so there will be no relief from the irritating ads). But the corporate home has been Dutch ever since Groen\u2019s Takeaway.com acquired Just Eat in 2020 in a deal that was more like a merger. At the time, Just Eat, version one, was a FTSE 100 stock, but the Dutch deal effectively signalled the end of its UK identity. None of which is to deny that the LSE is suffering deep problems of lack of dynamism, especially in the sub-\u00a35bn category of company. There is a desperate need for exciting arrivals. But Just Eat\u2019s exit is not a case of a UK company running away in search of a higher share rating, which is the usual reason to worry. The decision flows instead from mundane and rational administrative considerations. There is no need for mourning on this occasion, especially given the share price performance since the Grubhub silliness."

            "date": "2024-11-26T18:21:20Z",
            "content": "London\u2019s historic Smithfield meat market is to close for good after the City of London Corporation voted to pull out of plans to relocate it and Billingsgate fish market to Dagenham. The corporation, which owns and operates the central London site of the centuries-old market, had earlier this month put on hold relocation plans to a new \u00a31bn site in Dagenham, east London, to review the \u201cfinancial sustainability\u201d of the planned move. The court of common council, the main decision-making body for the corporation, voted on Tuesday to pull out of running the sites. A market has existed around the Smithfield site for more than 800 years. The corporation was given the right to run it and other wholesale food markets in 1327 by Edward III. The current market site was built in the 1860s and opened in 1868. It was designed by the architect Horace Jones, who also designed Billingsgate when it was redeveloped in the 19th century. The UK\u2019s largest inland fish market was moved to its current site in Canary Wharf in 1982. The corporation said it will provide financial compensation to market traders, who will be able to continue their operations at the markets until at least 2028. Compensation could total more than \u00a3300m, according to the Times. The authority is said to want to turn the Smithfield site into a mixed-use cultural development alongside the London Museum, which is in the process of relocating to part of the Smithfield site where the poultry market was. There are proposals to transform the land of the current Billingsgate site for a mixed-use housing scheme. Announcing the decision, the corporation said it was \u201cactively supporting traders to identify suitable new sites\u201d and they can continue their operations at Smithfield and Billingsgate until at least 2028. It added that its decision reflects a \u201ccareful balance between respecting the history of Smithfield and Billingsgate markets and managing resources for this project responsibly\u201d. Project costs had risen owing to a number of external factors, including inflation and the increasing cost of construction that have made the move unaffordable, it said. Both Smithfield and Billingsgate markets are governed by acts of parliament, effectively fixing the markets to the existing sites and imposing certain rights, restrictions and obligations as to the use of the land. A bill, which will be deposited in parliament on Wednesday, is required to repeal that legislation, and enable the land of the existing sites to be used for other purposes. Chris Hayward, the corporation\u2019s policy chair, said it was \u201ca positive new chapter for Smithfield and Billingsgate markets\u201d and the decision \u201cempowers traders to build a sustainable future in premises that align with their long-term business goals\u201d. \u201cBy stepping back from direct market operations, we will help to create opportunities for these businesses to thrive independently. We\u2019ve worked closely with the traders and thank them for their input and understanding. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to making sure they have the financial support and guidance they need to transition seamlessly and successfully to new locations.\u201d The Times reported that three king\u2019s counsel barristers, who sit on the 100-strong court, had written to the corporation\u2019s \u201ctown clerk\u201d warning that the private vote could be \u201cunlawful\u201d because a study into the importance of the markets to London\u2019s food supply, demanded by the court this year, has not yet been produced. The corporation told the Times that its own lawyers were \u201csatisfied\u201d with the legality of the vote. Meanwhile, Henry Pollard, the chair of the markets committee, had written to his court colleagues warning that \u201cthe process here is wrong\u201d, criticising the lack of a food security report and warning that the additional compensation to the traders \u2013 \u201can unquantified amount [of] over \u00a3300m\u201d \u2013 could be a misuse of public funds, it was reported. Dominic Twomey, the leader of Barking and Dagenham council, said: \u201cWhile this is disappointing news, we understand the financial pressures that key investment projects are facing with soaring inflation in recent years. We are committed to continue working with the City of London Corporation to unlock the huge potential of the Dagenham dock site to bring new employment uses and high quality jobs for local people.\u201d The corporation \u2013 which is one of the country\u2019s wealthiest local authorities but has its own financial pressures \u2013 has reportedly already spent \u00a3308m on the markets move, including a \u00a3115m compensation payment to traders in Smithfield\u2019s poultry market which shut last year."

            "content": "Australians\u2019 wages have increased faster than inflation for a fourth quarter in a row, bringing some relief to households battling with cost-of-living pressures. The wage price index rose at an annual rate of 3.5% in the September quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. That result compared with a pace of 3.6% expected by economists and the 4.1% rate reported by the ABS for the June quarter. Annual headline consumer inflation was 2.8% for the July-September period. On a quarterly basis, the WPI was up 0.8%, compared with market expectations of a 0.9% increase and the June quarter\u2019s 0.8% advance. Quarterly CPI was just 0.2%. The easing in wage price increases was roughly matched across both the public and private sectors. Public sector employees saw their wages rise a seasonally adjusted 3.7%, the lowest annual rate since the September quarter of 2022. For the private sector, where about four in five people are employed, wages were up 3.5%, or matching the annual increase in the September quarter of 2023. The latest wage increase marks a year of rises after adjusting for inflation. While welcome, the gain will only partly claw back some of the retreat when prices took off much faster than wages in late 2022 into 2023. The Reserve Bank of Australia will home that real wage increases don\u2019t stoke inflation, meaning interest rates would have to stay high for longer. Prior to Wednesday\u2019s data, investors weren\u2019t fully pricing in a cut to the cash rate until July. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email National Australia Bank\u2019s monthly business survey, released on Tuesday, though, found that labour cost growth has continued to ease, dropping from a quarterly pace of 1.9% in the three months to September to 1.4% in the three months to October. The RBA will likely be content that wage increases are continuing to ebb, albeit at a slower pace than headline inflation. Employer-worker wage agreements tend to make wage increases a lagging indicator in the economy, particularly with the jobless rate close to the lowest in half a century. Stocks pared some of their losses in midday trading on Wednesday, in a modest sign investors were a bit more hopeful of a near-term interest rate cut. The Australian dollar was little changed, hovering a bit above 65.2 US cents. \u201cWage rises for many jobs can be directly or indirectly linked to the outcomes of the Fair Work Commission Annual Wage Review decision,\u201d said Michelle Marquardt, head of prices statistics at ABS. That decision resulted in a 3.75% wage increase 1 July 2024, or two percentage points lower than for the same quarter of 2023, Marquardt said. The ABS noted the proportion of jobs reporting a wage change was similar for the quarter \u2013 at about 45% \u2013 from the same period a year ago. The average size of hourly wage changes, though, was lower at 3.7% from 5.4% in the September quarter of 2023. Jim Chalmers welcomed the four quarters of real wage gains, with the treasurer describing the data as \u201cvery, very encouraging\u201d. \u201cReal wages growth is one of the things I focus most on,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cI read a lot of stuff over a period of time that said you couldn\u2019t have strong wages growth and have inflation moderating. We\u2019ve shown that\u2019s possible. We\u2019ve shown it\u2019s happening.\u201d \u201cThere is not a whiff of a wage-price spiral in our economy, and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said, adding \u201cwe\u2019ve got a lot of ground to make up\u201d. Catherine Birch, a senior ANZ economist, said wage growth had slowed across awards, enterprise bargaining agreements and individual arrangements. \u201cThis may give the RBA more confidence that wages growth is returning to a pace consistent with its inflation target band, in the face of continued weakness in productivity growth,\u201d Birch said. The ANZ continues to forecast the RBA\u2019s first rate reduction will land in February, although \u201cthe risks remain tilted towards a later start to cuts \u2026 given the slow pace of disinflation and labour market resilience\u201d. The ABS will release October labour market data on Thursday."

            "date": "2024-11-25T15:40:33Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump imposing massive US tariffs on Chinese imports could drag down global inflation by lowering the price of goods in other countries, a senior Bank of England policymaker has said. Swati Dhingra, an external member of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee, said Trump imposing a threatened 60% tariff on goods from China sold in the US could lead Chinese exporters to cut their prices elsewhere to ensure they maintained current trade volumes. \u201cIf there is the kind of big 60% type of tariff increase that\u2019s been proposed, that will have repercussions on to world prices, and mostly on the downward direction,\u201d she said. Speaking at a conference in London on Monday, the economist said there was heightened uncertainty about what policies the president-elect would carry through from the campaign trail. Trump warned before this month\u2019s election that he would slap tariffs of up to 60% on China and up to 20% on other US trade partners. However, Dhingra said the \u201ctextbook\u201d impact of the world\u2019s largest goods importer imposing such a large tariff on products from the world\u2019s biggest exporter would be for global goods prices to fall. Chinese firms would respond to tougher trade barriers by attempting to find buyers in alternative markets, which could lead them to lower their prices to sell similar volumes, including in the UK, she said. \u201cIt takes a massive amount of demand out of the world market. The way exporters, say in China, would respond to that would be to respond with prices, world prices, as they don\u2019t want to lose market share,\u201d she said. Economists have warned Trump imposing punitive import tariffs on US trading partners will drive up inflation in the world\u2019s largest economy, as the costs would be borne by US consumers. However, it would also affect the wider global economy. Dhingra said much would depend on the response to a burgeoning trade war, particularly if governments chose to retaliate with \u201ctit for tat\u201d tariffs on US imports, or with protectionist measures to prevent an influx of cheap Chinese goods reallocating away from the US market. \u201cThen we\u2019re in a completely different situation,\u201d she said. Drawing a comparison with Brexit, Dhingra said that leaving the EU had led to \u201cpermanently\u201d higher prices of products for British households. This had generated inflation as prices rose, before prices stabilised at a higher level. \u201cWe saw much higher price increases in the UK compared to everywhere else and those pressures have now come off much more quickly as well, for the reason they\u2019re not inflationary, they change the price levels, permanently,\u201d she said. Analysts have warned that the euro risks falling to parity with the US dollar for the first time since late 2022 if a new transatlantic trade war weakens the already struggling eurozone economy."

            "date": "2024-11-20T08:35:18Z",
            "content": "Any lingering hope that the Bank of England might deliver a pre-Christmas interest rate cut next month has evaporated, after official data showed inflation jumping to 2.3% in October. If it continues to rise in the coming months, Labour will be forced to defend itself against Tory claims that government policy is at least partly responsible. The CPI measure had been expected to creep up, after dipping to 1.7% in September, but 2.3% was stronger than predicted. September was the first time inflation had fallen below the Bank\u2019s 2% target since July 2021, and looks likely to be the last for a while. Not surprisingly, the Conservatives are keen to hammer home the message that any increase from now on is down to Labour. As the shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, put it in response to Wednesday\u2019s figures: \u201cLabour\u2019s budget will push up inflation and mortgage rates.\u201d It is a bold strategy from the party that gave us Liz Truss, as Labour will remind voters at every opportunity. Much of the explanation for last month\u2019s jump in inflation lies in energy prices, with Ofgem\u2019s quarterly price cap rising from October \u2013 in contrast with the same period last year, when utility bills were falling rapidly from the peak hit following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Electricity prices rose by 7.7% in October, the ONS said, having fallen by 7.5% last year. Gas prices increased by 11.7% in October, having fallen 7% last year. But there may be some truth in the coming months in the argument that the government has given inflation a (modest) boost. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has suggested Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget package could increase inflation by about 0.5%, including through stronger growth, resulting from higher-than-expected government spending. The Bank\u2019s governor, Andrew Bailey, has also made clear that he and his MPC colleagues would be closely monitoring how the policy changes were likely to affect the path of GDP and inflation. Retailers have said they expect to increase prices as they absorb the costs of rising employer national insurance contributions, the biggest money-raiser in the budget, which starts next April. Against that backdrop, economists now confidently expect the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) to wait until the new year before going further, after cutting rates to 4.75% earlier this month. Donald Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House is also giving policymakers pause: if he presses ahead with across-the-board tariffs, the short-term impact at least is likely to be inflationary. Responding to the inflation data on Wednesday, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, emphasised that the government knew there was still \u201cmore to do\u201d, pointing to measures including the significant increase in the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, due in April. The increase in CPI was not unexpected; but as the UK enters a cold snap, with energy bills on the rise, the government will be conscious that cash-strapped households are still feeling the pinch."

            "content": "A key measure of US inflation has risen for the first time since March, underlining its bumpy ride down to lower levels. The consumer price index (CPI), which measures price growth across a basket of goods, ticked up to an annual pace of 2.6% in October \u2013 from 2.4% in September, which had been the slowest rate in more than three years. Stripping out volatile food and energy costs, the closely watched \u201ccore\u201d inflation index held firm at 3.3%. The reading was in line with economists\u2019 expectations. Though inflation has fallen dramatically since peaking at a four-decade high in summer 2022, many Americans are still under pressure after years of price increases. Frustration over the cost of living appeared to play a major role in the election, with exit polls indicating that the majority of Republican voters were frustrated with the US economy and their financial situation. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump proffered tax cuts and tariffs as solutions, but questions have been raised about what such policies will actually mean for inflation. The president-elect has pledged to enact tariffs of at least 10% on all US imports, a policy that many economists say would probably lead to inflation going up as much as 5.1%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in four years in September, a key turning point in its battle to bring down inflation. It lowered rates again last week, to their lowest level since February 2023. At a press conference, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said the central bank \u201chas gained confidence that we\u2019re on a sustainable path down to 2%\u201d, its target for inflation, but added: \u201cThe job\u2019s not done.\u201d The Fed has been trying to carry out its \u201cdual mandate\u201d, managing price increases without triggering higher rates of unemployment. The labor market has slowed significantly over the last few months, with the US adding just 12,000 jobs in October. After hitting a low of 3.4% in February 2023, the unemployment rate in October was 4.1% \u2013 still a low rate, comparable with pre-pandemic levels. When asked whether the outcome of the election affects the Fed\u2019s decision on interest rates, Powell said officials \u201cdon\u2019t know what the timing and substance of any policy changes will be. We therefore don\u2019t know what the effects on the economy would be.\u201d"

The problem has been that, under austerity, from 2010 onwards, the NHS was afflicted by a severe shortage of funds. The former chair of a leading London hospital trust says that in 2010, after the Blair-Brown concentration of extra resources for the NHS, his hospital had no waiting list. But, as a senior NHS official told me at the time, in order to stand still the NHS needed real (that is, after-inflation) increases of about 4% a year. The Cameron government claimed that they were paying special attention to the NHS, but between 2010 and 2019 the annual increase was less than 1.5%. Another welcome aspect of the budget was the emphasis on investment, and easing the fiscal rules somewhat. However, this has not prevented a barrage of negative comment from thinktanks and certain sections of the press. And not without reason. By hoisting herself with her own petard \u2013 no increases in income tax, VAT or employee national insurance \u2013 the chancellor found herself resorting to some deeply unpopular taxes that have caused quite a furore, and whose revenue gains are far from certain. In particular, the increases in employer national insurance contributions has proved an own goal, with few people believing that, as it works through to prices, this is not in effect also a tax on \u201cworking people\u201d. Thus, having honoured a commitment not to raise the other taxes, Reeves is nevertheless open to the charge of breaking an election promise. But my strongest criticism is of the omission, once again, of what Neil Kinnock calls \u201cthe mammoth in the broom cupboard\u201d \u2013 Brexit, and the government\u2019s continued obsession with its \u201cred lines\u201d, which rule out applying to re-enter the customs union and single market. Moreover, reports from Brussels suggest it is not obvious from there that the UK is making much headway with \u201cresetting\u201d our trading relationship. Which brings us to the issue which is on so many lips: the prospect of the second Trump presidency, this time with precious few constitutional restraints. The previous UK government got nowhere with the fatuous idea that a special trading relationship with the US could make up for the damage caused by opting out of our EU trading privileges. Because Trump\u2019s observations about trade and tariffs are so wild and often inconsistent, it is difficult to know what this notoriously transactional man will settle on, but the omens do not look good. It is almost laughable that our government, having sensibly feared the prospect of a Trump victory, is now trying to comfort itself by resorting to that old cliche: the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. What Britain actually needs is the shelter of the EU, and, with their own burgeoning troubles, the EU countries need us. One of Keir Starmer\u2019s understandable obsessions is trying to overcome the criminal gangs that exploit would-be migrants to this country. But the prime minister reportedly said last week that Brexit had made cooperation on this issue with other countries difficult. Well, well, well. People are comparing the Trump vote to our own Brexit vote: the frustration or revenge of the \u201cleft behind\u201d in reaction to globalisation and the supposed arrogance of the elite. In fact, many voters who were wooed in the UK by the Brexit crowd now realise they were conned, and the \u201cleft behind\u201d Trump supporters are in for a nasty surprise when higher tariffs make their living costs even worse. The famous motto \u201cit\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d was double-edged in the US this time. The macroeconomic figures looked reasonable, but even though the pace of inflation slowed down, the previous surge in US prices was not reversed and the cost of living seems to have been a major factor in the election. But back to the UK. Reeves is constantly concerned by market reactions. Her budget was regarded as mildly inflationary, with an inevitable impact on the course of interest rates. But the UK is a small participant in world financial markets. With markets expecting Trump\u2019s tax cuts and tariff policy also to be inflationary, there could be adverse consequences for US interest rates, and repercussions here."

            "date": "2024-11-20T16:03:02Z",
            "content": "Senate Republicans must soon consider several of Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet picks whose nominations were met with intense criticism: Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, Matt Gaetz as attorney general, Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense and Robert F Kennedy Jr as secretary of health and human services. Each of those cabinet announcements landed with somewhat of a thud on Capitol Hill, raising questions about whether the nominees will be able to muster the majority-level support needed in the Senate to get confirmed. But the president-elect has proposed an archaic and in recent years little-used mechanism to get his nominees installed without Senate confirmation: recess appointments. \u201cAny Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner,\u201d Trump said earlier this month. \u201cWe need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\u201d If Trump pursues a strategy of recess appointments, it could severely curtail the Senate\u2019s power to serve as a check on the new president\u2019s nominations and allow controversial picks to move forward. Here\u2019s everything to know about recess appointments: What does the constitution say about Senate confirmation of presidential nominations? Article 2, section 2 of the US constitution states that the president \u201cshall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States\u201d. Hundreds of senior officials in the federal government, including all members of the president\u2019s cabinet, are subject to Senate approval, meaning they need the support of a majority of the 100-member upper chamber to be confirmed. How do recess appointments allow a president to circumvent the Senate confirmation process? Although the US constitution outlines how the Senate serves as a check on presidential nominations, it also provides an alternate route for installing officials who are usually subject to the confirmation process. Article 2, section 2 further states that the president \u201cshall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session\u201d. This allows the president to install nominees in posts that might otherwise go vacant while the Senate is out of session. If Trump were to utilize recess appointments at the start of his term, those appointees could stay in their posts until the end of the next Senate session, or until the end of 2026. Why do recess appointments exist? Recess appointments have been criticized as an anachronism dating back to the country\u2019s founding, when Congress was in session much less frequently than it is now and correspondence over an important vacancy in the federal government could take weeks. Today, when instant communication and air travel are the norm, the idea that the president may need to rely on recess appointments to fill key government posts appears absurd, sparking criticism of the practice in recent years. Have other recent presidents relied on recess appointments? According to the Congressional Research Service, Bill Clinton made 139 recess appointments, while George W Bush made 171 recess appointments. But Barack Obama only made 32 recess appointments, as the supreme court issued a critical ruling on the practice during his presidency. In its 2014 decision of NLRB v Noel Canning, the court ruled that several of Obama\u2019s recess appointments had violated the constitution because the Senate was not out of session long enough to merit those appointments. The court noted that a Senate recess of at least 10 days is required to allow for recess appointments. In recent years, particularly when the Senate and the White House have been controlled by opposing parties, Senate majority leaders have relied on pro forma sessions, in which no real congressional business is conducted, to limit recesses. For that reason, neither Trump nor Biden had any recess appointments. Would Senate Republicans allow Trump to use recess appointments for his cabinet nominees? That remains unclear, although the newly elected Senate majority leader, Republican John Thune of South Dakota, has suggested he is open to the idea. \u201cWe must act quickly and decisively to get the president\u2019s nominees in place as soon as possible, [and] all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWe cannot let Schumer and Senate [Democrats] block the will of the American people.\u201d That being said, Thune acknowledged that it might be difficult to recess the chamber if a substantial number of Republican senators oppose a particular nomination. \u201cYou have to have all Republicans vote to recess as well,\u201d Thune told Fox News last week. \u201cSo the same Republicans \u2026 that might have a problem voting for somebody under regular order probably also have a problem voting to put the Senate into recess.\u201d Another complication is the role of the House in the recess process, as the constitution stipulates that neither the House nor the Senate can adjourn for more than three days without the consent of the other chamber. But the House speaker, the Republican Mike Johnson, has suggested he is open to a recess. \u201cI believe in the principle of the president being able to choose his team,\u201d Johnson told Fox News on Sunday. \u201cIf this thing bogs down, it would be a great detriment to the country, to the American people.\u201d Senate Democrats could attempt to at least slow the recess appointment process by holding a vote-a-rama, a tedious and lengthy procedure that could force the chamber to stay in session, but such tactics are unlikely to change the final outcome when Republicans hold a 53-47 majority. If Republicans did clear the way for recess appointments, they could significantly damage one of the Senate\u2019s most important functions at a time when their party has just won a governing trifecta in Washington. Such a decision would only further underscore the iron grip Trump has over the Republican party."

            "date": "2024-11-02T10:00:12Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden promised a \u201crecovery for everybody\u201d as he prepared to take over an economy ravaged by the pandemic four years ago. Few predicted what would follow. One of two candidates \u2013 Kamala Harris, his vice-president, and Donald Trump, his predecessor \u2013 will succeed Biden in January. As millions prepare to elect the next US president, here is how the world\u2019s largest economy fared under Biden. Inflation The shock waves unleashed by Covid-19 were still rippling across the world when Biden took office in January 2021. In the US, and many other economies, they set the stage for an extraordinary rise in inflation. For months, the White House and Federal Reserve insisted the factors driving this surging price growth were \u201ctransitory\u201d. By the time the consumer price index peaked, reaching its highest level in a generation in June 2022, officials had changed their minds. The Fed embarked upon an aggressive campaign to tackle inflation in March 2022. Interest rates \u2013 cut to close to zero at the outset of the pandemic \u2013 were increased at 11 meetings, to a two-decade high. Suddenly the central fear looming over the US economy was not runaway inflation, but the specter of recession. As the Fed scrambled to cool activity in an attempt to tackle prices, warnings of a prolonged downturn cast a shadow. Jobs Such effects failed to materialize. The US economy remained remarkably resilient. Millions of jobs were created in the labor market. Non-farm payrolls, the key monthly measure used to take the temperature of the US economy, held firm. Unemployment slipped to lows not seen in half a century. About 399,000 jobs were added each month in 2022, on average \u2013 followed by about 225,000 each month in 2023. While growth has trended lower over the past year, and essentially flatlined in October amid disruptions wreaked by strikes and storms, hiring in September proved unexpectedly strong. The robust data sparked hope that policymakers would successfully guide the US economy to a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d, with price growth normalized and recession avoided. The Fed started to cut rates in September. When officials at the central bank make their next decision on Thursday, two days after the election, they are widely expected to cut rates further. Food prices While the US economy has remained remarkably resilient, many Americans have not been feeling it. The vibes have been off. Earlier this year, a clear majority of Americans wrongly believed the US was in an economic recession, according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. This gloom had only shifted slightly by the time pollsters reran the survey in September. Positive economic data releases \u2013 softening inflation, healthy recruitment levels, steady growth \u2013 are unlikely to move the needle when your bank balance continues to dwindle. The cumulative effect of years of inflation are still taking a toll. Falling inflation does not mean falling prices. The grocery store bills which rose so rapidly in 2021 and 2022 have not crashed back down to earth. For many Americans, the cost of living is much higher today than it was four years ago. Stock markets For Biden\u2019s predecessor, and potential successor, no barometer of US economic success was greater than Wall Street. Reassuring his Twitter (now X) followers that Covid-19 was \u201cvery much under control\u201d in the US in February 2020, Trump added: \u201cStock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d It has been looking even better under his successor. The S&amp;P 500 has rallied by more than half since Biden took office at the start of 2021, and all the major stock market indexes have hit new highs under his tenure."

            "date": "2024-11-07T12:14:32Z",
            "content": "Food sales at Sainsbury\u2019s have been boosted by a return to the office and fewer people dining out in restaurants, as the retailer warned of possible price rises as a result of having to pay \u00a3140m more next year in national insurance contributions [NICs]. The supermarket chain\u2019s pre-tax profits were \u00a3356m for the six months to mid-September, up 4.7% on the same period last year, driven by a 5% increase in sales in its grocery business. However, its chief executive, Simon Roberts, said prices were likely to increase after the rise in NICs in last week\u2019s budget. Sainsbury\u2019s said grocery sales were benefiting from changes in customer behaviour, as the return of consumers to the office had led to more people carrying out one large shop each week rather than more frequent visits with smaller purchases. Roberts said: \u201cThere is a big return to the big weekly shop, and we\u2019re winning those big weekly shops just at a time that more and more people are going back to the office more days a week and going back to that weekly shop.\u201d The supermarket chain has also benefited from shoppers opting to dine in for special occasions, rather than going out to restaurants. \u201cAnother key trend we\u2019re seeing is customers continuing to choose to eat more at home, as eating out has become more expensive, and they\u2019re recognising more and more the restaurant quality of our Taste the Difference ranges,\u201d Roberts said. In the first half of the year, Sainsbury\u2019s recorded an 18% increase in sales of its Taste the Difference range compared with the same period a year earlier. Despite the increased sales in the grocery business, Argos faced a \u201ctough first quarter\u201d, with sales down 5% on the same period last year. Roberts said the decision by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to increase employers\u2019 NICs by 1.2% to 15% from April would lead to price inflation. \u201cThis industry operates on very low margins, and there just isn\u2019t the capacity in the structure of the way the supermarket industry works to absorb these level of costs without some impacts on inflation. \u201cI think given the speed these costs are coming at, they will be inflationary. We\u2019ll do everything we can to mitigate that impact but there will be inflationary impacts, because our costs are going up.\u201d On Wednesday, Marks &amp; Spencer reported that it could face \u00a360m in extra costs from the NIC rise, and that the long-term impact of the budget policies on suppliers and customers was uncertain. Roberts was critical of the government\u2019s decision not to take action on business rates in the budget, despite it being included in its manifesto. Sainsbury\u2019s pays more than \u00a3500m in business rates each year, with 80% of its stores valued above the \u00a3500,000 threshold at which the levy kicks in. \u201cI think [changes to business rates] was a clear expectation that we saw in the manifesto, and we would strongly urge government to move more quickly on the reform of business rates for all retail stores,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIn fact, now on the outcome of last week, business rates next year will actually go up for us.\u201d In the budget Reeves also put forward plans to remove the agricultural property relief inheritance tax exemption from farms worth more than \u00a31m. The decision has sparked fury in the farming community, with the National Farmers\u2019 Union planning a major protest later this month in London to urge that the policy be reversed. Roberts called on the government to listen to the concerns of farmers, particularly as they faced increased production and labour costs, saying: \u201cGiven the concerns that farmers are raising, and the critical role they play in our country, I really urge the government to listen to them and try to find a solution.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s shares fell by nearly 2% in early trading on Thursday."

            "date": "2024-11-07T12:01:11Z",
            "content": "Mortgage borrowers have been put on notice that interest rates will take longer to come down after the Bank of England warned Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget would add to inflation while boosting economic growth. Giving its verdict on last week\u2019s budget as it announced a quarter-point cut in interest rates to 4.75% on Thursday, the central bank said the chancellor\u2019s plans would drive up inflation to a fresh peak next year. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted by a majority of eight to one to reduce rates for the second time this year to ease the pressure on households and businesses from high borrowing costs. However, it said Reeves\u2019s \u00a370bn of additional spending backed by higher taxes and borrowing would add about 0.5 percentage points to headline inflation by the middle of next year and 0.75% to gross domestic product (GDP). Updating its forecasts after taking budget measures into account, the Bank said it expected inflation would now peak at 2.75% by the middle of next year and then remain above the 2% target in 2026, until falling back in 2027 \u2013 a year longer than it had expected in its previous forecasts, published in August. The pound rose against the US dollar after the Bank\u2019s decision to cut rates, while financial markets reacted by betting that Threadneedle Street would cut interest rates fewer times and at a slower pace over the coming year. \u201cWhile cutting interest rates from 5% to 4.75% today, the Bank of England implied that the budget means rates will continue to fall only gradually,\u201d said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. He said rates were now on track to fall to about 3.5% by early 2026 rather than to 3%. Threadneedle Street said it expected the government\u2019s increasing of the rate of employer national insurance contributions (NICs) and the \u201cnational living wage\u201d risked adding to inflationary pressures if companies passed on the costs in the form of lower wage rises and higher prices in the shops. Other measures including raising the cap on bus fares and VAT on private schools could also push prices up. The development led one member of the MPC, the external economist Catherine Mann, to push for interest rates to be held at 5%. Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said the slower pace of rate cuts would have an impact for hard-pressed households. \u201cThe fact so few cuts are expected during 2025 will be a blow for anyone who was hoping for their mortgage to be less of a burden in the coming months,\u201d she said. The Bank of England\u2019s governor, Andrew Bailey, signalled that borrowing costs were still likely to come down in future, although cautioned against expectations for rapid action. \u201cWe need to make sure inflation stays close to target, so we can\u2019t cut interest rates too quickly or by too much. But if the economy evolves as we expect it\u2019s likely that interest rates will continue to fall gradually from here,\u201d he said. Inflation fell back to 1.7% in September \u2013 after peaking at 11.1% in October 2022 \u2013 but was already on track to return to above 2% after an increase in the Ofgem energy price cap for households in Great Britain in October. Reeves said the interest rate cut would be \u201cwelcome news\u201d for millions of families but that households were still facing a challenge after Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget. She said: \u201cToday\u2019s interest rate cut will be welcome news for millions of families, but I am under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing households after the previous government\u2019s mini-budget. \u201cThis government\u2019s first budget has set out how we are taking the long-term decisions to fix the foundations to deliver change by investing in the NHS and rebuilding Britain, while ensuring working people don\u2019t face higher taxes in their payslips.\u201d With expectations that Donald Trump\u2019s US election victory would also pave the way for renewed inflationary pressures in the world economy, Bailey said a \u201cgradual\u201d approach to cutting borrowing costs was required. He signalled the Bank would \u201cwait and see\u201d if Trump would impose sweeping import tariffs on America\u2019s trading partners \u2013 as threatened by the president-elect during the campaign \u2013 while saying it was too early to \u201cprejudge what might happen\u201d. However, he warned Britain was an open economy exposed to disruptions in global trade. \u201cWe do have to watch very carefully the fragmentation of the world economy \u2026 There are a lot of risks attached,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is greater uncertainty out there. First of all there is greater global uncertainty, without a doubt. The second thing to say is, of course there are domestic uncertainties. We need to obviously see how the budget measures pass through in terms of their economic effects.\u201d"

BT\u2019s chief executive, Allison Kirkby, revealed that changes to employers\u2019 national insurance contributions and increases in the minimum wage would add to its costs next year, with the company being forced to offset this through higher pricing and the use of AI to improve productivity. Kirkby, who took over at BT in February, told the Financial Times that the employers\u2019 NIC changes would account for about 70-75% of the cost increase, with the 6.7% rise in the national minimum wage accounting for the rest. She has joined bosses at Sainsbury\u2019s, Marks &amp; Spencer and Primark in highlighting the cost increases they face after Rachel Reeves\u2019s decision to increase employers\u2019 NIC by 1.2 percentage points to 15% from next April. The chancellor also cut the level at which employers start paying national insurance for workers from \u00a39,100 to \u00a35,000. Kirkby said: \u201cIt\u2019s a new inflationary pressure that we need to suffer in our business. We will be going harder and faster on the cost transformation and plans that we have already laid out.\u201d The comments came as BT reported a 10% drop in pre-tax profits to \u00a3967m for the six months to 30 September, while revenues fell 3% to \u00a310.1bn amid a \u201ccompetitive retail environment\u201d. It revised its outlook, with revenue expected to be down by 1% or 2% in 2024-25, compared with the increase of 1% that was forecast earlier in the year. It blamed this on trading outside the UK and reductions in sales of less profitable kits, as well as a weaker performance in the corporate and public sectors. The company kept its underlying earnings guidance unchanged, for about \u00a38.2bn. It revealed in its results that it had cut its workforce by 2,000, or 4%, taking its overall headcount to 118,000, and that this helped save the company \u00a3433m in annual costs. Last year BT revealed it was looking to slim down to between 75,000 and 90,000 workers by 2030 as it aimed to shave billions of pounds in costs. The company estimates that about 10,000 jobs in the long-term cuts will be replaced by artificial intelligence. In May, the group announced a further \u00a33bn in cuts over the coming years, as Kirkby expanded on plans to turn around the struggling company. She said at the time that BT had hit its initial target of \u00a33bn in savings a year before schedule, and that it would cut the same sum by 2029. Kirkby said that alongside widespread cost-cutting, the group was also investing heavily and ramping up its full-fibre rollout. \u201cOur nationwide full-fibre rollout has set new records, now reaching more than 16m premises, and we have further extended our industry-leading take-up rate to 35%.\u201d The group had also expanded its 5G network to cover 80% of the UK population. \u201cThe accelerated modernisation of our operations, combined with a focus on connecting the UK, puts us in a strong position,\u201d Kirkby added."

            "content": "When Musa al-Gharbi first arrived in New York in 2016, what he most noticed was the operation of a \u201cracialized caste system\u201d under which \u201cdisposable servants\u2026 will clean your house, watch your kids, walk your dogs, deliver prepared meals to you\u201d. The \u201cdisposable servants\u201d, who earned \u201cpeanuts for their work\u201d, were inevitably mainly black or Hispanic, the ones being served, almost exclusively white. No one remarked upon this; it was taken to be \u201cthe way normal society operates\u201d. Al-Gharbi was not describing the uber-rich Upper East Side or the billionaires\u2019 hangout of Scarsdale. He was a freshman at Columbia University. Those profiting from the \u201cracial caste system\u201d were fellow students, many of them vocal about social justice, but largely indifferent to the needs of those at the bottom of the social hierarchy on whose labour their lives rested. Four years later, many of these same students joined Black Lives Matter protests. Al-Gharbi watched as they demonstrated on Broadway in New York\u2019s Upper West Side, oblivious to the \u201chomeless Black men who didn\u2019t even have shoes\u201d sharing the same space. The protesters \u201cwere crowding the benches that homeless people were using\u201d, insisting that \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d, but apparently not \u201cthe Black guys right in front of them\u201d. This constant disparity between the professed beliefs of liberal students agitating for social justice and actions that revealed an indifference to the material injustice surrounding them led Al-Gharbi to write a book to try to make sense of it. We Have Never Been Woke has just been published in America and will soon be out in Britain. If you want to understand what just happened in the US election, it is one of the more useful starting points. For the story of the election can be viewed from one perspective as that of the division between those who can see the disparity that so struck Al-Gharbi and those who can\u2019t or won\u2019t. Given that the Columbia activists were ignoring the tangible injustice all around them, why did they adopt the language of social justice? Or, to put it another way, what role does that language play in a world in which real injustice and inequality are ignored? Those were the questions that bugged Al-Gharbi as a student and lie at the heart of his book. His answer is that the language of social justice \u2013 \u201cwokeness\u201d if you will \u2013 is not about social justice at all but acts rather as an ideological glue binding together a section of the elite that want to keep climbing the ladder of privilege but don\u2019t want to see themselves as part of the elite. \u201cWoke\u201d is not a particularly useful term, more often used in disparagement than in analysis. Al-Gharbi recognises this, disavowing it as a slur, refusing even to define it. What matters to him is how the concept is deployed in practice both by supporters and detractors. The key to understanding wokeness, Al-Gharbi insists, is the struggles of \u201csymbolic capitalists\u201d \u2013 \u201cprofessionals who traffic in symbols and rhetoric, images and narratives, data and analysis, ideas and abstraction\u201d. In other words, writers and academics, artists and lawyers, museum curators and tech professionals. It is a social stratum that attempts to entrench itself within the elite, elbowing out others already there, by using the language of social justice to gain status and accrue \u201ccultural capital\u201d. Theirs is a struggle within the elite presented as a struggle against the elite on behalf of the poor and the dispossessed. This is not simply cynicism or hypocrisy, Al-Gharbi argues. Symbolic capitalists have constructed myths about their social roles that allow them genuinely to believe in fairness and equity while entrenching inequality and injustice, myths that have been accepted by many social institutions and power-brokers. The consequence is that the language of social justice has helped \u201clegitimize and obscure inequalities\u201d, allowing sections of the elite to \u201creinforce their elite status\u2026 often at the expense of those who are genuinely vulnerable, marginalized and disadvantaged\u201d. Many aspects of this argument have been expressed before, for instance by the cultural theorist Catherine Liu and the philosopher Ol\u00faf\u00e9mi T\u00e1\u00edw\u00f2. Liu argues that the professional-managerial class \u201choards virtue\u201d to enhance self-worth and justify \u201cits unshakable sense of superiority to ordinary working-class people\u201d. In Elite Capture, T\u00e1\u00edw\u00f2 also maintains, though from a different perspective, that the elite have appropriated the politics of radicalism to serve their own ends. These works are important in helping make sense of the absurdities of contemporary politics. They explain, for instance, why the Democratic party in the US (and many social democratic parties in Europe) is increasingly a club for the rich and educated, while many working-class voters have abandoned it. They illuminate, too, our culture\u2019s obsession with the minutiae of symbolic representation and the policing of language but disregard for real material inequalities. However, these arguments also lay traps for the unwary. Just as social justice campaigners have abandoned the struggle for material betterment for that of cultural empowerment, so many of their critics have come to see the new \u201ccultural elite\u201d as the main problem, ignoring the real material roots of power in our society. There is the danger, too, that we lose sight of the historical shifts that have paved the way for the degraded character of today\u2019s social activism. Al-Gharbi argues that the contemporary outpouring of \u201cwoke\u201d politics is just the latest of a series of \u201cawokenings\u201d, beginning with student support for the Communist party and other radical organisations in the 1930s. That, though, is to miss the realities of change. The US Communist party, for instance, was an opportunist organisation with often despicable policies, tied to a brutal regime in Moscow. It was also, in 1930s America, important to the struggle against racism and for workers\u2019 rights and, together with other radicals, socialists, trade unionists and black activists, helped lay the foundations of the postwar civil rights movement. Particularly in the American south, still in the grip of Jim Crow, they helped organise sharecroppers and millworkers, the homeless and unemployed. Those activists were not cosplaying like the protesters on Broadway. They faced vigilante terror and police violence. Some lost their lives; many were imprisoned. But they demonstrated the possibilities of cross-racial class solidarity. It is the fracturing of those movements of solidarity that has allowed for the degradation of social justice campaigns and the abandonment of working-class interests. Understanding that is as important as understanding the role of \u201csymbolic capitalists\u201d, especially if we are to rebuild movements for change. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "title": "Rounded up, massacred and posted on social media: can Ethiopia bring justice for atrocities in Tigray?",
            "date": "2024-11-07T09:00:55Z",
            "content": "Meaza Teklemariam was seven months pregnant when the soldiers came to her home in January 2021, dragged her husband, Tsegaye, outside and bound his hands together, before taking him away with other men from their neighbourhood in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. \u201cThey said to him, \u2018You are a fighter, you are a fighter\u2019,\u201d says Meaza, tears rolling down her cheeks. \u201cHe kept saying, \u2018No, no. I\u2019m a farmer, I\u2019m a civilian.\u2019\u201d Videos filmed by the soldiers and posted on social media show what happened next. The soldiers gather dozens of men on a rocky clifftop. Then they lead them to the edge and shoot them with automatic rifles. The limp bodies are tossed into the valley below, as the soldiers fire rounds into anyone showing signs of life. At one point, before the slaughter begins, a smiling soldier with a rifle slung over his shoulder beckons to the camera. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go closer and film?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou should film how these are going to die.\u201d In another video a soldier identifies his name and military unit and then passes his phone to a comrade who films him shooting someone. Today, a modest stone monument stands at the massacre site in Mahbere Dego town in Tigray, where children graze herds of donkeys and cattle among the orange aloe vera flowers. A tally by local officials, reviewed by the Guardian, puts the number of people killed at 50. It was six months before relatives discovered their loved ones\u2019 remains, when the soldiers withdrew from the area in the face of a rebel offensive. People were identified by their scattered belongings: tattered identity cards, charred shoes and bloodstained bits of clothing. Bones were collected in sacks as the sounds of battle echoed in the surrounding mountains, and buried in mass graves at two local churches. \u201cIt was heartbreaking,\u201d says priest Gebremeskal Berhe, standing beside one of the graves at his church of Mahbere Tsadkan. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the exact number of people buried here,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can only guess.\u201d This massacre is just one atrocity in the brutal war that engulfed northern Ethiopia from 2020 to 2022. About 600,000 people died, according to Olusegun Obasanjo, a negotiator for the African Union and former president of Nigeria. Many died from disease and hunger when aid was blocked to Tigray, prompting a UN investigation into accusations of Ethiopia\u2019s government using starvation as a weapon. An estimated 100,000 women were raped, and UN investigators concluded all sides committed war crimes, including rebels from Tigray when they entered the neighbouring regions of Afar and Amhara. Now, two years after the war ended, Ethiopia is preparing to launch a transitional justice process. In April, its cabinet approved a policy setting up a special prosecutor and court to deal with the most serious abuses, as well as a truth commission with powers to grant reparations and amnesties to mend fractured community relationships. Their work will start in the coming months, covering not just the recent civil war, but all crimes committed in the country since 1995, when its constitution came into force. The transitional justice policy has drawn praise from donors such as the US and the European Union, which froze aid to Ethiopia during the conflict and demanded a transitional justice process before they normalised relations. But it has been criticised by international and national human rights groups, who question the government\u2019s commitment to accountability. During the conflict, the government cut Tigray\u2019s phone lines and officials downplayed or denied accusations its forces and allies committed abuses. Eritrean troops fought alongside Ethiopia\u2019s military, but Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, denied their presence for months. The ministry of justice says it has carried out investigations but has released little information about findings, raising fears the transitional justice process will be similarly opaque. Laetitia Bader, Horn of Africa director at Human Rights Watch, says: \u201cTime and time again, the government has demonstrated outright resistance to any international oversight, scrutiny and transparency. And we are seeing that again with this process.\u201d A major concern is the lack of international participation in the process. A group of Ethiopian academics who helped draft the policy floated the possibility of including international experts as judges, investigators and commissioners, but the final policy limits them to training and advisory roles. The government has insisted on a nationally led process, under the banner of \u201cAfrican solutions to African problems\u201d, and refused to cooperate with the UN investigation, whose mandate it lobbied hard to end. The investigation was allowed to quietly lapse last year, as the EU restored \u20ac600m (\u00a3500m) in frozen funding to Ethiopia, a move that seemed to indicate a shelving of its demands for accountability. \u201cEurope is turning a blind eye because Ethiopia is an important partner in Africa,\u201d alleges a European diplomat in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. One senior member of the UN investigation says: \u201cWe left the process with the view Ethiopia was not serious about accountability, that this was something they were primarily doing for external consumption.\u201d They describe this tactic as \u201cquasi-compliance\u201d. A government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. There is still fighting in Amhara and Oromia, Ethiopia\u2019s biggest regions, where security forces face accusations of abuses. This includes a massacre of dozens of civilians early this year, which the government is yet to investigate. Much of these regions are too dangerous for officials, so it is not clear how the transitional process will work there. Civil society groups say the ongoing atrocities cast doubt on the government\u2019s commitment to accountability. The new special prosecutor will have powers to extradite suspects, but Eritrea sending men to face justice in Ethiopia is a remote prospect, with its president, Isaias Afwerki, calling allegations of war crimes in Tigray \u201ca fantasy\u201d. Eritrean troops have been accused of committing some of the worst atrocities of the war. This includes the massacre of hundreds of men and boys in Axum, an hour\u2019s drive north of Mahbere Dego through flat farmland. On 28 and 29 November 2020, Eritrean soldiers reportedly carried out a door-to-door killing spree after clashing with local militia in this ancient city, whose church is believed by Orthodox Ethiopians to house the Ark of the Covenant. At her home in Axum\u2019s old town, Tirhas Berha recalls how gunfire rang through the city. Then a group of Eritrean troops barged in. She says they ordered her husband, Tamrat, into the street, lined him up with five other men and opened fire. When she eventually managed to drag him inside, Tamrat was still breathing. But he bled to death in front of her and their children two hours later. They could not leave their home to bury his decomposing body for three days. Trust in government institutions is low in Tigray. According to a recent survey, just 2% of people living there want domestic courts to adjudicate. This includes Berha, who has little confidence her husband\u2019s killers will ever be prosecuted. \u201cWe need justice, but it\u2019s been four years and nothing has happened. They have just forgotten about us,\u201d she says. \u201cNo one can understand how I feel.\u201d As she speaks, her young daughter wipes her tears away with a scarf and rubs her back. Leake Embaye helped to collect the bodies. He says they were fired upon by Eritrean troops while doing the work. At his barber shop, stripped bare by looting, he unfurls a large poster with the pictures and names of the dead from his neighbourhood. He says he too doubts there will be justice. \u201cThe government lied about what happened, they said Eritrean troops weren\u2019t here at the time,\u201d he says. In a recent interview, Ethiopia\u2019s army chief downplayed what happened in Axum, saying Eritrean troops \u201cwere fired upon\u201d and \u201ctook action against those who attacked them\u201d. \u201cIn the midst of this, peaceful people might have been harmed,\u201d he said. In the countryside around Mahbere Dego, wrapped in a white shawl, Kiros Berhe walks along a dirt path through fields teeming with crops ready for harvest, up to the church gate where her husband, Solomon, and other relatives lie buried. But she won\u2019t go inside. \u201cIt is too painful,\u201d she says. Despite losing six family members in the massacre at the cliff top, she considers herself \u201cvery lucky\u201d because her only son survived. \u201cI am sure God will punish them,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t trust the government. They are responsible for this.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-25T21:43:47Z",
            "content": "Responding to news that the special counsel Jack Smith had dropped all charges against Donald Trump for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and retention of classified information, Dan Goldman, a prosecutor turned New York Democrat and member of the House oversight committee, lamented \u201ca shame for justice in this country\u201d. \u201cIt establishes that Donald Trump is above the law,\u201d Goldman told CNN. \u201cThe supreme court put him above the law [by ruling that he had \u2018absolute immunity\u2019 for official acts] but now he appears to escape full accountability for what were crimes charged by a grand jury.\u201d Goldman rejected the argument that by re-electing Trump, the American people had acquitted him of all charges. \u201cI think what was very clear is that people voted for Donald Trump because they thought that he was going to improve the lives of the middle class, and perhaps in addition that he would secure the border,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cThey did not vote for him to dismantle our democracy, to attack the constitution, to politicize all of our agencies, and certainly not as a referendum on his criminal cases. \u201cThose cases should have been played out in a court of law \u2026 and Donald Trump should not have been able to run out the clock.\u201d Elsewhere, Aquilino Gonell, a former Capitol police sergeant who testified memorably about his experiences and injuries on 6 January 2021, when Trump sent a mob to attack Congress, lamented a simple \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d. \u201c\u2018No one is above the law\u2019 is a great slogan,\u201d added Gonell, who suffered injuries to his hands, shoulder, calf and foot, as well as psychological trauma, in the Capitol attack. To many Americans on Monday, \u201cno one is above the law\u201d, however, no longer seemed like a legal reality. Three weeks after Trump defeated Kamala Harris, Smith dropped 44 charges against him: four for election subversion and 40 for retention of classified records. Smith said he was following Department of Justice policy, which says a sitting president cannot be charged. He also said he was acting \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d, which meant the cases could be refiled after Trump leaves power. That was an echo of the situation in New York, where sentencing on Trump\u2019s 34 felony convictions related to hush money payments to a porn star has been postponed. In Georgia, eight election subversion charges remain on the docket. Nonetheless, among Trump\u2019s opponents, the mood was one of despond. The writer Tom Nichols, a conservative Trump critic, summed up: \u201cMission accomplished. He ran for [president] to stay out of jail, and here we are.\u201d Steven Cheung, Trump\u2019s spokesperson, celebrated \u201ca major victory for the rule of law\u201d, adding: \u201cThe American people and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting our country.\u201d Democrats, however, expect Trump to seek revenge, not unity \u2013 and immediate comments from both the president-elect and JD Vance, the Ohio senator and incoming vice-president, did little to calm such fears. Vance said: \u201cIf Donald J Trump had lost an election, he may very well have spent the rest of his life in prison. These prosecutions were always political. Now it\u2019s time to ensure what happened to President Trump never happens in this country again.\u201d In a post to his own social media platform, Trump said all cases against him, including civil suits in New York resulting in multimillion-dollar penalties, were \u201cempty and lawless\u201d, orchestrated by his Democratic foes. \u201cIt was a political hijacking,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand a low point in the history of our country that such a thing could have happened, and yet, I persevered, against all odds, and WON.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-23T18:46:10Z",
            "content": "MPs will be placing the country on a \u201cslippery slope towards death on demand\u201d if they back legislation on assisted dying in England and Wales this week, the lord chancellor and justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has said in a letter to constituents before a historic Commons vote on Friday. Mahmood has received numerous letters about the bill from people in her Birmingham Ladywood seat, which has a big Muslim population, and sent out replies saying that she was \u201cprofoundly concerned\u201d about the legislation, not only for religious reasons but also because of what it would mean for the role of the state if one of its functions became helping people to die. \u201cSadly, recent scandals \u2013 such as Hillsborough, infected blood and the Post Office Horizon \u2013 have reminded us that the state and those acting on its behalf are not always benign. I have always held the view that, for this reason, the state should serve a clear role. It should protect and preserve life, not take it away. The state should never offer death as a service.\u201d She continued: \u201cIt cannot be overstated what a profound shift in our culture assisted suicide will herald. In my view, the greatest risk of all is the pressure the elderly, vulnerable, sick or disabled may place upon themselves. \u201cFaced with expensive or insufficient care, some may feel they have become too great a burden to their family, friends and society at large. In doing so, they would not be choosing death because that is what they want for themselves but because they think that others might want it for them.\u201d She added: \u201cWe must never accept the wrongful deaths of some in exchange for the desired deaths of others. That line, once crossed, will be crossed for ever. \u201cThe right to die, for some, will \u2013 inexorably and inevitably \u2013 become the duty to die for others. And that is why I will be voting against this bill.\u201d Mahmood, a barrister, also criticised the lack of legal safeguards in the bill. \u201cThe provisions in relation to coercion are particularly weak. The bill seems to prevent someone being pressured into ending their life by those acting with malign intent. But it is silent as to how this should be done, setting no test by which evidence will be assessed or how a judge will be expected to carry out this work.\u201d Mahmood has previously made clear that she will vote against the bill. But her latest, more hard-hitting attack on it will be seen as ignoring calls from Keir Starmer for his ministers to stay neutral in the heat of the debate. Mahmood\u2019s intervention means that both the justice secretary and the health secretary, Wes Streeting, now stand opposed to it. Government insiders said on Saturday night that this could create real problems if the bill were to pass into law. \u201cWe would have the justice and health secretaries \u2013 who would be key to its implementation \u2013 both opposed to a major piece of social legislation. It is difficult to see how that works.\u201d Streeting has made clear that he is opposed to the bill, saying it could have cost implications for the NHS and lead to someone with a terminal diagnosis choosing to end their life early as a way of saving the NHS money. Asked by the Observer about Mahmood\u2019s letter and whether she was ignoring the call by the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, for senior ministers to remain neutral, a source close to the justice secretary said: \u201cIt is the case that she has been deluged with letters and that she has replied to them.\u201d Friends of Mahmood also said she wanted to remain in her cabinet job. even if the bill passed all its parliamentary stages and went onto the statute book. If adopted, the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill would make it legal for over-18s in England and Wales who have mental capacity and are expected to die within six months to be assisted to end their life. They would have to be assessed by two independent doctors and have the decision signed off by a high court judge. A separate bill is under discussion in Scotland.Government sources said they expected the bill to pass at second reading on Friday (29 November), after soundings by party whips on all sides of the House suggested there would be majority support. One senior government figure said: \u201cI think the opponents have shouted louder but would expect it to go through.\u201d If the bill is passed on Friday, it would then be considered for several weeks in committee, where any concerns about lack of safeguards would be considered. MPs would then have the chance to vote again at report stage and third reading, which will not be until April next year at the earliest. In a letter to the Observer, a group of eminent lawyers counter Mahmood\u2019s criticisms and come out in strong support of the bill. They include former lord chancellor and secretary of state for justice Charles Falconer, two former directors of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald and Sir Max Hill, and Alex Goodman KC, the joint head of public law at Landmark Chambers. They state: \u201cThe bill will protect the vulnerable and the sanctity of life much more effectively than our current law. It will allow terminally ill people in the last six months of their life to make free, informed and settled decisions about their end of life through a robust process involving two doctors and a judge.\u201d In a separate letter to the Observer, faith leaders join forces to oppose the bill. Signatories include Sarah Mullally, bishop of London, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, archbishop of Westminster, and the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis. They write: \u201cPart of the role of faith leaders in communities is to provide spiritual and pastoral care for the sick and for the dying. We hold the hands of loved ones in their final days, we pray with families both before and after death. It is to this vocation that we have been called, and it is from this vocation that we write. \u201cOur pastoral roles make us deeply concerned about the impact the bill would have on the most vulnerable, opening up the possibility of life-threatening abuse and coercion. This is a concern we know is shared by many people, with and without faith.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-21T18:38:24Z",
            "content": "The US Department of Justice has proposed a range of punchy remedies to address Google\u2019s dominance of the internet search market, including the forced divestment of its Chrome browser. Google said the proposals represented a \u201cradical interventionist agenda\u201d that would harm America\u2019s standing as a tech superpower. Big tech\u2019s power, and whether and how it should be tamed, has become a political and regulatory talking point on both sides of the Atlantic. This will be one of the defining confrontations of that debate. What is the Department of Justice proposing? The DoJ has asked a federal judge to consider several remedies after a ruling in August that found Google was operating an illegal monopoly in the search market. The main proposal is to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser \u2013 a key gateway to its search engine and the most popular browser in the US. Other proposed remedies include making Google\u2019s search index, a database of all the webpages it has crawled, available to rivals at marginal cost; scrapping payments to third parties to make Google the default search engine on their products; and giving publishers and content creators the ability to block their data from being used to train its artificial intelligence models. Will the remedies work if they are implemented? Advocates for strong measures against big tech companies are delighted with the proposals. For instance, Chrome could be opened up to other search engines under new ownership, and rival services could use the search index to build competitive rivals to Google. \u201cThese remedies will have an impact,\u201d says Courtney Radsch, the director of the Center for Journalism and Liberty at the Open Markets Institute, an anti-monopoly thinktank. \u201cThese are not just tweaks around behaviour. They are structural remedies that seek to break up the advantages that Google has across its product lines and really entrench its market power.\u201d Google\u2019s president of global affairs and chief legal officer, Kent Walker, has said the proposals will harm Americans and the country\u2019s leadership in the global tech industry. Google has also said it will appeal against the monopoly ruling. What next? The judge overseeing the case, Amit Mehta, will also hear remedy proposals from Google, and is expected to make a final decision by August next year. Nevertheless, either side could appeal and take the process as far as the highest court in the US, the supreme court. William Kovacic, a professor at George Washington University law school, says this could push the resolution of the case to the end of 2027. According to Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt law school, a forced sale of Chrome could also be difficult. \u201cThe spin-off of Chrome is possible but an uphill battle,\u201d she says. \u201cThis judge is very careful and mindful of precedent, and there is not a lot of recent precedent of spin-offs. That doesn\u2019t foreclose the option to him, but maybe makes it a little harder.\u201d What will Donald Trump do? As the president-elect, Donald Trump can stop the investigation, order an alteration of the remedies \u2013 or let the process carry on uninterrupted. The DoJ case against Google started under the previous Trump administration, but the incoming president has indicated recently that he is against a break-up, saying splitting the company is a \u201cvery dangerous thing\u201d that could play into the hands of China. However, the vice president-elect, JD Vance, has voiced support for breaking up Google."

            "date": "2024-11-19T16:56:56Z",
            "content": "The call to overhaul the Cop process is inevitable, given the frustrations with this year\u2019s underwhelming conference in Baku (Cop summits \u2018no longer fit for purpose\u2019, say leading climate policy experts, 15 November). Yet restricting host nations or abandoning the inclusive framework of the Cop summits risks undermining the very cooperation required to combat climate change. The suggestion to exclude petrostates as hosts risks alienating critical players in the energy transition. The world\u2019s largest oil and gas producers have to be convinced \u2013 or forced \u2013 to change, and Cop summits without them would have a huge elephant in the room and risk being irrelevant from the start. It is also important to remember that the climate summits are about much more than the hosts. The Paris agreement\u2019s framework allows nearly 200 nations to participate in a process of shared accountability. This inclusivity has led to landmark agreements like the Paris accord itself, the loss and damage fund, and mechanisms for climate finance. The real issue is always implementation. The call to shift focus from negotiating to action is, of course, correct. But dismantling the negotiation framework to do so would be counterproductive. The ratchet mechanism that drives nations to increase their climate commitments is critical. Weakening this would remove one of the few accountability tools we have. Reforming Cop is difficult, but abandoning the summits would make addressing the climate crisis impossible. Sebastian Leape CEO, Natcap, London \u2022 Your coverage of climate finance ideas (Cop29: which climate finance ideas are most likely to work? 11 November) misses the simplest workable scheme \u2013 Prof Raghuram Rajan\u2019s Global Carbon Reduction Incentive. This would see countries with above-average per-capita emissions pay a per capita levy into an incentive fund, which would be paid out to countries with below-average emissions. Both would have the incentive to cut emissions, the rich to pay less and the poor to receive more. This scheme could be introduced in stages, with the carbon levy rising from, say, $30 to $160 per tonne over the years. Given the difficulties of getting all countries to agree, the UK should create a north-south coalition to launch the levy. (The Commonwealth would be the ideal body to do that.) It would accelerate the transition to a low-carbon future and benefit from first-mover advantage. What\u2019s not to like? Ulrich Loening East Lothian; Titus Alexander Galashiels, Scottish Borders \u2022 Your coverage of the climate crisis is valuable and much-needed, but your verdict on carbon taxes is misleading. Far from being a \u201cutopian concept\u201d, carbon pricing, either via carbon taxes or cap-and-trade schemes, is up and running in 53 countries and now covers 24% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon pricing\u2019s global effectiveness will soon play out as the EU\u2019s and UK\u2019s carbon border adjustment mechanism initiatives are implemented. Moreover, a recent study of the real-world effectiveness of more than 1,500 policies implemented to combat climate change in 41 countries over two decades concluded that carbon pricing stands out as an effective policy, particularly in developed economies. For sure, carbon pricing has a long way to go \u2013 coverage needs to be broader and prices higher. But this will only be possible when policymakers have the political headroom that greater public awareness and understanding can provide.

The former MP, who lost her seat at the last general election, was at an event on Thursday where Nigel Farage said that she just happened to be the 100,000th new Reform member. Her decision to join the party comes as a surprise after she engaged in a bitter public row with Reform UK earlier this year, after claiming she was wooed by a pro-Brexit businessman who she said had offered her jobs to defect. She was bitterly critical of Reform in July after an attack by the party\u2019s deputy leader, Richard Tice, who had accused her of bribing her Reform general election rival in the constituency of Leeds South West and Morley. On that occasion, Jenkyns insisted she never came close to defecting to Reform and described Tice\u2019s \u201cwild accusations\u201d as \u201clibellous\u201d and an attempt to \u201cdeflect from his own embarrassing behaviour\u201d. Tice was not to be seen on Thursday as Jenkyns joined Farage on stage at a central London hotel where she said that her old party was a sinking ship that was beyond salvaging. Asked how long she had been thinking about defecting, she said she has \u201calways respected\u201d Nigel Farage and noted her work with Tice during the Brexit campaign. \u201cWe are politically aligned. And how long have I been thinking about it? Well, I mean, I was tempted before the general election, but I am a loyal person to a party,\u201d she added. \u201cI might not be loyal to prime ministers, as we\u2019ve seen in the past, but I\u2019m loyal to parties, and I believed, as I said, in going down with that ship fighting.\u201d Jenykns has long been a controversial figure in Tory ranks and campaigned with a picture of Farage on leaflets even while in the party. In 2022, as a newly appointed education minister, she responded to complaints after making a rude gesture outside Downing Street, saying she had been provoked by a \u201cbaying mob\u201d. Farage said he was looking forward to \u201cmy new friend Elon Musk\u201d making cuts to the US civil service and it was a blueprint that Reform UK hoped to implement \u201cif things go well\u201d at the next general election."

I\u2019m sure even they would be surprised at their own success. Many of the decisions made were based on compromise, and the electoral college (Editorial, 4 November) is a perfect example of this. Giving small states (basically separate countries at the time) a disproportionate voice in the election of a chief executive was supposed to help prevent a majority from oppressing a minority. Due to unforeseeable circumstances, mostly based on modern economic and geographic factors, we now face an oppressive but empowered minority because of the electoral college. I agree that something should be done to make voting in presidential elections more fair and meaningful. However, I am not in favour of completely abolishing the electoral college. Rather, I would prefer to see a system in place more like that used in Maine or Nebraska: apportion some of the votes by congressional district while still giving the two \u201csenatorial\u201d votes to the overall popular vote winner of the state. This would open up at least part of nearly every state for meaningful voting, while still protecting the compromise inherent in the system.

            "content": "Keir Starmer is under renewed pressure over electoral reform after dozens of newly elected Labour MPs signed up to a parliamentary group calling for the UK to move to a proportional voting system. More than half of the nearly 100 MPs who have joined the new all-party parliamentary group on fair elections are from Labour, with 43 from the intake elected in 2024. The group, formed in September, says it is growing all the time. It has released a report, Free But Not Fair, which argues that a change from the distortions of the first-past-the-post electoral system, under which Labour won more than 60% of Commons seats with just a third of the votes cast in July, would help restore trust to politics. A number of Labour MPs, including many from the 2024 intake, are known to be sympathetic to the idea of electoral reform, an idea to which the party is officially committed after a vote to embrace PR was passed overwhelmingly at its 2022 conference. While Starmer has previously expressed at least some support for electoral reform, his leadership team have ruled out any immediate action, at least in the first term of a Labour government. One new MP who has signed up to the group said electoral reform was a common concern among the 2024 intake. \u201cWe perhaps have a greater sense of how relevant and salient it is as an issue, how much it is seemingly connected to this growing sense of apathy, of disengagement from politics for many people,\u201d they said. \u201cI get the argument that we don\u2019t necessarily have the bandwidth to do everything, but much as you\u2019d want to sort out the finances or the buses in a first term, there is also a responsibility to make sure the democratic system is working properly.\u201d The report, released alongside poll findings by Survation showing that 64% of people believe there is a need to address the electoral system before the next general election, calls for a \u201cnational commission for electoral reform\u201d to be set up in 2025 with the task of recommending a replacement for first past the post. It also calls for new measures to prevent murky campaign financing and to counter disinformation. With Labour officially committed to PR, the all-party group argues this means that in the new parliament about 500 of the 650 MPs represent parties in favour of change. Among what it calls the corrosive effects of first past the post, the report notes that despite a high turnover of seats in the July election, any constituencies not being specifically targeted by opposition parties were in effect ignored, giving local voters no meaningful choice. It points out that it took on average 24,000 votes to elect each Labour MP, 49,000 per Lib Dem, 56,000 for every Conservative MP, 486,000 votes per Green, and 824,000 for every Reform UK MP. Alex Sobel, the Labour MP for Leeds Central and Headingley and a former shadow minister, said: \u201cThe popular vote a party needs to win a majority has been steadily falling for decades, and now first past the post has delivered a landslide on just a third of the vote. \u201cAre we really comfortable with a situation where a party \u2013 even an extreme party \u2013 can win a thumping majority with, say, just three out of 10 votes? Because if things continue, that\u2019s where we\u2019re heading.\u201d"

Emails seen by Guardian Australia shows Michelle Rowland\u2019s office \u201ccan\u2019t confirm a revised timeframe\u201d for when it will formally respond to a report from the late Labor MP Peta Murphy, which called for a total wagering ad ban some 18 months ago. \u201cI acknowledge the ongoing toll this is taking on you and others, and I\u2019m personally very sorry that we have not been able to secure an outcome thus far,\u201d a staffer for the minister said in an email. \u201cAs a general observation though, I would note that decisions of this type require the support of the PM and Cabinet \u2013 ie, it\u2019s not enough for a Minister to have formed a view.\u201d The staff member, who Guardian Australia has chosen not to name, was replying to a query from Mark Kempster, who has campaigned for wagering changes as part of the Alliance for Gambling Reform group. Kempster, who has battled gambling addiction, made a submission to Murphy\u2019s inquiry calling for all gambling advertising to be removed from Australian TV, and banning the targeting of customers with promotion material. Kempster wrote to Rowland\u2019s office on Monday, saying he \u201ccan not really fathom how this has been delayed again\u201d. His email came days after the government confirmed the gambling reforms would not be introduced this year \u2013 less than a week after Rowland herself had told the ABC in a television interview that she was planning on revealing Labor\u2019s plans by the end of 2024. \u201cThe effect the constant delays is having on all of us who gave evidence as Peta\u2019s inquiry is taking a massive toll on us. To wait up to 20 months for any type of response and actions surely can not be acceptable,\u201d Kempster wrote.

I appreciate that this is really frustrating and hard to understand.\u201d Rowland\u2019s staffer conceded \u201cthis process is taking longer than hoped\u201d but said the government was focusing on \u201censuring that reforms are effective and comprehensive\u201d, as well as building on previously-announced reforms. The staffer sent a near-identical email to another gambling harm advocate who also queried the government\u2019s delay. The government has not given a specific reason for not having yet responded to the Murphy report, but the sport minister, Anika Wells, said on Monday that sporting codes\u2019 financial viability was a factor in Labor concluding its proposed gambling ad cap \u201cwasn\u2019t ready to go\u201d. Rowland\u2019s staffer, in the email to Kempster, said they acknowledged \u201cthe ongoing toll this is taking on you and others, and I\u2019m personally very sorry that we have not been able to secure an outcome thus far.\u201d Guardian Australia contacted the offices of Rowland and Anthony Albanese for comment. In a statement, Rowland confirmed the legislation would not be introduced this year, and that the government was \u201ccontinuing to engage with relevant stakeholders.\u201d \u201cAs we have seen in the past bad policy designs leads to bad outcomes. It is important we take the time to get these reforms right,\u201d she said. Tim Costello, chief advocate for the Alliance for Gambling Reform, said in a press conference on Wednesday that the government should act. \u201cWithin the prime minister\u2019s power is the opportunity to simply say, we are implementing the Murphy report. Eighteen months on, this is a failure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes backbone to protect children in this nation against very powerful vested interests. The failure to show that backbone has let Australians down.\u201d The opposition communications spokesperson, David Coleman, claimed on Sunday that Albanese was \u201cscared\u201d of touching gambling reform, and the advocates on both sides of the debate. \u201cHe\u2019s scared of anti-gambling advocates like Tim Costello. He\u2019s scared of the AFL, he\u2019s scared of the NRL. He\u2019s scared of the media companies. So what does he do? He cowers in the corner and does nothing,\u201d Coleman claimed."

            "content": "About 50,000 government officials, policymakers, investors and campaigners will gather in Azerbaijan this week in the hope of answering a trillion-dollar question: how much money should go each year to helping developing countries cope with climate-related costs? The aim of the UN\u2019s Cop29 climate talks in Baku, which is being called the \u201cclimate finance Cop\u201d, is to establish a new annual climate financing target to replace the current $100bn pledge, set in 2009, which expires at the end of this year. There is one clear consensus already: the existing climate finance available to developing countries is nowhere near enough to withstand worsening climate impacts. The ambition is too low, and in 15 years the annual target has been met in full only once, in 2022. Campaigners have called for the governments of wealthier countries to contribute to a new collective quantified goal (NCQG) on climate finance. Forecasts of how much this will be vary but are typically $500bn to $1tn a year, or less than 1% of global GDP. Some estimates are as high as $5tn. \u201cSetting a more ambitious goal will be essential to helping vulnerable countries adopt clean energy and other low-carbon solutions and build resilience to worsening climate impacts,\u201d said the World Resources Institute. But who should pay? To date, the financial contributions that enable developing countries to pursue low-carbon growth and greater climate resilience have come from countries defined by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as \u201chigh income\u201d. The list includes the UK, US, Japan and Germany. But in the 30 years since it was created, countries including China, India and South Korea have dramatically increased their economic might \u2013 and their carbon emissions. It is likely that the talks will include calls to expand the list of countries contributing to climate financing. But even then the sums involved are too large for government spending budgets alone, according to delegates from many wealthy nations. Instead, the talks aim to reform global climate lending to encourage more private capital to play a part. In an open letter last month, Stephanie Pfeifer, the head of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, said many global investors were beginning to explore ways to unlock and mobilise capital. \u201cAn ambitious finance goal that includes private capital can encourage greater ambition in developing countries\u2019 targets [for helping to limit global warming] by building confidence in accessible funding for both mitigation and adaptation, with the latter being historically underfunded,\u201d she said. This approach is not without its critics. Climate and humanitarian NGOs have warned that loans, even on favourable term, place the financial burden of the climate crisis on already indebted developing nations, which bear the lowest responsibility for the climate crisis but face the greatest risks. These groups have called for polluting companies to pay their fair share. \u201cClimate finance is not about charity or generosity but responsibility and justice,\u201d according to Debbie Hillier, a policy lead at the humanitarian NGO Mercy Corps. \u201cIt is based firmly on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities \u2013 those who contributed most to the climate crisis must bear the brunt of the solution.\u201d To this end, a new Climate Finance Action Fund (CFAF) will be under consideration. It aims to draw on voluntary contributions from fossil-fuel-producing countries and companies to support developing nations\u2019 climate projects. For polluters who would rather not pay, campaigners are calling for climate taxes. Billionaires and fossil fuel giants are in the crosshairs of environmental NGO 350.org, which plans to hold them accountable for their outsize impact on the planet in a new campaign. The group argues that funds generated through taxing the ultra-rich could be used both for domestic policies and programmes to lower carbon emissions, and for international climate finance to ensure \u201cthose most responsible for the climate crisis contribute to its solution\u201d. This approach is likely to prove popular with the public. Oxfam is scheduled to publish a report suggesting that the majority of the British public support higher taxes on private jets and superyachts to help tackle the climate crisis. The survey, by YouGov, is also expected to show strong public support for increasing taxes on the wealthiest UK individuals to fund action, and hiking taxes on businesses in sectors that produce the most emissions. The key to whatever form climate finance takes will be accountability \u2013 a meaningful climate finance target will mean nothing if the annual goal is never reached."

            "content": "The chair of the Climate Change Authority, Matt Kean, has declared Australia must take \u201cstrong and decisive action\u201d to address the climate crisis despite Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House, arguing the world needs cheap renewable energy and the country can provide it. Kean, a former News South Wales Liberal treasurer and energy minister, told Guardian Australia there were \u201cenormous opportunities and benefits\u201d in taking action to cut greenhouse gas emissions, no matter who was US president. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what Trump will do, but climate change waits for no one and will spare no one and no country. That\u2019s why we will continue to need to act - to take strong and decisive action to address this great challenge of our times,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world still needs cheap renewable energy, and the products that come with that, and Australia is in a very strong position to meet the world\u2019s needs, and in doing so create huge jobs and prosperity for our country that we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d Kean said past evidence, including in Trump\u2019s first term as president, showed states, territories and the private sector would continue to act. \u201cI have no doubt that will continue to be the case,\u201d he said. His comments contrasted with those from the Nationals MP Keith Pitt and Senate colleague Matt Canavan, who argued the federal Coalition should dump its commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 after Trump\u2019s re-election. \u201cWe need to consider our policies around net zero and their impact on the cost of living for every Australian and adopt policy that the Australian people can actually afford,\u201d Pitt told Guardian Australia on Thursday. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email He said Trump\u2019s decisive victory provided clear guidance on the best way forward on climate change and other issues. \u201cClearly president-elect Trump took bold positions on a number of policies and was successful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be in a contest with an Albanese government, which, in my view, went too far, too fast and at too high a cost to the people on their climate policies and, if we want there to be a contest at the next election, we will need to have a policy position that is sufficiently different.\u201d He said any decision on a policy rethink would be \u201cup to the shadow cabinet\u201d. But a spokesperson for the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, told Guardian Australia on Thursday that the policy on net zero stands. \u201cThere\u2019s no change in our position,\u201d the spokesperson said. Earlier on Thursday, the Coalition\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, emphasised the importance of sticking to the net zero objective. \u201cI want to see Australia stay committed to net zero by 2050,\u201d he told ABC Radio National. \u201cI don\u2019t anticipate any change in those commitments.\u201d Anthony Albanese also recommitted to the government\u2019s existing policies despite Trump\u2019s stated intention to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. \u201cEven if you were a climate sceptic and didn\u2019t believe any of the science and didn\u2019t notice that there were more floods and more bushfires and more cyclones \u2013 it would still be good policy because it will produce the cheapest form of energy, not the most expensive, which we know as nuclear,\u201d the prime minister said on Thursday. But he declined to commit to a 2035 emissions reduction target before the next federal election, saying the government was focused on 2030. The Climate Change Authority is preparing advice to the government on a 2035 emissions reduction target, but it will not be ready until next year. Initial advice from the authority found a 65-75% cut below 2005 levels would be \u201cambitious, but could be achievable\u201d. The government is not keen to reactivate the climate debate in Australia because the effects of climate change continue to generate anxiety in the community and Albanese is pushing a message of optimism about the future. Along with pressing the importance of pursuing net zero, Birmingham also talked up the Coalition\u2019s nuclear energy policy, saying it was taking \u201chard and difficult policy positions and decisions to be able to achieve that\u201d and \u201cmoving into a space in the policy debate nobody has been game to go into before\u201d. \u201cBut doing so because we see it as necessary if you are to be credible in achieving net zero whilst protecting Australia\u2019s industrial base in the future.\u201d Birmingham\u2019s comments came after Canavan took to the social media site X early on Thursday to condemn the net zero goal. \u201cThe re-election of Trump means that we can all say what we think again,\u201d he wrote. In a subsequent post he said Australians should \u201cstop whining\u201d about possible tariffs like \u201csome kind of hopeless basket case\u201d and \u201ctake charge of our own destiny for a change\u201d. \u201cWe should get out of the Paris climate agreement, dump net zero (which is dead anyway because of Trump) and unleash a New Age of Australian Energy Abundance,\u201d he posted. Canavan insisted Australia had all the natural resources to become \u201cthe richest country in the world\u201d without any other help and could also become a \u201cmanufacturing powerhouse\u201d. \u201cWe just need to dig up our coal, drill for our gas and use our uranium and we will have the cheapest energy prices in the world.\u201d The Climate Council chief executive, Amanda McKenzie, emphasised the need for Australia to stay the course on the clean energy transition. \u201cDuring his first presidency, Trump tried to withdraw the US from climate diplomacy, but state and local governments powered ahead,\u201d McKenzie said in a statement. \u201cCountries and US states know the Trump playbook \u2013 and they\u2019re determined to keep driving climate action forward.\u201d"

            "content": "The US climate envoy John Podesta said the fight \u201cfor a cleaner, safer\u201d planet will not stop under a re-elected Donald Trump even if some progress is reversed, speaking at the Cop29 UN climate talks on Monday as they opened in Baku, Azerbaijan. \u201cAlthough under Donald Trump\u2019s leadership the US federal government placed climate-related actions on the back burner, efforts to prevent climate change remain a commitment in the US and will confidently continue,\u201d said Podesta, who is leading the Biden administration\u2019s delegation at the annual talks. Trump has pledged to deregulate the energy sector, allow the oil and gas industry to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d, and pull the US from the Paris climate agreement, which committed countries to taking steps to avoid the worst impacts of the crisis. Yet while Trump will try to reverse progress, \u201cthis is not the end of our fight for a cleaner, safer planet\u201d, Podesta said. Last week\u2019s re-election of Trump to the White House, which will see him inaugurated for a second term in January, has cast a shadow on the UN talks after the Republican defeated Kamala Harris. Harris had been expected to continue the climate policies of Joe Biden, who passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest down payment on the green transition seen in US history. Experts say Trump\u2019s second term could be even more destructive, as he will be aided by an amenably conservative judiciary and armed with detailed policy blueprints such as the Project 2025 document published by the rightwing Heritage Foundation. Trump\u2019s incoming administration is already reportedly drawing up executive orders to erase climate policies and open up protected land for ramped-up oil and gas production. \u201cWe have more liquid gold than any country in the world,\u201d the president-elect said on Wednesday. Staff at the US Environmental Protection Agency, which was targeted the last time Trump was president, are already bracing for a mass exodus. Swaths of work done by the EPA under Biden, such as pollution rules for cars and power plants, as well as efforts to protect vulnerable communities living near industrial activity, are set to be reversed. A June analysis warned that Trump\u2019s forthcoming rollbacks could add 4bn additional metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere by 2030 when compared with a continuation of Biden\u2019s policies. That \u201cwould be a death sentence to our planet\u201d, said Jamie Minden, the 21-year-old acting executive director of Zero Hour, the US-based youth-led climate non-profit, at a press conference about the election result in Baku on Monday. Trump\u2019s looming presidency could also place a damper on other countries\u2019 climate action plans, said Todd Stern, who was the US special envoy for climate change and the United States\u2019 chief negotiator at the 2015 Paris climate agreement \u2013 especially China, which is currently the top global contributor to planet-warming emissions. \u201cThe two biggest players in the ring are the US and China, and China is extremely aware of that. It has just got a guarantee that the US president won\u2019t be bringing up climate change with them for the next four years and that means something,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will make things easier on China and that can\u2019t help but have some impact.\u201d Yet \u201cthe fight is bigger than one election, one political cycle in one country,\u201d said Podesta. The UN climate conference in Baku represented a \u201ccritical opportunity to cement our progress\u201d, he said. At Cop29, activists are pushing the Biden administration to file a bold climate plan under the Paris climate agreement \u2013 known as a nationally determined contribution \u2013 and to make big pledges to support global climate finance efforts. And the president \u201cstill has critical opportunities to cement his climate legacy\u201d on the domestic level as well, said Allie Rosenbluth, co-manager of the climate NGO Oil Change International, including by rejecting pending permits for fossil fuel projects. At least $1tn is needed to help poor countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, shift to a low-carbon economy and adapt to the impacts of climate disasters. If the US fails to meaningfully contribute, other countries can also fill the climate finance gap left by the US, noted Teresa Anderson, the global climate justice lead at the climate non-profit ActionAid, at another Monday press conference. \u201cThis is a test for rich countries,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they believe in the climate emergency then they should be willing to pay more than their fair share, not less.\u201d The US senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a climate hawk who will arrive at Cop29 later this week, said Trump and other US Republicans were \u201caiming a torpedo\u201d at climate progress, but that the pressure to slash US emissions would stay strong. \u201cI\u2019m heading to Baku to reassure the international community that large swaths of the US remain committed to steering the planet away from climate catastrophe, a catastrophe that is already doing massive economic harm and driving up prices for insurance, food, and other goods and services,\u201d he wrote in an email. Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, noted that the Paris agreement had 195 signatories and \u201cwill not collapse in the face of a single election result\u201d. \u201cThe Paris agreement has survived one Trump presidency and it will survive another,\u201d she said."

No,\u201d says Chris Bowen, the country\u2019s climate change and energy minister. \u201cWe\u2019re living climate change. What we\u2019re now trying to do is avoid the worst of it,\u201d Bowen says. \u201cReport after report, temperature records tumbling, natural disasters increasingly unnatural \u2013 that\u2019s why we keep going. That\u2019s what drives me. It gets me out of bed every day. So perhaps alarmed is the wrong word. Disturbed, maybe. But, you know, not surprised.\u201d Bowen is speaking to Guardian Australia shortly before a US presidential election where polls indicate a 50-50 chance voters will elect a candidate who calls climate change a \u201choax\u201d and who would lead an administration intent on gutting clean energy and science programs and again pulling the US out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Six days after the US election, thousands of delegates from nearly 200 countries will land in the Russia-aligned petrostate of Azerbaijan for Cop29, an annual UN climate summit. Bowen will be at the centre of that meeting, having been invited to help lead negotiations on what is considered its most important work \u2013 setting a new finance goal to help the developing world. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads The Australian government is also likely to learn if it will co-host the Cop31 summit with Pacific countries in 2026, an event that would bring tens of thousands of people to the country and increase scrutiny on its role as the world\u2019s third biggest fossil fuel exporter. But for now, all eyes are on the US. What will a Trump win mean? Speaking in his ministerial office in the Sydney CBD, Bowen acknowledges the election result will be seismic, and will shape the fortnight-long talks starting in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku on 11 November. Asked for his view on what a Donald Trump victory would mean, he is cautious but clear: the Albanese government and the Biden administration have been \u201cclosely aligned in policy and personal terms\u201d and \u201cobviously, having a United States administration with a very forward leaning climate policy is a good thing\u201d. He also gives three reasons why he believes a second Trump administration would be unlikely to live up to the former president\u2019s anti-climate rhetoric on the climate crisis. \u201cFirstly, they are the United States. So the state functions are very important. And perhaps unlike 2016, where the result came as a surprise, if it is a Trump administration people are doing more preparation for it,\u201d he says. \u201cSecondly, it\u2019s hard to legislate in the United States, but it\u2019s also hard to un-legislate. So the Inflation Reduction Act [which includes an extraordinary US$370bn in clean energy support] is the law of the land and will remain the law of the land unless it gets repealed, which will be very difficult to do. And thirdly, the private sector can help. In the United States, regardless of federal mandates, they know [climate action] is good business. \u201cWill the dynamics of Cop be different depending on who\u2019s president? Of course they will. But does the rest of the world just walk away if the United States president is Donald Trump? No.\u201d Within climate activist circles, there is an expectation that if Kamala Harris wins, she may quickly set a 2035 emissions reduction target and other countries may follow. If Trump wins, many countries, including Australia, are likely to delay and recalibrate before setting their 2035 commitments, which are due next year. Bowen says Labor will set a target based on \u201cwhat we think we can achieve and what our contribution should be under the science\u201d \u2013 and what others are doing. Initial advice from the Climate Change Authority found a target of up to a 75% cut below 2005 levels would be \u201cambitious, but could be achievable\u201d. According to a recent UN Environment Programme analysis, current national commitments would lead to only a 2.6% emissions reduction below 2019 levels by 2030. It is far short of what countries have agreed is necessary: a 43% reduction over that timeframe and a 60% cut by 2035. Bowen says he understands \u201cto a degree\u201d why this big discrepancy makes people cynical, but argues the summits are important, not least because they send a signal to governments and investors marshalling trillions of dollars. He says there was genuine progress last year, including a non-binding agreement the world should transition away from fossil fuels and triple renewable energy by 2030. \u201cWhat\u2019s the alternative? Not bother, not talk to other countries, not have targets?\u201d he says. \u201cIs it perfect? No, but it\u2019s what we\u2019ve got. I\u2019d be surprised if people who are concerned about climate activism argue we should not be active participants in the global conversation.\u201d Bowen will arrive in Baku, an historic oil town on the shores of the Caspian Sea, wearing three hats. The most important role is co-charing with the Egyptian environment minister, Yasmine Fouad, negotiations to create a new finance goal \u2013 known in UN lingo as a new collective quantified goal on climate finance, or NCQG \u2013 to help developing countries fight and limit climate catastrophe. It is meant to replace a US$100bn a year goal that was set more than a decade ago and that it is agreed is woefully insufficient. Bowen says their ability to wrangle a consensus on the issue \u2013 covering how much is needed, who pays and what sort of public, private and multilateral bank finance should be counted \u2013 will largely determine if the summit is seen as a success or failure. \u201cI probably should manage expectations, but \u2026 this is the finance Cop,\u201d Bowen says. \u201cSo getting an NCQG right is the key element.\u201d He is also chair of the negotiating bloc known as the umbrella group, which includes the US, UK, Canada and Japan, and will be representing Australia as it seeks to finalise whether it will host Cop31. Australia is favoured to win, but Turkey is also in the running and the decision-making process is opaque. The bid has been mostly warmly received by clean energy and climate advocates and business groups, but some critics say Australia should not be rewarded with summit hosting rights while it is still allowing large new coal and gas developments. This is the conflict in the Australian government\u2019s climate position. At home, it has a program to underwrite enough renewable energy to generate 82% of the country\u2019s electricity by 2030 and has legislated policies to drive a shift to cleaner cars and that promises to start to deal with pollution at large industrial sites. It is also attempting to argue against a Coalition nuclear energy proposal that many experts say would in reality boost fossil fuel power over the next two decades. But it also has no plan to limit coal and gas developments for export. In September the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, approved the expansion of three thermal coalmines that could lead to more than 1.5bn tonnes of CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere. Asked if the government\u2019s mixed messages \u2013 action at home, but unlimited shipments of fossil fuels to burn overseas \u2013 undermines its credibility and risks making people disengage on climate, Bowen responds that the Greens\u2019 argument for no new coal and gas is a \u201cneat, politically effective slogan\u201d, but that \u201clife is nowhere near that simple\u201d. \u201cThe idea that we can just say we\u2019re going to stop approving new coal, which means we stop exporting coal in due course, that is not the way you get this job done,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a drug dealer\u2019s defence\u2019. Well, ok \u2026 But the reality is that other countries will continue to export coal, and we need to think about our place in the world. \u201cI agree with this entirely: the biggest impact [on climate] we can have is on our exports. Hence, the need to become a renewable energy superpower.\u201d He points to an ambitious $30bn-plus SunCable plan to export solar energy from the Northern Territory to Singapore via subsea cable. Bowen was in the city state last month for the announcement the project had received conditional approval. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look holistically,\u201d he says. \u201cYes, our exports are important, but replacing our current fossil fuel exports with renewable exports is the key to it. Not just focusing on the negative \u2013 that we should be stopping fossil fuel exports. \u201cWe should be replacing fossil exports with renewable energy. And that is a big task, which is going to take a little while.\u201d"

            "content": "Support for nuclear power is likely to evaporate once Australians face a clear choice at the next election and realise the Coalition\u2019s policy would mean relying more on old coal plants and increased risk of blackouts, Chris Bowen says. The climate change and energy minister said that while some polling had suggested some voters were open to nuclear plants being allowed in Australia surveys had also consistently found they preferred renewable energy. \u201cEvery bit of research I\u2019ve seen, public and private, says that when shown details and given a choice between nuclear and other forms of energy, nuclear fares very, very badly,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at the popularity of different forms of energy, it\u2019s solar, wind, gas, daylight, coal, nuclear, in that order, every single time.\u201d The Coalition has named seven sites where it says it would eventually replace coal-fired power plants with nuclear plants but not how much this would cost. Multiple energy analysts argue nuclear energy would be more expensive than other options and a nuclear industry would not be possible in Australia until after 2040. The bulk of the country\u2019s coal plants are scheduled to close in the 2030s. The opposition has suggested it would limit the rollout of large-scale renewable energy \u2013 it has criticised Labor\u2019s goal of 82% renewable energy by 2030 \u2013 and bridge the gap by keeping ageing coal plants running longer and using more gas-fired power. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email It has not yet said what type of gas plants this means. With nuclear banned, gas is the most expensive form of electricity in the national electricity market and it use is largely restricted to \u201cpeaking\u201d power turned on only when needed. It provided less than 3% of electricity in the national grid over the past month. The chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, Claire Savage, told a parliamentary inquiry she did not believe that nuclear plants could be built in enough time to cover the closure of coal-fired power plants. More than a quarter of the coal power capacity in the national grid was offline on the day she gave evidence due to planned and unplanned outages. Polling on nuclear energy in Australia has produced varied results. A Lowy Institute poll in June found 61% strongly or somewhat supported its use alongside other sources of energy. A Guardian Essential poll was roughly split between people who considered it \u201can attempt to extend the life of gas and limit investment in large-scale renewables\u201d and those who said it was \u201cserious, and should be considered as a part of the nation\u2019s energy future\u201d. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Bowen said some Australians were open to nuclear energy but he was not concerned as there was a difference between people being open to it and agreeing to it. \u201cWhen you say to people, whether it\u2019s in a formal market research setting or a punter in the street setting, \u2018I don\u2019t object to nuclear, morally \u2026 but I object to it because it\u2019s so expensive, but probably even more importantly, because it takes so long, and we don\u2019t have time if we\u2019re going to wait the 20 to 30 years it would take, and that means more coal in the system and coal in the system longer, and even the Liberals aren\u2019t proposing to build new coal-fired power stations so they\u2019re just going to rely on these old ones longer, and that\u2019s blackouts\u2019 \u2013 then the support or openness evaporates.\u201d The Coalition\u2019s climate change and energy spokesperson, Ted O\u2019Brien, has promised more details of the opposition\u2019s proposal before the end of the year. He has rejected claims there would be a risk of an electricity shortage under its plan and said government and clean energy industry analysis of how much it would cost were inaccurate as they were not based on its full policy."

            "date": "2024-11-12T09:09:39Z",
            "content": "Shell has won its appeal against a landmark climate judgment by a Dutch court, which in 2021 ordered the fossil fuel company to sharply reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. A court of appeal ruled on Tuesday that, while Shell does have a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to cut its emissions as a big oil company, this would not be achieved by imposing a specific legal goal. Shell had appealed against a lower court ruling in 2021 that it must cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels. It was the first such ruling against a company in the world. Shell\u2019s chief executive, Wael Sawan, welcomed the appeal decision, saying it was \u201cthe right one for the global energy transition, the Netherlands and our company\u201d. The case was brought by Milieudefensie, the Dutch arm of Friends of the Earth, and more than 17,000 co-plaintiffs. \u201cThis hurts,\u201d said the director of Milieudefensie, Donald Pols. \u201cAt the same time, we see that this case has ensured that major polluters are not immune and has further fuelled the debate about their responsibility in combating dangerous climate change. That is why we will continue to tackle major polluters, such as Shell.\u201d Shell was originally told it must slash emissions within its own operations, as well as those of its suppliers and buyers, in line with the Paris climate agreement. During its appeal, Shell argued in court that corporate emissions were a matter for politicians, not the judiciary, and that any fossil fuels it chose not to extract would simply be exploited by another company. The appeals court said Milieudefensie had the right to bring such a claim even though political choices must be made to combat dangerous climate change. But it was not convinced that a reduction obligation imposed on a specific company would have the effect of limiting emissions from its customers, \u201cespecially if this reduction obligation can also be realised by selling less fossil fuels\u201d. Milieudefensie had accused Shell of failing to comply with the initial court ruling, which explicitly said the company should begin to act on the judgment immediately regardless of any appeal. The NGO gave evidence to the court that, despite increasing its volume of renewables, Shell was also planning to develop hundreds of new oil and gas fields despite the International Energy Agency warning against investments in any new fossil fuel extraction. The court said it was \u201creasonable to expect oil and gas companies to take into account the negative consequences of a further expansion of the supply of fossil fuels for the energy transition also when investing in the production of fossil fuels. Shell\u2019s planned investments in new oil and gas fields may be at odds with this.\u201d However, it said this was not relevant to whether a specific reduction obligation should be imposed on the company. Sawan said Shell still planned to halve emissions from its operations by 2030, adding: \u201cWe are making good progress in our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions.\u201d The court did uphold the statement that companies such as Shell had obligations to protect human rights. The judgment can still be appealed against and taken to the supreme court. However, this would focus on interpretation of the law and not the key facts of the case. Sjoukje van Oosterhout, head of research at Milieudefensie, said the NGO would read the full ruling carefully before deciding whether to appeal. But she said she believes there is still room for future legal action against corporations. While this appeal was taking place, other domestic courts issued important rulings on assessment of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel projects. In January 2024, Norway blocked the development of three North Sea oil and gas fields on the grounds that the state did not properly assess the impact of future use on climate breakdown. The UK supreme court issued a similar ruling several months later."

            "date": "2024-11-04T07:00:08Z",
            "content": "Drax will keep raising the levels of carbon emissions in the atmosphere until the 2050s despite using carbon capture technology, according to scientific research. The large power plant in North Yorkshire is a significant generator of electricity for the UK but has faced repeated criticism of its business model of burning wood pellets sourced from forests in the US and Canada. The new study found that the intensive forest management needed to source 7m tonnes of wood pellets from forests in the US to burn as fuel every year would erode the carbon stored in the ecosystems of these pine forests for at least 25 years. Drax was once one of the largest coal power plants in Europe but its owners claim that its switch to burning wood pellets means it is now a source of \u201ccarbon-neutral\u201d electricity because the emissions produced from its chimney stacks are offset by the emissions absorbed by the trees grown to produce the pellets. The research was based on a 2021 peer-reviewed analysis of the carbon emissions associated with using biomass pellets sourced from three Drax-owned mills in the southern US and combusted to generate about 4% of the UK\u2019s electricity. The original study, by Dr Thomas Buchholz of the Spatial Informatics Group, a scientific thinktank, found that the demand for wood pellets created by Drax would lead to reduced forest carbon stocks in managed pine forests in Louisiana and Mississippi which could raise atmospheric emissions for at least 40 years. An update to the study showed that the power plant\u2019s plan to fit carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to the plant by the 2030s would reduce this period of rising emissions but they would still be higher than they would otherwise be for decades, during a period that scientists have warned is crucial in addressing the climate crisis. \u201cThe results demonstrate that the CCS technology itself is less important than the impact of wood pellet sourcing on forest carbon stocks and flows,\u201d the study said. The company, which has claimed more than \u00a37bn in bill-payer-backed biomass subsidies since 2012, is in talks with the government to extend its subsidies from a 2027 end date until 2030 so it can fit CCS technology to the plant from 2030 to generate electricity with \u201cnegative emissions\u201d. These claims have been refuted by scientists, and the latest research is likely to reignite questions over Drax\u2019s green credentials and the government\u2019s support for biomass power. The government has thrown its weight behind CCS technology, pledging up to \u00a321.7bn of funding over 25 years to the industry last month. Chris Hinchliff, a Labour MP on the environmental audit committee, said: \u201cThe science behind Drax\u2019s claims to be able to achieve negative carbon emissions appears to be dangerously flawed. \u201cWith runaway climate change threatening our planet, tough choices need to be made. Public funds should not be spent on operations which are incompatible with the UK\u2019s commitment to achieving net zero by 2050. There are many other decarbonisation projects offering tangible climate benefits that are much more worthy of investment.\u201d In August, Drax agreed to pay the regulator a \u00a325m fine for submitting inaccurate data on the sourcing of wood pellets from Canada between April 2021 and the end of March 2022. The company has also faced claims, reported in the Financial Times, that it has used ecologically important wood sourced from old forests in Canada despite calls that these woods should be protected as their benefits include absorbing and storing atmospheric carbon for centuries. A spokesperson for Drax said the research was \u201cat odds with what the world\u2019s leading climate scientists say\u201d about the need for bioenergy fitted with carbon capture \u2013 known as Beccs \u2013 to remove carbon from the atmosphere. \u201cDrax is committed to rigorous data and transparent reporting to ensure our current biomass production and future Beccs activities support positive climate outcomes across all timescales, grounded in the best available science,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThis report is attempting to use limited science to validate what appears to be a predetermined view that Beccs is not sustainable. It uses assumptions and models that do not reflect Drax\u2019s sourcing practices or typical forestry operations in the US south,\u201d they added."

These minuscule organisms are masters of capturing carbon dioxide from the environment, and so productive and prolific that they fix up to 20% of the Earth\u2019s CO2. According to a recent research paper, they are one of the world\u2019s most powerful resources for removing CO2 from the atmosphere, absorbing an estimated 10-20bn tonnes every year, equal to the amount of carbon captured annually by all of the world\u2019s rainforests. And as an added bonus, they also give off oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis. Diatoms float in surface waters of oceans where they use sunlight to turn carbon dioxide into compounds used for their growth and development. They are particularly efficient at concentrating the CO2 captured inside their cell, which helps to explain how they fix so much carbon. When the diatoms die, they sink to the ocean floor and become sediment, in effect locking the carbon away. Alternatively, the diatoms are eaten by other sea creatures such as whales, and the carbon ends up in the animals\u2019 droppings that also fall to the ocean floor and become buried."

            "content": "Six decades after the bullet train first whisked passengers between Tokyo and Osaka, authorities in Japan are planning to do the same for cargo, with the construction of a \u201cconveyor belt road\u201d. The automated cargo transport corridor, which will connect the capital with Osaka, 320 miles (515km) away, is seen as part of the solution to soaring demand for delivery services in the world\u2019s fourth-biggest economy. Planners also hope the road will ease pressure on delivery drivers amid a chronic labour shortage that is affecting everything from catering and retail to haulage and public transport. The road will also help cut carbon emissions, according to Yuri Endo, a senior official at the transport ministry who is overseeing the project. \u201cWe need to be innovative with the way we approach roads,\u201d Endo told the Associated Press. \u201cThe key concept of the auto flow-road is to create dedicated spaces within the road network for logistics, utilising a 24-hour automated and unmanned transportation system.\u201d A computer-graphic video released by the government last month shows large containers on pallets \u2013 each capable of supporting up to a ton of produce \u2013 moving three abreast along an \u201cauto flow road\u201d in the middle of a motorway, with vehicles traveling in opposite directions on either side. Automated forklifts will load items into the containers as part of a network that links airports, railways and ports. Test runs are due to begin in 2027 or early 2028, with the road going into full operation in the middle of the next decade. While no official estimates have been released, the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper said a road linking Tokyo and Osaka could cost up to \u00a53.7tn [\u00a318.6bn] given the large number of tunnels that would be needed. If the project is successful, it could be expanded to include other parts of Japan. But humans will not be out of the picture altogether \u2013 they will still have to make door-to-door deliveries until the possible introduction of driverless vehicles. The ministry estimates logistics motorways could do the work of 25,000 truck drivers per day, the Yomiuri said. The shortage of truck drivers, who carry about 90% of Japan\u2019s cargo, is expected to accelerate after the introduction this year of a law limiting their overtime in an attempt to address overwork and reduce the number of accidents. While some have welcomed the change in a sector notorious for its long hours and difficult working conditions, the \u201c2024 problem\u201d will leave a gaping hole in the logistics workforce. If the trend continues the country\u2019s transport capacity will plunge by 34% by the end of the decade, according to government estimates. Demand for deliveries soared in Japan during the Covid-19 pandemic, with government data showing users rising from about 40% of households to 60%."

            "date": "2024-11-18T16:00:12Z",
            "content": "Relying on natural carbon sinks such as forests and oceans to offset continued fossil fuel emissions will not stop global heating, the scientists who developed net zero have warned. Each year, the planet\u2019s oceans, forests, soils and other natural carbon sinks absorb about half of all human emissions, forming part of government plans to limit global heating to below 2C under the Paris agreement. But the international group of authors who developed the science behind net zero have warned that countries could \u201ccheat\u201d their way towards Paris targets using naturally occurring parts of Earth\u2019s carbon cycle to make it look as if they achieved net zero while continuing to drive global heating. The study, published on Monday in Nature and led by the University of Oxford, said that naturally occurring carbon sinks such as rainforests and peatlands must be protected so they can remove historic pollution, but never formed part of the original net zero definition developed by scientists in 2009. The scientists underscored the need for \u201cgeological net zero\u201d, which means any future carbon emissions must be counteracted by permanent removal of the pollution from fossil fuels \u2013 not from pre-existing natural ecosystems. They urged governments to urgently clarify what net zero means at Cop29 in Azerbaijan or continue to risk catastrophic climate breakdown. The rules of the Paris agreement allow countries to claim carbon removals from \u201cmanaged land\u201d in their territory in their targets towards the goal, such as parts of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil or the taiga forest in Russia. But the net zero researchers said these rules allow countries to take credit for naturally occurring processes that have nothing to do with human emissions. Conversely, emissions and removals from \u201cunmanaged\u201d land, such as the recent wildfires in Canada that released CO2 equivalent to three times their annual footprint, are not factored into a country\u2019s progress towards the targets. \u201cWe have to protect passive carbon sinks. We have to protect our forests and oceans because we need them to provide that carbon sink service in order for net zero emissions to actually do what we promise people it will do, which is to halt global warming. But we can\u2019t pretend that those passive sinks are somehow compensating for ongoing use of fossil fuels,\u201d said Prof Myles Allen from the University of Oxford\u2019s department of physics, who led the study. \u201cIf you\u2019re still using fossil fuels and still generating carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels by mid-century, you need to have a plan to put the carbon dioxide they generate back underground or into some equally permanent storage,\u201d he said. Allen raised concerns that countries could even take credit for natural carbon removal from the sea by claiming \u201cmanaged oceans\u201d. \u201cMaybe you will get some countries deliberately using this in a mischievous way: \u2018cheating\u2019,\u201d said Dr Glen Peters, of the Cicero Center for International Climate Research in Oslo, a co-author on the paper. The study comes amid growing concern about the stability of Earth\u2019s carbon sinks, which researchers say temporarily collapsed in 2023 during record temperatures, an El Ni\u00f1o system, and other pressures on ecosystems. The result was that forest, plants and soil \u2013 as a net category \u2013 absorbed almost no carbon, research found. Analysis by the research organisation Zero Carbon Analytics has found that the role of nature in nationally determined contributions (NDCs) was a significant blind spot for governments that could make it look as if they were closer than they were to reaching net zero. An examination of differences in how natural carbon sinks are accounted for in models and NDCs indicated that the budget to limit global heating to below 2C could be 15% to 18% smaller than thought. It also found that the amount of land designated for land-based carbon dioxide removal \u2013 such as tree planting \u2013 by governments was unrealistic. \u201cHow land is classified in national climate commitments is a critical blind spot in carbon accounting. It allows vast emissions from wildfires and natural disturbances in forests to go uncounted, ultimately misrepresenting progress towards climate goals \u2026 Impressive-sounding national climate plans don\u2019t always give a true reflection of progress,\u201d said Joanne Bentley, who led the analysis for Zero Carbon Analytics. \u201cThis is especially problematic when governments over-rely on forests to absorb emissions instead of making the immediate, large-scale changes to industries that are urgently needed,\u201d she said.

            "content": "Black Friday is fast becoming Black Fraud Day with the discount period now \u201cprime time\u201d for scammers, according to Britain\u2019s cybersecurity chief, who said criminals were using artificial intelligence to trick shoppers. With online criminals taking advantage of an eagerness to save money amid the cost of living crisis, last Christmas people in the UK were scammed out of more than \u00a311.5m, figures show, almost \u00a31m more than in the same period in 2022. Fake clothing or high-end tech listings on social media were among the common ploys used to dupe people. The festive season had become \u201cprime time for cybercriminals\u201d as consumers hunted for deals, said Richard Horne, the chief executive of GCHQ\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). Fraudsters were \u201ctargeting bargain hunters with increasingly sophisticated scams, sometimes crafted using AI, making them harder to detect\u201d, he added. More than 16,000 reports of online shopping fraud were recorded between November 2023 and January 2024, with each victim losing \u00a3695 on average. Meanwhile, 7,168 reports (43%) made to Action Fraud, Britain\u2019s scam reporting centre, mentioned a social media platform. Online marketplaces were mentioned in 18.9% of reports. The figures, which were analysed by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, also showed people aged 30-39 accounted for the largest proportion of those who submitted a report (23%), closely followed by 40- to49-year-olds (20%). The average age of victims was 42. \u201cNever feel pressured into buying anything online,\u201d said Adam Mercer, the deputy director of Action Fraud. \u201cCreating a false sense of urgency is a tell-tale sign of a fraudster.\u201d He added: \u201cWhether you are shopping on online marketplaces, social media or retailers, avoid bank transfers if you can, and use a credit card as it can provide more protection if anything goes wrong.\u201d Black Friday started out as a single day of discounts, but with promotions now running for several weeks it has become the biggest shopping event of the year during which billions of pounds are spent. This year, average spending in the November sales is expected to hit \u00a3365 per shopper, up from \u00a3300 in 2023. This is despite four-fifths of people (82%) saying they are concerned about price increases for essentials such as food and energy, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group. With so much money at stake, scammers appear to be redoubling their efforts. The telecoms company Three said its customers were already reporting an increase in messages from fraudsters. Close to 3,500 scams a day were reported to Three during the Black Friday period last year. Since January, the volume of scam messages reported each month was 170,000 higher than in 2023, it said. To fend off scammers, the NCSC, which is launching a public awareness campaign on Monday, advises consumers to set up two-step verification, which provides an extra layer of protection and means that even if a criminal knows your password, they still will not be able access your accounts. Other advice is not to click on any links, and to research the company or seller by looking at reviews on trusted review sites."

            "content": "Russia-linked disinformation operations have falsely claimed officials in battleground states plan to fraudulently sway the outcome of the US presidential election, authorities said a few hours ahead of the opening of polling booths in the 5 November vote. \u201cRussia is the most active threat,\u201d the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said on Monday. \u201cThese efforts risk inciting violence, including against election officials,\u201d they added, noting the efforts are expected to intensify through election day and in the following weeks. The statement also noted that Iran remained a \u201csignificant foreign influence threat to US elections.\u201d It was the latest in a series of warnings from the ODNI about foreign actors \u2013 notably Russia and Iran \u2013 allegedly spreading disinformation or hacking the campaigns during this election. The latest ODNI statement cited the example of a recent video that falsely depicted an interview with a person claiming election fraud in Arizona involving fake overseas ballots and changing of voter rolls to favour Kamala Harris. The Arizona secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, called the video and its claims \u201ccompletely false, fake and fraudulent\u201d. A spokesperson for the Russian embassy did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. US officials warned in late October that Russia-linked operations were behind a viral video falsely showing mail-in ballots for Trump being destroyed in Bucks county in the swing state of Pennsylvania. The county\u2019s board of elections said the video was \u201cfake\u201d and the envelope and other materials depicted in the footage were \u201cclearly not authentic materials\u201d. In September, Microsoft\u2019s threat analysis centre said Russian operatives were ramping up disinformation operations to malign Harris\u2019s campaign by disseminating conspiracy-laden videos. Authorities also said they expected Iranian-linked operations to try to stoke violence by spreading false content. Tehran and Moscow have both denied such allegations in the past. Success in swing states is key to winning the White House for rivals Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, and those states have previously been the focus of unsupported accusations of election fraud.

            "date": "2024-11-18T14:33:33Z",
            "content": "\u201cThe software we use is older than me, and some of the hardware is older than my dad,\u201d says Siddharth*. He is one of a team fighting a daily battle to sustain ancient IT infrastructure at Thames Water. Sometimes the defences are breached. Thames, the UK\u2019s largest water and waste treatment company, is on a \u201cknife-edge\u201d according to sources, with its resilience in doubt because it depends on an array of creaking \u2013 often Victorian \u2013 infrastructure. While plenty of attention has been paid to its pipes, trunk mains and sewage overflows, less well understood is another big problem: its computer systems. Some IT systems date back to the 1980s, and have long been declared obsolete. According to sources who spoke to the Guardian, the systems are so antiquated they have been easy for cybercriminals to attack. \u201cThe hardware really is properly falling apart in front of your eyes,\u201d says Siddharth, who is in his 20s. \u201cWe\u2019ve been keeping machines going by using parts from similar old ones, once those give up the ghost. But we\u2019ve run out of our stores. We\u2019re not just holding things together with tape and glue. We\u2019re actually unable to turn things off, because we find we can\u2019t turn them on again.\u201d In an age of heightened risk, with espionage and attacks on critical national infrastructure reaching news heights, Thames and other companies\u2019 vulnerabilities are causing increased concern within Whitehall and beyond. With 16 million customers across London and Thames Valley relying on it, they fear the repercussions from a serious breach or systems failure. The controversies around Thames\u2019s finances as dividends piled up and its debt burden ballooned, as well as wider criticism of water companies\u2019 sewage treatment overflows, have often crowded out more detailed examination of its operations. Its economic regulator, Ofwat, has a responsibility towards ensuring water companies, including Thames, are resilient. Other aspects of its work, such as clean drinking water and security of its sites and systems, including cybersecurity, fall to a lesser-known small regulator, the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI). The pressure on the 50 or so staff that work at the DWI is acute. They are ultimately tasked with monitoring whether the water Thames and other companies in England and Wales provide is safe to drink. The DWI served Thames with an enforcement notice over the physical security at one of its sites earlier this year. Young workers, old machines Some of Thames\u2019s essential systems are still run on forms of Lotus Notes software from the late 1980s and early 1990s that can no longer be updated, Siddarth and other insiders at Thames Water say. Thames confirmed that it still uses Lotus Notes, but a source close to the company said that it was only for \u201cdatabases\u201d and not \u201ccritical\u201d systems. The use of Lotus Notes is a signal of how starved of investment technology at the company has been since it was privatised in the late 1980s. Other examples of obsolete or near obsolete technology include wide reliance on 2G technologies, arrays of meters that remain analogue and require manual checks, and hardware that is often more than 30 years old. Underinvestment in IT systems that are critical to the security of London and the south-east\u2019s water has left it prey to cyber-attacks from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea linked groups. There have been attempts on Thames\u2019s systems from groups believed to be linked to Russia, some of which have been at least partly successful, temporarily disabling some operations, according to three sources familiar with the company\u2019s operations. Thames declined to comment on the record about cyber-attacks, but a source at the company said it had \u201cnot experienced any cyber-attacks, full stop\u201d. Sources added the inability to turn things off \u2013 \u201cdark testing\u201d \u2013 means that basic cybersecurity protocols and service resilience cannot be established. The cyber arm of GCHQ, the National Cyber Security Centre, has warned of specific threats to Britain\u2019s water industry from attacks by \u201cstate-aligned actors, who are often sympathetic to Russia\u2019s further invasion of Ukraine\u201d. Troubling security gaps Sources claim that some areas containing IT equipment are not secure, and laid out a detailed list of areas within sites. They claim that it was possible to access some sensitive IT equipment within one particular site \u2013 which the Guardian named in correspondence with Thames \u2013 without appropriate security checks. A contractor without any requirement to enter areas with sensitive IT equipment was able to pass freely through areas containing it and would have been able to access or insert hardware into some computers. Thames declined to comment on the record when asked specific questions by the Guardian about buildings housing computer hardware, such as whether they were readily accessible by contractors or staff with no requirement to enter them. It also declined to comment on whether hardware could be easily removed or inserted into IT infrastructure. A company source said \u201call sites have stringent security measures in place\u201d and that claims otherwise were \u201cincorrect\u201d. A spokesperson for the Drinking Water Inspectorate said: \u201cThe Drinking Water Inspectorate considers the provision of a continuous, safe supply of clean drinking water to be the highest priority of a water company. Furthermore, this is a duty under the regulations. Where there are any circumstances which give rise to a concern to drinking water, the company are required to notify the inspectorate. \u201cSimilarly, water company staff are able report matters directly to the inspectorate. In both cases the inspectorate will carry out an investigation and will take action as necessary to maintain the high standard of drinking water in England. The inspectorate carry out a programme of risk-based audits to identify, monitor and verify areas of concern, and take enforcement action based on our enforcement policies.\u201d A spokesperson for Thames Water said: \u201cThe wellbeing and safety of our colleagues and customers is our highest priority. We supply 2.6bn litres of water every day, rated among the highest quality of drinking water anywhere in the world. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very open about the \u2018asset deficit\u2019 we face, and the challenges we will have meeting future demand if it\u2019s not addressed. That\u2019s why we have set out an ambitious plan for 2025-30 which asks for \u00a320.7bn of expenditure and investment with an additional \u00a33bn through gated mechanisms, so that we can meet our customers\u2019 expectations and environmental responsibilities. \u201cFurther, we take our requirements to protect customers\u2019 personal data and maintain essential services extremely seriously. We regularly review our systems to ensure their continued reliability. \u201cWe take a rigorous approach to financial discipline throughout the company in order to operate within budget, as any business in turnaround would be expected to do.\u201d An Ofwat spokesperson said: \u201cThe Guardian has raised a number of serious allegations about Thames Water. We will take action if there is evidence of breach of the company\u2019s obligations. \u201cWe have been pushing Thames Water to make significant improvements in its operational performance and financial resilience for some time. It is, of course, essential that all water companies provide a safe and reliable water supply. The company has made a request for a substantial increase in expenditure, including to address issues of asset health, as part of the current price review process. We are reviewing that request and the supporting information provided, and will announce our final decisions in December. \u201cIn assessing the business case put forward by companies and in our enforcement work, we work closely with other regulators where needed and seek their views. This includes the Drinking Water Inspectorate in regard to security and cyber measures related to water services, and the Health and Safety Executive and National Cyber Security Centre on matters relating to safety and cybersecurity.\u201d *Names have been changed"

The Canadian government said it was demanding the winding up of TikTok\u2019s business in the country due to \u201cspecific national security risks\u201d. It currently has offices in Vancouver and Toronto. \u201cThe decision was based on the information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community and other government partners,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, Canada\u2019s minister of innovation, science and industry. Champagne added that the government was not blocking citizens\u2019 access to TikTok or their ability to post content on the platform. TikTok has been banned from government-issued phones in Canada, the US, the UK, New Zealand and Australia amid concerns about the Chinese-owned app\u2019s access to user data. Champagne\u2019s statement did not give details of the security concerns behind the move but referred to risks related to ByteDance, the Beijing-based owner of the app, and its operations in Canada through TikTok Technology Canada. \u201cIt is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices and assess the possible risks of using social media platforms and applications, including how their information is likely to be protected, managed, used and shared by foreign actors,\u201d said Champagne. A TikTok spokesperson said : \u201cShutting down TikTok\u2019s Canadian offices and destroying hundreds of well-paying local jobs is not in anyone\u2019s best interest, and today\u2019s shutdown order will do just that. We will challenge this order in court. TikTok takes data privacy concerns very seriously.\u201d TikTok faces the threat of a full ban in US where the White House has introduced a law that gives ByteDance, until 19 January to sell its stake in the platform to an approved buyer, otherwise the app will be shut down. The president-elect, Donald Trump, who tried to force a sale of TikTok during his first administration, has said on the campaign trail he would \u201csave\u201d it. TikTok has also launched a lawsuit against the US law, arguing that it is breaches the first amendment protecting free speech."

            "content": "A ransomware gang claims to have stolen data from the Alder Hey children\u2019s hospital in Liverpool, allegedly including patient records. The INC Ransom group said it had published screenshots of data on the dark web that contained the personal information of patients, donations from benefactors and procurement information. Sources confirmed that snapshots of spreadsheets purporting to be from Alder Hey\u2019s systems had been displayed on the INC site carrying the message \u201cevidence of large scale data\u201d. There were 11 screenshots, understood to contain names, addresses, medical reports and financial papers. The Alder Hey children\u2019s NHS foundation trust said it was aware of the alleged leak and was working to verify whether the data belonged to the hospital. \u201cWe are aware that data has been published online and shared via social media that purports to have been obtained illegally from systems shared by Alder Hey and Liverpool Heart and Chest hospital NHS foundation trust. We are working with partners to verify the data that has been published and to understand the potential impact,\u201d the trust said. Alder Hey treats more than 450,000 patients a year making it one of Europe\u2019s busiest children\u2019s hospitals. It said its services were operating as normal and patients should continue to attend appointments. The hospital said it was working with the National Crime Agency to secure its IT systems and that the alleged data theft was not linked to another \u201ccyber incident\u201d that occurred this week at the nearby Wirral university teaching hospital NHS trust. Ransomware gangs typically operate out of Russia or former Soviet Union countries. They hack into their targets\u2019 computer systems and cripple them by inserting malware into the network, extracting data at the same time. They then threaten to leak the stolen data online unless they receive a payment, usually demanded in bitcoin. Last year, victims of ransomware attacks paid out a record $1.1bn (\u00a3866m) to assailants, according to the cryptocurrency research firm Chainalysis, double the 2022 total. Healthcare organisations are frequently targeted by ransomware gangs. In June, two major hospital trusts in London were subject to a ransomware attack which disrupted operations and accessed 300m patient interactions including the results of blood tests for HIV and cancer. The INC ransomware gang first emerged in July 2023 and as of April this year its second most popular target was healthcare organisations, the majority of them based in the US. However it has also claimed victims in the UK and this year said it was responsible for an attack on NHS Dumfries and Galloway health board. Rafe Pilling, the director of threat research at the cybersecurity firm Secureworks, said a partial leak of data was typical of ransomware gangs\u2019 attempts to secure a payment. \u201cThis is an attempt to apply pressure to the organisation,\u201d he said. A senior NHS official said trusts were advised not to pay ransoms and instead work with the NCA to respond to any demands. A spokesperson for the NCA said: \u201cWe are aware of an incident affecting Alder Hey Children\u2019s Hospital and the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital. NCA officers are working alongside the National Cyber Security Centre and the hospital trusts to understand its impact.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-02T10:00:12Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden promised a \u201crecovery for everybody\u201d as he prepared to take over an economy ravaged by the pandemic four years ago. Few predicted what would follow. One of two candidates \u2013 Kamala Harris, his vice-president, and Donald Trump, his predecessor \u2013 will succeed Biden in January. As millions prepare to elect the next US president, here is how the world\u2019s largest economy fared under Biden. Inflation The shock waves unleashed by Covid-19 were still rippling across the world when Biden took office in January 2021. In the US, and many other economies, they set the stage for an extraordinary rise in inflation. For months, the White House and Federal Reserve insisted the factors driving this surging price growth were \u201ctransitory\u201d. By the time the consumer price index peaked, reaching its highest level in a generation in June 2022, officials had changed their minds. The Fed embarked upon an aggressive campaign to tackle inflation in March 2022. Interest rates \u2013 cut to close to zero at the outset of the pandemic \u2013 were increased at 11 meetings, to a two-decade high. Suddenly the central fear looming over the US economy was not runaway inflation, but the specter of recession. As the Fed scrambled to cool activity in an attempt to tackle prices, warnings of a prolonged downturn cast a shadow. Jobs Such effects failed to materialize. The US economy remained remarkably resilient. Millions of jobs were created in the labor market. Non-farm payrolls, the key monthly measure used to take the temperature of the US economy, held firm. Unemployment slipped to lows not seen in half a century. About 399,000 jobs were added each month in 2022, on average \u2013 followed by about 225,000 each month in 2023. While growth has trended lower over the past year, and essentially flatlined in October amid disruptions wreaked by strikes and storms, hiring in September proved unexpectedly strong. The robust data sparked hope that policymakers would successfully guide the US economy to a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d, with price growth normalized and recession avoided. The Fed started to cut rates in September. When officials at the central bank make their next decision on Thursday, two days after the election, they are widely expected to cut rates further. Food prices While the US economy has remained remarkably resilient, many Americans have not been feeling it. The vibes have been off. Earlier this year, a clear majority of Americans wrongly believed the US was in an economic recession, according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. This gloom had only shifted slightly by the time pollsters reran the survey in September. Positive economic data releases \u2013 softening inflation, healthy recruitment levels, steady growth \u2013 are unlikely to move the needle when your bank balance continues to dwindle. The cumulative effect of years of inflation are still taking a toll. Falling inflation does not mean falling prices. The grocery store bills which rose so rapidly in 2021 and 2022 have not crashed back down to earth. For many Americans, the cost of living is much higher today than it was four years ago. Stock markets For Biden\u2019s predecessor, and potential successor, no barometer of US economic success was greater than Wall Street. Reassuring his Twitter (now X) followers that Covid-19 was \u201cvery much under control\u201d in the US in February 2020, Trump added: \u201cStock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d It has been looking even better under his successor. The S&amp;P 500 has rallied by more than half since Biden took office at the start of 2021, and all the major stock market indexes have hit new highs under his tenure."

            "content": "The Democratic party has begun to pick through Kamala Harris\u2019s loss to Donald Trump in the presidential election, with the post-pandemic headwinds, a failure to distance herself from Joe Biden and overestimating abortion access instead of the economy as an election winner, all reported by congressional Democrats as reasons for the decisive loss. Biden struck an optimistic tone in an address to the nation, praising Harris for an \u201cinspiring\u201d campaign. Comments from the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, claiming Democrats had \u201cabandoned working-class people\u201d, earned a rebuke from the Democratic party chair, Jaime Harrison. Biden\u2019s decision to pursue re-election and then his late withdrawal drew criticism from numerous former top Democrat advisers and politicians, including Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and presidential candidate, who said \u201cit probably wasn\u2019t great to cover up President Joe Biden\u2019s infirmities until they became undeniable on live TV\u201d. Biden\u2019s press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, pushed back on the accusation that it was arrogant for the 81-year-old president to run for a second term: \u201cThis is the president who has been the only person [who] has been able to beat Donald Trump.\u201d Here\u2019s what else happened on Thursday: US presidential election news and updates Trump has named Susie Wiles, the manager of his victorious campaign, as his White House chief of staff, making her the first woman to hold the influential role. She was seen as the leading contender for the job but has avoided the spotlight, even refusing Trump\u2019s invitation to take the microphone during his victory speech on Wednesday. Learn more about Wiles here. Vladimir Putin has congratulated Trump on his victory and expressed admiration for Trump\u2019s response to an assassination attempt. Putin said he was ready for dialogue with Trump, which will cause disquiet in Kyiv and other European capitals. Hours beforehand, Russia had carried out a massive drone attack on Kyiv, and killed four people in a strike on a hospital in Zaporizhzhia. Republicans have expanded their control of the US Senate, after Dave McCormick defeated the Democratic incumbent in Pennsylvania. Control of the House remained unclear on Thursday, with Republicans closing in on the 218 seats required for a majority. Healthcare providers have reported unprecedented surges in demand for reproductive and gender-affirming medications in the wake of Trump\u2019s victory, even greater than the day after Roe v Wade fell. California\u2019s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, announced a special session of the state\u2019s legislature to ensure the attorney general\u2019s office and other state agencies have the funding they need. California has been setting up guardrails to protect its residents\u2019 rights under an adversarial federal government. Trump as president may give Israel a \u201cblank cheque\u201d for all-out war against Iran, a former CIA director and US defence secretary has predicted. Palestinians in Ramallah argue things cannot get any worse for them than it has been under Biden. Elon Musk has said Trump\u2019s podcast appearances made \u201ca big difference\u201d in the election, as the manosphere and so-called \u201cheterodoxy\u201d celebrate the result. Meanwhile, searches for the 4B movement have spiked on Google and TikTok as women discuss cutting off heterosexual dating with men. A Texas judge has ruled against Biden\u2019s programme offering a path to citizenship for certain immigrant spouses of US citizens, a blow that could keep the scheme blocked through the president\u2019s final months in office. Fear has risen in undocumented communities and families face being torn apart at the prospect of Trump\u2019s promised mass deportation programme. Americans see immigration as the most pressing issue for Trump to address, and a large majority believe he will order mass deportations of people living in the US illegally, a Reuters/Ipsos poll has found. The US Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. Its chair, Jerome Powell, said the election result would have no \u201cnear-term\u201d impact on rates and insisted he would not resign if Trump asked him to leave early, adding that firing a Fed governor was \u201cnot permitted under the law\u201d. The British government will ask its ambassador to Washington, Dame Karen Pierce, to stay in post as Trump takes power, ahead of a complex shuffle of UK security and diplomatic jobs in the new year.

Few seemed impressed by months of positive headlines about slowing inflation: \u201cIt\u2019s not as if prices have come down, they\u2019ve just stopped rising as obscenely as before,\u201d as one woman in her 70s from Arizona, who still works part-time, put it. \u201cAm I supposed to be happy about that?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s more manageable, but prices are still too high for our wages compared to pre-pandemic,\u201d said a 36-year-old woman from Salt Lake City who works as a research associate. Even those who felt the economy was doing very well complained of the exorbitantly high cost of living. The economy, 40-year-old Roxanne Oesch from Missouri said, felt \u201cremarkably strong\u201d. \u201cGood jobs are available, interest rates are down and will come down further, and inflation has flattened out. It seems like there is a lot of good news.\u201d But simultaneously, she added, \u201cmost people still cannot enjoy the same level of financial security they had pre-pandemic\u201d. Alongside various young people who expressed dismay about their economic outlook were dozens of pensioners and people surviving on social security, for whom the new lower interest rates are bad news. \u201cInterest on savings is dropping, [which is] challenging for retirees on fixed incomes,\u201d said retired 71-year-old Paul Ames from Bellport, New York. \u201cThe US is doing a lot better than other developed economies. Gas is still way cheaper than Europe,\u201d said Toni, a retired woman from north Florida, who was among various respondents who felt very positive about the economy because they held stock market investments that had been making healthy gains in recent months. \u201cThings are good. The stock market has done well this year. Inflation isn\u2019t having much impact.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d said 69-year-old Timothy Crowley, from Honolulu. \u201cInvestment income rising. This is the best economy on earth.\u201d Respondents from places including New York City, Miami and Milwaukee pointed to rising levels of homelessness in their communities and felt that the US economic trickle-down model was broken. Views on who was responsible for America\u2019s economic shortcomings were split: while some blamed the Biden administration for triggering soaring levels of inflation and rising asset prices through unprecedented interventions to keep the economy afloat during the pandemic, others blamed the previous Trump administration and the larger structural economic system propped up by Wall Street and the Republicans. Alex, a married father of two in his mid-30s from rural North Carolina, said he retrained as a welder during the pandemic, thanks to government financial assistance, but he quickly felt exploited in his new line of work. \u201cI welded in two factories, each making millions in profits every year, and never made it off of government assistance, including food stamps and Medicaid. I\u2019m back in school now and succumbing to the student loan vampires, to try and make it work,\u201d he said. Alex said he has turned his back on Republicans, partly because of his economic concerns. Recent eye-wateringly high levels of inflation \u201cwere 25-percent caused by circa 15 years of quantitative easing, and 75-percent [caused] by corporate greed. I have completely abandoned the Republican party because they just refuse to rein in these economic monsters\u201d. White, the aquaculture specialist from North Carolina, also said that he became a swing voter because of the economy. He will \u201cvote a straight blue ticket until they turn their backs on Trump and the religious authoritarians\u201d, White said. \u201cI\u2019m retiring this year and believe Trump\u2019s tax breaks for the rich have already endangered my social security. He\u2019s also a threat to my healthcare.\u201d Among the respondents who expressed high levels of hopelessness were various college-educated people with established professional careers, such as architects, lawyers, engineers and medics, who said they were worried about financial insecurity, had recently been priced out of their longstanding communities or had been unable to save for retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s horrific,\u201d said 34-year-old Julia, a marketing professional from Washington. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t cost this much for basic necessities. I can\u2019t do anything but work and go to the gym now,\u201d she said, a remark that was echoed by many. \u201cNo social life, no plans, no savings.\u201d \u201c\u2018The US economy\u2019 is not a meaningful or useful concept for most Americans,\u201d said Karena Youtz, 54, a bookkeeper from Idaho. \u201cInflation is horrible. Around 40% of people in Idaho were fully employed and still unable to afford the cost of living here in 2019. I have no idea what that figure is now, but it\u2019s probably much higher.\u201d Melissa, retired, from northern California, who is disabled, reported struggling to get by on her social security payments. \u201cEverything is too expensive, my rent keeps rising faster than my social security benefits and food prices are too high. Medical services in my rural area are far too few and far too substandard,\u201d Melissa said. \u201cThe economy is doing fine and dandy. It\u2019s the citizens of this country that are suffering.\u201d"

            "title": "US economy \u2018motoring along\u2019 with 2.8% growth; coffee prices hit near-50 year high \u2013 as it happened",
            "date": "2024-11-27T17:37:17Z",
            "content": "Time to recap\u2026 The US economy expanded at a solid pace in the third quarter of the year, new data has confirmed. US gross domestic product increased at a 2.8% annualized pace in July-September, the second estimate of the figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed today. Analysts said it showed America\u2019s economy was \u2018motoring\u2019 along. But policymakers fear that new tariffs imposed by Donald Trump could hit growth at home and abroad. Price pressures seem to be picking up a little in the US, with the PCE inflation measure rising to 2.3% in the year to October. Coffee prices are certainly rising \u2013 they have jumped to their highest level in almost 50 years today, with analysts blaming fears of supply shortages. There have been some jitters on the French stock market, on concerns that the Paris government could be brought down by a row over a belt-tightening draft budget. Elsewhere: Wholesale coffee prices have hit their highest level in around half a century today. World arabica coffee price benchmarks climbed to their highest since 1977 on the ICE exchange today, Reuters reports, at $3.21 per lb (\u00a32.53/lb). Reuters attributes the rally to farmers in Brazil still reluctant to sell, speculators piling in, and talk of panic buying amongst the trade. A coffee expert at one of the world\u2019s top agricultural trade houses explained: \u201cBrazil farmers are not interested in selling, the trade has no cash and can\u2019t sell or put on new hedges, and speculators will certainly not sell, so there are not many sellers.\u201d Analysts at Saxo Bank said coffee prices were rising due to \u201csustained worries about Brazil\u2019s 2025 output after trees were hurt by a long drought earlier this year\u201d. There are also concerns that next year\u2019s harvest could suffer from the long dry and hot period that affected arabica coffee crops earlier this year, analysts at Rabobank explained. Arabica is the high-end variety favored for specialty brews. The price of robusta coffee, used to price the cheaper coffee variety typically used in instant coffee blends, has risen by almost 5% today, to the highest since the start of October. The US central bank\u2019s favourite inflation measure has risen. The PCE price index rose by 2.3% in the year to October, up from 2.1% in September to match August\u2019s reading. Stripping out food and energy, and core PCE rose to 2.8% from 2.7%. The Federal Reserve favours PCE as a good measure of inflationary pressures in the US economy, so Fed policymakers may be concerned to see prices rising faster than its 2% inflation target. The increase in US GDP in the last quarter was due to increases in consumer spending, exports, federal government spending, and business investment. The BEA reports: The increase in consumer spending reflected increases in both goods and services. Within goods, the leading contributors to the increase were other nondurable goods (led by prescription drugs) and motor vehicles and parts (led by used light trucks). Within services, the leading contributor to the increase was health care (both outpatient services and hospitals). The increase in exports primarily reflected an increase in goods (led by capital goods, excluding automotive). The increase in federal government spending primarily reflected an increase in defense spending. The increase in business investment primarily reflected an increase in equipment (led by information processing equipment as well as transportation equipment). The increase in imports primarily reflected an increase in goods (led by capital goods, excluding automotive). There\u2019s a subdued start to trading on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average has gained 75 points, or 0.17%, to 44,935 points. There\u2019s more action among small company stocks, though, lifting the Russell 2000 index by 1%. The Russian rouble has lurched to its lowest level since the early days of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The rouble has plunged by over 7.3% today to 113 roubles to the dollar, its weakest level since mid-March 2022. The latest drop came just days after the US introduced sanctions against Gazprombank, Russia\u2019s third-largest bank, which played a key role in processing payments for the remaining Russian natural gas exports to Europe. My colleague Pjotr Sauer reports: Earlier rounds of sanctions had spared Russian gas because Europe\u2019s economy was so dependent on it, but it is now far less reliant on Russian supplies. The Gazprombank sanctions raise the prospect of a further decrease in gas revenues and foreign currency for Moscow. The rouble\u2019s weakening threatens to erode Russians\u2019 purchasing power by increasing the cost of imported goods and could further increase inflation. The country is already contending with runaway inflation, which could climb to 8.5% this year \u2013 twice the Central Bank\u2019s target. US unemployment claims remained low last week. There were 213,000 new initial claims for jobless support last week, a drop of 2,000 compared with the previous week. Today\u2019s US GDP report shows that disposable personal incomes kept rising in the last quarter, despite inflation taking a bite out of pay packets. The Bureau of Economic Activity says: Disposable personal income increased $122.9 billion, or 2.3 percent, in the third quarter, a downward revision of $43.1 billion from the previous estimate. Real disposable personal income increased 0.8 percent, a downward revision of 0.8 percentage point. Today\u2019s US GDP report looks to be good news for Donald Trump \u2013 suggesting he will take control of an economy in good shape. Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors, says: \u201cThe US economy is clearly motoring. The second reading of Q3 annualised US real GDP growth has come in at 2.8%, in line with expectations and following 3% growth delivered in Q2, and 1.6% seen in Q1. \u201cRising real wages, falling interest rates and likely falling taxes and deregulation are all factors that are usually good news for stocks, and markets are already performing strongly in factoring in the better than expected growth. \u201cUS GDP has defied expectations throughout 2024, having been helped along by numerous factors. Consumer confidence levels, which have been consistently dreadful and would have indicated otherwise, do not seem to have deterred spending. Instead, US consumers continued with purchases, if more selectively in lower income households, which has played a significant role in boosting the economy. \u201cWhile growth has proven unexpectedly strong this year, looking ahead, Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks combined with a set of economic policies that are substantially un-tested in modern developed world economies mean that the range of outcomes for 2025 is wide. Nonetheless, expectations for the US economy are now much higher than they were, reflected by stock market gains of around 30% year to date. \u201cWith an impending sugar high from Donald Trump on the horizon, the US economy should continue to grow at a similar rate. However, it will take some time for the true nature and impact of the president-elect\u2019s policies to materialise. As covered in the introduction, Bank of England deputy governor Clare Lombardelli have warned that the president-elect\u2019s proposed trade tariff would pose a risk to economic growth in countries including the UK. Orders for durable goods at US factories rose last month, but by less than expected. Orders for durable goods \u2013 tangible products that can be stored or inventoried and that have an average life of at least three years \u2013 increased by 0.2% in October, less than the 0.5% expected. That follows a 0.4% fall in September \u2013 possibly a sign that customers are getting orders in before new tariffs are imposed on imports? Excluding transportation equipment, new orders increased 0.1%. Excluding defense products, new orders increased 0.4%. A flurry of US economic data has just been released, as statistics bodies clear the decks ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday tomorrow. First of all, we have confirmation that the US economy grew faster than European rivals in the last quarter. US GDP is estimated to have risen by an annualised rate of 2.8% in July-September, the same as was estimated last month. That\u2019s the equivalent of 0.7% growth quarter-on-quarter, much faster than the UK\u2019s 0.1% growth, and the 0.4% recorded in the eurozone. On trade, the US trade deficit has narrowed \u2013 to $99.1bn in October, down $9.6bn from the $108.7bn deficit recorded in September. Imports fell faster than exports: Exports of goods for October were $168.7bn, $5.6bn less than September exports. Imports of goods for October were $267.8bn, $15.2bn less than September imports. New US tariffs could push up the cost of furniture at IKEA. The chief financial officer of the world\u2019s biggest furniture retailer has told Reuters that the proposed tariffs would make it harder for IKEA to keep prices low. Juvencio Maeztu explained that some 30% of IKEA products are sourced from Asian countries including China, with 70% coming from Europe, adding: \u201cFor us, trade barriers around the world, whether it is from one country or another country, are limiting the possibilities to make things more affordable for the many people. \u201cWe will keep working with governments and with our supply chain to try to mitigate the impact and to hope to secure affordability.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s threat of a 25% tariff on Canadian imports could push Canada into recession, fears Rogier Quaedvlieg, senior US Economist at ABN AMRO. Quaedvlieg told clients today: From the perspective of Canada and Mexico, the tariffs are a hard blow. Exports to the US account for 74 and 80% of all exports of Canada and Mexico, and 20 and 26% of total GDP. Tariffs in the first Trump administration led to a percentage decrease in real consumption of about half the magnitude of the tariff percentage. This very conservative estimate gives a GDP hit of 2.5 and 3.25% to Canada and Mexico, enough to push at least Canada into a recession. Second order effects on dependent industries would amplify the impact. The countries reacted with shock to the announcement of such a strong measure. Canada seemed to try and appease President Trump, while Mexico threatened retaliatory tariffs. China on the other hand reacted mildly, seeing their promised 60% tariff downgraded to a mere 10%, although there is nothing to suggest that this proposal would replace the universal tariff touted during the elections. Manufacturers across the US are bracing for disruption from Donald Trump\u2019s planned new tariffs \u2013 and warning their customers could be hit \u2013 my colleague Callum Jones reports: Donald Trump set the business and political world alight late on Monday. The incoming president said he would impose a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada and hit China with more levies on day one of his term. \u201cThis Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\u201d he wrote on Truth Social. Scott Harris has been here before. Eight years ago Catoctin Creek, the Virginia whiskey distillery he runs with his wife, Becky, was generating 11% of its sales in Europe \u2013 and expecting to more than double its business there the next year. Then the trade war kicked in. After Trump imposed steep tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, the European Union hit back with retaliatory duties, including 25% on American whiskey. \u201cThat 11% went to zero,\u201d recalled Harris. While that initial wave of tariffs was repealed, today Catoctin Creek has \u201cno meaningful business\u201d left in Europe, he said. \u201cA few thousand dollars, but nothing to speak of.\u201d Trump\u2019s return to power sets the stage for a new trade war. The president-elect campaigned on a pledge to impose sweeping tariffs in a bid to revitalize the US economy. Officials in key markets are already considering if, and how, they would retaliate. More here: Back in Paris, shares in French financial companies are continuing to fall \u2013 amid worries that PM Michel Barnier\u2019s government could be brought down by a row over a belt-tightening draft budget. Insurance group AXA are down 5%, with bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale losing 3.5%. Yesterday, Barnier warned that France could face fiscal calamity should lawmakers decide to topple his government over a budget dispute. He told French broadcaster TF1 that \u201cThere\u2019s likely to be a serious storm and serious turbulence on the financial markets\u201d if the government were to collapse. French bond prices are pretty flat, though. But with German bond price rising, the spread between Paris and Berlin\u2019s borrowing costs has widened to a 12-year high: Bob Savage of BNY says: The French markets today are back to worrying about the risk of another election. The coalition government is stuck with 2025 budget battles and cracks in support with the National Rally far-right pushing back. There are broader implications about political risks everywhere. First is that in 2024, the voters have kicked on incumbents -signaling frustration over cost of living and national interests. Second is that deficits built up from pandemic responses are now problematic as debt servicing and austerity plans clash against fragmented coalitions. Setting what is most important in the years to come is the role of political leaders \u2013 and the best way forward will be to lead with growth but spending more money will not work in the same way it did during 2020. The problems of current policy and future policies show up most clearly not in FX or Equities but in Bonds. The risk premium for French debt is an example and a lesson for other governments. Britain\u2019s financial regulator has fined the former chief supply chain officer of budget airline Wizz Air Holding over \u00a3125,000 for trading company shares when he wasn\u2019t allowed to. Andr\u00e1s Seb\u0151k breached City rules by trading Wizz Air shares in the restricted 30-day period leading up to the firm\u2019s financial results announcements, the FA says, and also didn\u2019t notify the FCA and Wizz Air of his personal trades within the required 3 business days. The trading took place between April 2019 and November 2020, when Seb\u0151k made 115 trades in Wizz Air shares, worth over \u00a34m in total. This is the first time the FCA has fined a person discharging managerial responsibility (PDMR) for trading company shares during closed periods, under Article 19(11) of the Market Abuse Regulations (MAR), it says. Pets at Home boss Lyssa McGowan has broken ranks on the implications of cost rises linked to the government\u2019s budget - saying they won\u2019t necessarily lead to price rises. McGowan said Pets at Home\u2019s bill from the changes to National Insurance and the minimum wage would mean \u00a318m in extra costs for the specialist retailer, but this was in line additional cost from the increase in the minimum wage last year, which the chain had been able to absorb through various efficiencies helped by new technology. \u201cWe absorbed that [\u00a318m] and kept costs flat,\u201d McGowan said, adding that the company had no plans to change its strategy because of the budget measures. \u201c\u00a318m, some of which was unexpected, is a lot of money but like all retailers we are looking at all avenues to ameliorate that. It is not a given at all that we will have to put up prices.\u201d She said she was feeling \u201cconfident and optimistic\u201d about the run up to Christmas despite a \u201csubdued consumer\u201d environment, as households were turning to Pets at Home\u2019s own-label pet food, for example, as a way to save money helping the business grow in a flat market. She said shoppers were still prepared to buy treats - with the group\u2019s premium pet advent calendars quickly selling out, for example - but were being careful in many other areas. Pet food has seen high levels of price inflation in recent years, and McGowan said prices had now flattened, but not come down. In addition a surge in the number of pets in the UK has now flattened out, with the number of pets stabilising, so that Pets at Home is signing up 15,000 kittens and puppies a year to its loyalty scheme, half the level during the height of the pandemic pet boom. Pets at Home\u2019s share price dived 13% this morning, as the retailer warned that the subdued consumer environment would continue into the spring, hitting annual profits. Analysts at Peel Hunt trimmed \u00a310m off their forecast, taking it down to \u00a3135m. Here\u2019s Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, on Aston Martin\u2019s cash call: Aston Martin might be known for its association with James Bond, but there\u2019s no secret agent in sight to pull it out of its latest scrape. Instead, it\u2019s gone cap in hand to investors to raise money by issuing new shares after posting another profit warning, just months after flagging difficulties in September. The company has hit another troublesome speed bump, with production slowed down by supply chain issues, affecting deliveries of its super-high end Valiant models. This is coming on top of a deceleration of demand in China, a crucial market for the luxury car maker.\u2019\u2019 Trump\u2019s tariffs will lead to higher prices in the shops, and weaker currencies for Canada, China and Mexico, explains Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank. Schmieding says Taken at face value, such tariffs could raise the level of US consumer prices by c1% within a year if we assume that producers and distributors can pass on roughly 70% of higher import prices to consumers at a time of buoyant domestic demand. However, a depreciation of the Canadian, Mexican and Chinese currencies relative to the US dollar will likely absorb a significant part of that impact, perhaps up to half as a back-of-the envelope guess. Trump\u2019s tariff statement is probably merely the opening salvo of a series of tariff threats. But interestingly, he has tied his announcement of extra tariffs on the top three exporters to the US to specific complaints about immigration and drug trafficking. That seems to open the door for negotiations. If the three countries do his bidding on immigration and drugs control to some extent, the tariffs may not be fully imposed or be partly rescinded again afterwards. The Chinese yuan, Mexican peso and Canadian dollar all fell yesterday, with the latter hitting a four-year low against the US dollar. Shares in luxury car market Aston Marton have hit a two-year low in London this morning, after it tapped its investors for more cash and cut its profit forecast. Aston, which has been hit by softening demand in China, has raised \u00a3111m by issuing new shares worth 100p each \u2013 a near-8% discount to last night\u2019s close of 107.9p. It also raised \u00a3100m through new debt, and plans to use its new funds to invest in \u201cfuture growth opportunities\u201d and on its electrification strategy. Aston also warned shareholders last night that it has suffered delays in the delivery of its ultra-exclusive luxury car, Valiant, which cos \u00a32m each. While deliveries are still on track to start before the end of 2024, Aston now only expects to deliver around half of the 38 Valiant models by the end of the year, havng previously expected to get the majority into customers\u2019 hands. This will reduce operating profits to \u00a3270m-\u00a3280m, down from \u00a3285m previously expected. This morning, Aston\u2019s shares have dropped as low as 98.1p, the weakest since October 2022, before recovering slightly to 102.4p (-5%). Lawrence Stroll, executive chairman of Aston Martin \u2013 who rescued the company in 2000 \u2013 insists it can deliver \u201clong-term value\u201d to shareholders, as it enters 2025 with \u201ca stronger and more resilient balance sheet\u201d. But, shares are down roughly 97% since its stock market float in 2018\u2026. The London stock market has suffered another blow this morning, with the news that food delivery company Just Eat Takeaway is to delist. Just Eat is also listed on the Amsterdam stock market, where the company is headquartered, and said the delisting resulted from restarting a review into where its shares should be listed. Citing the \u201cadministrative burden, complexity and costs associated with the disclosure and regulatory requirements of maintaining the LSE listing\u201d as its reasons for the decision, Just Eat said it was also because of low liquidity and trading volumes of its shares on the London market. The French stock exchange, the Cac 40, has dropped to its lowest level since the market wobble of early August. The Cac 40 is down 0.8% at a three-month low, led by bank stocks, and exporters such as Renault (-2.1%) and STMicroelectronics (-1.7%). Back in the UK, the competition watchdog has reported that loyalty card pricing at UK supermarkets is not always the cheapest option for consumers. In a new report, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has found that loyalty prices do offer \u201cgenuine savings\u201d; after analysing 50,000 loyalty-priced products, it found 92% offered savings on the usual price. Customers can make savings of up to 25% by buying loyalty priced products, according to the CMA. But it stressed that while they offer \u201clegitimate\u201d discounts, supermarket customers could still find cheaper alternative options by shopping around. George Lusty, interim executive director of consumer protection, explains: \u201cWe know many people don\u2019t trust loyalty card prices, which is why we did a deep dive to get to the bottom of whether supermarkets were treating shoppers fairly. \u201cAfter analysing tens of thousands of products, we found that almost all the loyalty prices reviewed offered genuine savings against the usual price \u2013 a fact we hope reassures shoppers throughout the UK. \u201cWhile these discounts are legitimate, our review has shown that loyalty prices aren\u2019t always the cheapest option, so shopping around is still key.\u201d US tariffs would also have an impact on American consumers. Economists at Deutsche Bank have calculated that if Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs were fully implemented, US core PCE inflation for 2025 could increase from 2.6% to 3.7%. Before Trump\u2019s victory the assumption was for 2.3% inflation in 2025. Share have rallied in China today, on hopes that Beijing may roll out new stimulus measures to protect its economy from Trump\u2019s tariffs. The CSI 300 index has rallied by 1.75%, while stocks in Shenzhen are up over 2%. Vis Nayar, chief investment officer at Eastspring Investments in Singapore, explains: \u201cWith the potential threat of tariff hikes in 2025, it\u2019s likely China\u2019s policymakers would come up with further stimulus packages to counter downward economic growth pressure from domestic cyclical weakness and increased external uncertainty. There remains plenty of scope for China to surprise the markets.\u201d Budget airline easyJet has swelled its profits, despite the turmoil in the Middle East hitting demand. EasyJet has reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a3602m for the year to 30 September, \u00a3170m than the previous year. This earnings surge was driven by strong demand over the summer; easyJet had made a loss of \u00a3350m in the six months to 31 March, as conflict in the Middle East led to flight cancellations, extra costs and revenues. Outgoing CEO Johan Lundgren, says: \u201cThis strong performance - resulting in a 34% increase in our annual profits - reflects the effectiveness and execution of our strategy as well as continued popularity of our flights and holidays. It also represents a significant step towards our goal of sustainably generating over \u00a31 billion annual profit before tax. Profits were also lifted by charges for cabin bags and \u201cleisure bundles\u201d; last week, easyJet was one of five airlines fined in Spain for charging passengers for hand luggage and seat reservations\u2026. Overnight, Donald Trump has picked a proteg\u00e9 of Robert Lighthizer, his trade representative in the first Trump administration, to lead trade policy in Trump 2.0. Jamieson Greer, an attorney, will serve as the next US trade representative, Trump announced ovenight, and will be tasked with reining in the trade deficit and opening up \u201cexport markets everywhere\u201d. Greer, 44, served as chief of staff to Lighthizer, who designed Trump\u2019s original tariffs on some $370bn worth of Chinese imports, and also renegotiated the North American free trade deal with Canada and Mexico. Lighthizer, an arch protectionist and sometime free-trade skeptic, blasted \u201cglobalists\u201d and other ideological free-traders in his recent book, \u201cNo Trade Is Free\u201d. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, says: Trump has made more picks for his cabinet, including the trade representative, Jamieson Greer. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the tariff tzar in Trump\u2019s first term as president, Robert Lighthizer, and he is seen as trade hawk. This suggests that tariffs will be at the heart of Trump\u2019s trade agenda. However, it is worth noting that as trade representative, Greer\u2019s office will be overshadowed by the US Treasury. The new Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, is moderate on tariffs, and has espoused free trade ideals in the past. This suggests that Trump\u2019s tariff talk may be more bark than bite, although Greer\u2019s appointment is a nod to the trade hawks in his team. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. A day after Donald Trump announced plans for fresh tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, policymakers around the world are digesting the consequences of \u201cTariff Man\u201d Trump returning to the White House. A deputy governor at the Bank of England, Clare Lombardelli, has warned that the president-elect\u2019s proposed trade tariff would pose a risk to economic growth in countries including the UK. Speaking to the Financial Times, Lombardelli explained that Trump\u2019s trade policies could hit growth in the short term, while long-term productivity also suffers from increased trade frictions. She says: \u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate on the specifics but we know barriers to trade are not a good thing, whether they are tariffs or regulatory or others. \u201cWhether you are an economic historian, an economic theorist or a data-driven economist, the impact is clear in terms of its direction. In terms of its size, that depends on the circumstances.\u201d Trump rattled the financial markets yesterday by announcing he would impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and an extra 10% on China, in a crackdown on immigration and drugs. Trade experts fear that Trump could spark a global trade war, if other countries retaliate with their own tariffs in response. Keith Rockwell, a former director at the World Trade Organization, explained: \u201cThe United States exports hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods to these countries. Anyone who expects that they will stand pat and not retaliate has not been paying attention.\u201d Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs are likely to push up inflation in the US, as importers will pass the higher costs onto consumers \u2013 and possibly add a bit more on top! But they could have a deflationary impact on other countries; China, for example, could reroute shipments to Europe rather than the US, cutting prices to support its sales. They also pose a political dilemma for the UK \u2013 should it try to align with the US, to avoid being hit by tariffs too, or try to get closer to the EU? Simon Sutcliffe, Customs &amp; Excise Duty Partner at accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg, says the US hasn\u2019t considered such a protectionist trade policy since the 1930s with the Smoot-Hawley Act \u2013 which ended up fuelling the Great Depression. Sutcliffe says Sir Keir Starmer faces a dilemma: One of the biggest stumbling blocks in the UK\u2019s trading relationship with the EU is the control and administration surrounding the movement of food products. Moving closer to the EU may allow development of a consistent and streamlined food policy which would reduce trade red tape and extra charges.\u201d \u201cHowever, aligning with the US would undermine that attempt, as the EU would be exceptionally resistant to allow US originating food products to \u2018seep\u2019 into its marketplace, resulting in the administrative burden on food movements being cemented in for longer.\u201d \u201cBut \u2018Refusing\u2019 the US may result in UK exporters being subject to US tariffs on their products. The US is the largest individual trading partner of the UK trading with roughly 30% of our total exports going to the US and the US exporting 10% of its goods to the UK, so any tariffs would have a big impact on UK trade.\u201d Also coming up today We\u2019ll get a full-body health check on the US economy today, with a flurry of economic data \u2013 from GDP to trade and jobless claims \u2013 being rushed out ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday tomorrow.

            "content": "Hurricanes and the enormous strike at Boeing were always going to be temporary factors in the US economy, but there are nevertheless signs of a \u201cslowing trend\u201d, according to economists. Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, said the data \u201cbolsters the case\u201d for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates at both its November and December meetings. After that, it depends on what happens on Tuesday... Tombs said: The muted rise in October payrolls is not merely due to strikes and the recent hurricanes. A further slowing in the trend looks likely given that hiring intentions of small businesses remain depressed, large businesses still face a rise in their borrowing costs as low-rate corporate bonds mature, and job openings in the health and education sector have fallen. August and September job gains were revised down by 112,000 jobs, and growth in job numbers slowed. Preston Caldwell, chief US economist at Morningstar, said: Even setting aside the October data, where the impact of temporary distortions is unknown, today\u2019s jobs report was a bit bearish. The data does point to an ongoing downtrend in job growth. [\u2026] There is nothing in the overall assemblage of labour market data to dissuade the Fed from cutting in next week\u2019s November meeting and to loosen policy further over the next year. The data overall points to a job market that has shed all of its post-pandemic tightness and excesses, and the data suggests enough downside risk to warrant nipping in the bud with monetary easing. In other business news today: The UK gilt market appeared to stablise after yields jumped on Thursday. HSBC chairman Mark Tucker gave his support to Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget. The UK manufacturing industry fell into contraction in October as companies paused investments ahead of the budget, according to the closely followed purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). Rating agencies gave their UK budget verdicts. Moody\u2019s said the UK government\u2019s increased borrowing will give an \u201cadditional challenge\u201d to the public finances, while S&amp;P Global said the UK government will be \u201cconstrained\u201d by its debt load. UK house price growth slowed in October ahead of Wednesday\u2019s budget, surprising economists who had expected faster increases, according to one of the key measures collected by a lender. Oil prices rose after reports that Iran is preparing an attack on Israel.

Please do join us next week as we strap in for the US election, and its fallout on financial markets. JJ The response from the business lobby to the UK budget was fairly negative, but criticism of the Labour government has not been universal. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has gained the backing of some senior bankers \u2013 perhaps cognisant that Labour is likely to be in power for at least five years. Mark Tucker, chairman of HSBC, said: This is a budget which lays the foundations for necessary investment within a framework of clear fiscal rules. The overall package strikes a balance between tax, spending and borrowing to finance public services, alongside a focus on delivering economic growth. Patrick Thomson, JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive of asset management in EMEA, said: The market reaction compared to the Truss mini-budget has been relatively muted and should count as a success considering the ambition of the Budget. It was helpful that there were few surprises, given that it was so well telegraphed ahead of time. Having raised taxes for much-needed investment in public infrastructure and services, the market will be waiting to see that the money is spent wisely in actually fixing any underlying problems in the economy to have long term impact. Ultimately, we all want to see how this translates into growth, and so the City will look to the forthcoming Mansion House speech for further detail on the proposed investments. British banks with big motor finance arms have had a dire week on stock markets since a court ruling that could cost them billions of pounds. The latest lender to join the procession of warnings was Secure Trust Bank. It had already said that it was looking at the ruling, but on Friday it worried the market further with a profit warning. Its share price is down by 17% today, adding to a dire run that has driven its valuation to its lowest since floating in 2012. The share price dropped from above \u00a38 a week ago to \u00a34.70 today. The bank said that it was taking longer than expected to recover money from people who had defaulted on loans, meaning that profit before tax would \u201cfall materially below market expectations by between \u00a310m and \u00a315m\u201d. David McCreadie, Secure Trust Bank\u2019s chief executive, said: We are disappointed that it will take longer than expected to recover value from the excess level of defaulted vehicle finance balances, and the recent court of appeal decisions have added additional uncertainty on the benefits to be realised in 2024. US stocks are all up by more than 1%, after weak jobs data appeared to remove any lingering chance of the Federal Reserve leaving interest rates on hold next week. The S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average indices are all up by more than 1% in morning trading in New York. What have we learned from the US jobs numbers? It\u2019s tricky to say. Lara Castleton, US head of portfolio construction and strategy at Janus Henderson Investors, said it was \u201can underwhelming and muddying jobs report just five days before an election\u201d. There was no clear signal because of the hurricanes. There will likely not be much influence from this report on the results of next week nor on the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision later in the month, which will likely be 25-basis-points cut amidst this backdrop. James Knightley, chief international economist for the US at ING, an investment bank, said the number was \u201cdepressed by strike action and hurricane disruption\u201d. Nonetheless, the trend in hiring is obviously slowing and with the inflation backdrop looking less threatening, the Federal Reserve clearly has scope to move policy closer to neutral. Given the inflation backdrop is less threatening and the Fed is putting more emphasis on jobs, today\u2019s report cements expectations for a 25bp Fed rate cut next week. We expect that to be followed up by another 25bp rate cut in December. Wall Street has opened higher. Share prices were likely helped by expectations of looser monetary policy from the Federal Reserve after surprisingly weak jobs numbers. Here are the opening snaps, via Reuters: S&amp;P 500 UP 23.42 POINTS, OR 0.41%, AT 5,728.87 NASDAQ UP 93.71 POINTS, OR 0.52%, AT 18,188.86 DOW JONES UP 199.46 POINTS, OR 0.48%, AT 41,962.92 Back in the UK, the RMT union has suspended tube strikes due to start today after what it called a \u201csignificantly improved offer\u201d from Transport for London. Engineering staff represented by RMT were due to stop work for 24 hours from 6pm today. However, the separate Aslef union has not called off its action. Train operators and managerial employees are due to strike on 7 and 12 November. An RMT spokesperson said: Following intense negotiations with London Underground management and a significantly improved offer, we have suspended the strikes scheduled to start this evening. London Underground have sensibly abandoned their proposed changes to pay structures which now means all our members will receive the same value in any pay award. Further discussions will take place next week regarding the pay offer but progress has been made which would not have been possible without the fortitude and industrial strength of our 10,000 members on London Underground. *This post has been updated to reflect the fact that Aslef has not called off its strike action. The jobs numbers prompted a rapid fall in the yield on US Treasury bonds. The yield on the 10-year benchmark dropped 10 basis points (0.1 percentage points) in the immediate aftermath of the data. Perceptions of a weaker US economy will make the Federal Reserve more likely to lower interest rates next week. That would boost the relative value of bonds. (Yields dropping means prices are rising.) It\u2019s something of a side issue given the context of the US election, but the drop in yields has also affected UK debt. The yield on 10-year gilts has dropped below 4.4% \u2013 wiping out all of Thursday\u2019s post-budget move. The US dollar has weakened after the shock drop in non-farm payrolls. The dollar is down by 0.3% against a trade-weighted basket of currencies after initially climbing over the course of today. The pound is now up 0.5% today against the greenback, while the euro is up 0.1%. You can see the immediate reaction on this chart showing the performance of the dollar basket today: Economics professor Justin Wolfers of University of Michigan says that the underlying trend is of slower growth in jobs, but not a signal of a disastrous economic situation. But the headline is nevertheless still a long way below any recent readings thanks to the strikes and hurricanes. The US unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1%, but it is the non-farm payrolls number that will take up all the attention. Only 12,000 jobs were added \u2013 which will surely be seized on by Donald Trump in the last few days of campaigning ahead of the presidential election. A miss in the forecasts of that magnitude \u2013 more than 100,000 jobs \u2013 is rare. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) added the important caveat that the jobs reading is the first since Hurricanes Helene and Milton hit the US. The BLS said: It is likely that payroll employment estimates in some industries were affected by the hurricanes; however, it is not possible to quantify the net effect on the over-the-month change in national employment, hours, or earnings estimates because the establishment survey is not designed to isolate effects from extreme weather events. There was no discernible effect on the national unemployment rate from the household survey. It also added that \u201cEmployment declined in manufacturing due to strike activity\u201d \u2013 a reference to the ongoing strike at Boeing in particular. The US economy added far fewer jobs than expected in October, in a shock reading that will raise questions about its momentum days before the presidential election. Only 12,000 jobs were added in the month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, far below economists expectations of 113,000, and the 254,000 in September. Tens of millions of Americans have already voted, but we will shortly receive the last big economic update before the US presidential election next Tuesday: non-farm payrolls. The jobs numbers are a key measure of the US economy, but this month they could be affected by the huge strike at Boeing and the effects of a hurricane hitting Florida. Whatever the noise, the figures will help to set the narrative for the next day or two as the election campaign enters its most frantic stage. Bob Savage, head of markets strategy and insights at BNY Mellon, a US investment bank, said: US October non-farm payrolls expected 110,000 after 254,000 with hurricane and strike noise. The unemployment rate expected steady at 4.1% and the average hourly earnings flat at 4% year-on-year. Reuters\u2019s poll of economists suggests that the reading will be 113,000, down from 254,000 in September. A quick check-in on gilt markets: the Labour government will have been eyeing developments nervously after some movement this week, but so far on Friday things have been fairly steady. The yield on the UK 10-year bond has dropped to 4.42%, down from a high of 4.51% during London trading hours and two basis points (0.02 percentage points) below yesterday\u2019s close. Yields move inversely to prices, so falling yields is a sign of investors buying bonds, after Thursday\u2019s selloff. The 30-year yield has also dropped by a basis point, while the short-term two-year gilt is down four basis points in today\u2019s trading. The pound is up by 0.2% against the US dollar, and 0.3% against the euro. Shreyas Gopal, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said that the budget should be net positive for the pound, because it will likely make the Bank of England more hawkish \u2013 more likely to keep interest rates higher for longer. Our economist\u2019s base case for next week is that the BoE now retains its language around cuts being \u201cgradual.\u201d Higher policy rates for longer, driven by a demand stimulus that lifts growth and inflation, ought to be positive for the pound in the current market environment. America\u2019s two oil giants reported combined profits of more than $13bn (\u00a310bn) for the third quarter as higher production volumes made up for weaker prices. ExxonMobil made $8.6bn, while Chevron made $4.5bn. Both beat analyst forecasts. ExxonMobil said it had produced the most oil for a quarter in over 40 years, at 3.2m barrels per day. Chevron said its oil output rose 7% compared with last year thanks to record production in the US, including the West Texas Permian Basin. Slower global economies have dragged down oil prices in recent months \u2013 despite the turmoil in the Middle East and Ukraine. That has hit oil company profits this year, but there is little sign of them slowing down. Both companies and their rivals have expanded production in the face of warnings from forecasters such as the International Energy Agency that exploration for new oil and gas wells must cease if the world is to hit climate targets to limit global heating to 2 degrees Celsius. Oil prices have risen by 2% after reports that Iran is preparing an attack on Israel. Futures prices for Brent crude oil, the North Sea benchmark, have risen by 1.9% to $74.22, while the North American equivalent, West Texas Intermediate, is up 2.1% to $70.73. US news website Axios reported that Iran was considering the strikes, citing Israeli officials. Investors have been watching the conflicts in the Middle East closely for anything that could mark the start of further escalation. So far Israel\u2019s wars against Hamas in Gaza and Lebanon have not directly affected oil production, for all the horrors of the losses of civilian lives. The UK manufacturing industry fell into contraction in October as companies paused investments ahead of the budget, according to the closely followed purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). The final reading for British manufacturing dropped to 49.9 points in October, according to S&amp;P Global, below the 50 index level that marks a contraction. The initial \u201cflash\u201d reading had been 50.3. It was the first time since April that manufacturing activity had contracted, S&amp;P said. Rob Dobson, director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: UK manufacturing started the final quarter of the year on an uncertain footing amid speculation on government policies ahead of the Budget, which was widely reported to have led to a wait-and-see approach on investment and spending. This domestic headwind, combined with an ongoing loss of export business, led to the first outright contraction in new work intakes since April. Output growth came close to stalling as a result. Another of the big three rating agencies has published its verdict on the UK budget: S&amp;P Global Ratings said that the UK\u2019s fiscal position is \u201cconstrained\u201d \u2013 but it also said that public investments \u2013 particularly in the health service \u2013 could create a \u201cmore business-friendly environment\u201d. The UK faces \u201celevated budgetary deficits and net general government debt level\u201d, S&amp;P said \u2013 although it did not raise its forecasts for budget deficits because it had already taken into account \u201clingering public spending pressures\u201d. Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019s new fiscal rules gained the unusual backing of the International Monetary Fund this week, because they allow for increased investment. However, S&amp;P said that the rules presented \u201cmixed messages\u201d because they allowed for greater spending, but also that they are more credible on cutting future deficits because they require debt to be government debt to falling within three years. (Previous rules had a five-year timeframe, which meant governments could up load notional tax rises in the future, knowing they were unlikely to have to deal with it themselves.) The key test of success for Reeves will be growing the economy, S&amp;P said: The front-loading of spending will mechanically boost growth in the short term, but it\u2019s too early to tell how much this will add to potential output in the long term. On the positive side, investments in infrastructure and planning reforms should create a more business-friendly environment; an improved health service should help bring people back to work as current inactivity remains mainly linked to people who are off sick; and education and childcare investments should improve workers\u2019 skills in the long term. Nonetheless, reaping those potential benefits will also depend on whether the spending is deployed in an effective way. S&amp;P underlined that Reeves and Starmer have gambled on higher spending generating increased growth. If that does not happen it could prove tricky for the UK: A hypothetical scenario in which public spending is permanently higher but the quality and accessibility of public services still doesn\u2019t improve enough, could further complicate policy trade-offs in the future. Conversely, a faster improvement in public services could yield greater dividends in terms of lower future pressures and positive growth repercussions. The UK government\u2019s increased borrowing will give an \u201cadditional challenge\u201d to the public finances, according to influential rating agency Moody\u2019s. UK gilt yields, effectively the price at which the government can borrow, rose to their highest level this year on Thursday afternoon as markets responded to Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget \u2013 the first by a Labour government in 14 years. Investors were responding particularly to the prospect of about \u00a328bn in extra borrowing. Moody\u2019s said that the budget would not do much to boost UK economic growth, and that there was only a limited buffer if the country faces further financial shocks, in a further sign of the wariness of financial markets towards the government\u2019s plans. In a note sent to investors, reported by the Financial Times, Moody\u2019s said: In our view, the increase in borrowing, which is in part supported by a new measure of debt under the fiscal framework, will pose an additional challenge for what are already difficult fiscal consolidation prospects. [\u2026] Furthermore, the extent to which new investment spending can raise growth potential will be limited unless structural constraints are durably addressed which will prove difficult. Moody\u2019s is one of the three major ratings agencies, alongside S&amp;P and Fitch. Their economists are not privy to any special information or insight on sovereign debt, but their assessments tend to be influential among bond investors Changes to stamp duty by Rachel Reeves in the budget mean we should expect a rush of UK property transactions in the new year until the end of March, according to Nationwide. That will probably be followed by a period with fewer transactions in the months afterwards. The chancellor\u2019s decision to remove the temporary increase to the nil rate for stamp duty next April could spark a rush to complete purchases before the changes. In September 2022, the government temporarily increased the nil rate of stamp duty, the amount before you have to start paying stamp duty on a purchase, for homebuyers, raising the nil rate for first-time buyers from \u00a3300,000 to \u00a3450,000, and for those buying an additional home from \u00a3125,000 to \u00a3250,000. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: The main impact of the stamp duty changes is likely to be on the timing of property transactions, as purchasers aim to ensure their house purchases complete before the tax change takes effect. This will lead to a jump in transactions in the first three months of 2025 (especially March), and a corresponding period of weakness in the following three to six months, as occurred in the wake of previous stamp duty changes. The biggest mover on the FTSE 100 this morning is Reckitt Benckiser, the maker of products ranging from Dettol to Strepsils. Reckitt\u2019s shares are up 10% after a US court ruling boosted its baby formula subsidiary, Mead Johnson. Here\u2019s the Reuters report on the ruling from last night: Abbott and Reckitt unit Mead Johnson are not responsible for a young boy\u2019s debilitating intestinal disease, a jury found on Thursday in a lawsuit accusing them of failing to warn of their premature baby formulas\u2019 risks, a victory for the two companies following large losses in similar trials. At the five-week trial in St. Louis, Missouri state court, lawyers for plaintiff Kaine Whitfield had urged jurors to award more than $6.2 billion. The lawsuit, brought on Kaine\u2019s behalf by his mother, Elizabeth Whitfield, alleged that the companies failed to warn that their specialized formulas used by newborn intensive care units in hospitals could cause necrotizing enterocolitis, a disease that almost exclusively affects premature infants and has an estimated mortality rate of more than 20%. The UK\u2019s chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, has said that the UK is seeing a normal market response to the budget, after the \u201cPTSD\u201d from the chaos following Liz Truss\u2019s 2022 \u201cmini-budget\u201d. Asked about the market response to the budget, the Jones told Sky News that \u201cmarkets always respond to budgets in the normal way\u201d. There\u2019s a lot of new information about the economy and the nation\u2019s finances presented to Parliament, and it\u2019s normal for markets to respond. I think we\u2019ve all got PTSD from Liz Truss and just let\u2019s compare the two different scenarios, because they\u2019re very, very different: So, under Liz Truss, as we saw, they sacked permanent secretary, they ignored the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. They announced \u00a345bn of unfunded tax cuts and said they were only just getting started. And then the market went mad and we all know what happened. Completely different in contrast to now. Stock markets across Europe have gained ground. The FTSE 100 in London is up by 0.4%. Here are the opening snaps from across the rest of Europe: EUROPE\u2019S STOXX 600 UP 0.1% GERMANY\u2019S DAX FLAT FRANCE\u2019S CAC 40 UP 0.2%; SPAIN\u2019S IBEX UP 0.1% EURO STOXX INDEX UP 0.1%; EURO ZONE BLUE CHIPS UP 0.1% As trading in London has opened, yields on the UK 10-year and the 30-year have risen by about four basis points (0.04 percentage points) apiece. But they still remain just below the high for the year hit on Thursday. That left the 10-year gilt at 4.477%, and the 30-year at 4.913%. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. UK house price growth slowed in October ahead of Wednesday\u2019s budget, surprising economists who had expected faster increases, according to one of the key measures collected by a lender. House prices grew by 0.1% in October, according to the Nationwide building society. That was less than the 0.3% rate that economists polled by Reuters. The annual rate of growth slowed from 3.2% in September to 2.4% in October, below the 2.8% expected by economists. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: Housing market activity has remained relatively resilient in recent months, with the number of mortgage approvals approaching the levels seen pre-pandemic, despite the significantly higher interest rate environment. UK debt yields revisit year high after budget UK bond yields once more touched their highest point this year on Friday, as investors continued to digest the implications of the first Labour budget in 14 years. The yield \u2013 effectively the UK government\u2019s borrowing cost \u2013 on the benchmark 10-year bond reached 4.526% in global trading on Friday, matching the level hit on Thursday in the aftermath of Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget statement as investors predicted a slower pace of interest rate cuts from the Bank of England. Since then it has fallen back slightly to 4.456%. Scrutiny of bond market movements has been particularly intense after the budget because of the large borrowing set out by Reeves, alongside major tax increases. However, while there has been a noticeable reaction in the market for UK government bonds, also known as gilts, it has not so far been comparable to the turmoil following the budget of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng in 2022. The below chart shows the UK 10-year gilt yield over the last three months: yields (which move inversely to prices) have risen appreciably, but the post-budget movements have not been dramatic. We will update throughout the day on movements.

            "content": "The day that wokeness died. That has been one of the primary analyses of Donald Trump\u2019s resounding election victory: that it was a resounding rejection of the \u201cwoke\u201d left and the casting off of the shackles of political correctness. According to sections of the media and political establishment, people are tired of being harangued and scolded for not using the right language, annoyed by a constant focus on race and identity, and alarmed by a new orthodoxy of radical politics eager to please individual groups at the expense of common sense. \u201cThe era,\u201d summarised one British journalist, \u201cof Black Lives Matter, Latinx, critical race theory, pronouns and defunding the police is over.\u201d It\u2019s a neat conclusion \u2013 it\u2019s hard not to see this result as a rejection of something. But was that something \u201cwoke\u201d values in particular? As a starting point, it is worth looking at Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign rather than the assumptions about it. In reality, she seemed to avoid any focus on identity and \u201cwokeness\u201d. She didn\u2019t make much of her race, or even her gender, choosing instead to ground her identity in her background as a middle-class person raised in a rental household by a hardworking mother. Her position on race softened from when she was running in 2019: she previously backed \u201csome form\u201d of reparations but did not stake out a position as part of her bid. Trump wanted Harris \u201cto say something to turn off white voters. She was wise not to take the bait,\u201d wrote the author Keith Boykin. She was hardline on immigration, keen to show that she is a gun owner (memorably telling Oprah Winfrey: \u201cIf someone breaks into my house they\u2019re getting shot\u201d). And she was evasive on gender-affirming care for transgender Americans. And so this narrative of succumbing to \u201cBig Woke\u201d, according to the American journalist Jack Mirkinson, \u201cbears virtually no resemblance to the actual campaign we all just suffered through\u201d. Woke talking points were a key part not of Harris\u2019s campaign but of Trump\u2019s \u2013 he said that Harris suddenly \u201cbecame a Black person\u201d to capitalise on her race, and his campaign spent millions on ads about transgender rights. Welcome to the culture war \u2013 where only the right is really fighting, and the other side is helping it out by punching itself in the face. So why are progressives so keen to take on this narrative, one that has even now migrated to the UK, where the US election result is seen as a cautionary tale? One reason is that it offers a simple culprit \u2013 and a mistake easy to avoid next time. It\u2019s far more straightforward to blame an abstract \u201cwokeness\u201d than to reckon with the fact that Harris ran a broadly right-of-centre campaign and still lost. It also conjures up a convenient voter, one who is more offended by language than by the promise of mass deportations. That then makes these voters retrievable rather than subject to big shifts, both of class dealignment and the transformation of parties formerly supported by the working classes into ones that attract higher-income voters. It\u2019s also a big tell. The readiness to repudiate all forms of identity politics and group them under the \u201cbad woke\u201d umbrella is less about policy than about perception \u2013 social justice is seen as somehow tainting the liberal cause because, well, social justice is the stuff of scruffy radical activism, not upper-class power. Some of this is a broader backlash to a near-decade of breakthrough movements such as #MeToo and Black Lives Matter. But it also shows how these never really found a home in the Democratic party in a meaningful way and are seen only as a way to appeal to certain voting blocs. When those voters don\u2019t show up, this is seen as the fault of identity politics itself rather than the fact that it is pursued in ways that are shallow and entirely divorced from voters\u2019 lives. There is an irony to all this. Because central to the lack of appeal of identity politics is its \u201celite capture\u201d by exactly the sort of people who are now distancing themselves from it. Black Lives Matter is a case study. \u201cAllyship\u201d and \u201cdoing the work\u201d, buzzwords of the early 2020s, produced a frankly mortifying era in which white liberal politicians took the knee and this symbolic act took up an unbelievable amount of space in public discourse from sports to the media. \u201cDoing the work\u201d focused on interpersonal dynamics of racism rather than on structural ones. Diversity became about the visibility of people of colour and \u201cfirsts\u201d separate from \u2013 and I apologise for this now fatally unfashionable synopsis \u2013 the broader systemic impact of this on poverty, poor public housing, unequal policing and access to health care. (Not that visibility and institutional reform are necessarily in competition, but only one pays dividends to white people.) Anything more gnarly, and crucially anything that engaged with demands and needs as expressed by Black activists who had been doing their own \u201cwork\u201d for years, was roundly rejected. Discussions on policing became reduced to scoffing at the unrealistic ask of \u201cdefunding the police\u201d rather than what that demand actually entailed, which, as even a cursory glance shows, is not to abolish policing but invest in preventive measures at the community level. Even then, I am not sure that this diluted vision has turned off voters to such an extent that it would drive them into the arms of Trump. But it does act as a reflection of a superficial and flaccid approach that has no edge or universal vision. This is particularly dangerous when there is no vividly defined unified and unifying policy for change, rendering a rightwing version of wokeness sharper and more compelling. In Mistaken Identity: Race and Class in the Age of Trump, the academic Asad Haider identifies the power of this missing universalism, one that is \u201ccreated and recreated in the act of insurgency\u201d against a system in which there are interlocking oppressions but only one common enemy. The power of identity politics doesn\u2019t lie in balkanisation \u2013 in carving up society into special interest groups in conflict with one other \u2013 but in precisely what its contemporary adoption seeks to prevent: the recognition that the common enemy is the way in which society itself is designed. In short, the universal problem facing people of all identities in the US and the UK is hostility to those who lack capital in all it forms. To greater and lesser extents, our economies are based around social mobility rather than the ability to live in dignity without it, while ever-higher barriers to prosperity are erected and our public infrastructure is inadequate at almost every level. All the while, aggressive rightwing culture-war messaging is capitulated to because, to borrow from Yeats, liberals lack \u201call conviction, while the worst/ Are full of passionate intensity\u201d. It\u2019s a useful diversion to pretend, and even believe, that dropping the use of Latinx, ditching pronouns or casting fewer Black people in Jaguar ads is the way forward. Yet these are no more than crises of confidence broadly confined to the same class of people who imagine they are relevant to millions outside it. The far more uncomfortable reality, one that demands we raise our game, is that elites created \u201cwokeness\u201d in their own image and have now created a fictional reality in which this patrician class fought valiantly for it and it failed because it\u2019s clearly just not what the people want. But out in the real world, what the people want was never respected or advocated for with any leadership, consistency and conviction. The fight never started.

            "date": "2024-11-13T15:44:23Z",
            "content": "So here we are, back to the era of waking up to headlines that trigger audible \u201cughs\u201d and a desire to act out being violently sick. On Wednesday morning, this was the news that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy had been appointed by the president-elect, Donald Trump, to run something called the Department of Government Efficiency, a newly created body tasked with cutting back federal bureaucracy and given the larky acronym Doge. (Musk has been a longtime promoter of the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, so there\u2019s a great conflict-of-interest gag straight out the gate.) On X, Musk duly posted an image of himself in gangster pose, with digitally volumised hair alongside the lettering D.O.G.E, the message of which was clear: cutting $2tn from the federal budget, a figure touted by Musk before the election, was going to be not only satisfying, but fun! Quite apart from the fact that Musk may now be nominally in charge of government agencies with oversight of his companies \u2013 the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, has had run-ins with Musk over threats to wildlife near the SpaceX launch pad \u2013 it opens up a future in which the richest man in the world gets his lolz not from incontinent tweeting, but from the side-splitting task of slashing 75% of the federal workforce. This is the figure that Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur who ran against Trump in the 2023 Republican primary, has floated as desirable, along with his recommendation to shutter the Department of Education, the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI. And to be fair, Musk has had recent experience with this kind of efficiency when he fired 6,000 people at Twitter after buying the company in 2022, one of the actions that, by some calculations, wiped 80% from its value. If large numbers of Americans voted for Trump in the electoral equivalent of looting \u2013 roughly: everything\u2019s shit so let\u2019s burn the place down \u2013 they are in with a good chance of seeing that nihilism come home to roost. In his official statement, Trump likened Musk\u2019s new department to the Manhattan Project, the US nuclear programme that produced the world\u2019s first atomic bomb and an analogy that makes no sense beyond the broad outline of blowing-things-up. \u201cDoge will soon begin crowdsourcing examples of government waste, fraud &amp; abuse,\u201d tweeted Ramaswamy, and you can imagine what\u2019s going to follow: the mockery and destruction of any programme not personally interesting to these extremely limited men, and the promotion of programmes that personally favour them. This will be bad for social programmes supporting those on public assistance. It will be bad for the environment. It will almost certainly be bad for the arts. When, in response to Trump\u2019s announcement, Ramaswamy tweeted: \u201cWe will not go gently\u201d, it was in reference, I suspect, to the closing lines of the 1996 action movie Independence Day, rather than to Dylan Thomas. That the Musk/Ramaswamy announcement was the most eye-catching of Trump\u2019s appointments this week points to another issue with his leadership, which is the sheer reaction-fatigue we are likely to experience as we enter this exciting new era. In normal circumstances, the appointment as head of homeland security of Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota informally known as \u201cdog lady\u201d for admitting in her book earlier this year to shooting her own dog, would be dominating headlines. As would the nomination for secretary of defence of \u201cPete Hegseth\u201d, a former infantry captain who served in Afghanistan but is better known as a Fox News host and author of the book The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free. (Hegseth, who looks like a child\u2019s drawing of Mr Incredible, is an enthusiastic defender of US soldiers accused of war crimes and, if confirmed by the Senate, will be in charge of 1.3 million active-duty troops.) But it is Musk, a man with no experience in government, no interest in public service, and an apparent narcissism equal to Trump\u2019s that will surely see the men fall out before long, who grabbed all the headlines. Like Trump, Musk wins by doing things that trigger the endorphin rush of witnessing cruelty to others. And right on cue, there was Liz Truss, euphoric, reposting Trump\u2019s statement about Musk\u2019s appointment with the remark, \u201cwhat is needed in Britain\u201d \u2013 a piece of toadying that won her a repost by Musk. Truly, we live in terrible times. Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist"

            "date": "2024-11-03T06:07:59Z",
            "content": "\u201cI don\u2019t really laugh like that, do I?\u201d \u201cUhhhhh, a little bit.\u201d Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a \u201cjoyful warrior\u201d with a surprise appearance on the TV variety show Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. Dressed identically in a black suit and pearls, the two traded variations on Harris\u2019s first name, saying Americans want to \u201cend the drama-la\u201d in politics \u201cwith a cool new stepmom-ala\u201d. Filmed in New York and celebrating its 50th season, Saturday Night Live has become a favourite venue for politicians to show viewers \u2013 and voters \u2013 they can prick their own pomposity and laugh at themselves. Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have all appeared on past episodes. This week\u2019s \u201ccold open\u201d featured Rudolph as Harris preparing to deliver a speech in Philadelphia and conversing with running mate Tim Walz (Jim Gaffigan), Joe Biden (Dana Carvey) and husband Doug Emhoff (Andy Samberg). Then, left alone with her thoughts, Rudolph said: \u201cGosh, I wish I could talk to someone who\u2019s been in my shoes. You know, a Black south Asian woman running for president, preferably from the Bay Area.\u201d She turned to what appeared to be a vanity mirror to see, sitting opposite, the real Kamala Harris. The studio audience erupted in wild cheers and the two women laughed for half a minute. Harris, hands folded, said: \u201cYou and me both, sister.\u201d Rudolph said: \u201cNice to see you, Kamala.\u201d Harris replied: \u201cIt is nice to see you, Kamala, and I\u2019m just here to remind you: you got this. Because you can do something your opponent cannot do. You can open doors.\u201d This was a reference to Trump reaching towards, and appearing to miss, the door of a garbage truck during a recent stunt. \u201cI see what you did there,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cLike to a garbage truck, right?\u201d The actor then burst into an exaggerated cackle. Harris asked: \u201cI don\u2019t really laugh like that, do I?\u201d This was a near repeat of a line from a 2008 episode when Hillary Clinton, running in the Democratic presidential primary, appeared next to Amy Poehler, who played her with an over-the-top chortle. The real Clinton questioned: \u201cDo I really laugh like that?\u201d Rudolph then reached out, took Harris\u2019s hand and gave her a pep talk. \u201cNow Kamala, take my palm-ala. The American people want to stop the chaos \u2026 \u201d Harris rounded off: \u201cAnd end the drama-la.\u201d Rudolph: \u201cWith a cool new stepmom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las and watch a rom-com-ala.\u201d Harris: \u201cLike Legally Blonde-ala.\u201d Rudolph: \u201cAnd start decorating for Christmas, fa-la-la-la-la. Because what do we always say?\u201d The pair then said in unison: \u201cKeep calmala and carry on-a-la.\u201d Rudolph added: \u201cWe know each other so well we even finish each other\u2019s\u2026\u201d They said together: \u201cBelief in the promise of America.\u201d Rudolph and Harris then stood together. Rudolph said: \u201cI\u2019m going to vote for us.\u201d Harris replied: \u201cGreat. Any chance you are registered in Pennsylvania?\u201d \u2013 referring to a pivotal swing state in Tuesday\u2019s election. Rudolph admitted: \u201cNope, I am not.\u201d Harris mused: \u201cWell, worth a shot.\u201d Together they then delivered the show\u2019s signature line: \u201cAnd live from New York, it\u2019s Saturday night!\u201d Harris was making her first appearance on the show. \u201cIt was fun,\u201d she told reporters on the tarmac before flying to Detroit in the battleground state of Michigan. Saturday\u2019s episode also featured Tim Kaine, a senator for Virginia who was Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 running mate, performing in a skit where a contestant could not recall who Kaine was. The musical guest, Chappell Roan, announced in September that she is voting for Harris. Rudolph\u2019s performance has won critical acclaim, including from Harris herself. \u201cMaya Rudolph \u2013 I mean, she\u2019s so good,\u201d the vice-president said last month on ABC\u2019s The View. \u201cShe had the whole thing, the suit, the jewellery, everything!\u201d Harris follows a long line of politicians seeking to show a lighter side on Saturday Night Live, broadcast on the NBC network. The first sitting president to take part was Republican Gerald Ford, who made his debut a cold open in April 1976. Then-senator Barack Obama appeared alongside Poehler impersonating Clinton in 2007, and Republican Bob Dole was on the show in November 1996 \u2013 just 11 days after losing that year\u2019s election to Bill Clinton. In 2008 Tina Fey gave a memorable impression of vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, joking that \u201cI can see Russia from my house\u201d. Palin herself appeared on the show in the weeks before the election. Trump hosted Saturday Night Live in 2015, drawing protests outside the studio, and poked fun at his tendency to exaggerate and steer clear of policy specifics. He also appeared in 2004."

            "title": "Donald Trump elected US president in stunning political resurrection",
            "date": "2024-11-06T10:43:08Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump has been elected the 47th president of the United States in a stunning political resurrection that sent shockwaves through America and around the world. Trump becomes the first convicted criminal to win the White House. At 78 he is also the oldest person ever elected to the office. The result will sound alarm bells in foreign capitals given Trump\u2019s chaotic leadership style and overtures to authoritarians such as Vladimir Putin of Russia and Kim Jong-un of North Korea. He was branded a threat to democracy and even a fascist by his opponent, Vice-President Kamala Harris, and some of his own former White House officials. Yet the American electorate proved willing to push such concerns aside and hand the nuclear codes to the property developer turned reality TV star for a second time. Trump defeated Harris, a Democrat who had been seeking to make history herself as the first woman, first Black woman and first south Asian American to become president in the US\u2019s 248-year history. As votes were counted overnight, Trump took North Carolina surprisingly early, the first battleground state to be called, and later he won Georgia and Pennsylvania. As early as 1.20am ET, at Trump\u2019s election watch party in Palm Beach, Florida, a prolonged, almighty roar went up when Fox News called Pennsylvania for the Republican nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201d screamed one man. A young man in a black Trump hat shouted: \u201cFuck Joe Biden! Fuck her!\u201d After 2am, Trump emerged to speak, surrounded by his family, close aides and JD Vance, the hard-right Ohio senator he made his vice-presidential pick. \u201cThis is a movement like nobody\u2019s ever seen before,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is I believe the greatest political movement of all time. There\u2019s never been anything like this in this country and now it\u2019s going to reach a new level of importance, because we\u2019re going to help our country heal. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fix our borders. We\u2019re going to fix everything about our country \u2026 I will not rest until we have delivered the strong, safe and prosperous America that our children deserve, this will truly be the golden age of America.\u201d By 5.37am ET the Associated Press called Wisconsin for Trump, with the state\u2019s 10 electoral college votes tipping Trump\u2019s total to 277 \u2013 well past the 270 votes needed to win the presidency. In Congress, Republicans also recaptured the US Senate, but control of the House of Representatives remained unclear on Wednesday morning, with many of the most competitive races still uncalled. Harris, 60, made reproductive rights and personal freedoms a rallying cry and backed a national law codifying access to safe abortion. Her loss represents a devastating, anxiety-inducing blow to supporters reminiscent of Hillary Clinton\u2019s crushing defeat in 2016. She was expected to speak later on Wednesday. But for Trump, the unlikeliest of comebacks is now complete. Many analysts assumed that his defeat by Joe Biden in 2020 spelled the end of his political career, especially when an angry mob of his supporters \u2013 fuelled by his lie that the election was stolen \u2013 stormed the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, resulting in his second impeachment. But while Trump\u2019s grip on the Republican party was briefly shaken, it held firm. The thrice-married New Yorker, found liable for sexual abuse, remained an unlikely hero of evangelical Christians and the white working class, and polling suggested that he gained small but significant traction among African American and Latino voters. Four criminal cases \u2013 including a conviction on 34 felony counts over concealing hush-money payments to the adult film performer Stormy Daniels \u2013 would have been devastating to any other politician but only appeared to strengthen Trump\u2019s standing with his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d (Maga) base. Spewing insults, Trump swatted challengers aside to claim the Republican presidential nomination for a third consecutive time. Just before the party convention in July he survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, an escape that many allies took as a sign from God (another would-be assassin was caught at one of Trump\u2019s Florida golf courses in September). Meanwhile, after a disastrous debate performance, Joe Biden stepped aside as the presumptive Democratic nominee in July and anointed Harris his successor. Her \u201cpolitics of joy\u201d gave Democrats a jolt of energy and appeared to change the trajectory of a race that had been slipping away. The contest unfolded over little more than 100 days, the shortest in modern memory, against a backdrop of hurricanes at home and wars overseas. Trump received a major assist from the world\u2019s richest man, the tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who gave away millions of dollars to voters in swing states who signed a petition tied to his political action committee. The race looked extraordinarily close until the end. However, Trump\u2019s significant victory suggests that his pitch \u2013 often crude and rambling, mendacious and racist \u2013 still resonated among voters disillusioned with the political establishment. It was also a repudiation of Biden\u2019s legislatively productive presidency and his dire warnings of the danger that Trump poses to US institutions and global security. The election result threatens convulsions and mass protests across the country. Trump ran on a now familiar campaign theme of nativist populism that promised the biggest ever deportation of undocumented people, whom he branded as \u201canimals\u201d with \u201cbad genes\u201d who were \u201cpoisoning the blood of the country\u201d. He complained that the US was \u201clike a garbage can\u201d for the rest of the world. The former president also cast his criminal indictments as a political attack, vowing \u201cretribution\u201d against perceived enemies and embracing increasingly dystopian rhetoric. He made ominous comments threatening to deploy the military domestically against \u201cenemies from within\u201d and promised to pardon supporters imprisoned for the January 6 insurrection. Trump will be the first president to serve non-consecutive terms since Grover Cleveland, who was in office from 1885 to 1889 and from 1893 to 1897. As vice-president, Harris will preside over a joint session of Congress in January to certify the results of the election. She will be succeeded as vice-president by Vance, the 40-year-old senator who, unlike the former vice-president Mike Pence, has refused to acknowledge that Trump lost four years ago.

            "title": "US politics live: Women\u2019s marches hit the streets in support of Harris as both candidates target east coast \u2013 as it happened",
            "date": "2024-11-03T00:43:16Z",
            "content": "Thanks for joining us today. This has been Cecilia Nowell reporting on the latest US elections headlines this Saturday. Here\u2019s a summary of the day: In a startling reversal, a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll shows Kamala Harris ahead of Donald Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters as the presidential race comes down to its final days. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr \u2013 who was recently reported to be up for a role in US health and food safety in Trump\u2019s administration \u2013 said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water if Trump wins the election. Harris and Trump criss-crossed the country today, as both candidates tried to drum up support in the final weekend ahead of the presidential election. Both candidates began the day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, before Harris departed for Atlanta and then Charlotte, North Carolina. Trump also traveled to North Carolina, before heading to a rally in Virginia. Both candidates\u2019 running mates appeared at events in Nevada and Arizona. Tim Walz knocked on doors in Henderson, Nevada, before speaking alongside Indigenous leaders in Flagstaff and then courting Latino voters in Tucson. Meanwhile, JD Vance spoke in Las Vegas before heading to a gun store in Scottsdale. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women\u2019s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Donald Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Joe Biden spoke at a carpenters\u2019 union in his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he was joined by his granddaughter, a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania. The national guard is on standby in at least three states \u2013 Washington, Oregon and Nevada \u2013 and Washington DC as the election approaches, as fears of civil unrest grow. A record number of wealthy Americans are planning to leave the country as election day approaches, NBC News reports, citing fears that the election could spur political and social unrest regardless of its outcome. In Tucson, Arizona, Tim Walz has pulled out his \u201cmind your own damn business\u201d mantra again. \u201cThis guy is not John McCain\u2019s Republican party,\u201d he said, referring to Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cHe means government should have the freedom to be in your exam room, to be in your bedroom, to tell you what books to read and make those decisions. If they just mind their own damn business, we\u2019ll mind our own damn business and we\u2019ll all be better.\u201d The latest Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll shows Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump, a startling reversal for political analysts who had all but written off the state as a win for Republicans. The poll shows Harris ahead of Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters as the presidential race comes down to its final days. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for anybody to say they saw this coming,\u201d pollster J Ann Selzer, president of Selzer &amp; Co, said to the Des Moines Register. \u201cShe has clearly leaped into a leading position.\u201d The poll of 808 likely Iowa voters, which include those who have already voted as well as those who say they definitely plan to vote, was conducted by Selzer &amp; Co from 28-31 October. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Michelle Obama has taken the stage at a rally in Montgomery county in Pennsylvania. She was preceded by musician Alicia Keys, who encouraged the crowd to keep fighting for feminist causes. \u201cThis is not some dystopian Netflix show I\u2019m talking about. This is the platform the other side is running on. They want to turn back the clock,\u201d Keys said, hinting at the points in Project 2025. Michelle Obama is campaigning again for Kamala Harris this afternoon alongside singer Alicia Keys at an event in Norristown, Pennsylvania. Earlier today, supporters were gathered outside the local high school where Obama will appear. Trump has wrapped up his speech in Salem, Virginia, in his usual manner, reciting his Maga chants that have come to mark the ends of his rallies: \u201cWe will make America great again \u2026 we will make America strong again!\u201d This time, he has pointedly added a new chant before leaving the stage: \u201cWe will make America healthy again!\u201d, perhaps in reference to recent reports that Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration. According to the Washington Post, Kennedy has met with Trump transition officials to help draw up an agenda for a new administration and could take a broad \u201chealth tsar\u201d position that would not require confirmation by the Senate. Tim Walz has made his fifth visit to Arizona for a final campaign pitch for Kamala Harris as the US 2024 presidential race enters its final days. Harris and Trump are locked in a fierce battle for the swing state and have made several trips to court voters. According to the website FiveThirtyEight, Trump leads Harris by 2.2 points in the state. More than 1.2 million Arizonans have already cast their ballots in this election. As the candidates continue a busy day of events, Donald Trump and Tim Walz are still expected to make at least one more appearance each this evening. Trump is returning to North Carolina, where he\u2019ll speak at a rally in Greensboro at 7.30pm ET while Walz heads to Tucson, Arizona. In a post on X, Robert F Kennedy Jr has said that he would remove fluoride from all public water if Donald Trump is elected and gives him responsibility over the nation\u2019s health agencies. \u201cFluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease,\u201d Kennedy wrote. Although fluoride is associated with some health issues, dentists strongly recommend adding it to public water to prevent tooth decay. Fluoride is naturally occurring in drinking water at varying levels. US district judge Edward Chen ruled on 24 September that the Environmental Protection Agency must take action regarding fluoride in drinking water, claiming his finding does not \u201cconclude with certainty\u201d any harmful effects but that there is evidence of the risk of cognitive decline. The ruling stems from an August report from the Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s National Toxicology Program, which found that drinking water that contained more than twice the recommended limit of fluoride was \u201cconsistently associated\u201d with lower IQ in children. Despite this ruling, the American Dental Association said in a statement in September that it remains \u201cstaunchly in support\u201d of adding fluoride to community drinking water to help prevent tooth decay. Speaking to the crowd in Virginia, Trump is once again fixated on his hair. \u201cI\u2019m having a bad hair day! I have to have a bad hair day in front of Virginia? That\u2019s not good,\u201d Trump said, turning around presumably to look into a monitor that shows the back of his head. Trump\u2019s hair \u2013 and his appearance, in general \u2013 has lately become a standard talking point during his long and rambling campaign speeches \u2013 although he insists he does not ramble but employs a style of speech he calls \u201cthe weave\u201d. Donald Trump has implied that elections are rigged in blue states such as California and New York, falsely claiming that election officials will be executed if they ask to see voter ID. \u201cIf we had an honest election in California, we would win California,\u201d he said. Speaking at his rally in Salem, Virginia, Donald Trump has denounced a trans woman who was allowed to join Roanoke College\u2019s women\u2019s swim team last year. He said that seven members of the college\u2019s swim team had joined him backstage, before welcoming the teammates to the stage. \u201cJoe Biden and Kamala Harris have advocated for and pushed for this anti-woman sex-based discrimination to continue all over this country,\u201d swimmer Lily Mullens said. \u201cWe are so lucky to have a leader like Donald Trump with common sense,\u201d she said, thanking the ex-president for \u201cstanding with women\u201d. Donald Trump has taken the stage at his second rally of the day, this time in Salem, Virginia \u2013 a state that his rival Kamala Harris is leading by a wide margin. \u201cWe win Virginia, we win the whole thing without question,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible that without winning Virginia we\u2019re going to win the whole thing too.\u201d Trump was introduced by Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin, who led attendees in a prayer before the ex-president began speaking. Campaigning in Scottsdale, Arizona, JD Vance has called on voters to \u201cmake this thing too big to rig\u201d. He focused much of his remarks on immigration, an issue that is central to many Arizona voters. In a new video, actor Harrison Ford has endorsed Kamala Harris. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve been voting for 64 years. Never wanted to talk about it very much,\u201d Ford said, before referencing the former Trump administration officials who\u2019ve denounced the ex-president. \u201cI\u2019ve got one vote \u2013 same as anyone else \u2013 and I\u2019m going to use it to move forward. I\u2019m going to vote for Kamala Harris.\u201d Donald Trump Jr has concluded speaking ahead of JD Vance in Scottsdale, Arizona. In his remarks, the ex-president\u2019s son echoed misinformation his father has spread regarding Fema relief efforts following hurricanes Helene and Milton, Haitian immigrants, Hunter Biden and the media. He also implied that Democrats had tried to assassinate his father in July, and encouraged attendees to make sure their friends voted Republican down-ballot. Kamala Harris\u2019 rally in Charlotte, North Carolina has otherwise proceeded much like her other campaign events, with the vice-president delivering a familiar version of her stump speech. She\u2019s encouraged attendees to make a plan for voting if they haven\u2019t done so already. \u201cWe need everyone to vote, North Carolina. You all will make the difference in this election.\u201d JD Vance is currently campaigning at a gun store in Scottsdale, Arizona alongside Donald Trump Jr. \u201cWe have the opportunity to put not just my father in the White House, but have you seen the team around him,\u201d Trump said from the stage at Dillon Precision, touting roles his father has promised Robert F Kennedy Jr, Tulsi Gabbard and Elon Musk. Kamala Harris\u2019s rally in Charlotte was briefly interrupted by pro-Palestine protestors. \u201cOne of the reasons we are here is because we are fighting for a democracy, and the right of people to speak their mind, but right now I am speaking,\u201d Harris said. \u201cDemocracy can be complicated, it\u2019s all right. This is what democracy looks like.\u201d Kamala Harris is speaking at her second rally of the day, this time in Charlotte, North Carolina. Ahead of her appearance, Roy Cooper, the state\u2019s governor, urged Republicans and independents to vote for the vice-president. \u201cListen to the ultraconservative, well-respected leaders who worked with Donald Trump,\u201d Cooper said, referencing longtime Republicans like Liz Cheney who\u2019ve endorsed Harris. \u201cHe is a danger to our country, and he should never be president again.\u201d Preparing for potential social unrest ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election, the national guard is on standby in at least three states and Washington DC, CNN reports. In Washington, governor Jay Inslee has announced that the national guard is on standby following recent ballot box fires there. Meanwhile, in neighboring Oregon, governor Tina Kotek says the national guard is prepared to respond to potential uncertainty, following another ballot box fire in Portland. And in Nevada, governor Joe Lombardo says 60 troops are prepared to oversee a \u201csafe and smooth election day\u201d. Meanwhile, law enforcement is preparing for election day in Washington DC, where more than 3,000 police officers will work in 12-hour shifts. Tim Walz is campaigning this afternoon in Flagstaff, Arizona, alongside interior secretary Deb Haaland. The city, which is located just outside the borders of the Navajo Nation, is also home to Northern Arizona University. Walz, whose lieutenant governor, Peggy Flanagan, will become the first female Indigenous governor in the United States if he and Harris are elected Tuesday, has focused many of his campaign stops on Native voters in Arizona, including by visiting the capital of the Navajo Nation last week. Speaking ahead of Walz, Haaland evoked her childhood growing up in a pueblo household and encouraged attendees to \u201cas Coach would say, leave it all on the field\u201d. Navajo Nation president Jonathan Nez was also in attendance. \u201cThe sovereignty of our Indigenous tribes is paramount,\u201d Walz said, noting his recent visit to Window Rock, Arizona, before encouraging voters to get to the polls. \u201cWe get to shape not just the next four years, but generations to come.\u201d As the Women\u2019s March in Washington DC kicks off, women and supporters are gathering across the country in the 8th annual march since the 21 January 2017 march spurred by Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration and the Access Hollywood tapes. Here\u2019s the latest from around the country: After starting the morning side by side on the tarmac in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Kamala Harris\u2019s and Donald Trump\u2019s planes are now lined up once again in Charlotte, North Carolina. Both candidates are criss-crossing the country in a final blitz of campaign stops before Tuesday\u2019s election. Visiting the carpenter\u2019s union in Scranton this afternoon, Joe Biden used some of the unvarnished language that has come to endear him to many Americans (and gotten him in some hot water lately). Speaking about Republicans who want to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the Chips Act, as well as cut social security, Biden said: \u201cThese are the kinds of guys you like to smack in the ass,\u201d according to a White House pool report. This week, Florida will be one of 10 states where voters will weigh in on measures to expand abortion rights. The debate in Florida \u2013 which has turned from purple to red in recent years \u2013 has been particularly intense as Republican party leadership campaigns against Amendment 4. Here\u2019s Carter Sherman with more: As she stood in the parking lot of an auto supply store on Friday evening, Brittany Robinson was practically vibrating. With just a few days left before the 2024 presidential election, the 32-year-old Floridian needed an outlet for her anxiety. So Robinson decided to go knock on strangers\u2019 doors in support of Amendment 4, a ballot measure that, if passed, would enshrine abortion rights into Florida\u2019s constitution and overturn the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban. \u201cI wish I started earlier,\u201d said Robinson, a native of the Tampa Bay area who had never before canvassed for a political campaign. Living under Florida\u2019s ban, she said, is \u201cterrifying\u201d. When she was a freshman in college 13 years ago, Robinson discovered she was seven weeks pregnant and had an abortion a week later. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that now,\u201d Robinson said. As Kamala Harris and Donald Trump make their closing arguments ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election, Americans are preparing to take to the streets in cities across the country for a day of Women\u2019s marches. Marches are planned in all 50 states. \u201cNo matter where you\u2019re voting, we are in a choice between freedom and fascism,\u201d Rachel O\u2019Leary Carmona, executive director of Women\u2019s March, told ABC News Live today. Harris and Trump have taken different approaches to earning female voters\u2019 support, with Harris campaigning largely on issues of reproductive freedom and abortion access, while Trump says he will be a \u201cprotector\u201d of women. Here are some photos from marches across the country \u2013 we\u2019ll keep you updated on any developments as the largest march in Washington DC kicks off: In the final days of the election, Taylor Swift\u2019s fans are trying to get out the vote among \u201clow propensity Swiftie voters across Pennsylvania\u201d. The pop star endorsed Kamala Harris shortly after the September presidential debate. \u201cSwifties for Kamala (S4K) sent over 250,000 mail pieces encouraging Pennsylvania voters to vote for Kamala Harris for President and take a pledge to vote. Included in 50,000 of the mailers was an exclusive \u2018Voting Era\u2019 friendship bracelet,\u201d the press release reads. \u201cAs of this release, over 4,600 pledges to vote have been submitted because of the mailer.\u201d The FBI is working to dispel misinformation about the election, saying today that two videos circulating on social media are false. One claims that the bureau had \u201capprehended three linked groups committing ballot fraud\u201d and another concerns second gentleman Doug Emhoff. \u201cThese videos are not authentic, are not from the FBI, and the content they depict is false,\u201d the FBI said in a statement. While Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaign on the east coast today, their running mates are hosting events out west. JD Vance spoke at a rally in Las Vegas this morning while Tim Walz campaigned in Henderson, Nevada. This afternoon, both candidates will travel to Arizona, where Vance will speak in Scottsdale and Walz will attend events in Flagstaff and Tucson. Speaking in Atlanta this afternoon, Kamala Harris delivered a familiar version of her stump speech, addressing the future of the Affordable Care Act, Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs, abortion and contraception, Project 2025 and bipartisanship. \u201cI pledge to you to listen to experts and to listen to people who disagree with me, because unlike Donald Trump I don\u2019t believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe wants to put them in jail, I will give them a seat at the table. That\u2019s what real leaders do. That\u2019s what strong leaders do. \u201cI pledge to you to always put country above party and self and I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans.\u201d Harris will speak again in North Carolina later this afternoon \u2013 where Trump is currently holding a rally. Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, chair of the Harris-Walz campaign, said the team was \u201cfeeling very good about where we are right now\u201d. She pointed to the release of a new ad that draws from Harris\u2019s interactions with voters she met on the trail during her 100-day campaign, as an opportunity to create a \u201chigh impact moment\u201d in the final days of the election. \u201cWe are continuing to operate on this very broad map of the battleground states, where all seven of our battleground states are within the margin of error, completely in play,\u201d she told reporters on Saturday. O\u2019Malley Dillon repeated what the campaign has been saying for days, that late-deciding voters have been \u201cbreaking\u201d decisively in Harris\u2019s favor. Her campaign has pointed to Trump\u2019s vitriol-filled Madison Square Garden rally as a key factor. \u201cThese undecided voters, we believe, over the course of the last week, have been breaking in our direction,\u201d she said. The campaign also said that Harris was planning to vote by mail but were not sure if she had submitted her ballot yet. Kamala Harris has been introduced by Justin Martinez Posadas, a first-time voter and high school senior, at her Atlanta rally. \u201cI\u2019m the son of a factory worker and the child of immigrants. Vice-President Harris is the daughter of a single mother from a middle-class family,\u201d Martinez Posadas said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was honored to cast my first ever ballot for Vice-President Kamala Harris.\u201d He added that his grandparents, who recently became US citizens, also cast their first ballots for Harris. Joe Biden is speaking in his home town of Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he has been joined by his granddaughter Natalie, who is a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania and the daughter of his deceased son, Beau. Addressing members of the carpenters union, Biden said: \u201cA lot of politicians have trouble saying the word union, but I\u2019m not one of them.\u201d Following a chorus of cheers, the president added: \u201cBy the way, neither does Kamala.\u201d Director Spike Lee and Georgia senator Jon Ossoff have begun speaking at Kamala Harris\u2019s rally in Atlanta, as Donald Trump addresses supporters at a rally in Gastonia, North Carolina. Tapping into current fears that there will be voter suppression in this election, Ossoff told attendees in Atlanta: \u201c[Trump] tried to throw out your votes. You all remember the phone call.\u201d \u201cYou know what has been given for the struggle for voting rights in the state of Georgia, and across the American south,\u201d Ossoff added. Meanwhile, Trump is speaking about the support he\u2019s received from customs and border patrol agents (saying agents have told him \u201che\u2019s the greatest president in the history of our country\u201d), the economy and the election (\u201cwe\u2019re just three days away from the greatest political victory in world history\u201d). JD Vance is expected to begin speaking soon in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Joe Biden will be addressing a carpenters union in his home town of Scranton, Pennsylvania. The Harris campaign has released a new closing ad titled \u201cBrighter Future\u201d that will air tomorrow afternoon during NFL games on CBS and Fox. In the two-minute ad, Harris pledges to be \u201ca president for all Americans\u201d and promises to \u201cbuild a brighter future for our nation\u201d as her campaign seeks to draw out the differences between the vice-president and her opponent in the final days of the election cycle. Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib declined to endorse Kamala Harris at a United Auto Workers union rally yesterday. The only Palestinian American in Congress, Tlaib has criticized the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s handling of the war in Gaza. Her non-endorsement comes as a voter survey published on Friday suggested that 43% of Muslim American voters support the Green party candidate, Jill Stein. Here\u2019s Edward Helmore with more on Tlaib: And here\u2019s Erum Salam with more on the Arab and Muslim Americans campaigning for Harris despite the Biden administration\u2019s support for Israel: As election day approaches, state and federal officials are preparing for social unrest and political upheaval that could suppress votes. Yesterday, the justice department announced it will send election monitors to 86 jurisdictions, the most in two decades. Meanwhile, Washington state governor Jay Inslee announced that the state will put national guard members on standby this week to support law enforcement and protect key infrastructure in the event of social unrest. The Washington state announcement comes just days after someone set fire to a ballot drop box there and in neighboring Portland, Oregon, damaging hundreds of ballots. A deep dive inside Donald Trump\u2019s campaign published today in the Atlantic shows how the ex-president has struggled to balance his chaotic tendencies with running a disciplined campaign. The report notes that after Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket, Trump\u2019s advisers encouraged him to stick to planned criticism of the Biden-Harris administration while the ex-president instead longed to attack Harris personally. As a result, Trump began communicating with two of his 2016 campaign managers, Kellyanne Conway and Corey Lewandowski, citing fears that he was being overly \u201cmanaged\u201d by his current advisors. The report includes two other notable asides: Trump wanted to start calling the current president \u201cRetarded Joe Biden\u201d but was dissuaded by current aides, and broke ties with far-right activist Laura Loomer when he learned she\u2019d had significant plastic surgery. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has filed a complaint against the Washington Post with the Federal Election Commission, alleging that the paper made illegal in-kind contributions to the Harris-Walz campaign through its advertising, the Post reports. A copy of the complaint released by the Trump campaign cites a Semafor article that suggests the Post purchased ads to increase readership of articles it had published that were critical of the ex-president \u2013 after the newspaper\u2019s announcement that it would not endorse a candidate sparked backlash and a wave of unsubscriptions. In the complaint, the Trump campaign calls the advertising a \u201cdark money corporate campaign in opposition to President Donald Trump\u201d. In response, a Washington Post spokesperson said the allegations were \u201cwithout merit\u201d and that \u201cpromoted posts across social media platforms reflect high-performing content across all verticals and subjects\u201d. A rally for Kamala Harris is filling Atlanta Civic Center on Saturday, \u201cthree days before we remind the world that the south has something to say\u201d, said US representative Nikema Williams, quoting the iconic Atlanta hip-hop group OutKast. \u201cThis election is too important to sit out,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is battleground Georgia.\u201d Just over 4 million Georgia voters have already cast a ballot, about 80% of the 2020 figure and 55.3% of registered voters in the state, according to the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office. Fulton and DeKalb counties, the two counties with the largest number of Democratic voters in Georgia, are slightly ahead of state averages for early turnout, but the election remains too close to call judging by early voting turnout. Errors in polling models are likely to be larger than the ultimate margin. Harris is expected to appear at 1pm. Donald Trump today announced a rally in Macon for Sunday. Morehouse College graduate Spike Lee and recording artist Pastor Troy opened the rally, with Troy performing Vice Versa. A record number of wealthy Americans are planning to leave the country as election day approaches, NBC News reports, citing fears that the election could spur political and social unrest regardless of its outcome. Immigration attorneys at high-powered firms such as Lesperance and Associates and Henley &amp; Partners told NBC that they\u2019re seeing greater demand for services regarding possible moves overseas than ever before. \u201cA survey by Arton Capital, which advises the wealthy on immigration programs, found that 53% of American millionaires say they\u2019re more likely to leave the US after the election, no matter who wins,\u201d the outlet added. President Biden is set to land in Scranton, the city where he was born, for a visit shortly and I spotted this truck parked on Biden street downtown. Scranton is a key piece in Democratic hopes to win Pennsylvania, a key battleground state this election. Hillary Clinton lost tremendous ground here in 2016 when she lost the state, but Joe Biden improved on that in 2020. Democrats are hoping to build even further on those gains this year, or at least not lose ground. In the final days before the 2024 election, Donald Trump is growing increasingly anxious, Axios reports. Although the former president\u2019s campaign is projecting confidence, a campaign official close to Trump tells Axios that the ex-president is asking more questions about polling and demanding more work from his aides in late-night and early morning calls. Before heading to North Carolina today, Kamala Harris will rally voters in Atlanta alongside director Spike Lee, rapper Monica and singer Victoria Mon\u00e9t. The vice-president will also be joined by senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, and will be introduced by a first-time voter, according to the campaign. Then Harris will head to Charlotte, North Carolina \u2013 a state that both she and Donald Trump are visiting today. It\u2019s the fourth day in a row that both candidates will appear in the same state on the same day, as they attempt to swing through the most important battleground states one last time before Tuesday. At Harris\u2019s rally in Charlotte, her campaign says, Harris will be joined by actor Kerry Washington and again introduced by a first-time voter. The event will also feature performances by Brittney Spencer, Jon Bon Jovi, Khalid and the War and Treaty. Good morning, Cecilia Nowell here taking over from my colleague Tom Ambrose. As the final weekend before election day gets under way, Donald Trump called into Fox &amp; Friends Weekend to comment on the state of the race \u2013 and criticize a recent Harris campaign ad telling women they don\u2019t have to tell their husbands whom they vote for. \u201cCan you imagine a wife not telling a husband who she\u2019s voting for? Did you ever hear anything like that? Even if you have a \u2026 bad relationship, you\u2019re going to tell your husband. That\u2019s a ridiculous ad. So stupid,\u201d Trump said. During the call, Trump also critiqued Mark Cuban\u2019s recent comments that the ex-president avoids \u201cstrong, intelligent women\u201d, said he didn\u2019t know the comedian who made an offensive joke about Puerto Rico at the Madison Square Garden rally last week and responded to concerns regarding his comments about shooting former congresswoman Liz Cheney. He also shared that he has sued CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and thought the outlet should lose its broadcasting license. Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump head to North Carolina on Saturday to try to clinch support in the south-eastern battleground state just three days before Tuesday\u2019s US presidential election. It will be the fourth day in a row that vice-president Harris and former president Trump visit the same state on the same day, underlining the critical importance of the seven states likely to decide the race, which opinion polls show to be on a knife\u2019s edge, Reuters reported. Trump and Harris battled to woo voters in the key swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin on Friday, as the presidential campaign enters its final stretch. Harris made several appearances in Wisconsin on Friday, including one that featured the musician Cardi B, while Trump visited both Michigan and Wisconsin. At his rally in Warren, Michigan, on Friday afternoon, Trump tried to energize his voters, delivering an address replete with his characteristic fear-mongering about immigrants and tangents including musings about his hair. At a Wisconsin rally on Friday, Donald Trump called Kamala Harris a \u201clow-IQ person\u201d and vowed to save the economy \u201cfrom total obliteration\u201d in a 1.5 hour-long meandering speech that touched on top campaign issues including the economy and foreign policy \u2013 but also featured threats to curb press freedoms and a lengthy discussion of his own rhetorical style. \u201cI will stop the criminal invasion of this country,\u201d said Trump during his opening remarks, promising to usher in a new \u201cgolden age\u201d. \u201cCan you imagine if Kamala won? You would go down to a 1929 style depression,\u201d said Trump. Top Republicans have called on the White House to produce all documents and internal communications regarding president Joe Biden\u2019s statement earlier this week in which he appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump. White House press officials altered the official transcript of Biden\u2019s statement, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity, according to two US government officials and an internal email obtained on Thursday by the Associated Press. The office of Arizona Democratic attorney general Kris Mayes is \u201clooking into\u201d whether Donald Trump broke state law when he said on Thursday that Liz Cheney should face rifles \u201cshooting at her\u201d to see how she feels about sending troops to fight. \u201cThe Arizona attorney general\u2019s office is looking into whether Donald Trump\u2019s comments about Liz Cheney violated Arizona law,\u201d Richie Taylor, communications director for the AG\u2019s office, said in a statement on Friday. \u201cThe office has no additional comments to make at this time.\u201d Officials in the US battleground state of Michigan said they worry that the Democratic-leaning city of Warren could lag behind the rest of the state in reporting the results of Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, raising early doubts about the state\u2019s vote count. Warren, unlike Detroit and most other cities in Michigan, opted not to take advantage of changes enacted in a 2022 state law allowing for up to eight days of pre-processing of absentee ballots, Reuters reported. Instead, the city of 135,000 people will wait until election day to verify and tabulate more than 20,000 mail-in ballots. Elon Musk\u2019s troubled canvassing operation on behalf of Donald Trump and the Republican party is now facing a lawsuit in southern California filed by two women who say they were cheated out of wages and expenses as they knocked on doors for an embattled Republican congresswoman. The suit accuses Musk\u2019s America PAC, which has poured more than $100m into this year\u2019s election campaign, of \u201cwillful violations of the California labor code\u201d by paying the plaintiffs less than it promised and refusing to make up the difference. The US presidential election campaign enters its final weekend with polls showing Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in seemingly permanent deadlock and few clues as to which of them will prevail on Tuesday. At the end of another unruly week that began with Trump\u2019s racially charged rally in New York\u2019s Madison Square Guardian and was punctuated by celebrity endorsements, misogynistic comments and insults about \u201cgarbage\u201d being levelled left and right, the Guardian\u2019s 10-day polling average tracker showed little change from seven days earlier, with voter loyalty to their chosen candidate appearing relatively impervious to campaign events, however seismic. That\u2019s all from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Cecilia Nowell will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from the US election. On the second to last Sunday in July, Kamala Harris had just finished making pancakes and bacon for her grandnieces at the vice-president\u2019s residence in Washington, and was sitting down with them to work on a jigsaw puzzle when Joe Biden called. \u201cI got up to take the call, and then life changed,\u201d Harris recounted later. Biden, isolating with Covid at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, and facing calls from all corners of his party to step aside, had reached the history-altering decision to end his bid for re-election. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Harris said she asked the US president. \u201cBecause what a big decision.\u201d With Biden\u2019s endorsement, Harris, still wearing her workout clothes and hooded sweatshirt from her alma mater, Howard University, leapt into action. Time was of the essence. Over the next 10 hours, with pizza boxes littered around her, she placed 100 calls to Democrats whose support she would need to secure the nomination. A year punctuated by two assassination attempts, high levels of threats and harassment, and a number of troubling, violent incidents in the lead-up to election day will culminate on Tuesday with an election deemed existential by all sides. It\u2019s the first presidential election since the January 6 insurrection, a reminder of the ways political violence can manifest that leaves Americans with a fear that such an attack could happen again. Those who study the attack and its participants say they aren\u2019t convinced criminal convictions against them will fully deter those involved on January 6 from future political violence, but that the biggest threat is a lone actor, not a large, coordinated event. In the last few weeks, a man in Arizona was allegedly stockpiling weapons and plotting a \u201cmass casualty\u201d event, according to police who arrested him for shooting at Democratic party offices. The person behind explosive devices that burned hundreds of ballots in two drop boxes in Oregon and Washington is suspected to be a metalworker who could be planning more attacks. Arguments at polling places over political paraphernalia, banned at the polls in some places, have become physical. A young man waved a machete at a polling place in Florida. The risk of political violence only increases after election day, experts say, once races are called. Certain places could become targets of people or groups upset about results or who claim fraud. In the last week, the US saw numerous attacks on the voting process and threats of violence, and extremism experts are bracing for what comes after voting has ended. The goal of people committing these acts is often to create fear and distrust around voting or to sabotage the functioning of democracy. Still, election officials stress that voting is safe, and voters should not be deterred from voting because of any threats to the process, which are rare. Here is a timeline of the political violence seen so far during the voting period in the US. Elon Musk\u2019s troubled canvassing operation on behalf of Donald Trump and the Republican party is now facing a lawsuit in southern California filed by two women who say they were cheated out of wages and expenses as they knocked on doors for an embattled Republican congresswoman. The suit accuses Musk\u2019s America PAC, which has poured more than $100m into this year\u2019s election campaign, of \u201cwillful violations of the California labor code\u201d by paying the plaintiffs less than it promised and refusing to make up the difference. The women, Tamiko Anderson and Patricia Kelly, say they were hired last month and promised an hourly wage \u2013 about $25, according to their lead lawyer \u2013 to help turn out votes for Michelle Steel, who represents a closely contested swing district in Orange county, south of Los Angeles. It was only once the women started working, the suit alleges, that they found out they were being paid instead by the number of houses they visited. The suit further alleges that they were not reimbursed for work-related expenses, including the use of personal cellphones to track their movements along their designated routes. Musk\u2019s ground-game operation has come under repeated scrutiny in recent days following a report in the Guardian that canvassers may have skipped as many as a quarter of the houses they claimed to have visited in Arizona and Nevada, and a second report in Wired that revealed hired canvassers in Michigan were not told which campaign they were working for until they had already signed on. If Donald Trump re-enters the White House on 20 January he will do so emboldened by a power that no previous incoming president has ever enjoyed: immunity from criminal prosecution for any act carried out in his official capacity. The protection, awarded in a July ruling from the far-right supermajority of the US supreme court, changes fundamentally the dynamics of the Oval Office. \u201cThe justices wrote a how-to guide for a president who wants to break the law,\u201d said Michael Waldman, president of the non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cIn practical terms, if you are a president who wants to break the law, make sure your co-conspirators are also government employees \u2013 then you\u2019re off the hook.\u201d The immunity ruling, in Trump v United States, is the clearest example yet of the judicial feedback loop that the former president established during his 2017 to 2021 presidency. With the active support of Republicans in the US Senate, then President Trump appointed three new hard-right justices to the country\u2019s top court, creating a 6-3 conservative-to-liberal supermajority. Is it any surprise that \u201cphoto op\u201d is a phrase imported into British English from the United States? Of course it came from there, the land where the visual image sits right at the centre of the culture, with politics no exception. It was the Nixon White House that came up with it, specifically a press aide by the name of Bruce Whelihan. According to Washington legend, whenever the president was meeting a visiting dignitary, Richard Nixon\u2019s hardball press secretary, Ron Ziegler, would turn to his underling with an order to summon the snappers. \u201cGet \u2019em in for a picture,\u201d Ziegler would say. Too polite to put it that way himself, Whelilan would clear his throat and announce to the ladies and gentlemen of the Washington press corps, \u201cThere will be a photo opportunity in the Oval Office.\u201d) The photo op was born. Joe Biden promised a \u201crecovery for everybody\u201d as he prepared to take over an economy ravaged by the pandemic four years ago. Few predicted what would follow. One of two candidates \u2013 Kamala Harris, his vice-president, and Donald Trump, his predecessor \u2013 will succeed Biden in January. As millions prepare to elect the next US president, here is how the world\u2019s largest economy fared under Biden. The shock waves unleashed by Covid-19 were still rippling across the world when Biden took office in January 2021. In the US, and many other economies, they set the stage for an extraordinary rise in inflation. For months, the White House and Federal Reserve insisted the factors driving this surging price growth were \u201ctransitory\u201d. By the time the consumer price index peaked, reaching its highest level in a generation in June 2022, officials had changed their minds. The Fed embarked upon an aggressive campaign to tackle inflation in March 2022. Interest rates \u2013 cut to close to zero at the outset of the pandemic \u2013 were increased at 11 meetings, to a two-decade high. Suddenly the central fear looming over the US economy was not runaway inflation, but the specter of recession. As the Fed scrambled to cool activity in an attempt to tackle prices, warnings of a prolonged downturn cast a shadow. There\u2019s one story of the 2024 presidential contest that says that this election is all about men, and their anger. Men, in this account, have gotten a raw deal: the decline of the industrial economy in the years since the postwar boom means that many of the jobs that gave dignity, structure, and steady paychecks to their fathers are now gone, and some men, especially those without college degrees, have fallen into a cycle of desperation and despair, unable to make the kind of living for which they could respect themselves. This economic argument about men is usually followed by a cultural one: that women aren\u2019t as nice to men as they should be, or maybe not as nice to men as they used to be. On one end of this conversation, there are paeans to male loneliness and discussions of the male suicide rate, quasi-poetic odes to their depths of despair and acute feeling: women just don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to be sad the way that men are sad. On the other end, writers and commentators point to more recent cultural trends that they say have alienated men, making them feel attacked or unnecessary. They point, apparently seriously, to the fact that some young feminists online have used the term \u201ctoxic masculinity,\u201d which they say makes men feel bad, bad enough that their feelings are an emergency for the nation. They point to those t-shirts that were popular in 2017 that said, \u201cThe Future Is Female.\u201d This, too, is reflective of a great social pathology, a sign that we as a nation have failed men and boys. Why, they plead, can\u2019t the future be male? Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump head to North Carolina on Saturday to try to clinch support in the south-eastern battleground state just three days before Tuesday\u2019s US presidential election. It will be the fourth day in a row that vice-president Harris and former president Trump visit the same state on the same day, underlining the critical importance of the seven states likely to decide the race, which opinion polls show to be on a knife\u2019s edge, Reuters reported. More than 70 million Americans have already cast ballots, according to the Election Lab at the University of Florida, below the record early-voting pace in 2020 during Covid-19, but still indicating a high level of voter enthusiasm. Saturday also marks the last day of early voting in North Carolina, where over 3.8m votes have been cast, while the state\u2019s western reaches are still recovering from Hurricane Helene\u2019s deadly flooding. Harris plans appearances with rock star Jon Bon Jovi in Charlotte, the biggest city in North Carolina, which is tied with Georgia for the second-biggest prize of the swing states. Each has 16 votes in the Electoral College, where 270 are needed to secure the presidency. North Carolina backed Trump in 2020 but elected a Democratic governor on the same day, giving hope to both parties. Losing an election for the highest office is a crushing blow that no candidate forgets. But when the American electorate delivers its verdict next week, the personal stakes for Donald Trump will be uniquely high. His fate will hover between the presidency and the threat of prison. If he claims victory, Trump will be the first convicted criminal to win the White House and gain access to the nuclear codes. If he falls short, the 78-year-old faces more humiliating courtroom trials and potentially even time behind bars. It would be the end of a charmed life in which he has somehow always managed to outrun the law and duck accountability. For Trump, Tuesday is judgment day. \u201cHe branded himself as the guy who gets away with it,\u201d said Gwenda Blair, a Trump biographer, adding that, should he lose, \u201che is facing a lot of moments of reckoning. He could go to jail. He could end up considerably less wealthy than he is. No matter what happens, and no matter whether he wins or loses, there will be a reckoning over his health. Death, ill health, dementia \u2013 those are things even he can\u2019t escape.\u201d The property developer and reality TV star has spent his career pushing ethical and legal boundaries to the limit, facing countless investigations, court battles and hefty fines. Worthy of a novel, his has been a life of scandal on a gargantuan scale. Officials in the US battleground state of Michigan said they worry that the Democratic-leaning city of Warren could lag behind the rest of the state in reporting the results of Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, raising early doubts about the state\u2019s vote count. Warren, unlike Detroit and most other cities in Michigan, opted not to take advantage of changes enacted in a 2022 state law allowing for up to eight days of pre-processing of absentee ballots, Reuters reported. Instead, the city of 135,000 people will wait until election day to verify and tabulate more than 20,000 mail-in ballots. The potential delay from Warren has worried some Democratic leaders that it could leave the results appearing artificially high for Republican Donald Trump on Tuesday evening, and that the former president would seek to exploit the situation by falsely declaring victory in the state before all votes were in. \u201cIf the state is close at all and we don\u2019t have returns from Warren, which is our third-largest city, it\u2019s going to create all kinds of concerns,\u201d said Mark Brewer, an attorney and the former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very worrisome.\u201d The US presidential election campaign enters its final weekend with polls showing Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in seemingly permanent deadlock and few clues as to which of them will prevail on Tuesday. At the end of another unruly week that began with Trump\u2019s racially charged rally in New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden and was punctuated by celebrity endorsements, misogynistic comments and insults about \u201cgarbage\u201d being levelled left and right, the Guardian\u2019s 10-day polling average tracker showed little change from seven days earlier, with voter loyalty to their chosen candidate appearing relatively impervious to campaign events, however seismic. Nationally, Harris, the Democratic nominee, has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of error of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. The candidates are evenly tied at 48% in Pennsylvania, often seen as the most important swing state because it has the most electoral votes (19). Harris has single-point leads in the two other blue-wall states, Michigan and Wisconsin, while Trump is marginally ahead in the Sun belt: up by 1% in North Carolina and 2% in Georgia and Arizona. In Nevada, his average advantage in the polls is less than a percentage point. Writing on NBC\u2019s website, Josh Clinton, a politics professor at Vanderbilt University, and John Lapinski, the network\u2019s director of elections, pondered whether the tied race reflected not the sentiments of the voters, but rather risk-averse decision-making by pollsters. Some, they suggested, may be wary of findings indicating unusually large leads for one candidate and introduce corrective weighting. Of the last 321 polls in the battlegrounds, 124 \u2013 nearly 40% \u2013 showed margins of a single point or less, the pair wrote. Pennsylvania was the most \u201ctroubling\u201d case, with 20 out of 59 polls showing an exact tie, while another 26 showed margins of less than 1%. This indicated \u201cnot just an astonishingly tight race, but also an improbably tight race\u201d, according to Clinton and Lapinski. Read the full piece here: Around a month before the US elections, in the Kharkiv region, I sat down with a group of Ukrainian infantry soldiers together with the American historian Timothy Snyder. I suggested they ask questions of him not only as an American historian, but also as an American citizen. The servicemen were curious about the upcoming election, but mainly the chances of receiving significant military aid any time soon. They expressed pity that many Americans still don\u2019t understand that the Ukrainian fight is not just about us. It\u2019s in the world\u2019s interests to support the fight against blatant breaches of the international order. The anxiety of the American elections is felt more strongly in Kyiv among Ukrainian officials and civil society leaders because Ukraine has become a partisan issue, and part of US domestic politics. These groups have been trying for years to be on good terms with both Democrats and Republicans in the US. This was especially true during the long delays in Congress over the vote for security assistance to Ukraine. But engaging with the Maga camp has become difficult. This only got worse when it was revealed what Donald Trump\u2019s vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, said in 2022: \u201cI gotta be honest with you, I don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\u201d During the race, Vance has characterised Vladimir Putin as an \u201cadversary\u201d and \u201ccompetitor\u201d, rather than an enemy, and has generally argued that the US should be focusing on China, not Russia. This is what happens when successive US governments fail to tackle inequality. While millions of people live in poverty, a handful grow unimaginably rich. Wealth begets wealth, and they acquire political power to match. It was inevitable that one of them \u2013 now the richest man on Earth \u2013 would launch what looks like a bid for world domination. A vote for Donald Trump next week is a vote for Elon Musk. Just as Trump is using Musk, Musk could be using Trump as a springboard to perhaps even greater power than the US president can wield. Musk\u2019s secret conversations with Vladimir Putin, reported by the Wall Street Journal last week, and his contacts with other extremist world leaders, suggest a pattern of power-seeking that could be even more alarming than the prospect of a second Trump presidency. Trump, if he wins, will do to the nation what Musk did to Twitter: the US will be e-Muskulated. What this means is that those with the power to swarm, harass and crush people who do not share their noxious ideology will be unleashed. Elon Musk claims to be a \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d. But his absolutism seems to extend only to his allies. Since he bought Twitter and renamed it X, the platform has complied with 83% of requests by governments for the censorship or surveillance of accounts. When the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, demanded the censorship of his opponents before the last general election, the platform obliged. When Indian government officials asked it to remove a hostile BBC documentary, X did as they asked, and later deleted the accounts of many critics of the prime minister, Narendra Modi. Top Republicans have called on the White House to produce all documents and internal communications regarding president Joe Biden\u2019s statement earlier this week in which he appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump. White House press officials altered the official transcript of Biden\u2019s statement, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity, according to two US government officials and an internal email obtained on Thursday by the Associated Press. The Republican lawmakers said they question whether the decision to create \u201ca false transcript and manipulate or alter the accurate transcript\u201d produced for the National Archives and Records Administration was a violation of federal law. Representative James Comer, Republican chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, and House Republican conference chair Elise Stefanik demanded the White House produce the records. They also called on the White House to make available for a briefing the top supervisor of its stenography office. Comer and Stefanik said: The White House cannot simply rewrite president Biden\u2019s rhetoric. We are concerned with the latest reporting of the White House\u2019s apparent political decision to protect the Biden-Harris administration, instead of following longstanding and proper protocols. At a Wisconsin rally on Friday, Donald Trump called Kamala Harris a \u201clow-IQ person\u201d and vowed to save the economy \u201cfrom total obliteration\u201d in a 1.5 hour-long meandering speech that touched on top campaign issues including the economy and foreign policy \u2013 but also featured threats to curb press freedoms and a lengthy discussion of his own rhetorical style. \u201cI will stop the criminal invasion of this country,\u201d said Trump during his opening remarks, promising to usher in a new \u201cgolden age\u201d. \u201cCan you imagine if Kamala won? You would go down to a 1929 style depression,\u201d said Trump. On immigration, Trump\u2019s message was characteristically dark. The campaign played a painful video of a mother describing her daughter\u2019s murder and blaming Harris for allowing the accused to enter the US without authorization. Studies overwhelmingly refute Trump\u2019s claim that immigrants are disproportionately responsible for crime in the US, but such claims are a feature of his campaign. \u201cThe day I take office, the migrant invasion ends,\u201d said Trump. He vowed to launch the \u201clargest deportation program in American history\u201d and said cities and towns had been \u201cconquered\u201d by immigrants, whom he referred to as \u201canimals\u201d. Since his Madison Square Garden rally \u2013 which showcased racist and misogynistic comments from a lineup of speakers, including comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who called Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d \u2013 Trump and his allies have sought to recast the former president and his Maga base as unfairly maligned. \u201cKamala has spent the final week of her campaign comparing her political opponents to the most evil mass murderers in history,\u201d said Trump at the Wisconsin rally. \u201cVice-president Harris thinks you are Nazis, fascists,\u201d said the Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson, who spoke at the rally. Johnson praised Trump for bringing into his campaign Robert F Kennedy Jr, who ended his presidential bid as a third party candidate in August; and Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman who announced she had left the party in 2022. Johnson accused Democrats of \u201cdestroying America\u201d and credited Trump with making \u201cthe Republican Party the party of the working men and women of America.\u201d The office of Arizona Democratic attorney general Kris Mayes is \u201clooking into\u201d whether Donald Trump broke state law when he said on Thursday that Liz Cheney should face rifles \u201cshooting at her\u201d to see how she feels about sending troops to fight. \u201cThe Arizona attorney general\u2019s office is looking into whether Donald Trump\u2019s comments about Liz Cheney violated Arizona law,\u201d Richie Taylor, communications director for the AG\u2019s office, said in a statement on Friday. \u201cThe office has no additional comments to make at this time.\u201d Trump made the comments about Cheney, one of the former president\u2019s biggest Republican critics and the daughter of former vice-president Dick Cheney, to former Fox News Host Tucker Carlson at a campaign event in Glendale on Thursday, AP reported. \u201cLet\u2019s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLet\u2019s see how she feels about it.\u201d He repeated his aggressive attack at his rally in Warren, Michigan, on Friday afternoon. \u201cShe\u2019s tough one. But if you gave Liz Cheney a gun, put her into battle facing the other side with guns pointing at her. She wouldn\u2019t have the courage or the strength or the stamina to even look the enemy in the eye,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I broke up with her,\u201d Trump commented, prompting some laughs. In an interview on Friday with 12News, a local television station in Arizona, Mayes said Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d \u201cI have already asked my criminal division chief to start looking at that statement, analyzing it for whether it qualifies as a death threat under Arizona\u2019s laws,\u201d Mayes told 12News. \u201cI\u2019m not prepared now to say whether it was or it wasn\u2019t, but it is not helpful as we prepare for our election and as we try to make sure that we keep the peace at our polling places and in our state,\u201d she continued. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I\u2019m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest from the campaign trail throughout this morning. We start with news that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris battled to woo voters in the key swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin on Friday, as the presidential campaign enters its final stretch. Harris made several appearances in Wisconsin on Friday, including one that featured the musician Cardi B, while Trump visited both Michigan and Wisconsin. At his rally in Warren, Michigan, on Friday afternoon, Trump tried to energize his voters, delivering an address replete with his characteristic fear-mongering about immigrants and tangents including musings about his hair. He repeated his aggressive attack on Liz Cheney, one day after he first said the former Republican US representative should be under fire with rifles \u201cshooting at her\u201d. Harris meanwhile sought to draw a contrast, emphasizing at a rally in Wisconsin in the afternoon that she is looking to be a political consensus builder. \u201cHere is my pledge to you. Here is my pledge to you as president. I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI pledge to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make. I will listen to experts. I will listen to the people who disagree with me. Because, you see, unlike Donald Trump, I don\u2019t believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy.\u201d \u201cHe wants to put them in jail,\u201d Harris said, repeating a line she\u2019s has frequently invoked of late. \u201cI\u2019ll give them a seat at the table.\u201d During his appearance in Warren in the afternoon and in Milwaukee in the evening, Trump repeatedly stoked fears about immigrants. In Warren, he said: \u201cevery state is a border state\u201d and falsely claim immigrants were being flown into the south-west. He repeated some of his most racist tropes, saying: \u201cAll of our jobs are being taken by the migrants that come into our country illegally and many of those migrants happen to be criminals, and some of them happen to be murderers.\u201d For more on last night\u2019s events, see our full report here: In other news: Harris told her crowd at the Wisconsin State Fair Park Exposition Center that with four days to go, there was still work to do, but \u201cwe like hard work\u201d. Minutes beforehand, during a raucous warmup, the rapper Cardi B referred to Trump as \u201cDonnie Dunk\u201d and told the crowd: \u201cTrump says he\u2019s going to protect women whether they like it or not. Well, if his definition of protection is not the freedom of choice, if his definition of protection is making sure our daughters have fewer rights than our mothers, then I don\u2019t want it! I don\u2019t want it! I don\u2019t want it!\u201d Earlier, Harris said Trump\u2019s violent rhetoric about Cheney \u201cmust be disqualifying\u201d as far as his suitability for the presidency is concerned. \u201cRepresentative Cheney is a true patriot who has shown extraordinary courage in putting country above party.\u201d Cheney for her part warned the public against dictatorship and a presidential candidate who \u201cwants to be a tyrant\u201d. Republicans\u2019 latest offensive and misogynistic comments have boosted Democratic hopes of turning out women on election day in a contest where the rights of women have been a central issue for the Harris campaign. At his Milwaukee rally on Friday, Trump called Harris a \u201clow-IQ person\u201d and vowed to save the economy \u201cfrom total obliteration\u201d in a 1.5-hour-long meandering speech that touched on the economy and foreign policy but also featured threats to curb press freedoms and a lengthy discussion of his own rhetorical style. \u201cI will stop the criminal invasion of this country,\u201d said Trump, promising to usher in a new \u201cgolden age\u201d. \u201cCan you imagine if Kamala won? You would go down to a 1929-style depression.\u201d Trump\u2019s supporters are laying the ground for rejecting the result of the election if he loses, according to warnings from Democrats as well as anti-Maga Republicans. As well as baseless and/or failed lawsuits, suspicions have been voiced over partisan polls run by groups with Republican links in battleground states that mainly show Trump leading \u2013 the idea being that if Trump loses, the polls can be proferred as \u201cevidence\u201d that he was cheated out of the win. The New York author and journalist Michael Wolff has released audio tapes that appear to detail how Trump had a close social relationship with the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein that he has long denied. Wolff says the recordings were made during a 2017 discussion with Epstein about writing his biography. Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges two years later. Trump\u2019s campaign said the claims, made on Wolff\u2019s podcast Fire and Fury, amounted to \u201coutlandish false smears\u201d. A federal judge rejected an attempt by Elon Musk\u2019s America Pac to have charges of running an illegal lottery heard in federal court, instead of the courts of Pennsylvania, where Musk is running the sweepstakes to help Trump get re-elected. The case has been sent back to the Pennsylvania state court for a further hearing on Monday. Racism and misogyny; a firing squad death threat to a former congresswoman; the Republican candidate for president dressing up as a sanitation worker in the cab of a garbage truck. Donald Trump\u2019s final full week on the campaign trail was as unedifying as it was bizarre \u2013 Richard Luscombe sums it up. A valuable Republican voting bloc in Arizona is seeing a shift of its members towards Harris in numbers that Democrats believe could make the difference for them in an election where the latest polls have Trump slightly ahead. That bloc is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \u2013 the Mormons."

            "content": "The US government has recognized Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia as the \u201cpresident-elect\u201d of the South American country, months after President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed to have won the July contest. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, recognized Gonz\u00e1lez in a post on X in which he also demanded \u201crespect for the will\u201d of Venezuelan voters. Joe Biden\u2019s administration had previously said Gonz\u00e1lez earned the most votes in the disputed 28 July election, but fell short of acknowledging him as president-elect. \u201cThe Venezuelan people spoke resoundingly on July 28 and made [Gonz\u00e1lez] the president-elect,\u201d wrote Blinken. Gonz\u00e1lez fled to exile in Spain earlier this month, later telling reporters that he had been coerced into signing a letter recognizing Maduro as the winner of the disputed election as a condition for letting him leave Venezuela. Venezuela\u2019s national electoral council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, had declared Maduro the election winner hours after polls closed. Unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts. But the opposition coalition collected tally sheets from 80% of the nation\u2019s electronic voting machines and posted them online. Gonz\u00e1lez and opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado said the voting records showed the former diplomat won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro. Earlier this month, Maduro appeared to extend an olive branch to Donald Trump, calling for a new era of \u201cwin-win\u201d relations and prompting speculation of possible rapprochement between the two leaders.\u2019 \u201cIn his first government \u2026 Trump wasn\u2019t good to us [but] this is a new start,\u201d said Maduro during a live TV broadcast. Addressing Trump, Maduro said: \u201cYour slogan is \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019. And, paraphrasing your slogan, I\u2019d say that our slogan is to make the united Venezuela, Latin America and the Caribbean great.\u201d Earlier on Tuesday, Colombia\u2019s president, Gustavo Petro, who has friendly relations with Maduro, reversed his support for the July elections, calling them a \u201cmistake\u201d. Petro spoke in an interview with Brazilian news outlet Globo News, which released excerpts online that Petro\u2019s office shared Tuesday on social media. Petro told the news outlet on Monday while visiting Brazil for the G20 summit that he initially had been in favor of Venezuela holding the elections, but that he later decided that the vote was not \u201cfree\u201d. \u201cI think the elections were a mistake,\u201d Petro said.

            "date": "2024-11-06T10:43:08Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump has been elected the 47th president of the United States in a stunning political resurrection that sent shockwaves through America and around the world. Trump becomes the first convicted criminal to win the White House. At 78 he is also the oldest person ever elected to the office. The result will sound alarm bells in foreign capitals given Trump\u2019s chaotic leadership style and overtures to authoritarians such as Vladimir Putin of Russia and Kim Jong-un of North Korea. He was branded a threat to democracy and even a fascist by his opponent, Vice-President Kamala Harris, and some of his own former White House officials. Yet the American electorate proved willing to push such concerns aside and hand the nuclear codes to the property developer turned reality TV star for a second time. Trump defeated Harris, a Democrat who had been seeking to make history herself as the first woman, first Black woman and first south Asian American to become president in the US\u2019s 248-year history. As votes were counted overnight, Trump took North Carolina surprisingly early, the first battleground state to be called, and later he won Georgia and Pennsylvania. As early as 1.20am ET, at Trump\u2019s election watch party in Palm Beach, Florida, a prolonged, almighty roar went up when Fox News called Pennsylvania for the Republican nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201d screamed one man. A young man in a black Trump hat shouted: \u201cFuck Joe Biden! Fuck her!\u201d After 2am, Trump emerged to speak, surrounded by his family, close aides and JD Vance, the hard-right Ohio senator he made his vice-presidential pick. \u201cThis is a movement like nobody\u2019s ever seen before,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is I believe the greatest political movement of all time. There\u2019s never been anything like this in this country and now it\u2019s going to reach a new level of importance, because we\u2019re going to help our country heal. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fix our borders. We\u2019re going to fix everything about our country \u2026 I will not rest until we have delivered the strong, safe and prosperous America that our children deserve, this will truly be the golden age of America.\u201d By 5.37am ET the Associated Press called Wisconsin for Trump, with the state\u2019s 10 electoral college votes tipping Trump\u2019s total to 277 \u2013 well past the 270 votes needed to win the presidency. In Congress, Republicans also recaptured the US Senate, but control of the House of Representatives remained unclear on Wednesday morning, with many of the most competitive races still uncalled. Harris, 60, made reproductive rights and personal freedoms a rallying cry and backed a national law codifying access to safe abortion. Her loss represents a devastating, anxiety-inducing blow to supporters reminiscent of Hillary Clinton\u2019s crushing defeat in 2016. She was expected to speak later on Wednesday. But for Trump, the unlikeliest of comebacks is now complete. Many analysts assumed that his defeat by Joe Biden in 2020 spelled the end of his political career, especially when an angry mob of his supporters \u2013 fuelled by his lie that the election was stolen \u2013 stormed the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, resulting in his second impeachment. But while Trump\u2019s grip on the Republican party was briefly shaken, it held firm. The thrice-married New Yorker, found liable for sexual abuse, remained an unlikely hero of evangelical Christians and the white working class, and polling suggested that he gained small but significant traction among African American and Latino voters. Four criminal cases \u2013 including a conviction on 34 felony counts over concealing hush-money payments to the adult film performer Stormy Daniels \u2013 would have been devastating to any other politician but only appeared to strengthen Trump\u2019s standing with his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d (Maga) base. Spewing insults, Trump swatted challengers aside to claim the Republican presidential nomination for a third consecutive time. Just before the party convention in July he survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, an escape that many allies took as a sign from God (another would-be assassin was caught at one of Trump\u2019s Florida golf courses in September). Meanwhile, after a disastrous debate performance, Joe Biden stepped aside as the presumptive Democratic nominee in July and anointed Harris his successor. Her \u201cpolitics of joy\u201d gave Democrats a jolt of energy and appeared to change the trajectory of a race that had been slipping away. The contest unfolded over little more than 100 days, the shortest in modern memory, against a backdrop of hurricanes at home and wars overseas. Trump received a major assist from the world\u2019s richest man, the tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who gave away millions of dollars to voters in swing states who signed a petition tied to his political action committee. The race looked extraordinarily close until the end. However, Trump\u2019s significant victory suggests that his pitch \u2013 often crude and rambling, mendacious and racist \u2013 still resonated among voters disillusioned with the political establishment. It was also a repudiation of Biden\u2019s legislatively productive presidency and his dire warnings of the danger that Trump poses to US institutions and global security. The election result threatens convulsions and mass protests across the country. Trump ran on a now familiar campaign theme of nativist populism that promised the biggest ever deportation of undocumented people, whom he branded as \u201canimals\u201d with \u201cbad genes\u201d who were \u201cpoisoning the blood of the country\u201d. He complained that the US was \u201clike a garbage can\u201d for the rest of the world. The former president also cast his criminal indictments as a political attack, vowing \u201cretribution\u201d against perceived enemies and embracing increasingly dystopian rhetoric. He made ominous comments threatening to deploy the military domestically against \u201cenemies from within\u201d and promised to pardon supporters imprisoned for the January 6 insurrection. Trump will be the first president to serve non-consecutive terms since Grover Cleveland, who was in office from 1885 to 1889 and from 1893 to 1897. As vice-president, Harris will preside over a joint session of Congress in January to certify the results of the election. She will be succeeded as vice-president by Vance, the 40-year-old senator who, unlike the former vice-president Mike Pence, has refused to acknowledge that Trump lost four years ago.

            "date": "2024-11-05T11:00:49Z",
            "content": "Over the last 25 years, Americans have regularly found themselves up into the early morning hours waiting for news organizations to make the decisive call of the last state needed to put a presidential candidate in the White House, and to learn who controls Congress. A moment like this on election night in 2000 led to our common language of Republican states as red states and Democratic states as blue states, as the US watched the Meet the Press host Tim Russert on NBC talk late through the night about what was happening in Florida. It\u2019s extremely unlikely that we\u2019ll know the winner of the presidential contest on election night, as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are virtually tied in the polls, and the odds that the race comes down to a small number of swing states is high. So when will we know who won the US election? Well, that depends on how close things turn out to be. Four swing states \u2013 Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 have absentee ballot procedures that can require days to conclude. But if Harris has decisively won the other swing states, it is enough to declare her the victor. Any other result will take time. Why do US news organizations make the call? News organizations call a winner. They do not determine a winner. Officials in elections offices who count votes and certify election results determine the winner. That certification happens days or even weeks after an election. News organizations convey the moment it has become plain from what those elections offices have said that the mathematical results of the vote count show a winner. \u201cOur standard is absolute certainty,\u201d said David Scott, head of news strategy and operations at the Associated Press. \u201cWe don\u2019t declare a winner until we are 100% confident that the trailing candidates can\u2019t catch up.\u201d The Guardian follows the Associated Press in calling an election. How do news organizations make their calls? The AP and other election night news organizations such as CNN, NBC, ABC and Fox News maintain a \u201cdecision desk\u201d and use a model to project how the vote count will unfold, state by state. Some are now relying on Decision Desk HQ, an independent organization set up specifically for this task. \u201cNews organizations have gotten a lot more nervous about making early calls because they don\u2019t want to have to take a call back like they did in 2000,\u201d said Mike Wagner, a professor studying elections at the University of Wisconsin. The decisions about when to call are made by statisticians, not news anchors. Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts \u201cIt\u2019s not Sean Hannity making that determination,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cIt\u2019s not Rupert Murdoch making that determination early. It\u2019s the people in the room doing the analysis, making that determination about whether, whether the election can be called.\u201d The calls of different networks may differ in timing because each uses a model that is independent of others. Different analysts may make conclusions at different times. When did we know the results in 2020? Joe Biden was declared the winner on Saturday 7 November \u2013 four days after the election. The president crossed the electoral vote threshold that day when media outlets called Pennsylvania and Nevada. Michigan and Wisconsin were both called the day after the election, but Arizona wasn\u2019t called until 12 November, North Carolina until 13 November, and Georgia on 19 November, after a recount. Will results be faster or slower than 2020? That depends on the margins in each state. According to Protect Democracy, a non-partisan group, we\u2019ll generally see results faster than in 2020 if the margin in a state is greater than 0.5%. They draw this conclusion because there will be significantly fewer mail ballots than in 2020, and states will be able to count them faster. Three states also expanded the pre-canvassing of mail ballots before election day that didn\u2019t in 2020 (Arizona, Georgia and Michigan) and three states have an earlier deadline for when mail ballots must arrive than they did in 2020 (North Carolina, Nevada and Pennsylvania). Protect Democracy said in a recent report that its best guess was that results will be called in Michigan and Wisconsin one full day after polls closed \u2013 the same speed as 2020. It also guesses that Pennsylvania will be called faster than in 2020, when it took four days; Nevada will be called in the same amount of time or faster than 2020, when it took four days and Arizona will also be called in the same amount of time or faster than 2020, when it took nine days. North Carolina and Georgia will both be called faster than 2020, the organization guesses. What could prolong results? If the margin in states is smaller than 0.5% or if any states require recounts, results could be prolonged. News outlets will generally not call states until the results of a recount. For Arizona and Nevada in particular, \u201cit\u2019s very unlikely anybody\u2019s going to call those races on election night,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way those states have worked for a very long time, and so that\u2019s very much expected.\u201d If another swing state is as close as Georgia was in 2020, \u201cyou\u2019re just waiting. That\u2019s not something you\u2019re going to get ahead of and make a projection that\u2019s just too close to call. And so you\u2019re just waiting for the votes to come.\u201d Pennsylvania is particularly challenging because by law, local elections offices can\u2019t begin opening envelopes and tallying mail-in ballots until the day of the election. Wisconsin, another swing state, has a similar restriction and may not report complete results until early Wednesday morning. Some states permit absentee ballots to be counted as much as 10 days after election day. Of the swing states, only Nevada has a meaningful delay; it can accept mail-in ballots up to the Saturday after election day, as long as they are postmarked by 5 November. If there are legal battles over which ballots to count, that could also delay results. There are currently numerous pending lawsuits in a number of swing states concerning the canvassing of certain ballots, including late-arriving ballots and overseas ballots. If a state has results like Florida in 2000, where a three-digit number separates two candidates, the result may come down to military absentee ballots and possibly provisional ballots. Typically, only about half of provisional ballots count, but in a close race we\u2019ll see a mad scramble by political teams to find the people who cast those ballots to \u201ccure\u201d them, which usually involves bringing proof of identification and registration to an elections office. What states will provide results first this year? It\u2019s likely that news organizations will call several east coast states first where one candidate has a clear advantage over the other. \u201cObviously, there are some states that are going to be basically called at full closing,\u201d said Drew McCoy, president of Decision Desk HQ. \u201cThere\u2019ll be some that are called, you know, once you sort of start to see the first votes come in and that it tracks with historical precedents.\u201d What is the \u2018red mirage\u2019 and the \u2018blue shift\u2019? The phrases \u201cred mirage\u201d and \u201cblue shift\u201d refer to the same phenomenon in which a Republican candidate appears to have a lead early in the evening, only for that edge to disappear as more votes are counted. In 2020, mail-in ballots heavily favored Democrats, while Republicans were far more likely to vote in-person. On Wednesday at noon on the day after the election, Donald Trump had an 11% lead, which Joe Biden overcame over the next two days as elections workers counted 2.7 million voters\u2019 mail-in ballots. The AP and other news organizations knew how many absentee ballots voters had returned, and knew how many had been requested by registered Democrats, and refrained from calling the race for Biden until those ballots were counted. On the Friday before election day, Wisconsin had received more than 1m absentee ballots, with more on the way. \u201cIn the two most populous counties, they don\u2019t finish counting until 1am or 2am,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cAnd so several hundred thousand votes come in, you know, under the cover of darkness, and they happen in the two most liberal counties in the state. The Democrat always picks up a ton of votes in the middle of the night in Wisconsin, because, by law, they can\u2019t start counting until then. It\u2019s a petri dish for conspiracy theories, even though they\u2019re doing things exactly the way they\u2019re required to do them.\u201d The opposite phenomenon occurs in Arizona, where mail-in ballots received before election day are counted \u2013 and reported \u2013 first. In 2022, the Democratic senator Mark Kelly had a 20-point lead over Republican Blake Masters at the start of the night. Kelly ultimately won with a five-point margin. But mail-in ballots received on election day cannot be processed until after the polls close. In 2020, that was a significant number \u2013 about 320,000 ballots in Maricopa county alone. Why is this so complicated? Why doesn\u2019t the country just add up all the votes and see who has more? A reminder: in the presidential election contest, the popular vote nationally does not determine the result. Each state counts its votes separately. With two exceptions \u2013 Nebraska and Maine \u2013 the winner of a state gets all of its electoral votes, regardless of whether the state was won by 537 votes out of about 6m cast, as in the presidential contest in Florida in 2000, or the 1.5m-vote margin Reagan won California by in 1984. Each state has a number of electors based on the number of congressional districts it has, plus two additional votes representing the state\u2019s Senate seats. Washington DC has three electoral votes, despite having no voting representation in Congress. It takes 270 electors to win. Biden won by a 51-47 percentage in 2020, a margin of about 7m votes. The electoral count was 306-232, winning about 57% of the electors. When will we know who controls Congress? Individual congressional races will be called as votes come in, but with 435 races across the country, some are bound to be too close to call on election night. Depending on how many, it may not be obvious for some time which party controls Congress, McCoy said. \u201cThere\u2019s always kind of like one or two races that are just, you know, ridiculously close, and it just goes to a recount, or whatever the process may be,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cIt\u2019s very much about waiting for the data and seeing what it tells you, not getting in front of that. That\u2019s our biggest rule, is never getting in front of the data.\u201d Read more of the Guardian\u2019s 2024 US election coverage When do polls close? Where is abortion on the ballot?

            "content": "Claudia Sheinbaum has said her \u201cvery kind\u201d phone conversation with Donald Trump, in which they discussed immigration and fentanyl, means \u201cthere will not be a potential tariff war\u201d between the US and Mexico. The president of Mexico spoke to reporters on Thursday following Trump\u2019s threat earlier in the week to apply a 25% tariff against Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tariff against China, when he takes office in January if the countries did not stop all illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling into the US. Trump, in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday, claimed that during the phone call with Sheinbaum she had \u201cagreed to stop Migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border\u201d. During her Thursday address Sheinbaum clarified she did not agree to shut down the border. \u201cEach person has their own way of communicating,\u201d Sheinbaum said. \u201cBut I can assure you, I guarantee you, that we never \u2013 additionally, we would be incapable of doing so \u2013 proposed that we would close the border in the north [of Mexico], or in the south of the United States. It has never been our idea and, of course, we are not in agreement with that.\u201d She added that the two did not discuss tariffs, but that the conversation with Trump had reassured her that no tit-for-tat tariff battle would be needed in future. On Monday this week, Trump threatened to impose a 25% percent tariff on Mexico until drugs, including fentanyl, and undocumented immigrants \u201cstop this Invasion of our Country\u201d. He declared that Mexico and Canada should use their power to address drug trafficking and migration and, until they do, \u201cit is time for them to pay a very big price!\u201d The following day, Sheinbaum suggested Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own. On Wednesday, however, the conversation between Sheinbaum and Trump was \u201cvery kind\u201d, the Mexican president said. She said she told Trump of the various migration initiatives her government has undertaken, including providing resources and support to central American countries and to migrants arriving in Mexico. Potential immigrants \u201cwill not reach the northern border, because Mexico has a strategy\u201d, Sheinbaum said. Trump \u201crecognized this effort\u201d by the Mexican government, Sheinbaum added. She also said Trump expressed interest in the government-driven programs to address fentanyl addiction and overdoses in Mexico. And she raised the problem of American-made weapons entering Mexico from the US to be used by drug cartels. Sheinbaum further added that she encouraged Trump to stop the blockades against Cuba and Venezuela, since \u201cpeople suffer and it leads to the phenomenon of migration\u201d. Asked by a reporter from Rolling Stone magazine that quoted anonymous Trump-aligned sources discussing a \u201csoft invasion\u201d of Mexico by deploying the US military inside the country against drug trafficking groups, Sheinbaum dismissed the idea, calling it \u201centirely a movie\u201d. \u201cWhat I base myself on is the conversation \u2013 the two conversations \u2013 that I had with President Trump, and then, at the moment, the communication we will have with his work team and when he takes office,\u201d Sheinbaum said. \u201cWe will always defend our sovereignty. Mexico is a free, independent, sovereign country \u2013 and that is above everything else.\u201d"
