            "date": "2024-03-01T14:26:23Z",
            "content": "The past 14 years have been a white-knuckle ride for the British economy. Record low interest rates, money creation from the Bank of England on an industrial scale, Brexit, millions of workers furloughed during the pandemic, the biggest fall in output in at least a century \u2013 all that, and a record number of people inactive through long-term ill health. Boring it hasn\u2019t been. At the end of it all, there is a sense of deja vu as Jeremy Hunt puts the finishing touches to next week\u2019s budget. When Liam Byrne departed the Treasury in 2010 he left a note \u2013 meant as a joke \u2013 for his successor as chief secretary, which said: \u201cI\u2019m afraid there is no money.\u201d After almost a decade and a half of economic underperformance, Byrne\u2019s words have come back to haunt the Tories. Under pressure from Rishi Sunak to deliver pre-election tax cuts, the chancellor is scrabbling around for cash to fund the much-anticipated giveaways. The economy is officially in recession and money is tight. Opinion polls suggest the Conservatives are heading for a polling-day pummelling when the election is held, and the state of the economy is the principal cause of voter discontent. Gordon Brown, Byrne\u2019s old boss and the last Labour prime minister, says it should come as no surprise that the electorate is unhappy. \u201cIn 2010, I predicted a decade of austerity when we left office. We have actually had a decade and a half of austerity.\u201d Brown says that what motivated the Conservatives in 2010 was the idea of a small state, to be achieved through austerity and debt reduction. But austerity did not work. Slow growth meant deficit targets were missed and the public finances suffered from a chronic malaise. Productivity growth in the past 14 years had been the weakest since the Industrial Revolution, the former prime minister says. \u201cWe no longer have stop-go, we have different levels of stop, with crisis after crisis. \u201cBritain is a low-growth, low-productivity, low-investment, low-wage economy. And that means higher levels of poverty, destitution and inequality. We are entering a doom loop,\u201d Brown says. Hunt\u2019s case is that since 2010 the UK has grown faster than Spain, Italy, France, Germany or Japan, and that after hitting a 40-year high of 11.1% in October 2022, inflation is coming down fast. Last year\u2019s autumn statement included 110 measures designed to boost growth. Economists say George Osborne blundered when he imposed severe austerity measures on a still-fragile economy Voters may take some convincing that the Conservatives can again be trusted to run the economy. Living standards for workers are on course to be lower at the end of this parliament than when it started in 2019. Real average wages \u2013 pay adjusted for inflation \u2013 are no higher today than they were 16 years ago. What is more, after 14 years the Conservatives can no longer blame their difficulties on their legacy from Labour. Over the past 45 years, parties have enjoyed long interrupted periods in office: 18 years for the Tories between 1979 and 1997; 13 years for Labour from 1997 to 2010; 14 years for the Conservatives since then. After that length of time, governments are judged on their own record, and the one Hunt is defending is markedly worse than the one the Conservatives could boast of in 1997. Back then, growth was much stronger, debt was much lower, and the balance of payments was in surplus. Similarly, in 2010 the economy seemed to be slowly on the mend after the shock caused by the near-collapse of the global banking system two years earlier. Economists say George Osborne \u2013 David Cameron\u2019s chancellor \u2013 blundered when he imposed severe austerity measures on a still-fragile economy. Gerard Lyons, economic adviser to Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London and now chief economic strategist at Net Wealth says: \u201cThe whole period after 2010 was one of major fiscal mistakes. Austerity was wrong and badly executed. The ability to borrow cheaply was staring at us as a huge opportunity but was never taken.\u201d Lyons is also critical of the Bank of England for keeping interest rates low for so long. The official cost of borrowing was cut to 0.5 % in March 2009 and remained below 1% for the subsequent 13 years. \u201cCheap money was an absolute disaster. It led to asset price inflation, greater inequality, zombie companies and inflation.\u201d Lyons says the past 14 years have widened the UK\u2019s divisions, and not just those between north and south. \u201cIt is London versus the rest of the country, cities versus rural places, coastal communities versus those inland, homeowners versus renters, the old versus the young and the skilled versus the unskilled.\u201d Although politically dominated by one party, the period since May 2010 divides neatly into three distinct periods: the austerity years at the start; the Brexit years in the middle; and the pandemic years at the end. Jagjit Chadha, director of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research thinktank, says there is a thread running throughout. \u201cThe supply side of the economy has been very badly managed after the financial crisis and has suffered because of the way Brexit was brought about. That meant we were unable to cope with Covid and the cost of living crisis in the way we might have done. The economy was made riskier just as the global economy became riskier. \u201cWealth and income inequalities have expanded. There has been the growth of the working poor, who need state support. That has led to a structural budget deficit and a continual squeeze on public investment that has further weakened the economy\u2019s supply side. Things have come together that have not been tackled by our political masters.\u201d Lyons supported Brexit and remains convinced that it will be positive for the economy if the opportunities are seized. Even so, he says the three and a half years between the referendum in June 2016 and the December 2019 general election \u2013 when it was unclear on what terms the UK would leave the EU, if it all \u2013 created political instability that depressed investment. Within months of Brexit being finalised, the economy was in the grip of the pandemic. All of which has left the sense of a country stumbling from one crisis to another, and never getting to grips with underlying structural problems that have been evident for decades. Back in 2003, Mervyn King, then governor of the Bank of England, said the economy had enjoyed a NICE \u2013 non-inflationary, consistently expansionary decade \u2013 in which Lady Luck had smiled on the UK. That ceased to be the case five years later when the UK was one of the countries worst affected by the global financial crisis, and it has never really recovered in the 16 years since. Pre-2008 the economy doubled in size every 32 years. The Office for Budget Responsibility now says it will take 40-45 years for that to happen, and on current trends even that looks optimistic. The one positive surprise is that despite everything that has been chucked at the economy, unemployment has remained low. Rachel Reeves, Hunt\u2019s Labour shadow, says the party that wins the next election will have the direst inheritance of an incoming government since the second world war. The chancellor would disagree with that assessment. Voters might not."

            "date": "2024-03-02T06:00:23Z",
            "content": "Jeremy Hunt will attempt to use next week\u2019s budget to reboot the Conservatives\u2019 flatlining performance in the opinion polls before the next general election, with the chancellor widely expected to announce sweeping tax cuts. But while Rishi Sunak will be hoping his chancellor delivers a near-term bounce from crowd-pleasing giveaways, his government is facing growing pressure over the Tories\u2019 management of the economy over the past 14 years. Here are 10 charts outlining the Conservatives\u2019 record since 2010. The deficit \u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this. I\u2019ll cut the deficit, not the NHS,\u201d read David Cameron\u2019s famous campaign poster before the 2010 general election. After the 2008 global financial crisis cratered Britain\u2019s economy, inflicting the largest government deficit of the postwar era (before the Covid pandemic), the Tories came to power pledging to mend the public finances. Under George Osborne in No 11 this included austerity in the public sector and benefit cuts. Sunak is also promising to cut the national debt. But the Tories never eliminated the deficit, and the national debt (the sum of every annual shortfall) has steadily risen from 64.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010 to 96.5% currently \u2013 the highest level since the 1960s. The NHS NHS waiting lists have soared since the Covid pandemic \u2013 but were already rising sharply before the health emergency amid workforce shortages and underinvestment in infrastructure. NHS funding has risen in every year in real terms since 2010, as a ringfenced commitment under the Tories. However, it has increased by far less than the long-term historical average, while a growing and ageing population has added to pressures. Sunak has committed to cutting NHS waiting lists. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates they will be falling come the election but will not hit pre-Covid levels until at least 2030. Economic growth \u201cLong-term economic plan\u201d was a favourite soundbite of the Osborne era. But Britain\u2019s economy has suffered historically weak growth over the past 14 years, after a slow recovery from the 2008 crash; then shocks including Brexit, the Covid pandemic and the cost of living crisis. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimates the UK\u2019s trend annual growth rate has fallen from 3.4% a year in the postwar period up to 1973, to 2.3% up to the 2008 financial crisis, to just 1.2% in the years since. Underinvestment Britain historically lags other advanced countries for public and private investment in the economy. However, the UK has fallen further behind since 2010 amid the impact from austerity, Brexit uncertainty and the political drama of five prime ministers in eight years. The IPPR thinktank estimates the UK has underinvested to the tune of half a trillion pounds, or 30 Elizabeth lines. Most visible in crumbling schools, hospitals and infrastructure, it argues this lack of investment is behind key reasons for lacklustre productivity gains \u2013 a key driver of economic growth. Global Britain? The narrow Brexit vote in 2016 triggered lasting economic upheaval, including tougher trade barriers with the UK\u2019s largest trading partner. The UK economy has notably underperformed other advanced countries since, with real GDP per capita barely above pre-Covid levels, at 4% above the mid-2016 level, compared with 8% in the eurozone and 15% for the US. Rather than an explosion in global trade after Brexit, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates total goods trade volumes have underperformed by about 15% compared with other economies, and relative to staying in the EU. Record increase in taxation Rising debt interest and growing demand on services from an ageing population have pushed up government spending. But sluggish economic growth has meant weak tax income for the exchequer. In response, Sunak has increased taxes, largely by stealth, to put revenues as a share of the economy on track to hit the highest level since the second world war. Sunak launched a freeze on income tax and increased corporation tax during his time as chancellor. Even after tax cuts in last year\u2019s autumn statement, and any expected cuts in next week\u2019s budget, taxes are still expected to be higher as a share of national income than when the Conservatives came to power in 2010. Flatlining wage growth A weak economy has left workers paying the price. Real wages had grown by an average of 33% a decade from 1970 to 2007, but this fell to below zero in the 2010s. In mid-2023, average pay was back at the level during the 2008 financial crisis, after taking account of inflation. This 15 years of lost wage growth is estimated by the Resolution Foundation thinktank to have cost the average work \u00a310,700 a year. The performance has been ranked as the worst period for pay growth since the Napoleonic wars ended in 1815. Food bank usage has spiralled Poverty has deepened over the past 14 years, leading to an explosion in food bank usage. From fewer than 100,000 in 2010, the number of emergency food parcels from the Trussell Trust has soared to almost 3m a year. Deep cuts to benefits and rising living costs have outweighed gains from large minimum wage increases for the lowest-income households. These cuts have reduced the incomes of poorest fifth by just under \u00a33,000 a year, according to the Resolution Foundation. This laid the ground for a deeper cost of living crisis as inflation soared after the pandemic and Russian war in Ukraine to the highest level in 41 years. Unemployment has remained low An economic bright spot since 2010 has been consistently low unemployment, matching among the lowest levels on records dating to the 1970s. The official jobless rate has fallen from about 8% in 2010 to less than 4%, with a damaging rise prevented during the Covid pandemic by the government\u2019s furlough scheme. However, the official figures obscure consistently high economic inactivity \u2013 when working-age adults are neither in a job nor looking for one. This includes a sharp increase in the number of people outside the labour market due to long-term sickness to a record high of 2.8 million. Migration has increased sharply Net immigration to the UK has surged despite Brexit and repeated government promises to reduce it. David Cameron said in early 2010 that if he won the election, he would limit net immigration to \u201ctens of thousands\u201d per year. Net immigration reached a record 745,000 in 2022. The UK population is projected to hit 70 million by mid-2026, a decade earlier than expected. Without growth in the population, and with it the UK workforce, Britain\u2019s economy would have grown at a slower pace. Official figures show GDP per head has remained stagnant or fallen for seven quarters up to the end of 2023 \u2013 the worst performance since modern records began in 1955."

            "content": "The minimum wage has driven up the pay of millions of Britain\u2019s lowest earners by \u00a36,000 a year, making it the single most successful economic policy in a generation, according to a leading thinktank. Since its introduction in 1999 by Tony Blair\u2019s first Labour administration the policy has secured cross-party agreement, and should be seen as the basis for further improvements in the welfare of low wage workers, the Resolution Foundation said. The minimum wage will increase on Monday 1 April as it rises from \u00a310.42 to \u00a311.44, in the third-highest annual change in its history \u2013 a rise of 9.8% in cash terms and 7.8% above inflation. In a study released to mark 25 years since the policy\u2019s introduction, the foundation said workers would have been \u00a36,000 a year worse off since 1999 if their pay had only risen in line with average wages rather than the increases recommended by the independent Low Pay Commission. Nye Cominetti, principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, said parliament should use a review of the commission\u2019s remit \u201cto discuss the future of the minimum wage and low pay more widely ahead of the election\u201d. He said: \u201cPoliticians should reflect on why the minimum wage has been so successful \u2013 such as the combination of long-term political direction and independent, expert-led oversight \u2013 and whether this approach could be broadened to tackle some of the UK\u2019s other low pay challenges.\u201d The foundation said MPs should consider how the level of statutory sick pay had fallen in relation to average wages and could be brought under the umbrella of the commission. Some critics of the minimum wage have argued it is too high while others believe it has not risen fast enough to reduce poverty in the UK. The Living Wage Foundation charity operates the real living wage, which sets a minimum \u00a312 an hour wage across the UK and \u00a313.15 in London. It is aimed at UK workers aged 18 and over but it is not a legal requirement, and businesses choose whether to pay it. The charity says more than 460,000 employees working for 14,000 firms currently receive the real living wage. A report by the International Monetary Fund on the effect of minimum wages across developed and developing countries found that \u201cresearch spanning several decades has not settled the debate\u201d. It said that some studies found a minimum wage had significant benefits for workers while \u201cothers conclude that it is harmful. Many studies have been inconclusive\u201d. The Resolution Foundation said analysis of the UK showed that between 1980 and 1998, hourly pay growth in the UK was twice as fast for the highest earners as it was for the lowest earners \u2013 3.1% versus 1.4% a year. \u201cBut since 1999 this trend has reversed, and hourly pay inequality has fallen with pay growth for the lowest earners five times that seen by the highest earners \u2013 1.6% versus 0.3 per cent per year,\u201d it said."

She is across the street from \u201cHotel 583\u201d, a makeshift shelter in a dangerous part of downtown Manaus, the capital of Amazonas in Brazil. On the second floor of the building, in the Cidade de Deus slum, 20 of the 27 Warao people who live here cram into a sweltering room measuring about 20 sq metres. Some sleep on the floor, while the more fortunate are in hammocks. The children\u2019s stomachs are swollen, the effect of parasites, and their skin is covered in rashes. Warao people are crowded into a makeshift building in the Cidade de Deus slum The second-largest Indigenous community in Venezuela, with about 41,000 members, the Warao are increasingly making the dangerous trek to neighbouring Brazil, fleeing famine and their own country\u2019s economic and political crisis. Since the early 2010s, Venezuela has experienced economic, social and humanitarian turmoil, causing many residents to leave for neighbouring countries. More than 6 million people \u2013 more than 20% of the population \u2013 have fled, one of the largest exoduses in Latin America ever. The Warao people are no exception. About 7,000 Indigenous Venezuelans have entered Brazil since 2014, amid more than 560,000 Venezuelans, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Far from the lush forests of north-eastern Venezuela and southern Guyana, where they once lived a traditional lifestyle, the Warao \u2013 whose name means \u201cboat people\u201d \u2013 now survive on one meal a day. Often, it\u2019s a meagre portion of fish and rice. \u201cFor the rest of the day, the children\u2019s stomachs are soothed with sugar water,\u201d says a distraught mother. Warao men in a room shared by more than 20 people. Some sleep in hammocks, others on the ground Alexa Garc\u00eda in her small room, left, and her cousin Paulito Garc\u00eda, right. Alexa says the children cry all the time. She used to work with traditional handicrafts but now she doesn\u2019t have the money for the material Like many people in the shelter, Paulito Garc\u00eda, 49, left the Orinoco delta in north-eastern Venezuela to come to Manaus. This river labyrinth covers 25,000 sq km and includes more than 300 canals. He remembers the banana plants, sugar cane and cassava he grew there. \u201cI fished, I sold fish, I planted for our consumption and sale, and the women sold handicrafts,\u201d he says. \u201cNature gave us everything.\u201d In Mariusa, his local village, Garc\u00eda was a \u201ccacique\u201d, a village chief. Despite this responsibility, he left his community in 2017 for better opportunities as medical supplies dried up in a national healthcare crisis. \u201cWe had no more fuel for our boats that we used every day, even for fishing or going to the hospital, no more access to anything,\u201d he says. The Indigenous Venezuelans live in a poor and dangerous part of Manaus He travelled hundreds of miles by boat, and bus, and on foot, first reaching Pacaraima in Brazil, then arriving in Manaus months later. Now he shares a 5 sq metre room with his wife and six children. \u201cIn my community, we saw children dying from diarrhoea and fever, and it was impossible to find an aspirin. We felt too vulnerable staying there,\u201d he says. The other Warao continue to call him \u201cthe cacique\u201d as a sign of respect. When Venezuelan migration began, the Brazilian government built shelters and adopted legislative measures to promote the integration of Indigenous communities. The constitutional protection reserved for Indigenous Brazilians now apply to Indigenous people from all countries. The Waraos are, therefore, legal refugees in Brazil. But most of the Warao have no permanent job in Brazil. Some men unload fishing boats and get a few fish in exchange, but most speak only a few words of Portuguese; hardly any have studied. To pay their rent, they are reduced to begging. \u201cAt first, institutions and associations came to help us, such as ACNUR [UNHCR], but then our situation ceased to be considered an emergency,\u201d says Garc\u00eda. This community\u2019s dream is to obtain land to farm in Brazil. Wilmer Mart\u00ednez, 33, also from Mariusa village, lives in the room next door. He decided to travel to Manaus in 2022. He brought his own four children, as well as a newborn belonging to another family from his community, who had tried to give him away three times because of the economic situation. Nearby, Mauco, two, has a swollen stomach and is vomiting. The adopted child needs anti-parasite treatment that is too expensive for the Mart\u00ednez family. \u201cWe\u2019ve been abandoned here,\u201d Mart\u00ednez says. The Warao people believe that everything in nature has a spirit, but the children see little of the natural world now Fish are grilled on the shelter\u2019s rooftop. The house is overcrowded with people who have little or no source of income Warao communities dot the Amazonas region. About 800 Indigenous Venezuelans live in Manaus, mostly in the Cidade de Deus slum. Daisy P\u00e9rez, 42, has never seen such miserable conditions and has been going door to door for help with no luck. She is one of the few members of her Warao community to have completed higher education, and migrated to Brazil in 2017. The former teacher has a good command of Spanish and is proficient in Portuguese, making her the de facto representative of the Warao group. Like some of the Warao refugees in Brazil, P\u00e9rez had already moved within Venezuela, first going to Caracas in 2009 to seek treatment for her mother\u2019s cancer. A young girl in the street outside the shelter Multiple migrations are common for the Warao. These groups were first displaced in the 1960s to make room for hydrologic projects that diverted their water supply. Epidemics such as cholera, malaria and measles began to appear around the same time, forcing some people to leave their villages. However, the current economic crisis, which caused Venezuela\u2019s economy to contract and the inflation rate to increase to more than 63,000% in 2018, caused the most recent wave of Warao migration in search of better economic opportunities. Far away from their homes, the Warao remain attached to their traditions. Whenever possible, P\u00e9rez travels to the nearby mountains to pick moriche, a palm fruit symbolising the tree of life in Warao culture. This fruit is eaten, and its trunk and leaves are used to build canoes, palm houses and baskets, which women sell. Daisy P\u00e9rez (right) is a teacher who moved to Manaus in 2017. She volunteers to help other Warao people improve their standard of living Like many, P\u00e9rez left Venezuela due to the healthcare crisis. Her niece suffered from respiratory failure and could not be treated due to the lack of hospital beds in Caracas. \u201cI told myself that staying there meant not fighting for my children\u2019s future,\u201d says the mother of four. \u201cIt was either leave or wait to see our children starve. Any place was better than Venezuela at that moment.\u201d P\u00e9rez travelled by canoe from her village to the capital of Delta Amacuro, Tucupita. She then completed the journey to Boa Vista, Brazil, by bus and on foot. Hearing that Manaus had shelters for the Warao, she ended up there, along with her sisters and parents. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see myself leaving my parents there with nothing, alone, without being able to help them,\u201d says P\u00e9rez. Like her parents, many older community members have joined their families in Manaus. Pilar, 77, proudly wears her nagua (a traditional dress) as she makes a wicker basket at the Cidade de Deus in the room she rents. Her whole life has been one of displacement: she fled her village with her parents due to flooding, and her community was hit by a wave of cholera in 1994 that forced her to move again. In 2016, she made her way to Brazil to join her daughters. Pilar, 77, has been displaced her whole life \u201cI\u2019ll be a Warao until I die, even if I have to migrate again. All I need is land,\u201d she says. \u201cBut what about the children? Most of them don\u2019t even go to school, and all our traditions are being lost. They won\u2019t know how to fish or navigate in the forest. What will their future be here?\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-16T20:00:13Z",
            "content": "It was easy, during his 18 fruitless months at Manchester City, to be seduced by the idea that Kalvin Phillips was a fine player and all he needed was to start playing again. And then he did start playing again and, having started the 3-1 win over Italy in October and been called up for the games against Malta and North Macedonia in November, he was left out of the squad Gareth Southgate announced on Thursday to face Brazil and Belgium. \u201cHis form just hasn\u2019t been good enough,\u201d Southgate said, and that\u2019s hard to deny. Three minutes into Phillips\u2019s West Ham debut, against Bournemouth, his weak back-pass gifted Dominic Solanke a goal. Twelve minutes after coming off the bench for his second appearance, he was dispossessed, leading to a goal for Manchester United. Two games after that, he was sent off against Nottingham Forest when, five minutes after being booked for a needless shove, he committed a daft challenge on Morgan Gibbs-White. It was excruciating. It got to the point where every second on the pitch was like a slasher horror, watching through your fingers as a likable character sneaks along a dark corridor in the empty school, knowing that at some point, the music will screech as a shadow crosses the screen and torchlight glints off an exposed blade. Even if there have been no calamitous mistakes this month, the statistics really aren\u2019t good: 287 minutes played over eight games in which West Ham have scored three goals and conceded six. The 3-1 win at Everton is the only time the match situation has improved for West Ham in his time on the pitch. And yet he is clearly an extremely talented footballer. What impressed most when he emerged at Leeds under Marcelo Bielsa wasn\u2019t just his range of passing, but the speed with which he would play the pass. He seemingly had a preternatural capacity to assess the disposition of teammates and opponents on the pitch and then choose his option. He played every game for England at Euro 2020 and nobody thought it an aberration that he was named England men\u2019s player of the year for 2020-21. Southgate was keen to talk up the possibility of a way back. \u201cHe just needs to find that rhythm and confidence. There\u2019s a player in there, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll find that.\u201d Phillips is only 28. There is still time and what is encouraging is that David Moyes also seems to believe that, giving him minutes at the end of every match to try to refamiliarise himself with the game. It\u2019s obviously far from ideal to make only two league starts in 18 months at what should be the peak of your career, but players do come back from lean spells or poor transfers. The question is more what went wrong at City. There has been no suggestion that Phillips was anything other than diligent and professional. Although Pep Guardiola did criticise him for returning overweight after the World Cup, he later apologised and Phillips has explained he missed his target by 1.5kg, largely because of an injury and breakdown in communication about exactly when he was expected back. It has become habitual to praise City for their acuity in recruitment. Football could handle owners with extraordinarily deep pockets because they tended to be megalomaniacs who understood celebrity better than the game. The model fell apart with City because they weren\u2019t just rich but smart. They appointed the best coach in the world and built a club to his specifications. They signed exceptionally well. There were the occasional signings who didn\u2019t quite work out \u2013 Danilo, Ferran Torres, Angeli\u00f1o \u2013 but no real flops. It took players time to settle and adapt to Guardiola\u2019s methods and the assumption at first was that Phillips was one of them, not helped by the shoulder injury he suffered early on that required surgery. But gradually it became apparent that Guardiola saw no future for him. Signed for an initial \u00a342m, Phillips\u2019s only two league starts came in May last year when the title was wrapped up and players were being rested for the FA Cup and Champions League finals. So what had gone wrong? Even allowing for the fact that Phillips had suffered a slight decline in form towards the end of his final season at Leeds, why did City sign a player in whom Guardiola seemed to have so little faith? (It\u2019s possible similar questions might be asked about Matheus Nunes, signed for an initial \u00a353m last summer and seen only rarely, although even he has made six league starts; it\u2019s also possible he may be undergoing some sort of reprogramming \u2013 with Guardiola in the first season it\u2019s never easy to tell.) It may be that Phillips proved unable to absorb Guardiola\u2019s tactical instructions \u2013 although given he could handle Bielsa\u2019s, that seems unlikely. It may be there was a personality clash with Guardiola but, while the manager has certainly fallen out with players before, his recent tone in discussing Phillips has tended to be of sadness rather than irritation. It seems rather that there was some sort of breakdown in the City model, that they signed a player their manager didn\u2019t really want; from their point of view the only positive is that at least he wasn\u2019t playing well for one of their rivals. In that sense, Phillips seems an unfortunate victim of the cold economic reality of modern football. To force his way into England\u2019s squad for the Euros would require a remarkable upturn in form, even though, as Southgate said, England \u201cdon\u2019t have many players of that profile\u201d and \u201ca good version of him is an important player for us\u201d. His ideal, perhaps, would be Phillips sitting deep, spraying passes around, releasing Declan Rice to drive on as he has recently for Arsenal alongside Jorginho. For now, though, it\u2019s almost like rehab after a lengthy injury. Before thinking of England, Phillips needs to get back playing regularly, needs to become comfortable on a pitch again, has to remember what it is to be a player. What he achieved under Leeds showed he has the ability; after a difficult 18 months, it\u2019s a question of unlocking it again."

            "date": "2024-03-20T22:48:27Z",
            "content": "Reddit will enter a new era as a publicly traded company with a market value of $6.4bn after the social media platform\u2019s initial public offering was priced at $34 per share. The price, announced late on Wednesday, came in at the top of the target range set by Reddit\u2019s investment bankers as they spent the past few weeks gauging investor demand for the stock. It sets the stage for Reddit\u2019s shares to begin trading Thursday on the New York stock exchange under the ticker symbol RDDT in the largest initial public offering by a social media company in years. The platform, which is hoping to raise $748m, is set to sell 22m shares. The company\u2019s latest $6.4bn valuation is a drop from 2021, when it was valued at $10bn during a private funding round. Reddit\u2019s IPO was four to five times oversubscribed before it debuted, Reuters reported, a positive sign that it would reach its desired valuation. Its largest shareholder is Advance Publications, the parent company of Cond\u00e9 Nast, which owns such popular magazines as the New Yorker, Vogue and Wired. Reddit has recorded a net loss in each year since its debut in 2005, including losing $90.8m last year. But the company\u2019s approximately 267 million weekly average users and troves of posts have turned it into one of the largest social networks and content platforms, leading investor interest, though it never evolved to the same level of global dominance as a company like Meta. The company\u2019s IPO filing revealed that it had about 1bn posts and more than 100,000 active subreddits. The IPO comes as Reddit has sought to cut down on its yearly losses and find new revenue opportunities, including striking a deal with Google to let the tech giant train its artificial intelligence models on Reddit users\u2019 posts. Reddit\u2019s vast amounts of user-generated data has made it an attractive target for companies seeking to improve the functions of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini. Investors and Reddit executives expressed concern in the lead up to the IPO that some of the platform\u2019s users may attempt to negatively affect the stock price. A small portion of Reddit\u2019s IPO was reserved for some of the site\u2019s own users, including the unpaid moderators who oversee subreddits. The owners of these shares are not under any obligation to hold them for a period of time, and could immediately sell them off. Reddit chief executive Steve Huffman\u2019s attempts to increase revenue over the past year have at times caused backlash from the platform\u2019s users and moderators. Thousands of the platform\u2019s online communities, known as subreddits, shut down last year during a mass protest over Huffman\u2019s decision to start charging for access to the site\u2019s application programming interface. Huffman\u2019s choice hobbled free, popular third-party tools that enhanced the experience of browsing Reddit. Some users said the protest affected the culture of the social network for the worse, though user numbers returned to normal in the aftermath."

            "date": "2024-03-09T17:00:36Z",
            "content": "One of the consistent themes of the Conservative economic narrative is an admiration for the US and its ability to grow quickly. The way it has bounced back from the pandemic and how it has ridden out the impact of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine should serve as a blueprint. A neoliberal Conservative analysis puts the emphasis on tech, innovation and a myth-like entrepreneurial spirit that the UK would do well to emulate. What it ignores is the way the US economy zips ahead on fantastical stock market valuations and off-balance-sheet accounting reminiscent of the years before the 2008 financial crisis. And how both these habits could bite back in a big way, much as they did in 2008, and pretty soon. While Europe wrestles in a largely transparent fashion with the fallout of deindustrialisation and an ageing workforce with high levels of welfare and state subsidies (giving rightwing commentators all the ammunition they need to knock slow-moving social democratic societies), the US hides many of its problems. One of those costs is a looming insurance crisis chronicled by analysts at Bloomberg. It is an off-balance-sheet exercise that ranks alongside student loans and public service pensions for its sheer size, but outranks them for the nightmarish instability of the whole scheme. The financial data provider has documented the switch by millions of homeowners from private insurers to a \u201clast resort\u201d state-run insurer in areas affected by the climate crisis and the hurricanes, wildfires and floods that rising temperatures bring. Those plans have more than doubled their market share since 2018, and their liabilities crossed the $1tn threshold for the first time in 2022, according to Property Insurance Plans Service Office, a research company that tracks the programmes. Critics of the way private insurers have offloaded liabilities worry that even a modest wave of claims in any of these states will overwhelm the finances of the scheme. Still, one could argue that when this happens, it will be the US government that picks up the tab, keeping a bad problem relatively self-contained. A looming banking crisis may not be so easy to stop at the border. Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that US banks were at risk from the impact of high interest rates on the value of commercial property. Office blocks that have seen their value soar in the last 15 years are now seriously underwater, financially speaking. Analysts have been worried for some time about the huge liabilities on bank balance sheets, but the lack of demand for office space, as a result of the trend for working from home, means a crisis is now imminent. We all remember how the sub-prime residential property markets of California, Florida and many other US states became a bubble after several years of aggressive mortgage selling to people with low incomes. It burst, triggering the 2008 financial crisis, after a series of interest rate rises meant the mortgages were unaffordable and owners handed back the keys. The IMF said a \u201csizable subgroup\u201d of banks were in trouble, \u201cwith fears that the failure of one institution could precipitate a broader loss of confidence in the sector\u201d. It added: \u201cBeyond the unrealised losses due to higher interest, the credit risk carried by some institutions, particularly their exposure to corporate real estate, is at the centre stage of investors\u2019 fears today.\u201d Staff at the credit rating agency S&amp;P have also signalled concerns about high interest rates, though they make a separate point, saying rising debt bills could trigger a wave of corporate failures in the US next year. At a recent briefing, some of the agency\u2019s analysts said thousands of companies had hedged their interest rate exposure, betting that they could refinance when rates fell back. What if rates only tick down gently? These companies will find their loans unaffordable and go bust. Central bank governors in the US, eurozone and UK are expected to cut the cost of borrowing slowly this year. Possibly too slowly. Another concern is the exuberance seen in US stock markets. Could it be that increases in share values over the last two years, pushing the US S&amp;P 500 to a record high, constitute a speculative bubble and a rout is imminent? A great admirer of the US, Rishi Sunak appears to believe the UK would be well placed sitting in Washington\u2019s slipstream. That means loosening the constraints on financial companies and banks, letting them join the dash for profit, while running down the capacity of public services, including health. It also means becoming more dependent on foreign investment and imports of essential goods from countries that have lax health and safety laws, weaker workers\u2019 rights and more autocratic or unstable governments. Whatever kind of potential shock you care to think about \u2013 health, financial or trade \u2013 the UK is becoming more, not less, vulnerable."

            "content": "The UK\u2019s largest shares-focused investment fund has been downgraded by a leading ratings firm after a \u201cnumber of missteps\u201d by the star stock-picker Terry Smith. Morningstar demoted the \u00a335bn Fundsmith Equity fund\u2019s rating from gold to silver, saying the manager\u2019s ill-timed sale of shares in large companies including Amazon and the software firm Adobe had hurt performance. The downgrade will be a further blow for Smith. Fundsmith profits tumbled 14% to \u00a350m in the year to March 2023, according to the latest available filings, as customers started to pull money from the fund. The decline in profits resulted in Smith\u2019s pay falling for the first time since 2016, to \u00a331.1m, down from \u00a336.4m a year earlier. Daniel Haydon, a Morningstar analyst, said in the ratings firm\u2019s report: \u201cWhile Smith\u2019s careful sell discipline has long been an edge, some questions have become apparent more recently.\u201d Smith has admitted to bad timing in relation to the sale of four major stocks, the report noted. \u201cIn some cases (Adobe and Amazon.com) \u2013 having seen their share prices rise significantly after selling \u2013 he now thinks he acted too soon despite feeling his fundamental analysis stacked up at the time,\u201d it said. \u201cIn retrospect, he wished he had better incorporated thematic tailwinds relating to artificial intelligence. Elsewhere, he waited too long to make full sales of Est\u00e9e Lauder and PayPal, and this hurt performance.\u201d \u201cFor a high-conviction fund of 20-30 stocks that trades infrequently, this is a number of missteps,\u201d the report added. Smith, who grew up in Forest Gate, east London in 1960s, has long been one of the UK\u2019s most popular fund managers, delivering stellar returns that left many hailing him as Britain\u2019s answer to Warren Buffett. Fundsmith, which Smith founded in 2010, runs the UK\u2019s largest stock-focused investment fund and manages \u00a335bn on behalf of clients ranging from small savers to big institutions. Smith moved his operations to Mauritius in 2014. Commenting on Morningstar\u2019s downgrade, Fundsmith said the fund continued to outperform global benchmarks on a historical basis. The company said: \u201cWe have made it clear from the outset that we do not expect our strategy, or indeed any strategy, to outperform the market or even make a positive return in all reporting periods and market conditions. \u201cWe think that investors should judge our returns over the long term, and since inception Fundsmith Equity is up 596% or 15.7% on an annualised basis, net of fees, compared with 11.8% for the benchmark MSCI World. Looking over the last three years, Fundsmith Equity outperformed the average return delivered by funds in the IA [Investment Association] global sector.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 2 April 2024. Fundsmith profits fell to \u00a350m in the year to March 2023, not to \u00a350bn. It manages \u00a335bn on behalf of clients, not \u00a325bn. And due to an error introduced during editing, an earlier version said that the Fundsmith Equity fund was up 11.8% annually since its inception, once fees are stripped out; the correct figure is 15.7%."

            "date": "2024-03-01T17:18:10Z",
            "content": "Two of the largest pharmacy chains in the US, CVS and Walgreens, will start selling the abortion pill mifepristone on prescription at stores in several US states later this month, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing interviews with officials at both companies. Joe Biden quickly applauded the decision, issuing a statement from the White House hailing an \u201cimportant milestone\u201d in maintaining access to the pill and encouraged other pharmacies to pursue similar options. \u201cWith major retail pharmacy chains newly certified to dispense medication abortion, many women will soon have the option to pick up their prescription at a local, certified pharmacy \u2013 just as they would for any other medication,\u201d the US president said. \u201cThe stakes could not be higher for women across America,\u201d he added. The two pharmacy chains will not be providing the medicine by mail, the newspaper reported. In the coming weeks, CVS will begin filling prescriptions for the abortion medication mifepristone in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the Times reported. The pharmacy chain said it received certification to dispense the medication in states where abortion is still legal. And CVS intended to add those states to its distribution \u201con a rolling basis\u201d, chain spokeswoman Amy Thibault said to the Associated Press. Meanwhile, Walgreens will begin providing the pill in a select number of pharmacies in California, New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Illinois. \u201cWe are beginning a phased rollout in select locations to allow us to ensure quality, safety and privacy for our patients, providers and team members,\u201d a Walgreens spokesperson, Fraser Engerman, told the Times. Although both chains have plans to expand dispensing of the medication to other states where it is legally permissible, they have held off on expanding access where abortion bans are in place, the Times reported. The latest news comes as Republican-led states have widely blocked access to abortion since the US supreme court in 2022 overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision making access to abortion a national right in the US. Last December, the supreme court agreed to hear oral arguments in a case about abortion medication. The decision of that case, set for this summer, could further challenge access to mifepristone. It was 2000 when the FDA approved mifepristone to terminate pregnancies of up to 10 weeks, when used with a second drug, misoprostol. Labeling from the FDA for more than 20 years limited dispensing to a subset of specialty offices and clinics, due to safety concerns. Mifepristone is taken first to dilate the cervix and block the hormone progesterone, which is needed to sustain a pregnancy. Misoprostol is taken 24 to 48 hours later, causing the uterus to contract and expel pregnancy tissue. CVS has nearly 9,400 stores in the US. Walgreens has about 8,700.

            "date": "2024-03-27T14:00:24Z",
            "content": "Ricardo Lopez\u2019s taqueria is famous for a melt-in-your-mouth birria recipe that takes three days to prepare. Every week, hundreds of customers flock to La Vaca Birria in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District for a taste of the slow-braised beef served over rice and beans or tucked into a crispy taco with a side of rich dipping broth. Lopez recently hiked the price of his signature birria burrito to $22, an eye-popping figure even in the pricey city. The move rankled some customers, with one posting a scathing review that expressed disbelief at how the burrito\u2019s price had doubled from $11 just two years ago. In a detailed response that quickly went viral, Lopez argued that the price tag was justified due to the runaway costs of ingredients such as beef and onion, as well as rising labor costs. His plea felt like a microcosm of the pain experienced by restaurant owners across the US as food prices remain stubbornly high despite cooling inflation. Many items have yet to return to pre-pandemic prices, leaving small food businesses \u2013 already operating on thin margins \u2013 with limited options beyond passing the increase to customers. Lopez, 31, talked to Guardian about the factors that helped push his burritos from $11 to $18 to $22, and why he hopes \u201cevery damn Mexican restaurant in the Bay area raises their prices\u201d. Rising costs When Lopez went back to his food order receipts from mid-2021, and compared them with his recent orders, he found many items whose prices had risen and, in some cases, almost doubled. He shared the receipts with the Guardian to verify the prices; for some items, he could not find receipts from 2021, so we relied on his memory of the price. (These prices are different from his Instagram estimates, since they\u2019re based on different dates.) Behind the cost increases The rising costs of ingredients are driven by some major geopolitical events, from droughts in the midwest and Texas to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Continuing droughts have encouraged ranchers to shrink the size of their cattle herds, said Ted Schroeder, an agricultural economist at Kansas State University, thus reducing supply and driving up price. At one point in recent years, \u201cclose to 60%\u201d of US cattle grazing lands were experiencing significant drought, he said. The wholesale price of beef is up 46% over the past three years, Schroeder said, and beef prices are expected to remain near record highs. The Black Sea region, where Russia meets Ukraine, is a major source of the world\u2019s grain supply, but another major crop in Ukraine is sunflowers, which are used to make popular cooking oils, said Ricky Volpe, a food supply chain economist at California Polytechnic State University. The war has pushed the price of kitchen oil up, as well as having effects on global supplies of wheat and petroleum. The jump in Lopez\u2019s estimated onion prices was a bit of a head-scratcher, Volpe said, and might be specific to a particular supplier, since overall onion costs weren\u2019t up that much. The broader reasons behind price inflation continue to be debated, with some US researchers and politicians arguing that the country is experiencing \u201cgreedflation\u201d, propelled by companies deciding to turn customers\u2019 willingness to pay higher prices during the pandemic into ongoing profits. \u201cAfter Covid, everything skyrocketed first, and then everything lowered,\u201d Lopez said. But \u201cnothing has gone down to pre-Covid pricing, which is hard to understand being anything besides greed\u201d. How do you solve the price of a burrito? While overall food prices have gone up sharply in the past few years, Volpe said, they haven\u2019t jumped as much as the 100% increase in La Vaca Birria\u2019s burrito. One possibility, he said, was that Lopez\u2019s small business might have been charging too little in the beginning and operating at a loss. Lopez said that Volpe was right: to attract people to his recently opened business, he had tried to keep the price of his food as low as possible, worried that people would not try something new that was also pricey. In November 2023, Lopez wrote on Instagram, his business account was overdrawn. Then, just days later, a San Francisco Chronicle reviewer crowned La Vaca Birria the best burrito in the Mission district, the heart of the city\u2019s Mexican food scene, and customers tripled overnight. The first thing Lopez did after the glowing review wasn\u2019t raise his prices: it was lower the commission he was offering to food delivery apps in exchange for displaying his restaurant more prominently on their sites. But in December 2023, still feeling the squeeze, he raised the burrito price from $18 to $20. Then, in early March 2024, he raised it again. As one commenter pointed out, $22 is not the price of a burrito you can eat every day. And that\u2019s \u201ccompletely correct\u201d, Lopez said. \u201cWe do not see ourselves as an everyday burrito.\u201d Higher-volume businesses in the Mission such as the burrito-slinging institution El Farolito might have a smaller profit margin per burrito, but they reliably serve thousands of customers a day. Lopez is serving closer to 200 customers on a good day and is still building name recognition. There is no way a small business, especially a one-location store like Lopez\u2019s, can compete with big chains on the cost of their food, Volpe, the food chain economist, said. So deciding to offer a more expensive, high-quality product is the most rational choice. Another unique factor of La Vaca Birria\u2019s burrito math is that Lopez has a Muslim business partner and the restaurant serves all-halal meat. That means they attract enthusiastic Muslim customers from as far as Sacramento, but also that they don\u2019t serve pork, which, at about $2 a pound, is substantially cheaper than beef, Lopez says. While other Mexican restaurants can make higher margins on their pork al pastor or carnitas burritos, he said, La Vaca Birria doesn\u2019t have that option. What is good Mexican food worth? The debate over the $22 burrito has raised questions about whose cuisine is allowed to be expensive. With Italian food, customers \u201cdon\u2019t have an issue\u201d with paying $22 for pasta al pomodoro, Lopez pointed out, even though the dish is relatively cheap to make: canned tomatoes, dried or fresh pasta, and just a few other ingredients. So when it comes to a $22 burrito, Lopez asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d Preparing his birria is an intensive, three-day process, based on a recipe inherited from his grandfather. It takes an hour just to clean the seeds and the stems from the dried chillis for the spice mix that flavors it. The beef is marinated overnight, then braised in the oven at a low temperature for six hours, and then has to chill in the fridge for a full day. At the end, scrubbing the beef pans can take another hour. Lopez says he\u2019s seen many Mexican and Chinese restaurants avoid raising prices because the cuisine is valued for offering cheap and takeout meals. \u201cThe Chinese and Mexican restaurants have not been increasing prices along with inflation,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m barely seeing some restaurants where the burrito is $15. It should have been that two years ago.\u201d After multiple television stations did segments on La Vaca Birria\u2019s $22 burrito, Lopez says, the restaurant received angry phone calls including one who told them to \u201cget the f*** out of his country\u201d and another calling him an idiot. Some of the backlash appears racist: Lopez said that a Black baker in San Francisco who sells $18 loaves of sourdough talked about facing similar criticism after being named one of the country\u2019s most creative new bakeries by Bon App\u00e9tit. Lopez says that in the eyes of some, restaurateurs of color may be allowed to innovate, but \u201cpeople don\u2019t think it should be worth any more than a certain price point\u201d. But many of the comments on Lopez\u2019s Instagram posts about rising costs have been unexpectedly positive, with people across industries saying that the challenges of inflation have resonated with them. He said the controversy had doubled the number of customers coming in to try La Vaca Birria\u2019s specialties. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of business,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople, at least in San Francisco, have definitely come out to support.\u201d Illustrations by Rita Liu; development by Andrew Witherspoon"

            "content": "Macmillan Cancer Support, one of Britain\u2019s biggest and best known charities, is planning to axe 150 jobs \u2013 one in 14 of its workforce \u2013 saying that it is getting harder to raise money to cover rising demand for its help due to increasing numbers of people living with cancer. The charity, whose services play a vital role in local NHS provision, spends \u00a3250m a year funding about 11,000 specialist cancer nurses and care workers and providing financial, practical and emotional support and advice to the public, including thousands of \u00a3200 grants to patients needing help with energy and travel costs. Macmillan is an established part of the UK\u2019s voluntary fabric and traditionally one of its most effective and popular fundraisers, consistently pulling in more than \u00a3200m a year from legacies and money raised by tens of thousands of participants in events ranging from marathons, hikes and bike rides to its signature coffee mornings. But its heavy reliance on charity fundraising has been exposed by soaring inflation and a surging demand for advice and support from rising numbers of people needing help to cope with the financial and psychological consequences of cancer diagnoses and long waits for NHS treatment. It said in a statement: \u201cLike many organisations, Macmillan has felt the impact of a difficult financial environment. It is getting harder to raise money, and inflation means it costs more to do the same as we did a few years ago. We are tackling these challenges by transforming, so we can have more impact for people with cancer, but without relying on raising more money to be able to do that. \u201cThis has meant taking the difficult decision to reduce the size of the organisation and sadly means we must make some valued colleagues redundant. We are taking these difficult decisions, and building a new strategy to ensure Macmillan is in the best possible position to provide the vital support people living with cancer need now and long into the future.\u201d A Macmillan spokesperson said it had sought to \u201cminimise the impact\u201d of the cuts on beneficiaries living with cancer. While the job losses were organisation-wide, they would not hit staff providing advice and support direct to the public. The vast majority of the clinicians it funds are employed by the NHS. The move has shocked the voluntary sector because the biggest charities have been largely resilient to the cost of living crisis, unlike smaller organisations, which are often at the mercy of donor fatigue and council funding cuts. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise. Most big charities are hiring rather than shedding jobs,\u201d one analyst said. A Macmillan staff member told the Guardian the latest round of cuts had created a \u201chorrible atmosphere\u201d and questioned whether the management had taken its eye off the ball of its core fundraising role. \u201cA lot of good people will be losing their jobs,\u201d they said. \u201cIt\u2019s all pretty grim.\u201d The job losses come three years after Macmillan Cancer Support culled 300 jobs during the pandemic, as it prepared to lose tens of millions of pounds in income as a result of the lockdown cancellation of thousands of fundraising events. Although fundraising income picked up after the Covid lockdowns ended, the charity faces underlying financial challenges. It spent more than it made in donations in four out of the past five years, and has more than once drawn heavily on dwindling financial reserves to balance its books and meet the rising demand for services. Its latest financial accounts for the year to 31 December 2022, published in October, showed the charity\u2019s income had dipped from \u00a3231m to \u00a3227m, partly as a result of declining donations as rising living costs hit donor pockets. At the same time, spending on staff, overheads, grants and services rose to \u00a3252m. Of Macmillan\u2019s income, 97% comes via fundraising and legacies. It raised \u00a3204m this way in 2022, down \u00a36m year-on-year, and lower than pre-Covid levels. Fundraising is understood to have flatlined over the past year. Macmillan Cancer Support has topped YouGov\u2019s annual charity rankings \u2013 that measure which charities the public would be most likely to donate to \u2013 for 11 years in a row, ahead of other household names such as Cancer Research UK and the British Heart Foundation. The charity\u2019s chief executive, Gemma Peters, who joined just over a year ago, has described Macmillan\u2019s culture as \u201cquite clunky, siloed and a bit too hierarchical\u201d. She last year launched a major strategy review to re-examine its role, structure and priorities, including its heavy reliance on charity fundraising. Sarah Vibert, the chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said: \u201cCharities of all sizes are facing a triple threat of record demand, falling income and rising operational costs \u2013 with none of these showing signs of letting up anytime soon.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-15T18:01:13Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak will accept an inflation-busting 5.5% increase in his salary for being an MP, No 10 has indicated. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) has recommended MPs\u2019 salaries rise to \u00a391,346 in April, from \u00a386,584. The uplift is higher than the rate of consumer price inflation, which was 4% in January. It is significantly more than the 2.9% increase that MPs received last year, against what Ipsa called an extremely difficult backdrop. Asked whether Sunak would accept the pay rise, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said all Commons ministers would receive the rise awarded by Ipsa. The independent watchdog, established in 2009 after the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal, said the pay uplift was in line with one recently agreed for the senior civil service. Sunak\u2019s spokesperson said government ministers had opted not to accept increases to their ministerial salaries, which are separate. No 10 said: \u201cFor the government\u2019s part, I would point out that ministers are already voluntarily waiving part of their salaries, forgoing any pay increase to their ministerial salaries, which means that salaries of ministers in the Commons have not increased since 2010.\u201d According to government data, the prime minister\u2019s salary in 2022-23, the financial year in which Sunak entered office, was \u00a380,807, of which \u00a375,440 was accepted. This sum is paid on top of the salary the prime minister receives for being an MP. A summary of Sunak\u2019s taxable UK income published by No 10 last month showed he paid more than \u00a3500,000 in tax in 2022-23 from an income of \u00a32.2m. The prime minister made \u00a31.8m in capital gains, up from \u00a31.6m in 2021-22, and received \u00a3290,000 in other interest and dividends. All of the investment income and capital gains came from a US-based investment fund listed as a blind trust, according to the summary. The \u00a3139,477 he received from his MP and prime ministerial salaries made up 7% of his income. His total earnings over the last four years are about \u00a37m. Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, whose father is a billionaire co-founder of the Indian IT company Infosys, have a combined wealth estimated at about \u00a3529m, according to 2023\u2019s Sunday Times rich list. The prime minister has faced accusations of being out of touch with people struggling with the cost of living. The Ipsa chair, Richard Lloyd, said: \u201cServing as an MP should not be reserved to those wealthy enough to fund it themselves. We believe our decision recognises the vital role MPs play in our democracy and considers the continued economic challenges facing the country. \u201cWe are committed to supporting a parliament that reflects our society, where people from all walks of life can decide to become MPs.\u201d"

            "content": "Grocery price inflation in Great Britain has slowed to 4.5%, its lowest level since February 2022, but one in four households are still struggling financially, retail researchers have found. However, the figures also suggest a change in sentiment with upmarket retailers Waitrose and Ocado the only grocers to win new shoppers in the past three months, according to the latest monthly figures from the analysts Kantar, as growth in more expensive branded groceries outstripped supermarket own-label. Ocado was the fastest-growing brand, according to Kantar, as price cuts helped the online grocery specialist recover from a post-pandemic slump. In a separate trading statement issued on Tuesday, Ocado Retail reported a near 11% rise in sales to \u00a3645m in the three months to 3 March, underpinned by an 8% rise in the number of items sold after introducing more Marks &amp; Spencer branded items and matching Tesco prices on thousands of products. Hannah Gibson, the chief executive of Ocado Retail which is a joint venture between M&amp;S and technology group Ocado, said the market was stabilising, with shoppers prepared to spend on treats but offsetting the costs by making savings on the basics. \u201cConsumers are feeling a bit more confident. They are very conscious of value but want to spend on things they enjoy,\u201d she said. Waitrose\u2019s pace of annual sales growth, at 3.9% according to Kantar, was faster than at the discounter Aldi for the first time since 2021. Aldi has been the target of price-match campaigns by Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Lidl. Only Asda, the Co-op and Iceland trailed behind Aldi\u2019s 3.1% rise in sales, with even struggling Morrisons ahead on 3.6%. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: \u201cGrocery inflation has come down significantly since hitting an eye-watering peak of 17% in March 2023. However, despite this continued slowdown, many British households are still feeling the squeeze. Twenty-three percent identified themselves as struggling financially in our data \u2013 the same proportion as reported in November last year.\u201d Lidl remains the fastest-growing high street grocer, with sales up by 8.8% helped by a 24% rise in sales of baked goods and a 11% jump in fruit, vegetables and salads. Across Great Britain, \u00a3605m more was spent on promotional deals this month than in March last year, while nearly a third of baskets across Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda collectively contained at least one product price-matched to a discounter. While sales of branded goods are now growing faster than own-label, sales of supermarkets\u2019 premium own-label lines are up by 16.1%, the quickest rate in nearly three years. This may be partly down to budget constraints easing but also points to consumers still seeking out cheaper options to big brands. Prices are falling most rapidly on key goods such as butter and milk but rose strongly on sugary sweets and chocolate confectionery before Easter, when families stock up on seasonal treats. The number of hot cross buns sold was up 15% on last year."

            "date": "2024-03-12T08:23:30Z",
            "content": "Unemployment rose and wage growth slowed in the three months to January as the UK labour market showed signs of weakness, reflecting a broader slowdown in the economy. The unemployment rate rose unexpectedly to 3.9 in January from 3.8% in December according to the Office for National Statistics, while annual average wages growth including bonuses fell to 5.6% from 5.8% in the previous month. City economists had expected unemployment to reman flat and pay growth to slow to a more modest 5.7%. Pay without bonuses also ticked lower, to 6.1% from 6.2% over the same three-month period. Employers cut back on hiring new staff, pushing the number of advertised vacancies down on the quarter by 43,000 to 908,000, indicating that the recession during the last six months of 2023 took a slightly bigger toll on the labour market than first estimated. The Bank of England has waited to see signs that wage growth is slowing before making a move to reduce interest rates, and is expected to view the latest figures as another reason to begin that process this year. However, more recent surveys have shown UK businesses regaining confidence in the economic outlook and preparing to raise prices as employees continue to receive pay rises above the rate of headline inflation, which is now 4% \u2013 still double the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. A rise in the number of people leaving the labour market, mostly due to ill-health, will also likely mean that employers struggle to find staff and wages growth falls slowly over the coming months. Tony Wilson, the director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said: \u201cIn all, there are well over half a million more people out of work than before the pandemic began. This is being driven by more young people and older people outside the labour force, and in particular because of more people reporting long-term health conditions that stop them from working. \u201cIn our view this is holding back the recovery as the economy is continuing to create jobs, with nearly a million unfilled vacancies reported today.\u201d The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the figures showed his plans to increase incomes were working. \u201cOur plan is working. Even with inflation falling, real wages have risen for the seventh month in a row. And take home pay is set for another boost thanks to our cuts to national insurance which in total are putting more than \u00a3900 a year back into the average earner\u2019s pocket,\u201d he said. Wilson said the rise in inactivity meant the government needed \u201ca different approach to how we reach and engage with people who are out of work and may want to come back to work\u201d. He added: \u201cIn particular our employment services need to be more accessible, inclusive and supportive. Employers need to play their part too, and do more to keep people in work and to open up opportunities for those who may need more support.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-13T12:08:01Z",
            "content": "A surge in high street and online spending helped Britain\u2019s economy return to growth in January, boosting hopes that the recession of late 2023 will be short-lived. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said national output \u2013 as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 rose by 0.2% in the first month of 2024, largely as a result of a sharp recovery in retail sales after December\u2019s hefty drop. The ONS said unless there were revisions to past growth figures it would now take monthly GDP falls of 0.3% in February and March for the recession to continue into the first quarter of 2024. The UK met the technical definition of recession after contracting in the third and fourth quarters of 2023. Data from the UK\u2019s official statistical body showed the 3.4% jump in retail spending was the main factor behind the 0.2% growth in the service sector in January. Higher spending on private healthcare also boosted service sector output. A pickup in housebuilding was the main factor behind a 1.1% jump in construction output, but the production sector \u2013 which includes energy, mining and manufacturing \u2013 contracted by 0.2%. The ONS cautioned against reading too much into one month\u2019s figures and said that over the three months to January, GDP was 0.1% lower than in the three months to October 2023 and was 0.2% smaller than in the three months ending in January 2023. GDP per capita remains below its pre-pandemic level. Liz McKeown, the ONS director of economic statistics, said: \u201cThe economy picked up in January with strong growth in retail and wholesaling. Construction also performed well with housebuilders having a good month, having been subdued for much of the last year.\" \u201cThese were [partly] offset by falls in TV and film production, lawyers and the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry.\u201d Financial markets had expected a pick up in activity after December\u2019s 0.1% contraction, with the consensus forecast among economists of a 0.2% increase. Although the UK will officially remain in a shallow recession at least until the GDP figures for the first quarter of 2024 are released in May, the news of the slight rebound in growth came as a relief to the government. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said in last week\u2019s budget that the economy had turned the corner after a period in which action by the Bank of England designed to tackle high inflation led to slower growth. Responding to the January GDP figures, Hunt said: \u201cWhile the last few years have been tough, today\u2019s numbers show we are making progress in growing the economy \u2013 part of which makes it possible to bring down national insurance contributions by \u00a3900 this coming year. But if we want the rate of growth to pick up more we need to make work pay which means ending the unfairness of taxing work twice.\u201d Rachel Reeves, shadow chancellor, said: \u201cAfter 14 years of economic decline under the Conservatives, Britain is worse off. Rishi Sunak\u2019s claims that his plan is working are already in tatters after Britain was hit by recession last year.\u201d In the final six months of 2023, the economy grew only once \u2013 by 0.2% in November. Every other month recorded a fall or stagnation in GDP. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said: \u201cForward looking, indicators point to further strengthening of momentum in February, bolstering the prospect that the UK experienced a short and shallow recession. Although economic performance has somewhat improved, the outlook remains relatively gloomy.\u201d Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the analystHargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe UK economy snapped back to growth in January, adding fuel to the fire of speculation that the recession will indeed be super-short and ultra-mild. \u201cThe latest snapshot showed that GDP was estimated to have come in at 0.2%, and while the economy is hardly shooting the lights out in terms of growth, there will be relief that light has emerged at the end of a difficult tunnel for many companies.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-28T13:23:21Z",
            "content": "As the UK economy struggled for momentum, with households tightening their belts, higher defence spending in the second half of last year was a factor that prevented it from contracting by more than it did. The second estimate by the Office for National Statistics of national income, as measured by gross domestic product last year, showed that extra cash for the military, and an increase in government spending more generally, masked a deep and persistent recession in manufacturing and downturns in several other sectors of the economy. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction, and the UK achieved this in the third and fourth quarters of 2023 when GDP fell by 0.1% and 0.3% respectively. Most economists have described this as a technical recession because of its shallowness and the likelihood of a swift, though equally shallow, rebound this year. However, the recession could be considered to be deeper when Britain\u2019s rising population is taken into account. GDP per head was estimated to have fallen by 0.6% in the fourth quarter and to have not grown since the first three months of 2022, the ONS said. Across 2023 as a whole, GDP per head is estimated to have fallen by 0.7% when taking into account the latest ONS assessment of migration and its impact on the number of people in the UK. One factor that illustrates the UK\u2019s longer term decline can be found in trade data published on Thursday, where it is clear that exporters have had a tough time. The difficulties stretch back to the financial crash of 2008 and the recession that came immediately afterwards. They were made worse by the lack of private investment that followed the Brexit vote in 2016 and trade restrictions with the EU since 2021. To illustrate the point, the balance of payments deficit in the first quarter of 2011 was \u00a32.9bn. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the deficit had expanded to \u00a326.3bn, or 3.9% of GDP, a widening of \u00a35.9bn from the third quarter. These figures exclude the often-volatile trade in gold and other precious metals. One of the biggest elements of the decline across the second half of last year came from the UK\u2019s trade in goods. A recent study by the ONS showed total goods exports in 2023 fell by \u00a315.2bn, or 4.6%, compared with 2022, \u201cwith substantial decreases in exports to both EU and non-EU countries\u201d. To give a comparison with the pre-pandemic period, when the international trade scene was more settled, total goods exports were down by \u00a344.7bn, or 12.4%. The rocketing price of imported raw materials and energy played a big part in the rising cost of making goods in the UK and the difficulty of selling higher priced goods abroad. As a message to the government, it emphasises how open and vulnerable the UK manufacturing sector has become to global shocks, and how the economy needs to be much more resilient. And a higher population, which brings with it higher public spending, can bolster GDP, but unless workers are able to increase their productivity, the level of GDP per head will struggle to regain 2022 levels."

            "date": "2024-03-28T11:49:28Z",
            "content": "Official figures have confirmed that the UK economy went into recession at the end of last year, after the latest estimate found it contracted in the last two quarters of 2023. In a blow to the government\u2019s economic standing, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy, as measured by gross domestic product, shrank by 0.3% in the last three months of the year, unrevised from an earlier estimate. It followed a contraction of 0.1% in the third quarter of 2023, confirming a technical recession \u2013 two consecutive quarters of negative growth. As he prepares for a general election, Rishi Sunak has been seeking to reassure Tory MPs that the economy is turning around, after business surveys showed a recovery in private sector activity in the first few months of the year. A steep fall in inflation in recent months is expected to prompt the Bank of England to start cutting interest rates this summer, easing the pressure on mortgage payers and indebted businesses. However, one of the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC), which sets interest rates eight times a year, said on Thursday that cuts \u201cwere a long way off\u201d, dampening speculation that several reductions in the cost of borrowing would take place this year. Speaking to the Financial Times, Jonathan Haskel said: \u201cAlthough the fall in headline inflation is very good news, it is not informative about what we really care about: what we really care about is the persistent and the underlying inflation. I think cuts are a long way off.\u201d The consumer prices index (CPI) fell from 4% in January to to 3.4% in February. The decrease was mainly due to declining energy and food price growth. Inflation in the services sector remained above 5%. Haskel said he was worried about the high level of wages growth. He added that interest rates should remain high until there was evidence that wages growth had settled at a lower level. The Bank\u2019s governor, Andrew Bailey, said last week that interest rate cuts were \u201cin play\u201d, adding that he was increasingly confident inflation was heading towards Threadneedle Street\u2019s 2% target after it hit a peak of 11.1% in October 2022. Financial markets expect at least three quarter point rate cuts this year. The ONS said the latest GDP estimate for the final quarter of 2023 showed all three sectors of the economy \u2013 services, production and construction \u2013 experienced falling output. The figures indicated that and a deeper recession was prevented by a rise in government spending. Services declined by a milder 0.1%, compared with a 0.2% fall in the first estimate, but without making a difference to the overall decline in the wider economy, the ONS said. Britain\u2019s trade declined and household consumption also fell despite a fall in inflation towards the end of 2023. The ONS said retail sales had the largest monthly fall in December since January 2021, when Covid-19 restrictions were in place. Ashley Webb, a UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s mild technical recession at the end of last year was as mild as previously thought and the economic recovery is probably already under way.\u201d He said the firm\u2019s forecast for the economic recovery in 2024 and 2025 was that it would be stronger than the Bank of England expects. The firm has predicted that inflation will fall further than the Bank forecasts and that interest rates will be cut faster and further than current market pricing suggests. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the ONS figures showed that Sunak had \u201cbroken his promise to grow the economy and left Britain in recession with working people paying the price. The Conservatives cannot claim that their plan is working or that they have turned the corner on more than 14 years of economic failure.\u201d The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said last year was \u201ctough\u201d after interest rates remained high to bring down inflation, but added: \u201cWe can see our plan is working. Inflation has fallen decisively from over 11% to 3.4%, the economy grew in January and real wages have increased for eight months in a row. \u201cOur cuts to national insurance will boost growth by rewarding work and putting over \u00a3900 a year back into the average earner\u2019s pocket.\u201d"

There really is no good news to find in the December GDP figures. There\u2019s a fair bit of \u201cworst since\u201d about the numbers. Take the overall calendar year. In 2023 Australia produced just 2.0% more than it did in 2022. That is the worst since the lockdown year of 2020 and just the fourth time since the 1990s recession that we did not produce over 2% more than we did the previous year: If the graph does not display click here On a per capita basis things were truly bad. 2023 was only the third time in the past 40 years that our economy was smaller when accounting for population growth than it had been the year before. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup This is not indicative of things going well. It\u2019s indicative of an economy that has been slowed to a halt by the Reserve Bank. We generally don\u2019t look at total year growth, we focus more on quarterly growth. When we take into account population, Australia\u2019s economy shrunk 0.3% in the December quarter. This was off the back of a 0.5% fall in the September quarter and a 0.2% fall in the June quarter. In the March quarter of last year it didn\u2019t fall. But it didn\u2019t grow either \u2013 growth was 0.0%. If the graph does not display click here But don\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t hear talk of an \u201cofficial recession\u201d because total GDP in the December quarter went up 0.2%. Cripes. 0.2% is not far off an error term. The economy in the December quarter last year was just 1.5% bigger than it was in the final three months of 2022. That is half the average 3% growth Australia has had since the end of the 1990s recession. The only reason anyone really cares about GDP is because there is a link between growth and unemployment. Historically we need GDP growth of about 2.5% to keep unemployment stable. If GDP grows slower than that, unemployment rises; if we get GDP growth above 2.5%, unemployment falls. So with 1.5% growth, it\u2019s not a shock that unemployment went from 3.5% in December 2022 to 3.9% in December 2023. And remember, this is what the RBA wanted. It predicted this growth in its February Statement on Monetary Policy and, worse, it predicts growth of just 1.3% in the year to June. If it gets its way, expect unemployment to keep rising. So what kept the economy growing at all in the December quarter besides population? Trade mostly \u2013 or really our lack of it. Net exports contributed 0.6 percentage points of the 0.2% growth in December. So that means, if you took away our trade, our economy shrank 0.4%. You might think that is because our exports grew. Nope. \u201cNet exports\u201d is exports minus imports. Our exports actually went down in the December quarter, but so too did our imports. We imported 3.4% less stuff in the December quarter than we did in July, August and September. And a big factor was the drop in imported consumer goods \u2013 down 5.4%. Australians stopped shopping. And businesses knew this would happen. Three months ago, when looking at the September-quarter figures, I noted that \u201cchange in inventories\u201d was the biggest contributor to growth and that was not a good thing \u201cbecause next quarter we will likely see those inventories run down as businesses decide there is not much point buying more stock given households are not spending\u201d. And, alas, that came true. In the December quarter businesses ran down the stocks of things they had to sell \u2013 because why bother building up stocks when you know people aren\u2019t buying? This reduced GDP by 0.3%pts in the December quarter: If the graph does not display click here If you take away trade and government spending, Australia\u2019s domestic private sector fell 0.5% in the December quarter. That is not healthy. And we all know it. Household consumption grew a measly 0.1% in the December quarter. And what we bought was mostly essential items \u2013 food and groceries and paying off bills. Our spending on discretionary items (those things we can do without) fell 0.9%. If the graph does not display click here That\u2019s a direct result of interest rate rises. And it has meant even though average household disposable income finally rose again, we did not feel like we were doing OK. If the graph does not display click here Partly this is because the increase came after a long fall, and we\u2019re only back where we were in 2015 (although it is worth remembering that from 2015 to 2019 household living standards barely rose). But it is also due to what drove the increase in living standards. Partly it was an increase in wages but also an increase in the value of housing and the incomes investors received from their properties. That is not exactly a wide scope of the nation. There was also an increase in social assistance and a reduction in the level of tax being paid, although this is not as great as it sounds. The Bureau of Statistics noted this was due to \u201cchanged timing of final tax return submissions compared to previous years\u201d. If the graph does not display click here And so we find ourselves bidding goodbye to the 2023 economy, and the knowledge that we ended the year with a weak economy teetering on the brink of recession, with essentially only population growth keeping things going. We should remember that the Reserve Bank decided in November to increase interest rates one more time, just when this economy was struggling, just as households were cutting back on buying discretionary items and just as unemployment was rising. The Reserve Bank assured us it was aware of the risks of slowing the economy too harshly. Right now it should be very worried indeed. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

            "content": "The US economy is the strongest in the world and Joe Biden was right to say so in his State of the Union address, a rightwing Republican economist allied to Donald Trump and a co-author of a plan to reshape the federal government said on Friday morning. \u201cLet me just say one thing positive about where we are right now,\u201d Stephen Moore told Fox Business. \u201cOne thing that Biden said last night was true. It is true that the United States today has the strongest economy. There is no question about it. \u201cIf you look at what\u2019s happening in Europe today, Germany, Britain, France, if you look at Japan and China, they\u2019re not growing. And so it is true \u2026 the way I like to put it is we are the least rotten apple in the cart and that\u2019s something that\u2019s important to cheer.\u201d It was a surprising statement from Moore, who Trump tried to put on the Federal Reserve board in 2019, only for widely reported issues arising from his tax and legal affairs to prompt his withdrawal. A liberal watchdog recently labeled Moore an \u201cextremist\u201d, in relation to his work on Project 2025, a sprawling plan to stock the US government with rightwingers and reshape public policy should Trump defeat Biden in November. A member of hard-right groups including the Heritage Foundation, FreedomWorks and the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, Moore is also a regular analyst for Fox. On Friday, the Guardian asked Moore if he credited Biden for the strong economy, as was further expressed by strong February jobs numbers released that morning. Moore said: \u201cNo I don\u2019t credit Biden for the economy. \u201cIt IS true that we have the strongest economy, but as I said, we are the least rotten apple in the cart. Most of the rest of the world is in recession.\u201d Asked who he did credit for such a strong US economy, if not the president who has supervised it for three years, Moore did not immediately reply. Economic conditions are vital in every presidential election. Allan Lichtman, a professor at American University in Washington who has correctly predicted the winner of each presidential election since 1984, said recently Biden was leading Trump on five key measures, one being long-term economic trends. Nonetheless, as his rematch with Donald Trump gets into gear, Biden must combat polling showing voters do not believe the economy is working for them."

            "date": "2024-03-12T08:29:48Z",
            "content": "By historical standards Britain\u2019s current recession is a mild one, but even so weak activity is starting to take its toll on the labour market. Nothing dramatic is happening. Unemployment is up a bit but the jobless rate remains below 4%. The number of people employed fell slightly and job vacancies continued to decrease, although the total of 908,000 remains above pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, as the annual inflation rate has fallen so pay growth has moderated too. For the time being at least workers\u2019 living standards are rising because wages are rising more rapidly than prices. The big picture is that the labour market is still relatively tight given the fact that the economy has been moving sideways for the best part of two years. There has been no large-scale job shedding and there are still shortages of workers in many sectors. In anticipation of the recession being short-lived, employers are hanging on to their existing staff because they are worried they will have problems recruiting when the economy does start to pick up. So while pay levels are coming down, they are probably not coming down quickly enough to prompt the Bank of England into an immediate cut in interest rates. Private sector regular pay \u2013 an indicator closely watched by Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee \u2013 was 6.1% higher in the three months ending January 2024 than in the same quarter a year earlier. That is well down on last summer\u2019s peak of 8.2% but slightly higher than the Bank has been forecasting. With inflation poised to fall from 4% to about 2% within the next few months, further moderation in earnings growth is likely. Even so, the latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggests the structural labour market problems remain unresolved. As Tony Wilson, the director of the Institute for Employment Studies thinktank points out, at 75% the UK\u2019s employment rate for those aged 16 to 64 is a percentage point lower than it was before the arrival of the pandemic four years ago even though unemployment has fallen back to where it was pre-Covid. \u201cSo as has been the story in previous months, there are fewer people in work because there are more people outside the labour force altogether \u2013 not looking or not available for work. In all, there are well over half a million more people out of work than before the pandemic began,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThis is being driven by more young people and older people outside the labour force, and in particular because of more people reporting long-term health conditions that stop them from working.\u201d That is not good for those who are not well enough to work. It is not good for the economy either."

            "date": "2024-03-10T08:00:13Z",
            "content": "What kind of society do we want? The most obvious answer is simple: we want people to be happy. We want our children to be as happy as possible, so why not everyone else? The goal should be a world where people enjoy their lives, and feel satisfied and fulfilled. This noble idea was born in the 18th-century Enlightenment. It was probably the most important idea of the modern age. Yet somehow it is seldom talked of today in debates about our future. Some people say it is too ambitious; others say it is not ambitious enough. It is neither. We simply want to make people as happy as possible. And, especially, we want to reduce misery. This should be the goal of every government and every one of us. More than 200 years ago, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \u201cThe care of human life and happiness \u2026 is the first and only legitimate object of good government.\u201d Why else would we have a government than to give us a fairly distributed, better quality of life? But what chance is there of politicians embracing this goal? Fortunately, it is in their interest to do so. The people\u2019s life satisfaction is the best predictor of whether the governing party (or parties) gets re-elected. It is a better predictor than economic growth, unemployment or inflation. That is what evidence in national elections in Europe since the 1970s and in recent US presidential elections shows. It\u2019s not \u201cthe economy, stupid\u201d. It\u2019s people\u2019s wellbeing. Keir Starmer gets this. He has promised: \u201cWith every pound spent on your behalf we would expect the Treasury to weigh not just its effect on national income but also its effect on wellbeing.\u201d This should lead to big changes in national spending priorities. The new science of wellbeing tells us a lot about how policies affect people\u2019s wellbeing. We can then compare this benefit with a policy\u2019s cost and choose those policies that give the highest bang for the buck \u2013 ie the most wellbeing for each pound spent. Mental health emerges as a high priority: The service provided by NHS talking therapies is a success because it saves more than it costs. But we desperately need a parallel service for adults with addiction or personality disorders, who get very little therapy. Similarly, mental health support in schools has been severely held back by lack of funding. It needs a better deal. Altogether the government spends less than \u00a32bn a year on psychological therapy. By contrast, roads and railways transport gets close to \u00a362bn. Yet an extra pound spent on therapy makes much more positive difference to people\u2019s lives than a pound spent on road or rail. Similarly, we shamelessly neglect the post-school education of people who do not go to university. They need guaranteed access to an apprenticeship, provided they are qualified. And so on. We spend too much on things relative to what we spend on people. A major rethink is needed across the field of public spending. The same is true for other organisations. They should be justified by how they contribute to human wellbeing. Schools should not be exam factories; they should be places where young people learn the skills of a life that satisfies and contributes to the wellbeing of others. There are excellent curriculums, such as Healthy Minds in secondary schools, that have proven impacts on wellbeing. Similarly, employers should give more weight to the wellbeing of their workers. What matters most is our own personal goals. In the dominant culture today, the overarching goal is individual success, compared with other people (better grades, better jobs, better income). But this is a zero-sum game. For every winner there is a loser. So however hard people try, overall total wellbeing doesn\u2019t change. But we can be happier if our individual aim is to make others happy and we derive much of our own happiness from doing that. We need that positive-sum goal and countries with high levels of social support and trust (such as the Nordic countries) are indeed happier. It\u2019s not enough for philosophers to say we have \u201creciprocal obligations\u201d to each other. We must say what those obligations are \u2013 to help other people to be happy. That is the message of the Action for Happiness movement. Its members pledge to \u201ccreate more happiness and less unhappiness in the world\u201d. And it provides wonderful materials and meetings to help people live this way. The UN International Day of Happiness takes place on 20 March, when many of us will celebrate at the World Happiness Summit in London. As the general election approaches, let\u2019s ask every politician: \u201cWhat is the goal your party is offering to the country?\u201d Above all, let each of us be, as best we can, a creator of happiness \u2013 as the Como Wellbeing Manifesto put it, let\u2019s put wellbeing first. \u2022 Richard Layard is co-author of Can We Be Happier? and Wellbeing: Science and Policy.

            "date": "2024-03-11T19:44:22Z",
            "content": "New laws designed to improve the rights of gig economy workers in the EU contracted to companies such as Uber have been saved from oblivion after they won the majority backing of member states. The legislation had been blocked by a group of countries last month, when France said it could not support the text on the table and Germany abstained. But on Monday, a compromise text pushed by Belgium got the law over the line, giving it one final chance of being passed before legislative procedures are timed out due to the looming EU parliamentary elections. The Belgian presidency announced the breakthrough during a summit of employment, social affairs and health ministers in Brussels. \u201cBetter working conditions for those delivering your meal at home. Ministers just approved the compromise text on the platform work directive,\u201d it said in a tweet. Pierre-Yves Dermagne, the Belgian deputy prime minister and minister for the economy and employment, said: \u201cWe have taken this historic step, so the message is workers are being heard.\u201d He said the law \u201cwas one of the Belgian presidency\u2019s top priorities\u201d and would improve the working conditions of the 28 million people employed as gig workers in the EU by allowing the \u201creclassification of those bogus self employed persons\u201d. Two years in the making, the directive is designed to give taxi and delivery drivers, such as those working for Uber and Deliveroo, rights similar to those full employees enjoy, including holidays, sick pay and the minimum wage. Under the new laws the default status of gig workers will be as employees and the onus will be on employers to prove they are not, if they so wish. Brussels has previously estimated that this could affect about 5.5 million of the 28 million workers using gig economy platforms. Mark MacGann, the whistleblower who leaked more than 124,000 Uber documents to the Guardian, in part because he believed it misrepresented the economic benefits to drivers of the company\u2019s gig economy model, said: \u201cMillions of platform workers across the EU have waited almost a decade to get governments to recognise their basic human rights. This legislation is an overdue but welcome step in the right direction.\u201d An Uber spokesperson said: \u201cEU lawmakers have voted to maintain the status quo today, with platform worker status continuing to be decided country-to-country and court-to-court. Uber now calls on EU countries to introduce national laws that give platform workers the protections they deserve while maintaining the independence they prefer.\u201d It is understood that four countries \u2013 France, Germany, Estonia and Greece \u2013 said as recently as February that they could not support the text. However, after Estonia and Greece indicated their support at the minister\u2019s meeting, a breakthrough that tipped the balance in favour of the laws. The EU jobs commissioner, Nicolas Schmit, said: \u201cOne member state surprised us by joining the qualified majority at the last moment \u2013 of course that was great news.\u201d Schmit added that the law had much wider scope beyond taxi drivers and food delivery riders who had previously been dismissed as \u201cyoung people with bikes\u201d but were \u201cworkers with precarious jobs\u201d who must \u201cnot be deprived of their rights\u201d. The deal will also give workers the right not to be managed by algorithm, as well as future-proof employment law against employment rights being determined by artificial intelligence, something ministers said was a world first."

He was speaking at the Restitch conference in Coventry, held by the thinktank Create Streets. Labour is finalising its agenda for green renewal and Reed indicated a zero-waste economy would be part of this. This would mean the amount of waste going to landfill would be drastically reduced and valuable raw materials including plastic, glass and minerals reused, which would save money for businesses who would not have to buy, import or create raw materials. Reed said the Conservative government made this pledge in 2011 but little progress had been made towards it: \u201cThe government published a strategy, but they failed to do very much with it.\u201d Reed said a zero-waste economy was achievable and that other comparable countries were aiming for it by 2050: \u201cA series of other countries \u2013 the Netherlands, Belgium \u2013 smaller than us but similar in many respects, have got objectives to become zero-waste economies by 2050 and that has huge economic benefits.

He said the measure did not require a large amount of public investment because the government could work with businesses who would then benefit from having cheaper materials with which to make their goods. Reed said the measure had \u201cbenefit after benefit after benefit\u201d. \u201cRegulation would give businesses the confidence to invest in their facilities and they can be reusing materials rather than mining and using brand new materials.

            "content": "As well as further reducing US House speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s already threadbare majority in his legislative chamber, last week\u2019s abrupt departure of the Colorado congressman Ken Buck has the potential to significantly damage another prominent Republican figure: Lauren Boebert. The far-right firebrand seized on Buck\u2019s declaration last year that he would not seek re-election by opting to switch from a district the congresswoman barely won in 2022 to run in Buck\u2019s soon to be vacant seat. The calculation was that it would offer safe harbor and a near-certain return to Congress later this year, while allowing her to complete her term in office in her current seat. Buck\u2019s 15 March decision to bring forward his exit from November to this Friday, however, stripped the floor from beneath her. It triggered a special election in his district that will take place on 25 June and left Boebert with two equally unappealing choices. She could resign her post to run in the special election, giving Democrats the chance to flip her current seat. Or she could stay where she is and gamble on trying to unseat an incumbent in the 5 November general election. She chose the latter. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving my constituents,\u201d she said in a statement that failed to acknowledge she had already decided to walk away from them in November. \u201cI will not imperil the already very slim House Republican majority by resigning my current seat.\u201d The statement also expressed anger at Buck, who outmaneuvered her and left her facing a seemingly narrow path to being a member of the next Congress. She accused Buck of \u201cforcing an unnecessary special election on the same day\u201d as Colorado\u2019s presidential preference primary, predicting that it would \u201cconfuse voters, result in a lame duck congressman on day one, and leave the fourth district [being vacated by Buck] with no representation for more than three months\u201d. \u201cThe fourth district deserves better,\u201d Boebert\u2019s statement stated. Unsaid was that neither the \u201clame duck\u201d congressmember nor the primary choice of Republican voters in that district, most probably, would be her. Buck, who said last year he was standing down in part because of his disappointment at his party\u2019s backing of Donald Trump\u2019s lie that he won the 2020 election, denied his decision to bring forward his exit was intended to harm Boebert. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he told the Colorado Sun, stressing his decision to leave the House \u2013 where Republicans for the moment had a 219-213 edge over Democrats \u2013 was solely over his disillusionment at a lack of action in Congress. Buck said: \u201cI\u2019m not giving anybody an advantage or disadvantage. I have done my very best to stay out of this primary election.\u201d But he did slam Boebert for attempting to fundraise from the situation, as she did in a tweet attacking the \u201cuniparty\u201d, a derogatory term used by conservative extremists to attack Republicans who work or vote with Democrats to pass bipartisan legislation. Boebert\u2019s next steps are unclear, although her pathway to the fourth district seat, if she still wants to pursue it, is now strewn with obstacles. She can run in the crowded fourth district primary also on 25 June without resigning her current seat \u2013 but to be successful she would have to persuade voters to elect one Republican as a \u201ccaretaker\u201d in the special election before then rejecting that same candidate in the primary in her favor. The likelihood is that the winner of the June special election, assuming it is a Republican, will also become the primary winner and run again in November with the advantage of being an incumbent. A far less likely alternative is Boebert giving up on district four and attempting to defend Colorado\u2019s third district seat, which she retained in 2022 by only about 500 votes from more than 327,000 cast. Many, however, believe she has burned bridges there. The congresswoman\u2019s second term has been mired in controversy, including an unsavory groping incident involving a male companion at a Denver theater in September, and the arrest of her 18-year-old son in February on felony charges over multiple instances of credit card and identity theft. Either way, Boebert faces a monumental challenge to extend her political career in a House in which her behavior has been questionable, including unseemly heckling of Joe Biden during his 2022 State of the Union speech. In December, the self-styled \u201cno-nonsense conservative\u201d Richard Holtorf, a candidate in the district four primary, said in a tweet that \u201cseat shopping isn\u2019t something that the voters look kindly on\u201d. It is unlikely that Buck\u2019s decision will have gained her any more supporters."

In recent days, Biden visited Arizona and Nevada, where he is looking to shore up the support of young and Latino voters who could be key to his re-election. Biden is touting economic policies and attacking Trump on immigration and abortion as he seeks to win over wavering voters and waning enthusiasm among groups that backed him in 2020.

In a muted speech to a subdued crowd outside his party\u2019s headquarters in Ankara, Erdo\u011fan praised the vote itself rather than the outcome. \u201cRegardless of the results, the winner of this election is primarily democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, we couldn\u2019t get the result we wanted in local elections \u2026 Everything happens for a reason. We will rebuild trust in places where our nation has chosen someone else.\u201d Erdo\u011fan addressed most of his comments to the crowd, telling them at one point: \u201cI am madly in love with you.\u201d Imamo\u011flu, the star of Turkey\u2019s opposition, beat his rival, Murat Kurum, a former bureaucrat and environment minister from Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Justice and Development party (AKP), by a significant margin in Turkey\u2019s largest city, where his mayorship has become a thorn in the side of the Turkish president. With a majority of votes counted, the Istanbul mayor was on course to beat Kurum by 10%. Across Istanbul, drivers honked car horns in celebration, while videos showed jubilant people tearing down a poster featuring Kurum\u2019s face. Tens of thousands of people lit torches and waved Turkish flags after partial local election results showed that support for the government had weakened. \u201cTurkish people have opened their eyes and voted for those candidates who think about Turkey\u2019s economy, the youth\u2019s education and future,\u201d university student Ege Ersoz, 19, told AFP at the Sarachane square . \u201cThis is only the beginning. It\u2019s the first time AKP lost this much. God willing, this will go on in the coming elections,\u201d he said, referring to Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party. Large crowds chanted slogans, \u201cTurkey is secular and will remain secular\u201d and \u201cTayyip, resign!\u201d \u201cThese results will put Imamo\u011flu and the CHP at the centre of Turkish politics,\u201d said Yusuf Can, an analyst with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. Erdo\u011fan demanded a rerun of Imamo\u011flu\u2019s initial election victory in 2019, leading to a resounding second win for the opposition mayor. The result vaulted him from a minor municipal official to a role as the main challenger to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rule. His second resounding victory is expected to set Imamo\u011flu on the path to a presidential run. The mayor\u2019s campaign for a second term proved challenging. Election insiders estimated that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s AKP outspent Imamo\u011flu and the CHP by a factor of three in Istanbul, the country\u2019s financial and cultural centre, where Erdo\u011fan occupied the position of mayor 30 years ago. Despite Erdo\u011fan\u2019s name not appearing on the ballot, voters across the country seized the opportunity to express their dissatisfaction with his policies, many citing Turkey\u2019s struggling economy as their motivation for voting for the opposition or a rising collection of smaller parties further to the right than the AKP. \u201cIt\u2019s a resounding message,\u201d said Selim Sazak, the head of Sanda Global, an Ankara-based consultancy that advised several campaigns during the local election cycle. \u201cThe voters are telling the government that the economy is really hurting them.\u201d Their message, he added, was that either Imamo\u011flu or Ankara\u2019s mayor, Mansur Yava\u0219, could have turned out a similar sweeping victory for the opposition if the CHP had selected them as presidential candidates last year. The AKP selected the former environment minister Murat Kurum, born and raised in Ankara, to challenge the charismatic Istanbul mayor for a seat that Erdo\u011fan held from 1994 to 1998, only furthering the impression that Erdo\u011fan sought to bring Istanbul back within the central government\u2019s sphere of influence. However, some of Kurum\u2019s recent jabs at \u0130mamo\u011flu backfired, notably his decision to tell the latter that he should \u201cgo and manage a meatball shop\u201d, in reference to a popular Turkish staple. Imamo\u011flu made plenty of use of Kurum\u2019s comments on the campaign trail as evidence that his challenger was out of touch with the average Istanbulite, telling a crowd of supporters: \u201cDo you know why I love this election? Both the meatball maker and the minister are equal [at the ballot box].\u201d Erdo\u011fan\u2019s efforts to place himself at the forefront of the fight to retake Istanbul also backfired with many of its residents. Turkey has been plagued by an economic crisis linked to his policies, one that has hit the populations of major cities the hardest. \u201cThat son of a bitch raised inflation himself. That\u2019s enough,\u201d said one voter, Burhan, who asked that his family name be withheld. He said he had previously voted for the AKP but opted for Imamo\u011flu this time as he remained unhappy about the lack of economic progress since Erdo\u011fan\u2019s victory last year. After winning re-election, Erdo\u011fan appointed a new finance minister and central bank governor, who introduced reforms and austerity measures that some observers considered essential, but which left much of the public worse off as inflation continued to rise."

            "date": "2024-03-12T21:50:49Z",
            "content": "Google is restricting its Gemini AI chatbot from answering election-related questions in countries where voting is taking place this year, limiting users from receiving information about candidates, political parties and other elements of politics. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution on such an important topic, we have begun to roll out restrictions on the types of election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses,\u201d Google\u2019s India team stated on the company\u2019s site. The company initially announced its plans for limiting election-related queries in a blog post last December, according to a Google spokesperson, and made a similar announcement regarding European parliamentary elections in February. Google\u2019s post on Tuesday pertained to India\u2019s upcoming election, while TechCrunch reported that Google confirmed it is rolling out the changes globally. When asked questions such as \u201ctell me about President Biden\u201d or \u201cwho is Donald Trump,\u201d Gemini now replies: \u201cI\u2019m still learning how to answer this question. In the meantime, try Google search,\u201d or a similarly evasive answer. Even the less subjective question \u201chow to register to vote\u201d receives a referral to Google search. Google is limiting its chatbot\u2019s capabilities ahead of a raft of high-stakes votes this year in countries including the US, India, South Africa and the UK. There is widespread concern over AI-generated disinformation and its influence on global elections, as the technology enables the use of robocalls, deepfakes and chatbot-generated propaganda. \u201cAs we shared last December, in preparation for the many elections happening around the world in 2024 and out of an abundance of caution, we\u2019re restricting the types of election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses.\u201d Governments and regulators around the world have struggled to keep up with the advancements in AI and their threat to the democratic process, while big tech companies are under pressure to rein in the malicious use of their AI tools. Google\u2019s blogpost on Tuesday states that it is implementing multiple features, such as digital watermarking and content labels for AI-generated content, to prevent the spread of misinformation at scale. Google\u2019s decision to restrict Gemini should be a reason to scrutinize the overall accuracy of the company\u2019s AI tools, argues Daniel Susser, an associate professor of information science at Cornell University. \u201cIf Google\u2019s generative AI tools are too unreliable for conveying information about democratic elections, why should we trust them in other contexts, such as health or financial information?\u201d Susser said in a statement. \u201cWhat does that say about Google\u2019s long-term plans to incorporate generative AI across its services, including search?\u201d Gemini recently faced a heated backlash over its image-generation capabilities, as users began to notice the tool inaccurately generated images of people of color when given prompts for historical situations. These included depictions of people of color as Catholic popes and as German Nazi soldiers in the second world war. Google suspended some of Gemini\u2019s capabilities in response to the controversy, issuing statements apologizing and saying that it would tweak its technology to fix the issue. The Gemini scandal involved issues around AI-generated misinformation, but it also showed how major AI firms are finding themselves in the center of culture wars and under intense public scrutiny. Republican lawmakers accused Google of promoting leftist ideology through its AI tool, with the Missouri senator Josh Hawley calling on its CEO, Sundar Pichai, to testify under oath to Congress about Gemini. Prominent AI companies, including OpenAI and Google, increasingly appear willing to block their chatbots from engaging with sensitive questions that could result in a public relations backlash. Even the decision of which questions these companies block is fraught, however, and a 404 Media report from earlier this month found that Gemini would not answer questions such as \u201cwhat is Palestine\u201d but would engage with similar queries about Israel."

            "date": "2024-03-29T18:49:34Z",
            "content": "The town of Newbern, Alabama, has not had a political election in the last several decades. But that could all change this November if a new motion is successful. The Legal Defense Fund (LDF), an organization that focuses on racial and civil rights, along with an Alabama-based private law firm, filed a preliminary injunction to force Newbern, a town of about 133 people, to hold elections and allow its citizens to vote for the first time in years. The town, about an hour and a half away from Montgomery, captured national attention last summer, after white officials had refused for three years to allow Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor in Newbern\u2019s history, to exercise his mayoral duties. Newbern is about 80% Black and 20% white, but the town\u2019s leadership, with the exception of Braxton and his town council, has been majority white for years. The defendants in the lawsuit, including the previous mayor and council, have refused to hold elections. \u201c[They\u2019re] so stuck in their ways and don\u2019t want nothing else for the town. They just want it to stay the same,\u201d Braxton said last year. \u201cI hope they break and just go ahead and release everything to me. If not, we\u2019ll just go to court.\u201d Braxton assumed office by default in 2020 when he filed for office and no one else, including the incumbent, did the same. Previous Newbern mayors had also been appointed or ran unopposed, with several of the officers serving in the position for more than 10 years. Many residents did not know they were allowed to have elections. The LDF lawsuit builds on a previous one filed last year, which alleged that white officials had manipulated the political process for years to maintain their power in the majority Black town. The defendants, listed as former mayor Haywood \u201cWoody\u201d Stokes III and his town council, held a secret, special election, preventing Braxton from appointing his town council. During their special election, the previous town council re-elected themselves, and ultimately reappointed the previous town mayor. They were aided, the lawsuit alleges, by the town\u2019s bank and clerk. Newbern has effectively had two mayors since 2020. Though the white officials have not recognized his position, Braxton has continued trying to serve as mayor, using his own funds to host events and food distribution drives. The LDF suit aims to give all citizens in the town an opportunity to vote \u2013 something that would be history making. \u201cFor decades, officials in my town have excluded me and other voters from participating in elections and having a say in what happens here,\u201d Braxton said in a statement provided by the LDF. \u201cVoting is not a privilege; it is a responsibility in helping to shape the direction and priorities of our community. We want to ensure our voices are heard and votes are counted. We ask the courts to enforce elections in Newbern this November so that we can cast our ballots and actively participate in the democratic process.\u201d"

His government certainly shoulders a lot of blame but so do those who have done nothing to help since he was voted out. The earliest millennials will be 70 in 2050, meaning almost all will be working when the world is forecast to reach temperatures more than 2C above pre-industry averages unless we do something. They are the first generation who can\u2019t really say \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019ll be dead by then\u201d, but they of course are not the only group screwed by climate change. When I turned 20 in 1992, I had experienced one month of global temperatures 1C above the average of the late 19th century. That was one month more than my father had experienced when he turned 20 in 1966. For their first 20 years, millennials born in January 1985 had just four months of temperatures 1C higher than the late 19th-century average. When my daughter turned 20 last year, she had experienced 106 months of them. If the graph does not display click here John Howard is not to blame for climate change, but inaction on climate change in this country started under his watch. He was the one who made sure Australia was able to count land clearing when calculating our emissions, and thus be able to claim reductions when we haven\u2019t made any at all. If the graph does not display click here His government killed any chance of bipartisan policy for a price on carbon. But Howard\u2019s actions are no excuse for anyone in government since, because we kept using his government\u2019s definition of emissions and repeated its claims that we need more gas to lower emissions. More millennials are paying for private health insurance than any during the Medicare period. Why fund public health when you can force people to prop up the private health sector with the \u201clifetime health cover\u201d policy! If the graph does not display click here Howard\u2019s desire to kill unions for the purpose of keeping wages down and profits high turbocharged (and distorted) the \u201cneoliberal project\u201d that began in the 1980s under Hawke and Keating. If the graph does not display click here Millennials have barely any experience of conducting industrial action for better pay and conditions, and coincidentally, those who started working after 2010 entered at a time real wage growth was heading south. If the graph does not display click here Is there any good news? Fortunately, overall unemployment is now lower than anyone of working age has experienced. Millennial women for example are much more likely to work than their older sisters and mothers. Just over 80% of women born in 1980 were employed in their early 40s compared with 67% of those women born in 1950. If the graph does not display click here Men in their 30s and 40s are less likely to be working full-time but the drop from about 90% to 82% is much less than the increase for women of the same age from 28% to 50%. That\u2019s good because millennials chose a pretty bad time to come into the labour force and be unemployed. Whereas boomers had unemployment benefits roughly 25% below poverty, by 2007 they were 47% below and by the middle of 2020 they hit 50% below. If the graph does not display click here But all this work means they all own homes, right? Ahhh. Now we get to it. Millennials, despite being more likely to have work than earlier generations, are much less likely to own a home. If the graph does not display click here When Howard said in 2003, \u201cI don\u2019t get people stopping me in the street and saying, \u2018John, you\u2019re outrageous, under your government the value of my house has increased\u2019\u201d, 57% of gen Xers in their late 30s and 65% of those in their early 40s already owned a home. Little wonder his government was happy to not only provide a 50% discount to capital gains tax that turned the housing market into a casino, but also introduced the first homeowner\u2019s grant and then later doubled it to keep juicing house prices. If the graph does not display click here Factors outside Australia also played a part in the soaring prices. But neither Howard nor anyone who followed has done anything to stop it. Australian governments have decided that building homes is no longer worth doing despite every single person in the country (including all the MPs who have investment properties) knowing housing is a good bet. There was a time when 20% of all new residences were being built by the public or social sector. Now it\u2019s less than 2%. If the graph does not display click here Now sure, in 1990 interest rates got up to 17%. But those rates came down quickly and the loan sizes were much smaller compared with now. Anyone who took out their first home loan after 2005 is paying much higher mortgage repayments than those who took out loans in the 1980s. If the graph does not display click here Have millennials been screwed? Sure, they are more likely to be in work, but they work in a time of low wages growth. They are better educated, but pay much higher rates of Hecs/Help, and they are required to pay more for health cover. They know climate change is not some far-off event and yet governments filled with older MPs either do nothing or merely pretend to do something. And they know that owning a home is less likely than for any generation since the second world war and their repayments will be larger should they be lucky enough to buy a home. Blaming John Howard is easy, but he was just the main avatar of a political and economic project designed to boost the wealth and incomes of those whose votes mattered more from 1980 through to 2010. Unfortunately, the impact of those policies \u2013 especially on climate change \u2013 has screwed not only the millennials, but the generations to come. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

            "date": "2024-03-20T08:43:08Z",
            "content": "Scotland\u2019s pledge to cut its climate emissions by 75% by 2030 is \u201cno longer credible\u201d and cannot be met, the UK\u2019s climate watchdog has said. In a damning report submitted to the Scottish parliament, the UK Climate Change Committee (CCC) accused the Scottish government of repeatedly failing to live up to its legally binding targets. Despite missing the annual emissions reductions required by law in eight of the last 12 years, ministers still have no meaningful plans for hitting that target after failing to produce the climate change strategy due last year, the CCC said. Its action and policies \u201ccontinue to fall far short\u201d of what was needed. Most sectors, such as housing, transport and farming, remained so far behind their interim targets \u201cthe acceleration required [to] meet the 2030 target is now beyond what is credible\u201d. In response to the committee\u2019s conclusions, Oxfam warned the Scottish government\u2019s credibility was \u201cnow firmly on the line\u201d and Friends of the Earth Scotland accused ministers of \u201can embarrassing and abject failure\u201d. Mike Robinson, the chair of the civic society umbrella group Stop Climate Chaos, said: \u201cAfter declaring a climate emergency, the Scottish government has failed to deliver anything close to an emergency response, and must now redouble efforts. \u201cWhile every party in the Scottish parliament carries some blame, the Scottish government has lost its position as a climate leader and we would like to see the first minister make an emergency statement to parliament to set out his response.\u201d The CCC\u2019s criticisms have been growing in intensity for some years. In the Scottish government, the Scottish National party shares power with the Scottish Greens after signing a cooperation agreement in 2021 that prioritised action on climate. Humza Yousaf, who succeeded Nicola Sturgeon as first minister and as SNP leader, has put less emphasis on climate action, despite its significance in the deal with the Greens. With the SNP facing significant losses in the next general election, he has endorsed the oil industry\u2019s position that heavier taxes to fund a transition to clean energy are unjustified, cut funding for forestry and watered down proposals to switch farming subsidies towards nature recovery. In its annual progress report to Holyrood, the CCC found: \u2022 Scotland would need to cut emissions across housing, transport, farming and waste by ninefold in the next six years to meet its 2030 target. \u2022 Its tree-planting, peatland restoration, heat pump installation, recycling and electric van rates are \u201csignificantly\u201d off track. \u2022 On transport alone, the government had to achieve a fourfold increase in its annual reductions to hit the 2030 target. \u2022 It has no strategy to decarbonise aviation, and has failed to use the powers to set higher air departure taxes given to Holyrood in 2016. In one of the few policy areas it applauded, the CCC said the government\u2019s \u201cbold\u201d heat in buildings bill could become a template for the rest of the UK if it was implemented as planned. As well as banning gas and oil-fired heating by 2045, the bill will mandate minimum energy efficiency standards for private and rented homes and require lower carbon heating to be installed when a house is sold. M\u00e0iri McAllan, the Scottish net zero secretary, implied the Scottish government had effectively dropped its 2030 target. She said the CCC had long been clear that hitting that target \u201cwill be extremely challenging, and may not be feasible\u201d. However, she said: \u201cWe remain fully committed to meeting our target of net zero emissions by 2045. We are under no illusion that the hardest part of this journey is ahead of us.\u201d Scottish ministers had developed proposals to cut car usage by 20% by 2030 and for decarbonising buildings, but she blamed the UK government for the delays to Scotland\u2019s climate change plan. Ministers in London had \u201creneged on their net zero commitments, and rolled back on policies already announced and accounted for\u201d, as well as cutting capital funding for Scotland needed to deliver new infrastructure. \u201cWe will now carefully consider the report\u2019s recommendations and our next steps \u2013 including legislative options \u2013 before providing a formal response,\u201d McAllan said."

            "date": "2024-03-13T06:00:05Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s plans for adapting to the effects of the climate crisis \u201cfall far short\u201d of what is required, the government\u2019s statutory adviser has said. The Climate Change Committee (CCC) has examined the national adaptation programme published by ministers last July, intended to set out how people, buildings and vital national infrastructure such as water, transport, energy and telecommunications networks could be protected from the increasing severity of storms, floods, heatwaves and droughts that are afflicting the UK as a result of global heating. In a damning verdict delivered on Wednesday, the committee found that the government had no credible plan for making the UK resilient to the increasing effects of extreme weather. Julia King, chair of the adaptation subcommittee of the CCC, said: \u201cThe evidence of the damage from climate change has never been clearer, but the UK\u2019s current approach to adaptation is not working.\u201d The national adaptation plan published last July, known as Nap3, was the third in a series of five-yearly updates in response to an assessment of climate risks, required under the 2008 Climate Change Act, from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. But the CCC found that although it was an improvement on previous efforts, the new plan was still inadequate and required improvement before the next scheduled update in 2028. King said: \u201cDefra needs to deliver an immediate strengthening of the government\u2019s programme, with an overhaul of its integration with other government priorities such as net zero and nature restoration. We cannot wait another five years for only incremental improvement.\u201d The CCC found that most of Nap3 was based on existing policy or mechanisms, which were inadequate and ignored more than half of the short-term actions to address urgent risks from extreme weather that had been identified in the latest risk assessment. The report sharply criticised Defra for failing to make adaptation a priority and to work closely with other government departments on the issue. Ministers had also failed to fund adaptation efforts sufficiently, or provide the incentives for private sector investment, the CCC found, and there was too little monitoring and evaluation. Jim Hall, commissioner at the National Infrastructure Commission, pointed out that utilities and other companies were planning to spend about \u00a3400bn on infrastructure by 2030, so it was essential that the need for it to be resilient to extreme weather was taken into account. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a short window to ensure that [the \u00a3400bn spending] is optimised for adaptation and resilience, and government must seize the moment,\u201d he said. Analysts said the reports showed that the government must step up its efforts to protect people, land and infrastructure, or face disaster. Friends of the Earth said it was planning to take the government to court over the inadequacy of its climate plans. The group\u2019s head of policy, Mike Childs, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that government plans to protect people, property and infrastructure from the escalating climate crisis are unfit for purpose and must be improved. Ministers must do more to face up to the reality of climate change, including faster action to end our reliance on costly fossil fuels and a robust plan to help safeguard people\u2019s lives and livelihoods from the consequences of a rapidly warming planet.\u201d Gareth Redmond-King, head of the international programme at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) thinktank, said: \u201cAs this government slows action to tackle climate change, their advisers remind us they\u2019re also doing nothing like enough to adapt to the dangerous impacts from it. Climate impacts are getting worse every year as we heat the planet. Not investing to adapt our infrastructure and services is a bit like not bothering to insure your house: it might save you some money in the short term, but it will cost you an awful lot more when your roof falls in.\u201d The UK should also be helping other nations to adapt, he added. Half of the UK\u2019s food imports come from places around the world likely to bear the brunt of the rapidly changing climate. \u201cIf we don\u2019t support other nations to adapt, then harvests of staples such as rice, bananas and tea will fall, leading to shortages and higher prices,\u201d Redmond-King said. Last month was the hottest February ever recorded globally, and in the UK it was the fourth wettest. Heavy rain is making it difficult for farmers to get crops in the ground, while crop pollination may also suffer as the mild February brought bees early from their winter sleep, only to famish as few blooms were ready. Tom Lancaster, land analyst at ECIU, said: \u201cRelentless rain this winter is likely to lead to a terrible harvest, come the summer. Floods last year hit yields, just as droughts did the year before.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe government\u2019s third national adaptation programme sets out a robust five-year plan to strengthen infrastructure, promote a greener economy and safeguard food production in the face of the climate challenges we face. \u201cWe are investing billions in projects to improve the UK\u2019s climate resilience, including \u00a35.2bn in flood and coastal schemes in England, safeguarding future water supplies by accelerating \u00a32.2bn of investment through our ambitious plan for water, and driving tree planting and peat restoration through the \u00a3750m nature for climate fund. \u201cOur negotiators played an important role at the Cop28 summit to help bring an ambitious global goal on adaptation to life and as a leading nation on climate adaptation, the UK is well placed to achieve these ambitions in full.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-11T11:37:12Z",
            "content": "Greta Thunberg has accused Sweden of being \u201cvery good at greenwashing\u201d as she staged a protest along with about 50 other activists outside her home country\u2019s parliament. The activists \u2013 who she said were acting as a group of concerned, largely young individuals rather than representing a particular organisation \u2013 sat outside the main entrance to Sweden\u2019s government buildings in Stockholm on Monday morning in an attempt to stop politicians from getting to work. The action came on a high-stakes day for the Swedish government, with the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, and numerous key figures in Brussels for its official flag-raising ceremony outside Nato headquarters after becoming members last week. The 21-year-old climate activist said: \u201cSweden is unfortunately not unique in completely ignoring the climate crisis, not treating it as an emergency at all. But actively trying to greenwash, deceive and lie in order to make it seem like they are doing enough and that they are moving in the right direction, when in fact the exact opposite is happening.\u201d She added: \u201cSweden in particular is very good at greenwashing and framing themselves as a climate leader, when we have very high emissions per capita if we include all our emissions, including consumption based and biogenic emissions etc and especially if we look at historic emissions. So we are not a climate leader at all.\u201d The Swedish government, a centre-right coalition run by the Moderate party and dependent on the support of the far-right Sweden Democrats, has faced heavy criticism in recent months over how it plans to reach its agreed climate goals with policies that are expected to greatly increase emissions. All over the world, Thunberg said, \u201cpeople seem to be physically incapable of focusing on several things at the same time\u201d. She added: \u201cWe need to be able to tackle the climate crisis in a way that addresses all the other root causes as well and make sure that we have a just transition.\u201d The aim of Monday\u2019s protest against the climate crisis and the people that it is killing, Thunberg said, was to highlight how \u201cthe people in power are ignoring the most affected and activists and young people and the science\u201d. She accused politicians of instead \u201cprioritising short-term economic profits\u201d, which she said was \u201csacrificing human life and the planet in the name of greed\u201d. She said this type of protest marked a first for Sweden, although similar actions had happened in other locations around the world. \u201cThe climate justice movement has for decades tried to get our message across and scientists and the most affected people have been sounding the alarm for even longer than that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the people in power have not been listening, they have been actively ignoring and silence those speaking out.\u201d Climate scientists were also in attendance at the demonstration to show their support. Swedish police, who are understood to be at the protest, have been contacted for comment."

            "date": "2024-03-31T09:00:34Z",
            "content": "Annie Jacobsen was a high school student in 1983, when ABC television broadcast the film The Day After, about the horrors of nuclear war. She never forgot the experience. More than 100 million Americans watched and were terrified too. One of them lived in the White House. According to his biographer and his own memoirs, it helped turn Ronald Reagan into a nuclear disarmer in his second term. Not long after, the world\u2019s stockpile of nuclear warheads peaked and began to decline rapidly, from 70,000 to just over 12,000 currently, according to the Federation of American Scientists. That is still enough however to reduce the Earth to a radioactive desert, with some warheads left over to make it glow. Meanwhile, the global situation is arguably the most dangerous since the Cuban missile crisis, the Russian invasion of Ukraine grinding on mercilessly and China contemplating following Moscow\u2019s example by making a grab for Taiwan. The danger of nuclear war is as immediate as ever but it has faded from public discourse, which is why Jacobsen, now a journalist and author, felt driven to write her new book, Nuclear War: A Scenario. \u201cFor decades, people were under the assumption that the nuclear threat ended when the Berlin Wall went down,\u201d Jacobsen said, before suggesting another reason the existential threat of nuclear weapons has been filtered out of mainstream discourse \u2013 it has been turned into a technical debate. \u201cNuclear weapons and the whole nomenclature around them have been so rarefied it\u2019s been reserved as a subject for those in the know,\u201d she said. In her book, Jacobsen seeks to break through jargon and details in order to tell a terrifying story in a devastatingly straightforward way. The spoiler alert is that it doesn\u2019t end well. As the book promises on the cover, it presents a single scenario for a nuclear war, set in the present day. North Korea, perhaps convinced it is about to be attacked, launches a surprise missile strike against the US, leading Washington to respond with a salvo of 50 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). These are aimed at North Korea\u2019s weapons sites and command centres, but in order to reach their intended targets the missiles have to fly over Russia, because they do not have the range to use any other route. All too aware of the danger of miscalculation, the US president tries to get hold of his Russian counterpart. But the two men and the countries they run are not getting on, and he fails. Making things even worse, Russia\u2019s dodgy satellite early warning system, Tundra, has exaggerated the scale of the US salvo, and from his Siberian bunker, the Russian president (Vladimir Putin in all but name) orders an all-out nuclear attack on the US. The scenario is based on known facts concerning the world\u2019s nuclear arsenals, systems and doctrine. Those facts are all in the public domain, but Jacobsen believes society has tuned them out, despite (or perhaps because of) how shocking they are. Jacobsen was stunned to find out that an ICBM strike against North Korea would have to go over Russia, and that Russia\u2019s early warning system is beset with glitches, an especially worrying fact when combined with the knowledge that both the US and Russia have part of their nuclear arsenals ready to launch at a few minutes\u2019 notice. Both also have an option in their nuclear doctrine to \u201claunch on warning\u201d, without waiting for the first incoming warhead to land. A US president would have a few minutes to make a decision if American early warning systems signaled an incoming attack. In those few minutes, he or she would have to process an urgent, complex and inevitably incomplete stream of information and advice from top defence officials. Jacobsen points out that in such circumstances the president is likely to be subject to \u201cjamming\u201d, a chorus of military voices urging he or she follows protocols which lead inexorably towards a retaliatory launch. \u201cMy jaw dropped at so much of what I learned, which was not classified but had just been removed or rather sanitised from the public discourse,\u201d she said. \u201cI found myself constantly surprised by the insanity of what I learned, coupled with the fact that it\u2019s all there for the public to know.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Ultimately, only presidents can make the decision and once it is made, no one has the authority to block it. It is called sole authority, and it is almost certainly the most frightening fact in the world today. It means a handful of men each have the power to end the world in a few minutes, without having to consult anyone. It is not a group anyone would choose to have that responsibility, including as it does the likes of Putin and Kim Jong-un. In Washington it is a choice this year between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. They all bring a lot of human frailty, anger, fear and paranoia to a potential decision that could end the planet. \u201cYou would want to have a commander-in-chief who is of sound mind, who is fully in control of his mental capacity, who is not volatile, who is not subject to anger,\u201d Jacobsen said, referring to this year\u2019s presidential election. \u201cThese are significant character qualities that should be thought about when people vote for president, for the simple reason that the president has sole authority to launch nuclear weapons.\u201d Nuclear War: A Scenario is published in the US by Dutton Nuclear War is published in the UK by Transworld Publishers Ltd, \u00a320.

            "date": "2024-03-28T13:24:43Z",
            "content": "The Sellafield nuclear waste dump is to be prosecuted for alleged information technology security offences, the industry watchdog has said. The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) said on Thursday that it had notified the state-owned Cumbrian nuclear company that it would be prosecuted under industry security regulations. The prosecution follows the Guardian\u2019s revelations last year of multiple cyber failings at the vast site, part of a year-long investigation into cyber hacking, radioactive contamination and an unhealthy workplace culture at Sellafield. The ONR said: \u201cThese charges relate to alleged information technology security offences during a four-year period between 2019 and early 2023. There is no suggestion that public safety has been compromised as a result of these issues. The decision to begin legal proceedings follows an investigation by ONR, the UK\u2019s independent nuclear regulator.\u201d Sellafield, which has more than 11,000 staff, was placed into a form of \u201cspecial measures\u201d for consistent failings on cybersecurity in 2022, according to sources at the ONR and the security services. Among the Guardian\u2019s revelations in December were that groups linked to Russia and China had penetrated its computer networks, embedding sleeper malware that could lurk and be used to spy or attack systems. At the time Sellafield said it did not have evidence of a successful cyber-attack. The site has the largest store of plutonium in the world and is a sprawling rubbish dump for nuclear waste from weapons programmes and decades of atomic power generation. Other findings in the Guardian\u2019s Nuclear Leaks investigation included concerns about external contractors being able to plug memory sticks into its computer system while unsupervised. The Guardian also revealed that cyber problems have been known by senior figures at the nuclear site for at least a decade, according to a report dated from 2012, which warned there were \u201ccritical security vulnerabilities\u201d that needed to be addressed urgently. Sellafield\u2019s computer servers were deemed so insecure that the problem was nicknamed Voldemort after the Harry Potter villain, according to a government official familiar with the ONR investigation and IT failings at the site, because it was so sensitive and dangerous. At the time, Sellafield said that \u201call of our systems and servers have multiple layers of protection\u201d. \u201cCritical networks that enable us to operate safely are isolated from our general IT network, meaning an attack on our IT system would not penetrate these,\u201d it said. This week, the Guardian revealed that Richard Meal, Sellafield\u2019s chief information security officer, is to leave the site after more than a decade. He will be the second senior leader to leave this year, after the top director responsible for safety and security, Mark Neate, announced in January that he planned to leave. In January, Sellafield appointed Graeme Slater as its chief digital information officer, responsible for cybersecurity. The ONR said details of the first court hearing would be announced \u201cwhen available\u201d. Britain\u2019s public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, last month launched an investigation into risks and costs at Sellafield. A spokesperson at the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, which funds Sellafield, said: \u201cSafety and security at our former nuclear sites is paramount and we fully support the Office for Nuclear Regulation in its independent role as regulator. \u201cThe regulator has made clear that there is no suggestion that public safety has been compromised at Sellafield. Since the period of this prosecution, we have seen a change of leadership at Sellafield and the ONR has noted a clear commitment to address its concerns.\u201d Sellafield said: \u201cThe Office for Nuclear Regulation\u2019s Civil Nuclear Security and Safeguards has notified us of its intention to prosecute the company relating to alleged past nuclear industry security regulations compliance. \u201cAs the issue is now the subject of active court proceedings, we are unable to comment further.\u201d"

            "title": "Diplomats fear growing power of Iranian factions that want nuclear weapons",
            "date": "2024-03-10T08:00:12Z",
            "content": "There are growing fears among diplomats in the US and Europe that Iran\u2019s largely unmonitored nuclear programme and the destabilisation caused by the Gaza conflict are strengthening the hand of Iranian factions that back the development of nuclear weapons. The Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, has reiterated in recent days that his country is pursuing a civilian nuclear programme for now. However, at a quarterly meeting last week of the governing board of the nuclear inspectorate, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the US and its European partners issued dire warnings about the threat posed by Iran\u2019s lack of cooperation on its nuclear programme. The IAEA director, Rafael Grossi, even admitted that that the inspectorate had lost \u201ccontinuity of knowledge about the production and stock of centrifuges, rotors, heavy water and uranium ore concentrate\u201d in Iran. Russia\u2019s envoy to the IAEA, Mikhail Ulyanov, also warned that the situation was \u201cfull of danger and risks getting out of control\u201d, though he placed the blame largely on the US walkout from the 2015 nuclear deal. The warnings came after the success of hardliners opposed to the 2015 deal constraining Iran\u2019s nuclear programme in last weekend\u2019s parliamentary elections. The elections were highly managed and in Tehran especially were marked by a very low turnout, but the parliament can nevertheless help frame domestic political debate. The sense of urgency has increased not just because Iran is enriching uranium at such a high level \u2013 very close to the 90% regarded as weapons grade \u2013 but also because in recent months senior Iranian figures have questioned Tehran\u2019s commitment to a solely civilian nuclear programme. The regional geopolitical context, including fears of the Gaza conflict metastasising into a wider Iran-Israel war, is also a factor, as is the knowledge that the 2015 nuclear deal expires in October next year, during a possible Donald Trump presidency, leading to the nuclear issue being removed from the UN security council agenda. Kasra Aarabi, the director of IRGC research at United against Nuclear Iran, said: \u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s refusal to impose direct consequences on Iran \u2013 despite its consistent acts of aggression since October 7, including an Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps proxy attack that killed three US soldiers in Syria \u2013 has emboldened the Iranian regime and made supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei and the IRGC believe the regime can escalate without facing any repercussions.\u201d Gen Michael Kurilla, the commander of US Central Command, warned the US armed services committee on Thursday that if Iran became a nuclear power it would \u201cchange the Middle East for ever\u201d. He added: \u201cThe key to deterrence is for Tehran to understand that this behaviour will have consequences for it,\u201d clarifying that \u201cthe deterrence is temporary\u201d. There have long been concerns about Tehran\u2019s answers \u2013 deemed as not credible by the IAEA \u2013 to questions about nuclear material found at three facilities and the extent to which weapons inspectors can do their job in the country, but the US is losing patience with what it describes as Iranian stonewalling. Laura Holgate, the US envoy to the IAEA, told the board last week: \u201cAfter five years of only limited, last-minute cooperation by Iran; five years of failure by Iran to follow through on its commitments; and five years of unresolved questions related to the presence of nuclear material at undeclared locations in Iran, we cannot allow Iran\u2019s current pattern of behaviour to continue.\u201d Holgate has asked for a definitive comprehensive report from Grossi on Iran\u2019s compliance before the next board meeting in June when the E3 group \u2013 Britain, France and Germany \u2013 will have to consider further sanctions via the UN. The E3 were equally blunt. In a statement, they said: \u201cIran has continued enriching uranium far beyond what it committed to in the JCPoA [the nuclear deal]. \u201cIran must now take serious and meaningful steps that show a genuine desire to de-escalate. Recent public statements made in Iran regarding its technical capabilities to produce nuclear weapons go in the opposite direction.\u201d The UK ambassador to the IAEA, Corinne Kitsell, said: \u201cAfter so many missed opportunities and lost time, the need for the board to hold Iran accountable to its legal obligations is long overdue.\u201d Iran insists it is willing to negotiate a follow-on version of the nuclear deal and talks in the background with the deputy foreign minister, Ali Bagheri, and his European counterparts continue. At the same time, Tehran is increasingly highlighting Israel\u2019s semi-declared nuclear weapon programme. The Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, told a Geneva disarmament conference in February that the Israeli regime was \u201cthe real source of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\u201d in the region. \u201cIt is necessary that the entire nuclear arsenal of this regime be eliminated and all of its nuclear facilities be placed under safeguards and verification mechanisms of the International Atomic Energy Agency,\u201d he said. Aarabi, of United against Nuclear Iran, said: \u201cThe remainder of this year will be extremely volatile, not least as there is growing mood within the regime that the next 10 months may present the best opportunity to move towards weaponisation prior to a potential new administration in White House.\u201d"

            "title": "Did Ukraine war lead Russian security services to neglect Islamist threat?",
            "date": "2024-03-24T15:00:32Z",
            "content": "As Russia observes a day of mourning for the victims of Friday\u2019s terror attack, along with the sorrow comes the hard question that follows most similar incidents: how could this have happened? Rooting out determined and well-trained terrorist cells is not an easy task for security services in any country, but there are numerous signs that failing to prevent Friday\u2019s attack was in large part down to a catastrophic security failure on the part of Russian authorities. First, there was the public warning from the US government earlier in March that it had learned of \u201cimminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow\u201d by terrorists. The warning, also shared privately with the Russian government, suggested Washington had picked up some fairly specific intelligence relating to an upcoming attack. But Putin, three days before the attack, brushed off these warnings, calling them an \u201cattempt to scare and intimidate our society\u201d. In light of Putin\u2019s public dismissal of the threat, it also seems Russian authorities did not take additional security measures to protect such large gatherings, with numerous witnesses talking of an extremely light security presence at the Crocus City Hall. The police response to the attacks was so slow that the handful of attackers were able to roam the venue at will, kill more than 100 people and then slip away without being apprehended or shot on the spot. For a country with a giant, sprawling security apparatus, this slow response is shocking. Some Russians pointedly compared the absent police response on Friday with the overwhelming police presence at the funeral of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, after his death in a Russian prison. \u201cThe FSB obviously had their priorities wrong. They had their main resources on Ukraine and on the domestic opposition. These are the priorities placed upon them from the top,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, an expert on the Russian security services. As the crackdown on dissent has intensified in the two years since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin\u2019s security services have gone after people who put likes on anti-war social media content, LGBTQ+ adolescents who can now be accused of \u201cextremism\u201d simply for attending gay club nights, and people laying flowers in memory of Navalny. Thousands of security officials have been sent away from their day jobs in Russia to manage the takeover of newly occupied parts of Ukraine, rounding up Ukrainian sympathisers and sowing terror in a foreign country rather than keeping an eye on security threats at home. There was also a feeling that the threat from domestic Islamist terrorism, ever-present during the first decade of Putin\u2019s rule, had subsided. Strong-arm tactics in the North Caucasus region, combined with allowing several thousand radicals to leave for Syria and Iraq several years ago, led to a feeling that the fight against Islamist terror was over. \u201cEverybody relaxed and there was a general feeling that there was no longer a serious threat,\u201d said one analyst who works on the phenomenon inside Russia. The dynamics at play in Friday\u2019s attack, with most of the perpetrators apparently radicalised citizens of Tajikistan, are different to the terror attacks in the early part of Putin\u2019s rule, when attackers tended to be from the North Caucasus. Galeotti said: \u201cCentral Asian Islamic terrorism remains a real problem for the FSB. The FSB has a lot of experience dealing with extremists in the Caucasus, they have spent huge resources on that, but central Asia is more of a blind spot.\u201d Predictably, in the aftermath of the attack, rumours and wild theories abounded about who might \u201creally\u201d have been responsible, even as Islamic State took responsibility for the bloodshed. Putin hinted at supposed Ukrainian links to the attacks, and Russian pro-war commentators went further, making a concerted effort to suggest that the Islamic State claims were a red herring and the attacks were actually organised by Kyiv. Ukraine has fiercely denied this. Meanwhile, Ukrainian military intelligence and some western commentators suggested the whole thing had been a \u201cfalse flag\u201d event, organised or facilitated by the Kremlin to consolidate the war effort in Ukraine. There is so far no evidence that either of these suggestions are true, although the coordinated claims of Ukrainian involvement by Russian sources do suggest that the Kremlin plans to use the aftermath of the attacks for political gain. The coming days will show whether the Kremlin\u2019s claims of Ukrainian involvement are simply a distraction tactic from the intelligence failure, or if they will be used to bolster a ramping up of war rhetoric. In many societies, there would be serious political questions raised after such an attack, but Putin rarely punishes subordinates for failures and will likely be keen to avoid too much talk of an intelligence catastrophe. \u201cYou would think heads should roll at the FSB, but there was no meaningful retribution for their intelligence failures during the invasion of Ukraine. Putin is hesitant to implement a major reshuffle,\u201d said Galeotti."

            "title": "No, you\u2019re the threat to democracy: Trump\u2019s latest alternate reality attack",
            "date": "2024-03-20T09:00:47Z",
            "content": "On the cusp of the election year, Donald Trump made a decision: knowing Joe Biden would structure his campaign around the threat Trump poses to US democracy, Trump would use the same line back at Biden. It was an unlikely bet, given that Trump is facing 88 criminal charges for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. But Trump started laying out that message last summer, sprinkling into his speeches the idea that the US president was \u201cgrossly incompetent\u201d and that such incompetence posed a threat to democracy. As charges rolled in against the former president, none of them lodged by Biden himself, he added the claim that Biden was also using his power to shut down his opponent, threatening democracy by engaging in \u201celection interference\u201d. As 6 January 2024 approached, three years after the insurrection, Trump ramped up his attempt to turn one of his liabilities against his opponent. On the 2024 campaign trail, Trump falsely claims to be a savior of democracy and, with increasing harshness, says Biden is the threat. At a rally in Ohio this month, Trump predicted an end to US democracy if he doesn\u2019t win the race. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to have another election in this country, if we don\u2019t win this election \u2026 certainly not an election that\u2019s meaningful,\u201d he said. The \u201cthreat to democracy\u201d retort was Trump\u2019s latest attempt at rebranding the truth, a practiced part of his effort to create an alternate reality for his disciples. In that mirror world, Trump is both the victim and the strongman, the only person who can drive out an underworld of deep-staters who control the country and have unjustly targeted him because he threatens their supposed dominance. The wealthy businessman casts himself as an everyman, the guy willing to say what others are thinking, no matter how uncouth. Jump to the timeline \u201cSomeone on his staff has made it clear that criticisms that he is anti-democratic are hurting his image,\u201d Edward Schiappa, a humanities professor who researches argumentation, media influence and rhetorical theory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an email. \u201cRather than fix the image, or otherwise moderate any of his lies, he has resorted to the Pee-wee Herman strategy of: \u2018I know you are but what am I?\u2019\u201d (Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story.) Trump\u2019s previous efforts to shift blame by warping criticisms of himself are legion. Fake news, which once referred to untrue articles online that fooled readers, became a retort to media critical of Trump. Not paying taxes makes him \u201csmart\u201d. Efforts to hold him accountable are \u201cwitch-hunts\u201d or a \u201choax\u201d. After being called out for racist words and actions, he claimed to be \u201cthe least racist person anywhere in the world\u201d \u2013 this, despite a track record of dehumanizing language aimed at immigrants. \u201cBelieve me,\u201d a man whose political career runs on a stack of falsehoods often tells his audiences. The seeds of these falsehoods culminated in the biggest lie he has attempted to get his followers, and in turn the American public, to believe: that he won an election he lost. That claim reverberates in all he does on the campaign trail in his attempt to return to the White House. Trump\u2019s attempt to cast himself as pro-democracy also coincides with more authoritarian language, saying he would be a dictator for a day and vowing to go after his political opponents, whom he called \u201cvermin\u201d. He called those arrested for storming the US Capitol \u201chostages\u201d rather than acknowledging the crimes they committed. Jennifer R Mercieca, a professor specializing in political rhetoric at Texas A&amp;M University, said she would have expected Trump to double down on his \u201cdictator for a day\u201d messaging rather than fall into this back-and-forth with Biden over who\u2019s better for democracy. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting and, in fact, a sign of weakness that Donald Trump is allowing Joe Biden to define this election as democracy versus autocracy,\u201d Mercieca said. Trump\u2019s consistent base doesn\u2019t need his new line about threats to democracy in order to vote for him; in fact, the far right of the Republican party, Trump\u2019s most ardent followers, favor some degree of authoritarianism. This inclination was on display at CPAC in February, where the far-right activist Jack Posobiec praised the insurrection and called for overthrowing democracy, though he later attempted to walk back the comments as partly satirical. \u201cWelcome to the end of democracy. We are here to overthrow it completely,\u201d Posobiec said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get all the way there on January 6, but we will endeavor to get rid of it.\u201d For that Trump-loving core group, being a Trump supporter is part of their core identity, Schiappa said. When Trump repeats a claim over and over, like that the 2020 election was stolen, it becomes part of that self-identity, making their beliefs and attitudes hard to charge, he said. It\u2019s an argument technique called \u201ctu quoque\u201d, essentially attacking an opponent\u2019s argument by pointing out a hypocrisy, but it\u2019s more understandable as the kind of language you\u2019d hear in a match of playground finger-pointing, not in a presidential election. \u201cThrough sheer repetition, aided by conservative news media, he has persuaded a group of devoted followers that what he speaks is true,\u201d Schiappa said. \u201cIt is similar to how a cult works in the sense that his followers are deeply invested in him \u2013 emotionally and for their own sense of identity. This combination leads a minority of Americans, who are sufficiently unmotivated or unable to consider alternative sources, to believe claims that rational adults know are false.\u201d Beyond that group for whom Trump is a part of their identity, his ability to sway beliefs is weaker. So who is this argument for? Given the democracy message\u2019s lack of needed appeal to his base, it would seem Trump is seeking out a less radical voter by starting to proclaim himself a savior of democracy. But, Schiappa noted, \u201coutside of self-identified conservatives, no, I do not think Trump\u2019s assertions that Biden represents a threat to democracy has much influence\u201d. Mercieca said it could be for donors, some of whom eschew Trump\u2019s authoritarian rhetoric. \u201cI think they don\u2019t want to give money to somebody who says they\u2019re going to end democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cThey still probably legitimately recognize that democracy is actually a better environment for business than autocracy.\u201d A timeline of key moments for Trump\u2019s \u201cthreat to democracy\u201d March 2023 In a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump calls on the audience to \u201ccomplete the job\u201d by sending him back to the White House so he can \u201creclaim our democracy\u201d. April 2023 Biden launches his re-election campaign with a video that frames his bid around freedom, equality and democracy. It includes imagery from the insurrection and calls out \u201cMaga extremists\u201d. A few days later, Trump speaks to a crowd at a rally in New Hampshire and references the launch video: \u201cHe states he\u2019s running because Trump and Maga pose a threat to democracy. Can you believe it? Maga is Make America Great Again, right? No threat there. No. \u201cIt\u2019s Biden who poses the threat to democracy because he is grossly incompetent, has no idea what he\u2019s doing, and basically he doesn\u2019t have a clue and that\u2019s a very bad position to put our country in. Our country\u2019s in a very dangerous position right now.\u201d June 2023 The US justice department charges Trump with 37 felonies related to keeping classified documents after he left the White House (more charges are later added). At an arraignment in Miami on 13 June, Trump pleads not guilty. That night, he rails against the charges and Biden, outside Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey. \u201cThis day will go down in infamy,\u201d Trump says. \u201cAnd Joe Biden will forever be remembered as not only the most corrupt president in the history of our country, but perhaps even more importantly, the president who together with a band of his closest thugs, misfits and Marxists tried to destroy American democracy. But they will fail and we will win bigger and better than ever before.\u201d August 2023 The special counsel Jack Smith spends much of 2023 working on an investigation into Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, culminating in a grand jury indicting Trump on 1 August 2023. At an Alabama Republican dinner on 4 August, Trump calls the indictment a \u201csham\u201d with \u201cfake charges\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not the ones trying to undermine American democracy,\u201d Trump says. \u201cWe are the ones fighting to save our democracy. We\u2019re fighting to save our democracy. This ridiculous indictment against us, it\u2019s not a legal case. It\u2019s an act of desperation by a failed and disgraced crooked Joe Biden and his radical-left thugs to preserve their grip on power.\u201d Elsewhere, in Fulton county, Georgia, a grand jury hands up an indictment of Trump on 14 August in another election subversion case, centered on the swing state in 2020. The sprawling case includes Trump and many of his allies and involves state racketeering and conspiracy charges. After his booking in Fulton county, Trump brings up his common line that the charges are \u201celection interference\u201d but doesn\u2019t mention Biden by name \u2013 the case is not brought by the US justice department, but by the local prosecutor Fani Willis. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is election interference. They\u2019re trying to interfere with an election. There\u2019s never been anything like it in our country before,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is their way of campaigning, and this is one instance, but you have three other instances. It\u2019s election interference.\u201d September 2023 Biden makes remarks a couple times that call out Trump as a threat to democracy and pins his re-election campaign on preserving US democracy, just as his 2020 election was. \u201cLet there be no question: Donald Trump and his Maga Republicans are determined to destroy American democracy,\u201d Biden says at a New York fundraiser. \u201cAnd I will always defend, protect and fight for our democracy.\u201d In an Arizona speech framed around democracy issues later that month, Biden calls out the Maga agenda but doesn\u2019t mention Trump by name much. He doesn\u2019t mention the charges against Trump, which come in part from Biden\u2019s justice department. \u201cThis Maga threat is a threat to the brick and mortar of our democratic institutions,\u201d Biden says in Arizona. In response to the speech, Trump\u2019s campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung gives NBC News a now familiar response: \u201cThe radical-left Democrats, now led by crooked Joe Biden, are the greatest threat to democracy the United States of America has ever faced.\u201d November 2023 In Colorado, a trial is under way that seeks to boot Trump from the ballot there, citing the 14th amendment as its basis. The amendment\u2019s third clause disqualifies Trump from holding the White House again, the filers argue, because he engaged in insurrection while he was an officer of the US. The case will eventually end up in the US supreme court, after Colorado becomes the first state to decide Trump is disqualified from appearing on the state\u2019s ballot, based on the amendment. In a speech in Iowa on 18 November, Trump brings up the cases now in several states that seek to keep him from returning to high office, calling them an \u201celection-rigging ballot-qualification scam\u201d. \u201cOur opponents are showing every day that they hate democracy,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re trying every illegal move they can to try and steal this election because they know that in a free and fair fight against President Trump and crooked Joe Biden, Biden doesn\u2019t have a shot. He\u2019s going to be going down into his basement again. He\u2019s going to be hiding.\u201d December 2023 On the campaign trail throughout the US, Trump keeps bringing up the democracy argument, solidifying its place in this election\u2019s stump speech for the former president. The third anniversary of 6 January is on the horizon, a date that Biden is expected to use to drive home his points that his re-election protects democracy from the threat posed by Trump and his followers. In Iowa on 2 December, Trump says: \u201cBiden and his radical left allies like to pose as standing up as allies of democracy. Joe Biden is not the defender of American democracy, Joe Biden is the destroyer of American democracy.\u201d His speech to the New York Young Republicans on 9 December is perhaps his most extensive broadside at Biden over democracy issues yet. He\u2019s not a threat to democracy, he says \u2013 he will \u201csave democracy\u201d. Biden is the threat, and the claims that Trump is the threat are a \u201choax\u201d. The media is part of the hoax, too, and is using it to deflect from the left\u2019s \u201cmonstrous abuses of power\u201d. \u201cWe call it now the threat-to-democracy hoax because that\u2019s what it is. These guys are so good with misinformation, disinformation, it\u2019s a slight difference,\u201d Trump says. The lines Trump uses to attack Biden on democracy issues come out with a bit more clarity after a few months of him using them here and there while campaigning: \u201cBiden is the real threat to democracy for two simple reasons. He\u2019s corrupt, and he\u2019s incompetent, grossly competent. But we have to fight Democrat misinformation at every corner if the Republican party is to survive.\u201d Back on the campaign trail in New Hampshire, on 16 December: \u201cWe\u2019re engaged in a righteous crusade to liberate this nation from a corrupt political class that is waging war on American democracy like never before.\u201d On 17 December, in Nevada: \u201cJoe Biden is a threat to democracy. They\u2019re weaponizing law enforcement for high-level election interference because we\u2019re beating them so badly in the polls.\u201d In the Nevada speech, Trump brings up one of the terms he has effectively turned on its head, depriving it of its previous meaning: fake news. It used to refer to stories published by sham outlets that were patently fake, but for years now, Trump has been using it to refer to media he doesn\u2019t like. \u201cWe have some great journalists and reporters, but mostly, for the most part, they\u2019re corrupt and fake. Hence the term fake news. That was a good one. We have a lot of good ones,\u201d he says. On 19 December, the Colorado supreme court rules that Trump is disqualified from the ballot because of the 14th amendment. In an Iowa speech that same day, Trump again calls Biden a threat to democracy. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder crooked Joe Biden and the far-left lunatics are desperate to stop us by any means necessary,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to violate the US constitution at levels never seen before in order to win this election. Joe Biden is a threat to democracy. It\u2019s a threat.\u201d January 2024 On the eve of the insurrection\u2019s anniversary, Biden delivers a speech going deep on democracy issues, saying a \u201cdetermined minority\u201d is doing all it can to \u201cdestroy our democracy\u201d. Trump won\u2019t condemn political violence, Biden says. He pledges that democracy is our \u201csacred cause\u201d that he will protect. \u201cThis is the first national election since [the] January 6 insurrection placed a dagger at the throat of American democracy,\u201d Biden says. In a response to Fox News Digital after the speech, Trump uses his practiced line: \u201cBecause of his gross incompetence, Joe Biden is a true threat to democracy.\u201d In the weeks following the 6 January anniversary, Trump keeps up his rhetoric about democracy. Back on the campaign trail, Trump tells supporters at an Iowa rally that a vote for him is a vote to \u201creclaim our democracy from crooked Joe Biden and the entire criminal class in our nation\u2019s capital\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s never happened, the weaponization of justice like they\u2019re doing right now,\u201d Trump says. \u201cThe DoJ is very corrupt. What they\u2019re doing is very corrupt. People aren\u2019t going to take it. Joe Biden is a threat to democracy. He\u2019s weaponizing law enforcement for a high-level election interference.\u201d After a court hearing about his claim of presidential immunity from prosecution, he says that the justice department\u2019s cases against him, playing out now during an election year where he\u2019s a candidate, are the \u201creal threat to democracy\u201d. At a New Hampshire rally again later that month, he says the prosecutions of his actions are more akin to what happens in \u201cbanana republics, third-world countries\u201d. \u201cJoe Biden is a threat to democracy. That\u2019s what it is. He\u2019s a threat to democracy,\u201d Trump tells the crowd. \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing there is so bad, it\u2019s a Pandora\u2019s box. It can happen the other way. And when it happens the other way, it\u2019s going to be a terrible thing, too. And that\u2019s not a threat. That\u2019s just the way life is. That\u2019s the way life works. It doesn\u2019t have to be me. It could be anybody else.\u201d He closes out the month in Las Vegas, reciting his stump speech about Biden being a threat to democracy because he\u2019s both incompetent and also interfering with Trump\u2019s re-election. \u201cIncompetence is a gross threat to democracy,\u201d Trump says. March 2024 At a 2 March rally in Richmond, Virginia, days before Biden\u2019s planned State of the Union address, Trump brings up the democracy line again, saying he\u2019s no threat. \u201cJoe Biden and his fascists that control him are the real threat to democracy in this country,\u201d Trump says. \u201cThey are a big threat, and they are corrupt. They are a big threat. He is the one. They have the standard line: \u2018Donald Trump is a threat to democracy.\u2019 Some advertising agency wrote that down. I\u2019m not a threat. I\u2019m the one that\u2019s ending the threat to democracy.\u201d Biden issues his State of the Union address on 7 March, an energetic defense of Democratic values, where he never uses Trump\u2019s name, instead referring to him as Biden\u2019s \u201cpredecessor\u201d. As expected, democracy is a cornerstone of the speech: Biden notes how democracy is under threat both in the US and around the world. \u201cJanuary 6 and the lies about the 2020 election, and the plots to steal the election, posed the gravest threat to our democracy since the civil war,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they failed. America stood strong and democracy prevailed. But we must be honest, the threat remains and democracy must be defended.\u201d Trump and his allies in Congress \u201cseek to bury the truth about January 6\u201d, the president says. But the moment calls for speaking the truth. \u201cAnd here\u2019s the simplest truth: you can\u2019t love your country only when you win,\u201d Biden says. \u201cAs I\u2019ve done ever since being elected to office, I ask you all, without regard to party, to join together and defend our democracy.\u201d On 9 March, both Biden and Trump hold rallies in Georgia. There, Trump responds to the State of the Union, calling it an \u201cangry, dark, hate-filled rant\u201d that wouldn\u2019t bring the country together. \u201cI\u2019m going to bring it together,\u201d Trump says. \u201cHe\u2019s a threat to democracy. I will tell you, he\u2019s a threat to democracy. Weaponize government. Weaponize the FBI. Weaponize the DoJ. He\u2019s a threat to democracy for other reasons also. No 1, he\u2019s grossly incompetent.\u201d In a 16 March speech in Ohio, Trump derides the court cases he faces and again calls the January 6 rioters \u201cpatriots\u201d and \u201chostages\u201d. He warns that there will be a \u201cbloodbath\u201d if he loses the race, though his campaign later claims Trump was talking about the effects on the auto industry and the economy. Biden\u2019s campaign says the comment was another sign of Trump\u2019s threats of political violence, saying :\u201cHe wants another January 6.\u201d In the speech, Trump starkly lays out what he thinks will happen if he loses the election: US democracy will end. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to have another election in this country, if we don\u2019t win this election \u2026 certainly not an election that\u2019s meaningful,\u201d he says."

            "content": "Unemployment rose and wage growth slowed in the three months to January as the UK labour market showed signs of weakness, reflecting a broader slowdown in the economy. The unemployment rate rose unexpectedly to 3.9 in January from 3.8% in December according to the Office for National Statistics, while annual average wages growth including bonuses fell to 5.6% from 5.8% in the previous month. City economists had expected unemployment to reman flat and pay growth to slow to a more modest 5.7%. Pay without bonuses also ticked lower, to 6.1% from 6.2% over the same three-month period. Employers cut back on hiring new staff, pushing the number of advertised vacancies down on the quarter by 43,000 to 908,000, indicating that the recession during the last six months of 2023 took a slightly bigger toll on the labour market than first estimated. The Bank of England has waited to see signs that wage growth is slowing before making a move to reduce interest rates, and is expected to view the latest figures as another reason to begin that process this year. However, more recent surveys have shown UK businesses regaining confidence in the economic outlook and preparing to raise prices as employees continue to receive pay rises above the rate of headline inflation, which is now 4% \u2013 still double the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. A rise in the number of people leaving the labour market, mostly due to ill-health, will also likely mean that employers struggle to find staff and wages growth falls slowly over the coming months. Tony Wilson, the director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said: \u201cIn all, there are well over half a million more people out of work than before the pandemic began. This is being driven by more young people and older people outside the labour force, and in particular because of more people reporting long-term health conditions that stop them from working. \u201cIn our view this is holding back the recovery as the economy is continuing to create jobs, with nearly a million unfilled vacancies reported today.\u201d The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the figures showed his plans to increase incomes were working. \u201cOur plan is working. Even with inflation falling, real wages have risen for the seventh month in a row. And take home pay is set for another boost thanks to our cuts to national insurance which in total are putting more than \u00a3900 a year back into the average earner\u2019s pocket,\u201d he said. Wilson said the rise in inactivity meant the government needed \u201ca different approach to how we reach and engage with people who are out of work and may want to come back to work\u201d. He added: \u201cIn particular our employment services need to be more accessible, inclusive and supportive. Employers need to play their part too, and do more to keep people in work and to open up opportunities for those who may need more support.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-21T00:34:58Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s jobless rate dived to 3.7% in February as employers shrugged off signs of an economic slowdown to boost staff numbers by triple the level expected. The unemployment rate last month fell from a seasonally adjusted 4.1% in January, the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed on Thursday. Economists had expected the jobless rate to come in at 4.0%. The economy added 116,600 \u2013 two-thirds of them full-time roles \u2013 in February compared with economists\u2019 forecast for a net gain of 40,000 positions. The unexpected surge in employment lowered the jobless rate to where it was half a year ago, said Bjorn Jarvis, ABS head of labour statistics. A shift in the way people were entering the market affected the February result. \u201cIn 2022 and 2023, around 4.3% of employed people in February had not been employed in January,\u201d Jarvis said. \u201cIn 2024 this was higher, at 4.7%, and well above the pre-pandemic average for 2015 to 2020 of around 3.9%.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The result dumbfounded economists, with Moody\u2019s Analytics\u2019 Harry Murphy Cruise describing the labour market as \u201call topsy-turvy\u201d. \u201cEmployment is seesawing from month to month \u2013 but not because employers can\u2019t make up their minds or are second-guessing their hires,\u201d Murphy Cruise said. \u201cInstead, it reflects changes to the way and time we work throughout the year.\u201d \u201cRecent monthly labour force movements are gobbledegook,\u201d he said, adding the trend figures offered a clearer picture of a jobs market that was \u201cever-so-slowly weakening\u201d. The participation rate was 66.7%, an increase from the revised 66.6% rate in January. Hours worked rose 2.8%, or 53m, reversing a similar slide in the first month of 2024. Australia\u2019s economy slowed to a crawl in the final three months of 2023, growing just 0.2%, as 13 interest rate rises by the Reserve Bank to quash inflation took their toll. The labour market had been weakening since September, when the jobless rate was 3.6%, although that level was close to half-century lows. The RBA\u2019s February forecasts has the unemployment rate creeping higher to 4.2% by June and 4.3% by the year\u2019s end. Earlier this week, RBA governor Michele Bullock indicated a rapid increase in unemployment could prompt the central bank to start cutting its key interest rate provided inflation continued on its slowing path towards a 2%-3% target range. \u201cThe judgment at the moment is that the labour market is still slightly on the tight side, and that\u2019s on the basis that the unemployment rate is still much lower than it was pre-pandemic,\u201d Bullock said on Tuesday after the RBA left rates steady for a third meeting in a row. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping a keen eye also on employment numbers, because as I\u2019ve said before, we want to hold on to as many gains in the labour market as we can,\u201d she said. Tuesday\u2019s figures were interpreted by investors to imply the RBA will be less likely to cut interest rates soon. The dollar rose to 66.06 US cents from about 65.95 US cents prior to the release. Stocks also pared their gains for the day from about 0.6% to slightly more than 0.4%. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the jobs figures were \u201ca remarkable result\u201d. \u201cDespite everything that\u2019s coming at us from around the world, inflation is moderating and our labour market remains one of our greatest strengths with unemployment remaining below its pre-pandemic average and participation at near record highs,\u201d Chalmers said, adding the government expects conditions to soften. Ben Udy, lead economist for Oxford Economics Australia, said \u201cthe recovery in employment in February was stronger than we, or anyone else had forecast, and highlights the continued tightness of the Australian labour market\u201d. \u201cThese data clearly challenge the view that monetary policy is providing enough of a drag on the economy to bring down wage growth and inflation,\u201d Udy said. The labour market results varied widely across the country. South Australia\u2019s unemployment rate dropped to 3.2% from a reported 4% in January. New South Wales also saw a big decline, with the rate falling to 3.6% from 4.1%. Western Australia also posted a big slide \u2013 0.6 percentage points \u2013 to 3.6%, with Queensland also easing to 3.9% from 4.2%. The laggards were Victoria, where the rate was steady at 3.9%, and Tasmania \u2013 which goes to the polls this Saturday \u2013 also moving sideways to 4.5%. The Northern Territory posted a rise in the jobless rate to 4.4% from 3.9%, while the other territory (ACT) notched a slightly lower rate of 4.2% from January\u2019s 4.3% pace. The jobs bonanza in February came as the nation added almost 550,000 net migrants in the year to September, the ABS said in a separate release. About 145,200 more people arrived than left in the September quarter alone. Welfare groups in particular were worried the RBA might wait too long for signs of a weaker labour market before taking an axe to interest rates. \u201cUnemployment is the last domino to fall,\u201d Peter Davidson, an economist with the Australian Council of Social Service, said prior to today\u2019s data release. \u201cOnce the number of vacancies is reduced, and employers have reduced working hours for part-time workers, then they start to lay people off or not take people on as quickly.\u201d"

Inflation ticked higher across the US last month, rising at an annual pace of 3.2%, up slightly from 3.1% the previous month. Economists had expected a reading of 3.1%. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve are working to bring inflation down to 2%. On the month, the index rose by 0.4% in February. This was also up slightly from 0.3% the previous month. The so-called \u201ccore\u201d consumer price index, a closely watched measure of inflation which removes volatile food and energy costs, slipped from an annual rate of 3.9% in January to 3.8% last month \u2013 but this was also higher than expected. The strength of this reading is likely to test confidence that the Fed, which aggressively increased interest rates in a bid to reduce inflation, could soon begin cutting them. Shelter costs like rent, airline fares, motor vehicle insurance and the price of clothes all rose last month, according to Tuesday\u2019s report from the labor department, driving the headline inflation indices higher. Some grocery prices decreased, however, including dairy products and fruit and vegetables.

Take care! \u2013 JK Manchester United posted record revenues for the October to December quarter as it participated in the Champions League \u2013 while the football club\u2019s early exit from Europe will only show up in future financial results. The club made revenues of \u00a3225.8m in the three months to December, up 35% from a year earlier, \u201cdriven primarily by UEFA Champions League participation benefit and continued strong Matchday momentum with record attendance for all teams\u201d. United\u2019s wage bill rose by 23% to \u00a395m, mainly because of its participation in the Champions League this season, compared to the Europa League last year. However, it dropped out of the Champions League in December after a home defeat to Bayern Munich. The company reported a net profit of \u00a320.4m for the quarter, up from \u00a36.3m a year earlier, its latest financial results showed. Losses in the first half, the six months to December, narrowed to \u00a35.3m from \u00a320.2m. United announced the completion of the minority investment by the British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Ratcliffe, the owner of the Ineos chemicals group, spent just over \u00a31bn to buy a 25% stake in the club in December, and pledged a further $300m investment in infrastructure at Old Trafford \u2013 of which $200m (\u00a3157m) has been received so far. The results show no dividends were paid to its majority owners, the Glazer family. United also revealed its total borrowings amounted to \u00a3774m at the end of last year \u2013 $650m (\u00a3507m) in long term debt, relating to the Glazers\u2019 buyout, and a revolving credit facility of \u00a3267m. Cliff Baty, chief financial officer, said: We delivered strong revenues during the first half of the fiscal year and have reiterated our guidance for record revenues for the full fiscal year. This is an exciting time at Manchester United following the completion of Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s investment, and we are all focused on working together with our new co-owners to drive the club forward and deliver success on the pitch. The UK\u2019s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has today raided two sites and made three arrests across the south of England, as part of a new investigation into an alleged \u00a376m fraud involving luxury care homes. The raids in St Leonard\u2019s, Dorset and Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire are part of an investigation into the UK registered property developer, the Carlauren Group, which collapsed into administration in November 2019, requiring some elderly residents to vacate their homes and leaving more than 600 investors out of pocket, the SFO said. Over four years, the Carlauren Group purchased 23 properties across the UK, mostly former hotels including the historic Windlestone Hall in Durham, offering an annual 10% return on investment in its renovation of these properties into high-end care homes. Only nine of the properties were ever operational and some continued to be run as hotels, instead of homes. The group also bought a number of vehicles purportedly for the company including two Lamborghinis, a Mclaren 570GT, a private jet and two yachts, the SFO said. More than 600 people and companies invested in the scheme via purchase of rooms, that were to be rented out to elderly residents, in facilities that boasted of swimming pools, room service and other luxury amenities. Rooms were advertised widely and sold with a guaranteed annual payout and the opportunity to resell the asset back with up to a 25% profit after 10 years, the SFO said. Nick Ephgrave, the SFO\u2019s director, said: This company\u2019s abrupt collapse has created turmoil and enormous anxiety for many, with elderly people forced to vacate their homes and investors left with nothing. Today\u2019s arrests are a major development in our investigation and a step towards getting the answers so many people need. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said: The second-consecutive 0.4% month-on-month increase in core consumer prices index in February leaves Fed officials some way from attaining the \u201cgreater confidence\u201d needed to begin cutting interest rates. The annual rate of core CPI inflation edged down to a still-elevated 3.8%, from 3.9%. Nevertheless, we still believe there is plenty of disinflationary pressure to feed through, particularly with unit labour cost growth back down to its pre-pandemic rate. On balance, we expect the Fed to begin cutting interest rates in June, by which time there will be more evidence of core PCE [personal consumption expenditures] inflation moving close to the 2% target. But that will now require a shift in tone in the March CPI data. Inflation in the US unexpectedly edged up to 3.2% last month, suggesting that price growth remains stubborn and that the Federal Reserve probably won\u2019t be in a rush to cut interest rates. The headline figure rose from 3.1% in January, according to official data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists had expected the rate to stay at 3.1%. Excluding volatile items like food and energy, the \u2018core\u2019 measure of inflation fell from 3.9% to 3.8%, the lowest since May 2021, but was higher than the 3.7% forecast by Wall Street. Britain\u2019s productivity record has been so bad in the 15 years since the global financial crisis that the only way is up. That was the guardedly optimistic message from David Miles, a member of the Office for Budget Responsibility, when giving evidence to MPs on the Treasury committee this morning. Miles said in the years since the financial crisis, productivity growth in the UK had fallen from 2.5% a year on average to 0.5%, and added that the economy would have been 30% bigger had the pre-crisis trend continued. We are all a lot worse off. It is an educated \u2013 and perhaps not terribly educated guess \u2013 that the past 15 years have been so bad it is likely the next 5-10 years will be a bit better. Miles thinks there is a good chance the use of artificial intelligence will help boost productivity in Britain\u2019s service sector, but even so doesn\u2019t expect productivity to return to its pre-GFC trend. Miles joined the OBR\u2019s budget responsibility committee in January 2022. He retains a part-time professorship of financial economics at Imperial College in London. Starling Bank has finally named a new CEO. Raman Bhatia will be shifting sectors, moving from energy retailer Ovo, to lead the online-only lender by early summer. He will take over from interim boss, and former chief operating officer, John Mountain. Bhatia does have experience in the banking sector, though, having previously served as head of digital banking for HSBC\u2019s UK and European arm. As a member of HSBC\u2019s executive committee, he also had responsibility for its First Direction and M&amp;S Bank operations. Bhatia\u2019s appointment comes roughly a year after founder Anne Boden stepped down in a surprise move that she said was designed to shield the online bank from potential concerns over a conflict of interest, because she is a major shareholder. Starling chair David Sproul said: We see significant opportunities for Starling under Raman\u2019s leadership as the economy stabilises, as our truly differentiated offering for personal and small business customers wins market share in the UK, and as our Engine by Starling software-as-a-Service business secures further international contracts. Karen Noye, mortgage expert at the wealth management firm Quilter, said the figures \u201cpaint a very worrying picture of the mortgage market\u201d. This shows that the large increase in mortgage rates seen over the last couple of years is really starting to bite for some borrowers and this is unfortunately causing them to fall into arrears as they simply can\u2019t afford to keep up with their increased payments. The changes to national insurance and child benefit at the budget last week, will barely help considering many people will have seen their mortgage payments shoot up by \u00a3300 or more a month. She advised people who are worried about falling into arrears to contact their lender as soon as possible as there are options that can help ease the pain such as going onto a cheaper interest-only mortgage, or setting up a payment plan. Positively, the statistics show that new arrears cases decreased by 2.6% from the previous quarter, to 13.2% of the total outstanding balances with arrears, but remained 0.2% higher than a year earlier. This may well continue to climb again though as more people come off fixed term mortgages set when rates were low. Elsewhere, the data points to a market in a deep freeze similarly suffering from the higher rates. While house prices have remained resilient, the value of new mortgage commitments (lending agreed to be advanced in the coming months) decreased by 6.6% from the previous quarter to \u00a346bn, and was 21.2% lower than a year earlier. This illustrates a serious lack of demand and although prices continue to be buoyant if this dearth in demand continues prices may return to a downward trajectory. Turning to the buy to let market, she said: The various measures to make the buy to let market less attractive by the government are clearly having their intended impact as the share of gross mortgage advances for buy-to-let purposes (covering house purchase, remortgage and further advance) decreased by 0.5% from the previous quarter to 7.0%, the lowest since 2010 Q3. The changes to the holiday let rules at the budget may also make things even worse for landlords who have been hit with numerous changes to the buy to let tax landscape in recent years making it a less attractive option. This has resulted in many leaving the market. The value of UK mortgages in arrears has risen sharply, indicating that households are struggling with high interest rates. The value of outstanding mortgage balances with arrears increased by 9.2% between October and December from the previous quarter, to \u00a320.3bn, and was 50.3% higher than a year earlier, according to Bank of England figures released today. Loan balances with arrears made up 1.23% of all outstanding mortgage balances, up from 1.12% the previous quarter, and the highest since the end of 2016. Michelle Lawson, director at mortgage broker Lawson Financial, said on Newspage: This data makes for grim reading but is sadly not unexpected. People don\u2019t have bottomless pockets and this data places stark emphasis on that fact. Household finances are set to spontaneously combust if the current level of pressure on them continues. You\u2019d like to think the Monetary Policy Committee will read this report given that the Bank of England produced it. Today\u2019s labour market data show more than a fifth of people aged over 16 were economically inactive between November and January, which means they weren\u2019t working or looking for a job. This is some 9.2 million people \u2013 700,000 more than before the Covid pandemic. A rise in long-term illness has been cited as a main reason. Those classed as economically inactive include students, those who care for the elderly or look after young children, people with disabilities and those taking early retirement. \u2022 This post and headline were amended at 11.41 GMT. More than a fifth of people aged over 16 were economically inactive, rather than people aged between 16 and 24 as mistakenly reported in an earlier version. Here is our full story on the data: And here is some analysis: Pets at Home said it is disappointed and frustrated with the UK competition watchdog\u2019s findings on vet pricing. The Competition and Markets Authority is worried that large chains are squeezing out small independent practices with negative effects for the UK\u2019s 16 million pet owners, and plans a formal investigation into the \u00a32bn industry. The watchdog is concerned that pet owners are finding it difficult to access basic information like price lists and prescription costs \u2013 and are potentially overpaying for medicines. Since 2013, about 1,500 of the 5,000 vet practices in the UK have been acquired by six of the largest corporate groups: CVS, IVC, Linnaeus, Medivet, Pets at Home and VetPartners, the CMA said. Pets at Home, whose shares fell nearly 7% on the news in early trading but are now down 2.3%, said: We are incredibly disappointed the CMA\u2019s findings today do not fully reflect our unique business model of locally-owned vet practices. Whilst our brand is national, our veterinary practices are led by individual entrepreneurial vets who have clinical and operational freedom. They choose all pricing, products and services to ensure the best care for clients and their much-loved pets in their local area, which promotes competition in the market and helps to keep prices low. We have been working closely with the CMA on their areas of concern and will continue to do so as their inquiry progresses to ensure the distinctiveness of our model is fully recognised. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at the global hiring platform Indeed, has looked at today\u2019s UK labour market figures. Today\u2019s Office for National Statistics figures paint a familiar picture of further gradual softening in the labour market and easing pay pressures, but it remains an incremental process. Regular pay growth edged down to 6.1% year-on-year in the three months to January, from 6.2% in the previous period, but is still running well above levels where the Bank of England would be comfortable initiating interest rate cuts. Elsewhere, the figures point to ongoing constraints on labour supply, with low unemployment and inactivity well above its pre-pandemic level. But the dubious veracity of the Labour Force Survey data makes it harder to accurately gauge underlying dynamics and the extent to which conditions for a sustained moderation of pay pressures are falling into place. Rate setters remain focused on a range of forward indicators of pay pressures as a guide. He said Indeed Wage Tracker data on advertised pay for new hires shows a similar picture of gradual easing. But at 6.3% year-on-year in February, down from 6.5% in January, it remains high and is only down around one percentage point from last summer\u2019s peak. Posted wage growth remains particularly strong in lower-paid occupations like childcare, cleaning, retail and hospitality, running in the 7-9% range. Though the labour market has cooled, hiring challenges persist in these areas and continue to support pay increases. The latest round of supermarket wage hikes is the most recent example of this, in advance of a 9.8% rise in the National Living Wage coming into effect in April. The UK arm of the German supermarket chain Aldi has raised staff pay for the second time this year. Hourly rates for store assistants and deputy store managers will rise from \u00a312.00 to \u00a312.40 outside the M25, and from \u00a313.55 to \u00a313.65 within the M25, from 1 June. Aldi claims its new national minimum rate of \u00a312.40 an hour for store assistants and deputy store managers is the highest level of entry pay paid by a supermarket in the UK. Aldi is also the only supermarket to offer paid breaks, which for the average store colleague is worth more than \u00a3900 a year. It is the UK\u2019s fourth-largest supermarket and has more than 1,000 stores, 11 regional distribution centres and 45,000 staff across Britain. Aldi is vying with its fellow German-owned discounter Lidl to be the UK\u2019s fastest-growing grocery chain, with both benefiting as the ongoing cost of living crisis has prompted more people to switch to discount chains to save money. On 1 April, the UK\u2019s national living wage will go up by almost 10% to \u00a311.44 an hour for full-time workers aged 21 and over. This will benefit nearly 3 million low-paid people. Shares in Persimmon fell 3.7%, making it the biggest loser on the FTSE 100 in early trading, after the housebuilder reported a 33% drop in home completions and a halving in annual profits, and flagged a \u201csubdued\u201d outlook. Persimmon completed 9,922 new homes last year, down sharply from 14,868 in 2022. Profit before tax more than halved to \u00a3352m. Dean Finch, the chief executive, said: With interest rates expected to remain at current levels and a general election on the horizon, market conditions are expected to remain subdued throughout 2024. Pets at Home shares have fallen nearly 7% after the UK\u2019s competition watchdog said it planned an investigation into vet pricing, after an initial review threw up multiple issues. Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, has looked at this. The UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has completed its initial investigation into unfair practices in the vet space. The review has thrown up multiple concerns that the CMA feels are worth digging further into, most of which centre around large vet groups having major footholds in certain markets. This will come as a blow to vet groups like CVS which saw its valuation come under pressure back when the initial investigations were announced. There\u2019s still no formal action being taken, and if there is it\u2019s likely to be around improving awareness for pet owners rather than severe sanctions on the vet sector. Nonetheless, markets don\u2019t like uncertainty, and this is a dark cloud looming over the sector. In financial markets, the FTSE 100 index in London has opened higher, taking its lead from Asian markets overnight (Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose almost 3% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei was little changed). The UK blue-chip index is currently trading almost 60 points higher at 7,7728, a 0.8% gain. Germany\u2019s Dax opened 0.4% higher while the French and Spanish indices rose 0.3% at the open. In Germany, inflation slowed to 2.7% in February, according to final figures. Consumer price growth slowed from 3.1% in January, the German statistics office said. Markets are eagerly awaiting inflation data from the US, out at 12.30pm GMT, which is expected to show the rate unchanged at 3.1%. Stephen Evans, who runs the Learning and Work Institute and previously worked for the Treasury, said: The labour market shows signs of slowing with vacancies and employment down as weak economic growth takes its toll, though the data need to be treated with caution. The UK is the only G7 country where employment is lower than pre-pandemic. With the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasting further increases in economic inactivity, the government needs to revisit its approach given that only one in ten out-of-work disabled and older people currently get employment support. Nominal earnings grew at an annualised 3.5% over the last quarter, broadly consistent with the Bank of England\u2019s inflation target and adding to the case that interest rates have peaked. The good news is real earnings continue to grow as inflation falls. But the bigger picture is people are earning \u00a312,000 per year on average less than if pre-financial crisis trends had continued. That\u2019s a nightmare we have to end. Tony Wilson, director at the Institute for Employment Studies, said: Today\u2019s jobs figures show that the labour market remains pretty subdued. The employment rate is broadly flat but still about one percentage point below where it was before the pandemic, even though unemployment has fallen back to where it was. So as has been the story in previous months, there are fewer people in work because there are more people outside the labour force altogether \u2013 not looking or not available for work. In all, there are well over half a million more people out of work than before the pandemic began. This is being driven by more young people and older people outside the labour force, and in particular because of more people reporting long-term health conditions that stop them from working. In our view this is holding back the recovery as the economy is continuing to create jobs, with nearly a million unfilled vacancies reported today. This reiterates that we need a different approach to how we reach and engage with people who are out of work and may want to come back to work, and in particular our employment services need to be more accessible, inclusive and supportive. Employers need to play their part too, and do more to keep people in work and to open up opportunities for those who may need more support. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Unemployment has gone up in the UK, with the jobless rate unexpectedly rising, while pay growth has slowed, reflecting wider weakness in the economy. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 3.9% in the three months to January from 3.8%, according to the Office for National Statistics, at a time when the economy entered into recession. City economists had expected the rate to remain unchanged. The number of people claiming jobless benefits increased by 16,800 in February. Employment growth has tailed off, from an increase of 72,000 in the three months to December to a fall of 21,000 in the three months to January. As employers cut back on hiring people, the number of job vacancies in the economy declined, by 43,000 to 908,000 in the three months to February. (But they remain more than 100,000 above their pre-pandemic level.) Average earnings grew by 5.6% between November and January, down from 5.8% in the previous three months. Excluding bonuses, pay growth slowed from 6.2% to 6.1%. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: The easing in wage growth in January is probably still a bit too slow for the Bank of England\u2019s liking. But there are encouraging signs that a more marked slowdown is just around the corner and that an interest rate cut in June is possible. The Bank of England wants to see evidence that wage growth is slowing before cutting borrowing costs. The chancellor of the exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, said: Our plan is working. Even with inflation falling, real wages have risen for the seventh month in a row. And take home pay is set for another boost thanks to our cuts to National Insurance which in total are putting over \u00a3900 a year back into the average earner\u2019s pocket. Britain\u2019s competition watchdog plans to launch a formal investigation into vet pricing, as it has multiple concerns, including that pet owners might be overpaying for medicines or prescriptions. After taking a look at the market for the UK\u2019s 16 million pet owners, the Competition and Markets Authority flagged these concerns: Consumers may not be given enough information to enable them to choose the best veterinary practice or the right treatment for their needs. Concentrated local markets, in part driven by sector consolidation, may be leading to weak competition in some areas. Large corporate groups may have incentives to act in ways which reduce choice and weaken competition. Pet owners might be overpaying for medicines or prescriptions. The regulatory framework is outdated and may no longer be fit for purpose. Referring to the watchdog\u2019s concerns, Sarah Cardell, chief executive, said: These include pet owners finding it difficult to access basic information like price lists and prescription costs \u2013 and potentially overpaying for medicines. We are also concerned about weak competition in some areas, driven in part by sector consolidation, and the incentives for large corporate groups to act in ways which may reduce competition and choice. If it finds the market is not working as it should, the CMA can impose measures such as mandating the provision of certain information to consumers, imposing maximum prescription fees and ordering the sale or disposal of a business or assets. Most vet practices do not display prices on their website \u2013 of those practices checked, over 80% had no pricing information online, even for the most basic services. People are not always informed of the cost of treatment before agreeing to it \u2013 around one fifth of respondents to its call for information said that they were not told of the cost before agreeing to tests. Some vet practices make up to a quarter of their income selling medicines, so there may be little incentive to make pet owners aware of alternatives, the CMA said. A company can own multiple vet practices in a local area without making that clear. The share of vet practices that belong to large corporate groups has shot up to almost 60% from 10% in 2013. The CMA has launched a four-week consultation on the proposal to launch a market investigation. The Agenda 12.30pm GMT: US Inflation for February (forecast: 3.1%, previous: 3.1%)"

Australia may yet extend the buzzwords to include \u201cimmaculate migration\u201d, at least as far the workforce expanding fast enough to absorb record rates of newcomers. (Housing net migrants totalling about 550,000 in the past year might be more tricky.) Some pullback in January\u2019s jobless rate of 4.1% was expected, but no pundit came close to forecasting that it would plunge to 3.7% last month. The extra 117,000 jobs, or 4,000 a day, was the biggest monthly increase excluding pandemic distortions in a decade, Reuters reported. Labour market figures have been notably volatile lately. February might prove to be as rogue a month as December, when employers shed 65,200 jobs from their payrolls. The Australian Bureau of Statistics also revised January\u2019s net jobs gain by almost 15,000. The increase would have been bigger yet, but many people with jobs lined up opted to delay their start until February, contributing to last month\u2019s stellar result. Labour market trends look to be a better guide than seasonally adjusted numbers, but even the trend unemployment rate has mostly flatlined since September and was 3.8% in February. \u201c[It\u2019s] a remarkable outcome, especially when combined with the rapid improvement of inflation over the same period,\u201d Moody\u2019s Analytics economist Harry Murphy Cruise said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The UBS economist George Tharenou said that while labour force surveys were historically volatile, \u201cextreme moves are making data unreliable\u201d. The three-month job creation average had slowed to 23,000 a month from 40,000 previously. \u201cThis implies the momentum of the labour market is easing, but is nowhere near as weak as it appeared in the prior release,\u201d Tharenou said. The employment figures were understandably welcomed by an Albanese government that had reason to brace for a much less robust result. Treasury\u2019s mid-year update had forecast the jobless rate would rise to 4.25% by June, a prediction that now looks pessimistic. Similarly, its projected budget deficit of $1.1bn now looks to be a certain surplus. The Reserve Bank\u2019s assessment, though, will matter more to borrowers. Its latest modelling had the unemployment rate rising to 4.2% by mid-year. Traders had been rating as an 80% chance that the first RBA interest rate cut would land in August, but that tally dropped to 60% after the jobs figures according to Bloomberg. The RBA governor, Michele Bullock, aside from \u201cnot ruling anything in or out\u201d, has made it clear that bringing down inflation remains the central bank\u2019s top priority. Just what constitutes full employment \u2013 the lesser half of the RBA\u2019s duel mandate \u2013without pumping up or deflating prices remains an enigma. \u201cDo we know what that level is? No, we don\u2019t,\u201d Bullock told a press conference on Tuesday after leaving rates on hold. \u201cWe think [the sustainable jobless rate] might be \u2026 between 4% and 4.5%, but we don\u2019t know where it is.\u201d \u201cSo all we can do is tread carefully,\u201d she added. Next Wednesday will provide Bullock and fellow RBA board members more guidance of how hard they still need to stomp on inflation when the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases February inflation figures. The more thorough guidance won\u2019t land until Anzac Day eve when March quarter inflation figures get released. If the inflation outlook remains uncertain, there are reasons to think demand for workers will hold up for some time. ABS figures out on Tuesday showed Australia\u2019s population increased 2.5% to a record 26.8 million in the year to 30 September 2023. Net overseas migration contributed 83% of the increase, KPMG noted. Eventually housing construction will have to pick up to accommodate our swelling numbers. Also still requiring lots of extra hands is the country\u2019s pipeline of major works, worth $230bn over five years, the Property Council noted this week. \u201cIt is estimated that, in order to meet demand, our labour supply alone will need to grow by 127%,\u201d the council said. No wonder Bullock said that \u201cthe labour market is still slightly on the tight side\u201d. It\u2019s a view only reinforced \u2013 and then some \u2013 by today\u2019s numbers."

            "content": "By historical standards Britain\u2019s current recession is a mild one, but even so weak activity is starting to take its toll on the labour market. Nothing dramatic is happening. Unemployment is up a bit but the jobless rate remains below 4%. The number of people employed fell slightly and job vacancies continued to decrease, although the total of 908,000 remains above pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, as the annual inflation rate has fallen so pay growth has moderated too. For the time being at least workers\u2019 living standards are rising because wages are rising more rapidly than prices. The big picture is that the labour market is still relatively tight given the fact that the economy has been moving sideways for the best part of two years. There has been no large-scale job shedding and there are still shortages of workers in many sectors. In anticipation of the recession being short-lived, employers are hanging on to their existing staff because they are worried they will have problems recruiting when the economy does start to pick up. So while pay levels are coming down, they are probably not coming down quickly enough to prompt the Bank of England into an immediate cut in interest rates. Private sector regular pay \u2013 an indicator closely watched by Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee \u2013 was 6.1% higher in the three months ending January 2024 than in the same quarter a year earlier. That is well down on last summer\u2019s peak of 8.2% but slightly higher than the Bank has been forecasting. With inflation poised to fall from 4% to about 2% within the next few months, further moderation in earnings growth is likely. Even so, the latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggests the structural labour market problems remain unresolved. As Tony Wilson, the director of the Institute for Employment Studies thinktank points out, at 75% the UK\u2019s employment rate for those aged 16 to 64 is a percentage point lower than it was before the arrival of the pandemic four years ago even though unemployment has fallen back to where it was pre-Covid. \u201cSo as has been the story in previous months, there are fewer people in work because there are more people outside the labour force altogether \u2013 not looking or not available for work. In all, there are well over half a million more people out of work than before the pandemic began,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThis is being driven by more young people and older people outside the labour force, and in particular because of more people reporting long-term health conditions that stop them from working.\u201d That is not good for those who are not well enough to work. It is not good for the economy either."

The wisdom of intervention needs to be assessed case by case, not with his blanket critique. He should reflect on where he has gone wrong before. In 2001, before 9/11, Nato launched Operation Essential Harvest, sending in thousands of troops to what is now North Macedonia to collect weapons from an insurgent group as part of the Ohrid agreement. It worked: a looming civil war in the Balkans was snuffed out; North Macedonia is at peace and now a Nato member. However, as it got under way, Mr Jenkins, then with the Times, referred to Essential Harvest as \u201cbizarre\u201d and \u201cthe craziest mission British soldiers have endured at the hands of politicians\u201d. Predicting a mission of indefinite duration done to save face for the then British defence secretary, George Robertson, he predicted: \u201cThese half-baked, short-term interventions merely turn local brushfires into major conflicts.\u201d Given the outcome, he could not have been more wrong, but in the succeeding two decades he has clearly not learned. Intervention has not always turned out well, but arguing we should never intervene is as useless as arguing we should always intervene.

Russia is relying on dire warnings about escalation to scare us into giving them a free hand to do more, and that is what we should fear most. It is not our action that is the biggest risk of escalation, but our inaction. Mark Laity Nato spokesman in North Macedonia, 2001 \u2022 Simon Jenkins\u2019 interpretation of the west\u2019s justified objective in Ukraine as being \u201cto help foil Putin\u2019s attempt to topple Kyiv\u2019s elected government\u201d is interesting, if idiosyncratic. As is his view that \u201cthis was achieved in a matter of months\u201d. To topple Kyiv\u2019s democratically elected government was but one element in Vladimir Putin\u2019s intention to wipe Ukraine off the map of Europe and annexe it as a province of Russia. This was clearly stated in his infamous essay, written before the Revolution of Dignity was even dreamt of and reiterated in Dmitry Medvedev\u2019s inflammatory statements. The invasion was and is in flagrant breach of international law and threatens far more than Ukraine. As the Baltic states keep warning us, this threatens the whole world order and the inviolability of sovereign state borders as recognised in international law. It has global consequences. Nato has havered and been slow in its support, though it has members that recognise the enormity of the situation and is getting clearer in its intentions. These are times when we cannot afford to be intimidated by Putin\u2019s threats, when peace has to be fought for if it is not to turn into appeasement, with all the dire consequences that follow from that.

            "date": "2024-03-11T12:13:45Z",
            "content": "Under the driving rain of a Brussels springtime, the Swedish flag was raised on Monday outside Nato\u2019s headquarters. The organisation\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, welcomed the alliance\u2019s newest member in its native language: \u201cTo all Swedes, I say: \u2018V\u00e4lkommen till Nato\u2019.\u201d The Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson , vowed that his country would be a \u201cproud member\u201d driven by \u201cunity and solidarity\u201d. But, while he basks in the glow of his country finally joining Nato after months of delays, Sweden\u2019s once thriving peace movement is smarting. Once widely visible in debates and on the streets \u2013 particularly over nuclear weapons, disarmament and the Vietnam war \u2013 the movement had already been on the wane since the end of the cold war. But at the Olof Palme International Centre in Stockholm, a short walk from where the peace campaigner and former Swedish prime minister was assassinated, there is a feeling that ever since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the subject of peace has disappeared from public debate. Anna Sundstr\u00f6m, the secretary general of the centre, a democracy and social justice organisation, said: \u201cIt was perceived to be totally naive to talk about peace. That space was not there. We were called \u2018naive\u2019 or \u2018Putinist\u2019, making an argument that was only serving the interests of Russia.\u201d Instead, Sweden rapidly made the decision to apply to join Nato, abruptly ending its 200 years of military non-alignment and issuing warnings that the Nordic country \u2013 whose neighbours are Finland, Denmark and Norway \u2013 was at imminent threat of war. Kristersson\u2019s rhetoric had been \u201creckless\u201d, said Sundstr\u00f6m. \u201cWe are not standing on the brink of war. It\u2019s extremely dangerous to talk in these terms.\u201d Even if war were imminent, preparedness was about much more than just military equipment, she added. A further blow came in December when the government announced it was abolishing a peace fund that had been providing financial support to peace organisations since the 1920s. For Sundstr\u00f6m it was \u201ca worrying sign that the government does not want these kinds of views to be strong\u201d. On Thursday night, Kristersson was First Lady Jill Biden\u2019s guest of honour at the US president\u2019s State of the Union speech \u2013 hours after the final Nato documentation exchanged hands. The prime minister, who has been grappling with the issue of Sweden\u2019s Nato membership since taking office in 2022, beamed as he was praised mid-speech by the president and applauded by the room. Ulf Bjereld, a political science professor at Gothenburg University and an active Social Democrat, said Sweden\u2019s entry into Nato was a failure of the peace movement. \u201cThere is very big disappointment among the peace movement in Sweden now. The debate process went so fast and the peace movement failed to stop Nato membership,\u201d he said. When Magdalena Andersson, the Social Democrat leader and former prime minister, who led Sweden\u2019s initial Nato application, decided to support joining the western military alliance, the peace movement was \u201ctoo weak\u201d. \u201cThey tried to mobilise but it was an issue that was very difficult for them,\u201d added Bjereld. But now that the deal has been done, he believes the movement\u2019s goals should include banning nuclear weapons on Swedish land. Stockholm also has a chance to take a stand within the alliance, but Bjereld believes that may depend on who is in government and whether or not Donald Trump wins the next US election. But many will long for Sweden\u2019s former policy of military non-alignment, which, Lisa N\u00e5bo, the chair of Sweden\u2019s Social Democratic Youth Association (SSU) who is running for the EU parliament, said \u201cgave us a voice to criticise and prioritise humanity and solidarity\u201d. There were fewer protests and dissenting voices than there might have been because of the political sensitivity around the subject, she added. \u201cIf you criticise Nato, you\u2019re automatically pro-Russian. In the debate there is not the possibility to have two thoughts in your head at the same time.\u201d Critics reject this interpretation but also say that peace activists such as N\u00e5bo are deluded if they think there is room for ambiguity with an emboldened Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin. Before the Social Democrats changed their minds on the issue in a major policy reversal in May 2022, Kristersson accused Andersson of pleasing only Russia with her comments against joining Nato. He said at the time: \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything to be neutral between any more. There is the west and there is Russia.\u201d Meanwhile, among younger generations the immediacy of the climate crisis could sometimes outweigh taking a long-term view on issues such as Nato, she said. Having not been given a referendum on Nato or the ability to vote in the last election because they were too young, she believes teenagers should be given more clarity on what military service entails. The Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, which at 140 years old is one of the world\u2019s oldest peace organisations, has seen membership soar from 6,500 before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine to more than 15,000. But its president Kerstin Berge\u00e5, who has called Sweden\u2019s Nato membership \u201ca historic misprioritisation\u201d, said that overall during the Nato debate there was \u201cvery little space for critical voices\u201d and accused Sweden of giving in to the demands of the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. \u201cSweden\u2019s historic voice for peace seems to have quietened. We are worried [it] \u2026 will go silent.\u201d Now that Sweden has joined Nato, she hopes it will act as a \u201cpeacemaker\u201d within the alliance and take a strong stance against nuclear weapons. Emma Berginger, a Green party MP who is on the government\u2019s defence committee, said the war in Ukraine was a \u201chuge gamechanger\u201d for the peace movement and for her party, as well as the Swedish population. But she said the application was rushed and should have been subject to more public debate, which meant many were unclear on what being a Nato member really entailed. Although the Greens voted against Nato membership, they have decided to respect the outcome and will not be calling for Sweden to leave. \u201cInstead we want to work in a constructive way influencing what role Sweden may take in the alliance,\u201d she said."

            "content": "Giving Ukraine the weapons it needs to defend itself against Russia would not escalate the war, but help to forge peace, David Cameron has said. The UK foreign secretary was speaking on a trip to Berlin, less than a week after a leaked top-secret military call exposed internal tensions about Germany\u2019s support for Kyiv. Germany is under growing international pressure to provide Taurus missiles to Ukraine, despite reluctance from Olaf Scholz\u2019s government. In apparent words of encouragement to Berlin, the UK foreign secretary said: \u201cOf course there\u2019s the question what we can do in terms of medium- and long-range missiles, and I just make this point that it\u2019s a sovereign decision for every country. But in terms of what Britain has done, I know that what we have given to the Ukrainians has helped them to resist this appalling invasion and to fight back against Russian aggression.\u201d The meeting came at a delicate time for Berlin, not long after Kremlin-controlled media in Russia published an intercepted call between senior German military officials about Ukraine. During the call, the generals discussed Britain\u2019s involvement in Ukraine, as well as the logistics of deploying German-manufactured Taurus missiles. German chancellor Olaf Scholz has repeatedly refused requests to allow the use of the missiles in Ukraine, because, he argues, it would involve putting German troops on Ukrainian soil. There are also concerns in Germany that the missiles\u2019 500km range means they could be used to strike mainland Russia, escalating the conflict and making Germany a party to war. Cameron appeared alongside Germany\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Annalena Baerbock, on Thursday. Neither addressed the intercepted call directly. When asked about it, Cameron replied: \u201cI don\u2019t want to play into the hands of some Russian narrative about divisions between allies. What I see \u2026 is incredible unity between allies, incredible unity in Nato.\u201d Cameron\u2019s unwillingness to engage directly with the leak was at odds with the former defence secretary Ben Wallace, who was quoted by the Times as saying it was proof that Germany was \u201cneither secure nor reliable\u201d. Acknowledging the \u201cenormous amount\u201d Germany had done as the second biggest supplier of weapons to Ukraine after the United States, Cameron said, facing Baerbock: \u201cWe both know we have to ask ourselves and all our allies: \u2018What more can we do? What more ammunition can we provide, what extra production can we invest in, what weapons do we have that can help the Ukrainians in this fight?\u2019\u201d Baerbock \u2013 who has said she would support in principle the sending of any weapons that helped Ukraine defend itself \u2013 said she and Cameron had talked about the matter and the leak privately, but \u201cwe won\u2019t discuss this on an open stage\u201d. Showing \u201csolidarity and resolve\u201d were the strengths of the partners of Ukraine, she said, and Vladimir Putin should not be allowed to divide them. Asked about the upcoming US elections, and how Germany and Britain would react to Donald Trump securing a second presidential term, Cameron said: \u201cIt\u2019s not in our control. But Britain and Germany will work with whoever wins the elections in the United States and try to build on the importance of that Atlantic partnership.\u201d However, he said the onus was on European partners to concentrate their minds on forging a close and consolidated alliance on major issues before the next US president took office."

            "date": "2024-03-13T11:00:05Z",
            "content": "After he says a number of his concerts have been canceled at the last minute by the venues that planned to host them, the man who shot Ronald Reagan in 1981 is telling the public: \u201cI stand for peace now.\u201d \u201cI want people to know that I\u2019m coming in peace,\u201d John Hinckley said, according to the Connecticut news station WTNH. The comments from Hinckley, 68, come as his effort at a second act as a folk musician and painter has apparently run into hitches. Shows he was scheduled to perform in New York, in Chicago, in Virginia and in Hamden, Connecticut, had all reportedly been canceled late in their planning, with organizers citing security concerns and in one instance a threat. A promoter, who says he was willing to give Hinckley a second chance despite his attempt to assassinate a US president, had booked him to play Hotel Huxley in Naugatuck, Connecticut, on 30 March \u2013 the 43rd anniversary of Reagan\u2019s shooting. If the show went ahead as scheduled, it would have marked Hinckley\u2019s first ever live performance. And tickets were being sold as of Monday. But on Tuesday, Hinckley posted on X that the 30 March concert had been postponed. He didn\u2019t say when \u2013 or if \u2013 it would be rescheduled, though in a follow-up post he wrote: \u201cI\u2019m looking for a place to open my own music venue.\u201d Despite the timing of the Hotel Huxley show, Hinckley reportedly said he no longer wants to be associated with shooting Reagan, who died in 2004. \u201cI stand for peace now,\u201d Hinckley said, according to WTNH. \u201cI know I\u2019m known for an act of violence, but I\u2019m a completely different person than in 1981.\u201d Hinckley was 25, suffering from acute psychosis and hoping to catch the attention of the actor Jodie Foster when he used a revolver to shoot Reagan and three others outside a Washington DC hotel. In addition to wounding Reagan, the attack paralyzed the then president\u2019s press secretary, James Brady, who died in 2014. A police officer and a Secret Service agent were also injured. Hinckley was found not guilty of the shooting by reason of insanity in 1982 and ordered to live at a psychiatrist hospital. In the 2000s, Hinckley began visiting his parents\u2019 home in a gated community in Williamsburg, Virginia. He obtained legal permission in 2016 to move in with his mother after experts determined his mental illness had long been in remission. Yet Hinckley had to abide by certain restrictions, including being unable to own a gun or use drugs or alcohol. He also was forbidden from contacting Foster, his victims or their families. His mother died in July 2021, and he moved into an apartment with his cat, according to court filings reviewed by the Associated Press. In June 2022, he gained his freedom from oversight of court officials and mental health professionals. \u201cI have true remorse for what I did,\u201d Hinckley said to CBS Mornings after his release from supervision. \u201cI just want them to know that I am sorry for what I did.\u201d Hinckley also said then that he did not \u201cwant to remember\u201d the emotions that he experienced when he shot Reagan, Brady and the others. Historian Barbara Perry spoke with the AP when Hinckley\u2019s restrictions were fully lifted and said history had mostly forgotten him as a \u201cmisguided soul\u201d who unwittingly helped boost Reagan\u2019s legend in some political quarters and prompted a congressional push to require background checks for people buying guns from federally licensed arms dealers. However, Hinckley has since managed to accumulate more than 90,000 followers on X and YouTube. His YouTube account has videos of his songs, which have titles such as Finally Living Free, I Won\u2019t Go Back Again and She\u2019s My One and Only. And his X account contains pictures of his cat, Theo; some paintings he has created; and a T-shirt touting the \u201cJohn Hinckley Redemption Tour\u201d."

            "date": "2024-03-05T18:02:17Z",
            "content": "Israel\u2019s devasting military assault on Gaza has now killed more than 30,000 Palestinians, 70% of them women and children, with thousands more missing, presumed dead under the rubble of their homes. Every weekend, thousands of people attend marches in London; across the nation, there have been protests in dozens of towns and cities. The Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC), the largest Palestine solidarity organisation in Europe, has been at the forefront of these actions, and support for our work has mushroomed. Yet as public pressure has built for a ceasefire, the efforts to repress these calls have accelerated, too. I made a recent speech calling for people to peacefully lobby their MPs inside parliament. I said that so many protesters would arrive that parliament would have to lock its doors. But this was reframed in national media as a call for violent insurrection. Peaceful but loud and vigorous protests at council meetings and outside MPs\u2019 offices have been characterised as acts of physical intimidation. Now we have Lord Walney, a politician with a track record of unabashed support for Israel, calling for political leaders to ban any contact between MPs or councillors and members of the PSC. Rishi Sunak has told us he will carefully consider these proposals. We must resist this political desire to shield Israel from accountability and from the charge of genocide, and attempts to suppress people\u2019s right to protest, manifested in the repressive legislation passed by this government. Having destroyed the civilian infrastructure in Gaza, including schools, universities and hospitals, Israel\u2019s denial of adequate food, water and essential supplies is now leaving hundreds of thousands of people facing starvation. The ICJ has found claims by South Africa that Israel is violating the genocide convention to be \u201cplausible\u201d, and has ordered Israel to \u201ctake all measures within its power\u201d to prevent and punish the incitement to commit genocide. Israel\u2019s assault, combined with the weak response from British political leaders, has led to unprecedented waves of solidarity in the UK. The PSC has organised and mobilised demonstrations to pressure politicians to call for an immediate ceasefire. We have also sought to help people understand how this violence is rooted in Israel\u2019s decades-long military occupation, and its imposition of a system of oppression now accepted by leading human rights organisations including Amnesty International as meeting the legal definition of apartheid. Since 1982, PSC has been campaigning to end this oppression and support a just peace based on respect for the rights of everyone in the territory between the river and the sea. Over the past few weeks, the number of people subscribed to our email list has grown from 75,000 to 300,000. We have opened a further 25 branches, and 15 national trade unions have formally affiliated with us. All of those who campaign for the rights of the Palestinian people are used to attempts to delegitimise their actions. Since October, politicians and parts of the media have attempted to demonise those who have been marching in London as hatemongers and extremists. The reality, as confirmed by the Met Police in the evidence it recently gave to the home affairs select committee, is that despite very heavy policing, the marches have been overwhelmingly peaceful, with proportionally fewer arrests than at Glastonbury music festival. And every march has included a bloc of Jewish protesters, sometimes several thousand strong \u2013 a fact that has rarely been reported in the media. These interventions from politicians are framed as a defence of democracy, but they are in reality an attack on it. Seeking to limit the legal and legitimate activities of established groups such as PSC, whose work is endorsed across UK civil society, is profoundly anti-democratic. At a time when civil society and human rights defenders are under attack around the world, the government should be upholding our democratic freedoms, not seeking to remove them from people with whom it has a political disagreement. Rather than seeking to silence those standing up for justice and peace, political leaders should be focused on exercising maximum pressure on Israel\u2019s extreme rightwing government to cease its assault.

            "date": "2024-03-27T06:00:44Z",
            "content": "The landscape at the most southerly tip of mainland Britain is expansive and grand: rolling heath and grasslands, spectacular cliffs, crashing waves. But a recovery project funded by Natural England is focusing on unique and vital \u201cmicrohabitats\u201d found in sometimes overlooked spots on the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall. The scheme at the Lizard National Nature Reserve aims to nurture lichens, liverworts and wildflowers found on or around the cliffs, rocks, paths and in animal scrapings, ditches and ponds. Though often modest looking, these plants are seen as key to the survival of the whole ecosystem and landscape. As part of the two-year \u00a3350,000 scheme, called the Lizard Rarities Project, scrub is being cleared, new watery areas dug and fire breaks created to help protect the area from an increasing risk of summer blazes. Seth Jackson of the National Trust, one of the main landowners in the area and a key player in the recovery work, said: \u201cMany of the Lizard specialities, such as twin-headed clover, upright clover and dwarf rush, have become fragmented and lost. The most important and urgent task is to expand wild populations, encourage natural recolonisation and cushion the expected impacts of climate change.\u201d The mild oceanic climate and unusual geology at the Lizard have created a distinctive landscape. More than 250 species of national and international importance are found here, many of which are found only in this region of Britain. Karen Shelley-Jones, Natural England\u2019s species recovery programme manager, said: \u201cThere is much work to be done. The serpentinite rock on the Lizard is of national importance for lichens and these are at risk from encroaching ivy which has to cleared by hand. Wild asparagus is being crowded out by a creeping blanket of invasive, non-native species hottentot fig and purple dewplant along the cliffs.\u201d There are 15 species at the centre of the project \u2013 three lichens, three liverworts, eight vascular plants and one butterfly. The lichens include Lathagrium (Collema) latzelii, a crusty-looking dark lichen that clings tightly to rocks. Among the liverworts is black crystalwort (Riccia nigrella), a dark green plant with a bluish sheen that grows in rosette shapes and likes cliff ledges, thin soil on rocks, wall tops, banks and footpaths. Pygmy rush (Juncus pygmaeus) is a rare but striking purple plant that thrives on old trackways. Some improvements can be made quickly. For example, yellow centaury, a summer annual that does well on heathland paths trampled by cattle or ponies, will quickly take advantage of newly created scraped and disturbed ground. Others need a little more help. The caterpillars of grayling butterflies feed on the grasses bristle bent and sheep\u2019s fescue, which grow well on the Lizard after targeted heathland burning. So fires will be carefully set to help the grasses grow. However, uncontrolled fires can destroy habitats and firebreaks are being created to protect isolated species from the effects of increasingly common summer wildfires. Scrub is to be removed from grassland slopes, rock outcrops and old quarries, all excellent habitats. Clearing invasive plants from the cliffs can be particularly tricky, requiring contractors to abseil down the cliffs to get to tucked-away spots. Ben McCarthy, the National Trust\u2019s head of nature and restoration ecology, said: \u201cWhile the Lizard has always experienced the full impact of the weather rolling in across the Atlantic, it is the more pernicious impact of a warming planet, invasive species and atmospheric pollution that is accelerating the loss of our most threatened habitats and species. \u201cThe work we\u2019re doing on the Lizard looks to adopt more adaptive approaches to tackle these major drivers of biodiversity loss \u2013 specific targeted action where necessary, but more broadly looking to kickstart natural processes that give our most threatened species the best chance to respond to these modern-day pressures.\u201d"

            "content": "Thank you to John Crace for this article (\u2018Is this how I die?\u2019 John Crace on his terrifying heart attack, 21 March). It has allowed me to start the process of accepting that although my two heart attacks on Christmas Day 2022 were mild and sorted by some stents, they were still serious. Surrounded by men on my ward who were recovering from, or waiting for, various heart bypass procedures, I felt almost like a fraud \u2013 after all, a stent is at the lower end of the scale, or so I convinced myself. I have laughed off the concern of loved ones and friends, and dined out on a good story that involved me thinking I had a bad chest infection on the day, accounting for my chest pains and breathlessness and symptoms that in general did not conform to my view of what a heart attack should be like. Even my definition of pain was at odds with what I thought heart attack pain was. It seems, however, that others had contemplated what life could have been like without me after hearing my news. This opens up a whole new can of worms about men\u2019s health and how seriously we take it ourselves, brushing illness off, avoiding the doctor because it\u2019s time-consuming (for them) and generally not wanting to get involved with our health. John rightly points out the magnificent diversity of the health service and I couldn\u2019t agree more with his observation that \u201cwhen the chips were down, it was there for me\u201d. It took a friend to ask me how much more serious a heart attack had to be before I accepted that it had been a life-changing event \u2013 after all, the Royal Liverpool university hospital did. Thanks to John\u2019s article, I am encouraged to continue on the journey of acceptance. Nick McLeod Ellesmere, Shropshire \u2022 In October 2022, between lockdowns, we moved to rural France. We went to Paris for Christmas, and on 22 December we were rushing to catch the M\u00e9tro when I experienced exactly what John Crace described in his article: a slight out-of-body experience and a tightness in the chest. We continued underground but after two stations I knew something was wrong. A medical student got off the train with us, reassured my family and gently held my hand as the pompiers were called \u2013 in France, the fire service always comes first. I was taken back upstairs into an ambulance, and thankfully a doctor was seeing to another heart attack across the road \u2013 what are the odds? He insisted I go straight to hospital whereupon an incredible team inserted a stent into the small diagonal artery which was blocked. I was 45. I don\u2019t smoke, drink a little, am average size and weight, and eat lots of vegetables. Again, what are the odds? Like John, I am profoundly grateful for those people who saved my life that day. And now I silently offer daily thanks to the heart-shaped aspirin I must take for the rest of my life along with a statin. It\u2019s not a cliche to say that experiences like this put everything into perspective. I wake up every day full of joy to be alive and well. I rarely think about what happened, but this article so movingly described my own experience that I wept as I remembered asking that very same question: \u201cIs this how I die?\u201d Rebecca de Volkovitch Parsac, France \u2022 I am three months out from quadruple bypass surgery. I am 64, in reasonably decent shape, hike, do tai chi and walk. The aching pain in my left shoulder began last summer, went away, but returned in late fall along with a pain in my jaw. I passed it off as overexertion. A visit to the doctor led her to sending me off to hospital. After eight days of prepping and waiting in hospital, I spent six hours on the table. Next was four days of hospital stay and then, blessedly, home. I have my wife, my doctor, and the staff of two different hospitals to thank for getting me from tests, new medications, and all the way through surgery. My wife cooked for me, helped me dress, and kept me company the first month home. I\u2019ve had visiting nurses and now spend three hours per week with a great crew at cardio rehab, where I am slowly rebuilding my strength and stamina. Family, friends and colleagues have been wonderfully supportive and my eldest grandson takes me on walks, chats with me about great ideas and keeps an eye on me. Now I imagine how I want to live my remaining years, how to better spend each day, how to make sure that everyone who loves me knows that I love them. I am back to doing taiji with my online class, I walk two miles or more each day, and am preparing to return to work soon. It is a slow process of regaining the health I once took for granted, but, as my mother-in-law used to say, it beats the alternative. Heal well, John, and embrace the gift of a healthier future. Joseph E Charnley South Deerfield, Massachusetts \u2022 I read John Crace\u2019s account of his recent hospital stay following his heart attack. It is moving and reassuring to hear yet again about the excellence and loving care taken over his treatment by the staff, and makes the contrast all the more stark with the chaos and inadequacies of the surrounding infrastructure. We must radically overhaul our healthcare system, which is no longer fit for purpose. We have to separate it from the divisive and bitter world of politics and set up a cross-party, cross-generational commission of the best experts we can find to remodel it. We may need to face up to making higher financial contributions via taxation, if we can afford to, but the principle of treatment based on clinical need without charge should be preserved. Without such intervention, we will soon be looking at the ruins of the NHS and be forced into the world of private medicine, where treatment is based on the levels of the patient\u2019s insurance policy. We owe this to ourselves, our incredible healthcare workers and future generations. Fran Mortimer Brighton \u2022 May I join everyone else in wishing John Crace a full and speedy recovery. His is the first column I turn to each day, and the Guardian is not the same without him. As someone currently receiving chemotherapy, can I endorse John\u2019s final comments about the NHS. I must have been seen by 100 people of different origin, colour, ethnicity and religious belief. Without exception, they have treated me and each other with respect and good humour and are an uplifting pointer to the Britain of the future, rather than the negative picture the angry men like Lee Anderson portray. Jonathan Harris Poundon, Buckinghamshire \u2022 I have been lucky to have been treated at St George\u2019s for cardiac emergencies. I am simply lost for words to express my gratitude for the level of care I received there, it is simply world-class. I\u2019m not religious, but if I was I would thank God for the NHS.

            "date": "2024-03-02T06:00:23Z",
            "content": "Jeremy Hunt will attempt to use next week\u2019s budget to reboot the Conservatives\u2019 flatlining performance in the opinion polls before the next general election, with the chancellor widely expected to announce sweeping tax cuts. But while Rishi Sunak will be hoping his chancellor delivers a near-term bounce from crowd-pleasing giveaways, his government is facing growing pressure over the Tories\u2019 management of the economy over the past 14 years. Here are 10 charts outlining the Conservatives\u2019 record since 2010. The deficit \u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this. I\u2019ll cut the deficit, not the NHS,\u201d read David Cameron\u2019s famous campaign poster before the 2010 general election. After the 2008 global financial crisis cratered Britain\u2019s economy, inflicting the largest government deficit of the postwar era (before the Covid pandemic), the Tories came to power pledging to mend the public finances. Under George Osborne in No 11 this included austerity in the public sector and benefit cuts. Sunak is also promising to cut the national debt. But the Tories never eliminated the deficit, and the national debt (the sum of every annual shortfall) has steadily risen from 64.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010 to 96.5% currently \u2013 the highest level since the 1960s. The NHS NHS waiting lists have soared since the Covid pandemic \u2013 but were already rising sharply before the health emergency amid workforce shortages and underinvestment in infrastructure. NHS funding has risen in every year in real terms since 2010, as a ringfenced commitment under the Tories. However, it has increased by far less than the long-term historical average, while a growing and ageing population has added to pressures. Sunak has committed to cutting NHS waiting lists. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates they will be falling come the election but will not hit pre-Covid levels until at least 2030. Economic growth \u201cLong-term economic plan\u201d was a favourite soundbite of the Osborne era. But Britain\u2019s economy has suffered historically weak growth over the past 14 years, after a slow recovery from the 2008 crash; then shocks including Brexit, the Covid pandemic and the cost of living crisis. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimates the UK\u2019s trend annual growth rate has fallen from 3.4% a year in the postwar period up to 1973, to 2.3% up to the 2008 financial crisis, to just 1.2% in the years since. Underinvestment Britain historically lags other advanced countries for public and private investment in the economy. However, the UK has fallen further behind since 2010 amid the impact from austerity, Brexit uncertainty and the political drama of five prime ministers in eight years. The IPPR thinktank estimates the UK has underinvested to the tune of half a trillion pounds, or 30 Elizabeth lines. Most visible in crumbling schools, hospitals and infrastructure, it argues this lack of investment is behind key reasons for lacklustre productivity gains \u2013 a key driver of economic growth. Global Britain? The narrow Brexit vote in 2016 triggered lasting economic upheaval, including tougher trade barriers with the UK\u2019s largest trading partner. The UK economy has notably underperformed other advanced countries since, with real GDP per capita barely above pre-Covid levels, at 4% above the mid-2016 level, compared with 8% in the eurozone and 15% for the US. Rather than an explosion in global trade after Brexit, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates total goods trade volumes have underperformed by about 15% compared with other economies, and relative to staying in the EU. Record increase in taxation Rising debt interest and growing demand on services from an ageing population have pushed up government spending. But sluggish economic growth has meant weak tax income for the exchequer. In response, Sunak has increased taxes, largely by stealth, to put revenues as a share of the economy on track to hit the highest level since the second world war. Sunak launched a freeze on income tax and increased corporation tax during his time as chancellor. Even after tax cuts in last year\u2019s autumn statement, and any expected cuts in next week\u2019s budget, taxes are still expected to be higher as a share of national income than when the Conservatives came to power in 2010. Flatlining wage growth A weak economy has left workers paying the price. Real wages had grown by an average of 33% a decade from 1970 to 2007, but this fell to below zero in the 2010s. In mid-2023, average pay was back at the level during the 2008 financial crisis, after taking account of inflation. This 15 years of lost wage growth is estimated by the Resolution Foundation thinktank to have cost the average work \u00a310,700 a year. The performance has been ranked as the worst period for pay growth since the Napoleonic wars ended in 1815. Food bank usage has spiralled Poverty has deepened over the past 14 years, leading to an explosion in food bank usage. From fewer than 100,000 in 2010, the number of emergency food parcels from the Trussell Trust has soared to almost 3m a year. Deep cuts to benefits and rising living costs have outweighed gains from large minimum wage increases for the lowest-income households. These cuts have reduced the incomes of poorest fifth by just under \u00a33,000 a year, according to the Resolution Foundation. This laid the ground for a deeper cost of living crisis as inflation soared after the pandemic and Russian war in Ukraine to the highest level in 41 years. Unemployment has remained low An economic bright spot since 2010 has been consistently low unemployment, matching among the lowest levels on records dating to the 1970s. The official jobless rate has fallen from about 8% in 2010 to less than 4%, with a damaging rise prevented during the Covid pandemic by the government\u2019s furlough scheme. However, the official figures obscure consistently high economic inactivity \u2013 when working-age adults are neither in a job nor looking for one. This includes a sharp increase in the number of people outside the labour market due to long-term sickness to a record high of 2.8 million. Migration has increased sharply Net immigration to the UK has surged despite Brexit and repeated government promises to reduce it. David Cameron said in early 2010 that if he won the election, he would limit net immigration to \u201ctens of thousands\u201d per year. Net immigration reached a record 745,000 in 2022. The UK population is projected to hit 70 million by mid-2026, a decade earlier than expected. Without growth in the population, and with it the UK workforce, Britain\u2019s economy would have grown at a slower pace. Official figures show GDP per head has remained stagnant or fallen for seven quarters up to the end of 2023 \u2013 the worst performance since modern records began in 1955."

Biden\u2019s press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, wished Catherine a full recovery at a Friday press briefing. \u201cAll of us just heard the terrible news,\u201d she said. \u201cOur thoughts are with the Duchess of Cambridge and her family members and friends during this incredibly difficult time, and certainly we wish her a full recovery.\u201d Jean-Pierre said it was important for the public to respect the privacy of the royal family, a remark that came after rampant speculation \u2013 especially online \u2013 about what was behind the low profile Catherine had been keeping. The princess disclosed her cancer diagnosis and accompanying chemotherapy treatment in a video message the BBC recorded in the gardens of Windsor Castle.

            "date": "2024-03-27T05:00:42Z",
            "content": "The minimum wage has driven up the pay of millions of Britain\u2019s lowest earners by \u00a36,000 a year, making it the single most successful economic policy in a generation, according to a leading thinktank. Since its introduction in 1999 by Tony Blair\u2019s first Labour administration the policy has secured cross-party agreement, and should be seen as the basis for further improvements in the welfare of low wage workers, the Resolution Foundation said. The minimum wage will increase on Monday 1 April as it rises from \u00a310.42 to \u00a311.44, in the third-highest annual change in its history \u2013 a rise of 9.8% in cash terms and 7.8% above inflation. In a study released to mark 25 years since the policy\u2019s introduction, the foundation said workers would have been \u00a36,000 a year worse off since 1999 if their pay had only risen in line with average wages rather than the increases recommended by the independent Low Pay Commission. Nye Cominetti, principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, said parliament should use a review of the commission\u2019s remit \u201cto discuss the future of the minimum wage and low pay more widely ahead of the election\u201d. He said: \u201cPoliticians should reflect on why the minimum wage has been so successful \u2013 such as the combination of long-term political direction and independent, expert-led oversight \u2013 and whether this approach could be broadened to tackle some of the UK\u2019s other low pay challenges.\u201d The foundation said MPs should consider how the level of statutory sick pay had fallen in relation to average wages and could be brought under the umbrella of the commission. Some critics of the minimum wage have argued it is too high while others believe it has not risen fast enough to reduce poverty in the UK. The Living Wage Foundation charity operates the real living wage, which sets a minimum \u00a312 an hour wage across the UK and \u00a313.15 in London. It is aimed at UK workers aged 18 and over but it is not a legal requirement, and businesses choose whether to pay it. The charity says more than 460,000 employees working for 14,000 firms currently receive the real living wage. A report by the International Monetary Fund on the effect of minimum wages across developed and developing countries found that \u201cresearch spanning several decades has not settled the debate\u201d. It said that some studies found a minimum wage had significant benefits for workers while \u201cothers conclude that it is harmful. Many studies have been inconclusive\u201d. The Resolution Foundation said analysis of the UK showed that between 1980 and 1998, hourly pay growth in the UK was twice as fast for the highest earners as it was for the lowest earners \u2013 3.1% versus 1.4% a year. \u201cBut since 1999 this trend has reversed, and hourly pay inequality has fallen with pay growth for the lowest earners five times that seen by the highest earners \u2013 1.6% versus 0.3 per cent per year,\u201d it said."

            "date": "2024-03-11T11:27:15Z",
            "content": "Marco Parolo was only joking when he posed the question to Simone Inzaghi last December. \u201cBack when you were coaching me at Lazio you offered us players a dinner for the first goal assisted by one wing-back and scored by the other,\u201d said the former Italy international during an interview after Inter\u2019s home win over Udinese. \u201cWhat are you trying for now? A goal set up by the defender from one side of your back three and scored by the one on the other side?\u201d The translation is a little unwieldy. In Italian, Parolo was contrasting \u201cun gol da quinto a quinto\u201d with one \u201cda terzo a terzo\u201d, but English does not offer an equivalent for this shorthand reference to footballers\u2019 positions as \u201cfifths\u201d and \u201cthirds\u201d. The sentiment was what mattered. Parolo was marvelling like the rest of us at the fluidity of an Internazionale side in which it can seem like every player bar the goalkeeper has permission to join the attack. On Saturday, Parolo\u2019s vision came to pass. In the 37th minute of Inter\u2019s match at Bologna, Alessandro Bastoni, notionally starting on the left of Inter\u2019s back three, pushed up to support his wing-back just outside the opposition box. Carlos Augusto laid the ball back to him, Bastoni sent in a first-time cross, and Yann Bisseck, Inter\u2019s right-sided \u201cterzo\u201d for this game, arrived to score a diving header at the back post. The most improbable part was that none of this felt improbable at all. Bastoni has been taking up these positions and playing those crosses all season. Bisseck, who joined from Aarhus in Denmark last summer, defined himself at his unveiling as a \u201cmodern defender, who likes to play with the ball and to score\u201d. He had already opened his account for the club with a goal against Lecce in December \u2013 a game in which he also crashed a volley against the bar. There may not be a better club in Europe right now for a player with that mindset to flourish. To even define Inzaghi\u2019s football as \u201cmodern\u201d feels uncharitable because that would imply a wider trend of clubs embracing such a liquid approach to what formations can be. Where else can a young centre-back feel so empowered to commit to an attack knowing colleagues will fill the space that he leaves? This might have been Inter\u2019s first goal da terzo a terzo, but the principles that made it possible have been developing for months. It was on display in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 match against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, when Stefan de Vrij \u2013 from the middle of the back three \u2013 ran beyond the Spanish club\u2019s defence and almost set up Marcus Thuram for an opening goal after barely a quarter of an hour. Inter\u2019s 1-0 win in the Derby d\u2019Italia last month was sealed by an own goal caused, in part, by another of their defenders, Benjamin Pavard, attempting a scissor-kick volley inside the Juventus box. The Frenchman failed to connect but his action caused the defender behind him to misread the flight of a ball which ultimately bounced off Federico Gatti and in. This hints at another extraordinary feature of Inzaghi\u2019s Inter: the interchangeability of so many different players. Bastoni and Pavard are the first-choice starters for the left and right of the defence, but Bisseck and Matteo Darmian offer able cover. De Vrij and Francesco Acerbi can be alternated without hesitation in the centre. The same is true in the wing-back positions. Denzel Dumfries and Darmian offer horses for courses options on the right: the latter a more diligent defender but the former a greater attacking threat. Federico Dimarco has developed into an elite player on the left side but Carlos Augusto has progressed so rapidly since joining from Monza that Inzaghi now can rest the Italian with no concerns. Saturday\u2019s game was a case in point, a trip to Bologna representing about as tough a challenge as Inter could find domestically. Thiago Motta\u2019s team had won six on the bounce, including away games against Lazio and Atalanta, climbing to fourth in the table. They had not lost at their Stadio Renato Dall\u2019Ara since August. This was not a crucial game for Inter. Already 15 points clear at the top of Serie A, they could be excused for prioritising this week\u2019s second leg against Atl\u00e9tico and Inzaghi made six changes to the starting XI that beat Genoa five days before. Yet Inter could have scored several times before Bisseck broke the deadlock. Alexis S\u00e1nchez drew a save from a narrow angle in the 10th minute, Darmian flashed a shot wide in the 15th and Nicol\u00f2 Barella fluffed a one-on-one in the 21st. Lewis Ferguson did force Yann Sommer into action with a long-range shot at the other end but Inter were good value for their half-time lead. Inzaghi\u2019s side sat deeper in the second half, inviting Bologna on perhaps more than they should have done. Yet Sommer still only had to make one more save after the break, and a routine one at that. Across all competitions, he has now kept 23 clean sheets. Parolo was not present to remind Inzaghi of their conversation at full time, but another post-game interviewer stepped in to ask whether he planned to buy any meals to celebrate the terzo a terzo goal. \u201cMore than one!\u201d said the manager. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a free day to plan a dinner at the moment but we will find time.\u201d A moment to celebrate will come soon enough. Juventus\u2019s draw with Atlanta on Sunday meant Inter increased their advantage at the top of the league to 16 points. The prospect that they could seal their title against rivals Milan next month is starting to look real. With both teams equal on 19 Serie A wins, that would be some culmination to the race to see which of the city\u2019s footballing cousins affix a second golden star above their club badge first. Inzaghi said again on Saturday that this Scudetto is not yet in the bag. It is a hard claim to take seriously. Inter have won 13 games in a row across all competitions and are on course for more than 100 points. They score goals with combinations that once seemed like joking exaggerations. The Champions League is another matter, and even with a one-goal advantage Inter can take nothing for granted as they travel to Madrid. Parolo told Dazn: \u201cI think Inter can go 50-50 with any of the big clubs in Europe, except perhaps [Manchester] City.\u201d Even then, just quietly, we might add that this Inter team is better than the one which gave the Premier League champions a close run in the final last year."

            "date": "2024-03-16T19:00:13Z",
            "content": "When Apple\u2019s first iPhone launched in 2007, all its apps were made by Apple. Steve Jobs was reluctant to allow the apps of third-party developers on the iPhone, according to his biography by Walter Isaacson. He ultimately caved to pressure with the launch of the App Store in 2008. But the company wanted strict control over what was allowed on the platform, an email released in 2021 revealed. Apple\u2019s control over its empire will be front and centre in a case heard over the next five months in Melbourne\u2019s federal court. At the same time, Google \u2013 which has prided itself on having a more open ecosystem than Apple \u2013 will have its own practices put to the test. Two Australian federal court cases were put on hold in April 2021, pending the outcome of similar cases in the US. Epic Games, maker of the popular game Fortnite, has spent the past three years in a global legal battle against Apple and Google, alleging misuse of market power over the control they wield over their app stores. Fortnite was kicked off the Google and Apple app stores in 2020 after Epic Games offered its own in-app payment system that bypassed the one used by the platforms, and cut out the fees Apple and Google receive for in-app payments. Epic lost its 2021 antitrust case against Apple, but won its case against Google late last year. Originally separate, the Australian cases have now been combined into a single monolith. Justice Jonathan Beach decided to hear the two cases and an associated class action at the same time to avoid duplication of witness evidence. David and Goliath? In the Australian cases, which originally kicked off in 2020, Epic Games has alleged that Apple\u2019s control over in-app purchases and its actions in banning the Fortnite app are a misuse of market power, which has substantially lessened competition in app development. The company has also alleged Google harmed app developers and consumers in Australia by preventing choice over app distribution and in-app payments on Android devices. Just like their phone operating systems, the legal cases between Apple and Google have many similarities \u2013 but also key points of difference. Apple\u2019s iOS and App Store are completely closed and controlled by Apple. That means if an app is on your phone, and there is a payment through that app, it has to go through Apple. Similar rules operate on Google\u2019s Android operating system for the Play Store, but Google also allows \u201csideloading\u201d of apps \u2013 meaning apps installed directly on the phone without using the app store. It also allows for phone manufacturers such as Samsung to have their own app stores. Fortnite is still available on Android, but only through sideloading or through the Samsung store. Each company charges fees for transactions in their app stores. Google Play charges a 15% fee for the first US$1m earned by developers each year, increasing to 30% above that. Apple developers pay a 15% fee if the revenue generated the previous year is lower than $1m, but pay 30% if they earn more than that. Fees are common in the industry \u2013 Epic\u2019s own store charges developers a 12% fee. Epic argues that it should be able to offer its own store as competition to Apple\u2019s store, and also offer alternative payment options within their app in the official Games Store. While Google has argued it is more open than the Apple App Store, it was this openness that cost the tech company in the US case. A jury found that tying the Google Play Store to payments in apps was illegal, and that the company had entered into anti-competitive agreements with select developers to keep their apps in the Play Store. In the Apple case, the judge took a narrower view, considering mobile gaming transactions specifically rather than the app store as a whole. The judge found that Apple was not a monopoly, instead it was competing against Google and others. The judge also backed Apple\u2019s concerns about the security implications of opening up the App Store, and supported the company seeking a fee for the use of its intellectual property through in-app payments. Apple is expected to run a very similar case in Australia. The company believes there is little difference between the cases, and the principles underlying Australian competition law are similar to those in US antitrust laws. Apple sees Epic not as David to its Goliath, but as a multibillion dollar company seeking to further profit at the expense of the security of iPhone users. Google argues it does offer customers a choice in app stores, as well as alternative options for developers to sell content outside Google Play. It also points to its permissions allowing the sideloading of apps while also trying to preserve security for users \u2013 something it argues Epic is attempting to water down. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Android and Google Play provide more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform and it\u2019s a model that\u2019s good for Australian developers and consumers,\u201d Google\u2019s VP of government affairs and public policy, Wilson White, said in a post this week. \u201cWe will continue to vigorously defend our right to a sustainable business model that enables us to keep users safe, partner with developers to grow their businesses and keep the Android ecosystem thriving and healthy for all Australians.\u201d Apple compelled to make changes in EU App Store Opening submissions will last two weeks, followed by evidence from fact witnesses and experts spanning three months, followed by two weeks of closing submissions ending in mid-July. Witnesses expected to testify include Epic\u2019s CEO, Tim Sweeney, who is in Melbourne for the hearing, as well as key executives from Apple and Google. A class action being run at the same time on behalf of Australian developers and consumers will fail if Epic\u2019s case fails. The case is unlikely to be resolved this year, with Beach not expected to deliver a judgment within six months, after which there could be appeals. Regardless of whether Epic wins the battle, Apple and Google may ultimately lose the app store war. Apple has been forced to implement changes to its App Store in the European Union \u2013 including allowing alternate payment options and marketplaces \u2013 following the Digital Markets Act. As a result, Apple restored Epic\u2019s developer account in the EU last week. According to Epic, Apple\u2019s implementation of those changes is imperfect, but it may lead to other governments, including Australia, following suit."

            "date": "2024-03-10T06:00:11Z",
            "content": "Conservative ministers have in recent years bullied civil servants, been criminally sanctioned for breaking the law and sent restricted material to those unauthorised to receive it. Now there is a new misdemeanour to add to the list: the science and innovation secretary, Michelle Donelan, has had to pay damages and apologise to two academics after they launched legal action, accusing her of libelling them. Last October, Donelan wrote to UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), a non-departmental umbrella body that oversees seven higher education research councils, Innovate UK and Research England, to complain about two members of the latter\u2019s new equality, diversity and inclusion expert advisory group. She accused the two academics of \u201csharing extremist views on social media\u201d, expressed her \u201cdisgust and outrage\u201d at their appointment, and asked UKRI\u2019s chief executive to disband the working group. Except that neither academic shared extremist views on social media. One tweeted a Guardian news story with the headline \u201cSuella Braverman urges police to crack down on Hamas support in UK\u201d with the comment \u201cthis is disturbing\u201d. It seems Donelan implausibly interpreted this as a comment on the sentiment in the headline not the news story. The other stood accused of \u201camplifying\u201d a post that condemned violence on both sides but made reference to Israel\u2019s \u201cgenocide and apartheid\u201d, a view that may cause offence to some but which is certainly within the bounds of legal speech. UKRI responded by suspending the advisory group\u2019s operations and conducting a full investigation. Its report, published last Tuesday, found no evidence that either academic had shared extremist material or supported a proscribed terrorist organisation; no failure on their part to uphold the principles of public life; and no grounds to remove either from the working group. Donelan has publicly apologised; and the government stumped up \u00a315,000 in agreed damages. Quite apart from the financial cost to the taxpayer, this is a case of a minister unfairly impugning two academics because she disagrees with them. Muddying disagreement with support for extremism has reputational consequences for the people in question, and, more broadly, will have a chilling impact on other academics who hold similar views. It undermines academic freedom in the university sector, and is symptomatic of a government with a low tolerance for free expression and dissent. As we reported last year, there is evidence of 15 government departments monitoring the social media feeds of their potential critics in order to prevent them from speaking at government-funded public events. Extraordinarily, this is a government that also claims to champion academic freedom. Ministers are right that there are issues in higher education: several academics, for example, have experienced bullying or lost jobs as a result of their mainstream gender-critical view that sex cannot be replaced by self-identified gender. It remains to be seen whether the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023 will have its intended effects; culture change can be difficult to effect through legislation. But ministerial hypocrisy is actively undermining it. \u201cFree speech for me but not for thee\u201d is the sentiment that characterises much of the debate on free expression. But citizens have a right to expect government ministers to uphold free speech rights for everyone. A science and innovation secretary who uses her position to falsely denounce academics as holding extremist views cannot continue in post; she should resign or be sacked.

            "date": "2024-03-19T05:01:21Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak\u2019s plans to expand childcare provision in England are at risk of not living up to parents\u2019 expectations as nursery costs surge and available places dwindle, a charity has warned. The cost of 25 hours a week for a child under two has risen by 7% on 2023, with the most expensive area being inner London where the average cost is \u00a3218 a week, the latest annual survey of the Coram Family and Childcare charity found. A total of 34% of English councils reported having sufficient childcare places \u2013 a decrease of 14 percentage points on the previous year \u2013 while 35% reported having enough spaces for children under two. The survey also pointed to a drop in childcare places for children with disabilities, with 6% of councils reporting sufficient spaces, down 12 percentage points from 2023. Provision was also found to have reduced for parents working atypical hours \u2013 down 7 percentage points \u2013 and for families in rural areas \u2013 down by 14 percentage points. Under the prime minister\u2019s flagship childcare expansion policy, starting from April, existing childcare support will be expanded in phases with a plan that by September 2025, most working families with children under the age of five will be entitled to 30 hours of childcare support. Ellen Broome, managing director of Coram, said: \u201cThe new childcare support that is being rolled out from April has the potential to be a game-changer for parents up and down the country \u2013 many of whom have found themselves facing eye-watering childcare bills and sometimes even locked out of work because of childcare costs. \u201cOur findings \u2013 with higher costs and dramatic drops in availability of childcare places \u2013 are concerning at this crucial time, showing the scale of challenge and the very real risks around this policy not living up to parents\u2019 expectations. \u201cUnless this policy is properly funded and supported, it could have the opposite effect, with families unable to access or afford the childcare they need and the most disadvantaged children set to miss out.\u201d The Coram report revealed councils\u2019 concerns over the delivery of the expansion to free early education entitlements and the further impact on the availability of childcare places. About 63% of councils in England were said to be \u201cconfident\u201d or \u201cvery confident\u201d that there will be enough places to meet demand for the imminent expansion \u2013 15 free hours for two-year-olds \u2013 but just 28% said the same about the expansion from September 2024 \u2013 15 free hours from nine months old \u2013 and this fell to just 12% for the September 2025 expansion, which will be 30 free hours from nine months. The vast majority of councils identified the local childcare workforce as a \u201cbarrier\u201d to successful delivery of the 30 hours free entitlements in 2025, which Coram said reflects the significant challenges of recruiting and retaining staff. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cWe are confident in the strength of our childcare market to deliver further expansion, with our funding rates for the new entitlements independently assessed by the IFS [Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank] as significantly above market rates, guaranteed further rises in funding for the next two years backed by an estimated \u00a3500m, our national recruitment campaign, and \u00a31,000 cash incentive pilot to encourage new staff into the sector. \u201cEven before these interventions, early years places and staff had increased in 2023 compared with five years ago, while the number of children aged 0-5 has dropped year on year between 2018 and 2022.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-12T14:00:45Z",
            "content": "For working parents or guardians of young children, arranging childcare can be the source of untold stress. Whether it is the logistical wrangle of pickups and drop-offs, nagging anxiety about whether it is the right decision, not to mention the sheer punishing cost, childcare is up there with life\u2019s most arduous chores. Profit-hungry private equity investors don\u2019t see it that way. To them, the pressure that parents are under is not so much a sign of the unsustainable strain placed on family life in the modern British economy, but more a golden opportunity for profit. Few people can afford to pass up badly-needed income to look after children full time: someone has to be paid to take the job on. Investment firms figure they might as well take a slice of the action. Private equity invests in all sorts of sectors but childcare, and social care more widely, is among the most attractive. It isn\u2019t a luxury, like fashion or cars, that consumers can dispense with in straitened times. Rather, it is increasingly the backbone of a functioning economy, so vital that it requires funding from that most reliable of customers, the state. Back in 2021, pan-European investment firm Fremman Capital summarised childcare in terms that few stressed parents or harassed nursery carers would choose, when it bought the north--west-focused nursery chain Kids Planet. \u201cThe market is highly resilient and is expected to see a continued increase in demand for nursery provision,\u201d it proclaimed. \u201cMarket leaders, like Kids Planet, are best placed to capture a larger share of this growth, as well as capitalise on the consolidation opportunities in this highly fragmented market.\u201d That was before the government\u2019s welcome expansion of state-funded childcare, further extended in Jeremy Hunt\u2019s spring budget last week. The market now looks even more resilient (translation: reliably lucrative even in a recession) for the firms at the top of the tree. They are already making bumper profits according to analysis published on Tuesday by the Guardian, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) and the investigative accounting firm Trinava Consulting. Extra funding, on top of the \u00a34bn estimated before the latest expansion, signals a more spectacular profit bonanza. In theory, there is nothing wrong with this. If investment firms figure they can make money from childcare, that ought to yield an increase in provision as profit-seekers fill gaps where care is in demand. That hypothesis requires some major caveats. First, private enterprise has an incentive to prioritise investment in well-to-do areas, where parents can afford the extras that boost profit margins \u2013 longer opening hours, for instance, or day trips. Poorer neighbourhoods are less likely to yield this higher margin spending and risk being shunned. Second, the profit motive means that when a decision is to be made about improving care, or raising the earnings of the hard-working staff who make nurseries a safe and welcoming place for our children, there is always the danger that keeping costs down will be the priority. A report by UCL, released in 2022, found that the private equity gold rush did not appear to have led to an overall increase in places, or greater investment in staff. What\u2019s more, chains owned by private equity aren\u2019t necessarily stronger just because their owners make bigger profits. Such buyout firms often borrow heavily to fund acquisition, which typically means substantial interest payments, often paid upwards to an overseas parent company or external lender. This is a model that works well in stable times but can unravel quickly and dramatically, resulting in the kind of failures that have been seen in the elderly care sector, with cautionary tales such as Southern Cross and Four Seasons Healthcare. If private companies are to be allowed to make bumper profits from childcare, they must be rigorously scrutinised to ensure they are not profiteering, cutting corners or running unsustainable financial models. That will require alert oversight from agile government, at both local and national level. It is far from clear that such a safety net is in place."

            "date": "2024-03-04T16:16:26Z",
            "content": "\u201cThe Harlem Renaissance should be central to how we think about the modernist period. It should be essential to the way we define and articulate not just African-American identity but American identity.\u201d The Met curator Denise Murrell recently shared with me the animating idea behind her new blockbuster exhibition, The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism, which brings together an amazingly diverse grouping of some 160 pieces to reveal the true breadth and depth of the work made by Black artists from the 1920s through the 40s. The show\u2019s lofty aspiration is to redefine how we understand the Harlem Renaissance and the modernist art movement. Murrell\u2019s exhibition is the first major survey of the Harlem Renaissance in New York City since Studio Museum\u2019s Harlem Renaissance: Art of Black America in 1987, and it is both welcome and overdue. It casts an extremely wide net, giving a rare, comprehensive look at how Black creators portrayed the texture of Black life in early 20th-century America. From cityscapes to portraiture to jazz-age nightlife, community elders and activism, the show gives Black Americans the agency long denied to them to tell their own stories. Beyond this premise, The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism also aims to make the case that many of its artists should be in the center of the modernist movement. \u201cIn the same way that we talk about Edward Hopper or Georgia O\u2019Keefe, we should be talking about at least some of the artists of the Harlem Renaissance,\u201d said Murrell. Thus, one section of the show demonstrates how prominent white European modernist standard-bearers like Matisse drew inspiration from Harlem aesthetics. The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism also offers a weighty look at the cross-fertilization that tied Black artists more closely to modernism than has generally been recognized, including a section chronicling the work of the Black artist Archibald J Motley Jr in Paris. Murrell\u2019s show is impressive for its comprehensive nature, bringing in a truly authoritative range of styles and subjects. It demonstrates that Black artists were true innovators, using all of the tools of the modernist art movement to explore the values and aesthetics of their community, and to assert their place in the fabric of American and European society. \u201cIt was about breaking down this idea that to be American was to be white, to be European was to be white, and to show the multicultural aspect of both of these populations in the 1920s through the 1940s,\u201d Murrell said. In order to put together The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism, Murrell spent years viewing the collections of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), as well as private and institutional collections from all over the US and Europe. This was often groundbreaking work, as these institutions and collectors tended to be far outside the orbit of a major New York art museum. \u201cAlmost all of the museums I visited for the project were not traditional Met museums,\u201d said Murrell. \u201cAlmost all of the HBCUs told me I was the first person from the Met they had ever met.\u201d Through her extensive travels, Murrell unearthed many gems that had been long hidden in the archives. \u201cIt was essentially an archival excavation effort,\u201d she said. Murrell said she made some surprising discoveries as she explored these art collections. While visiting Clark Atlanta University, she was amazed to come upon William Henry Johnson\u2019s Woman in Blue, a work that she had only seen previously as a study. \u201cWe\u2019re pulling out things in the storeroom and there\u2019s this large, beautiful oil painting,\u201d she said. \u201cI immediately recognized it as the final version of the study I had seen at the Smithsonian.\u201d The work, a gorgeous, modernist take on a world-weary woman done primarily in hues of gold and blue, has since become the exhibition\u2019s signature image. It joins other powerful works by Johnson, including the equally distinctive Man in a Vest, the spirited Street Life, Harlem, and the storytelling Mom and Dad, among many other standout pieces of Johnson\u2019s. Another major find for Murrell was artist and writer Bert Hurley\u2019s novella Loose Nuts: A Rhapsody in Brown. A little-known Kentucky railroad worker, Hurley penned and illustrated the comic mystery novella that celebrates the many forms that Black life took in Louisville in the 1930s. Hurley\u2019s virtuosic illustrations range across forms, from pen and ink to charcoal, sketches and watercolors \u2013 and everything in between. The book becomes something of an encyclopedia for African-American life of the era. \u201cLouisville was a destination of the Great Migration, and he wrote about everyday life there,\u201d said Murrell. \u201cI became obsessed with this book \u2013 the language, the phrasing. It really cements the idea of this new Black majority taking hold in cities across the country.\u201d One section of The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism lays out the relationships between African-American art and European modernism by showing paintings from well-known artists such as Picasso, Matisse and Munch, demonstrating the cross-pollination with the Europeans. \u201cWe know Matisse spent time in Harlem,\u201d said Murrell. \u201cHe has a very astute collection of jazz recordings. It\u2019s not like these groups were unaware of each other.\u201d The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism also very much captures the sense of debate and contention among Black artists as to what they, as a group, stood for. The feeling of viewing the multitudes of contrasting styles and viewpoints is that of a community very much exploring and having deep and passionate conversations about itself. \u201cThere were discussions and debates within the Black community about what art would best represent themselves,\u201d said Murrell. \u201cThe movement did inspire a change in attitudes within the community about its own culture.\u201d Murrell also noted that the way these artists lived and worked was very much a model to inspire others in the community. As much as The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism does to unearth a staggering array of important Black art, there is still so much more to be seen. Murrell stated as much when she indicated her hopes of continuing to work with lending institutions for subsequent exhibitions. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely so much depth here. I do hope that we will have an ongoing collaboration with the HBCUs to jointly do more shows and additional research.\u201d Given the delights, insights and new narratives that this show has brought to the Met, it is not hard to see the value in producing more exhibitions along these lines. \u201cIt\u2019s really something that I think would be important,\u201d said Murrell. \u201cThe broader art world should engage with these collections.\u201d The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism is now on show at The Metropolitan Museum of Art until 28 July"

            "content": "By historical standards Britain\u2019s current recession is a mild one, but even so weak activity is starting to take its toll on the labour market. Nothing dramatic is happening. Unemployment is up a bit but the jobless rate remains below 4%. The number of people employed fell slightly and job vacancies continued to decrease, although the total of 908,000 remains above pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, as the annual inflation rate has fallen so pay growth has moderated too. For the time being at least workers\u2019 living standards are rising because wages are rising more rapidly than prices. The big picture is that the labour market is still relatively tight given the fact that the economy has been moving sideways for the best part of two years. There has been no large-scale job shedding and there are still shortages of workers in many sectors. In anticipation of the recession being short-lived, employers are hanging on to their existing staff because they are worried they will have problems recruiting when the economy does start to pick up. So while pay levels are coming down, they are probably not coming down quickly enough to prompt the Bank of England into an immediate cut in interest rates. Private sector regular pay \u2013 an indicator closely watched by Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee \u2013 was 6.1% higher in the three months ending January 2024 than in the same quarter a year earlier. That is well down on last summer\u2019s peak of 8.2% but slightly higher than the Bank has been forecasting. With inflation poised to fall from 4% to about 2% within the next few months, further moderation in earnings growth is likely. Even so, the latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggests the structural labour market problems remain unresolved. As Tony Wilson, the director of the Institute for Employment Studies thinktank points out, at 75% the UK\u2019s employment rate for those aged 16 to 64 is a percentage point lower than it was before the arrival of the pandemic four years ago even though unemployment has fallen back to where it was pre-Covid. \u201cSo as has been the story in previous months, there are fewer people in work because there are more people outside the labour force altogether \u2013 not looking or not available for work. In all, there are well over half a million more people out of work than before the pandemic began,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThis is being driven by more young people and older people outside the labour force, and in particular because of more people reporting long-term health conditions that stop them from working.\u201d That is not good for those who are not well enough to work. It is not good for the economy either."

            "date": "2024-03-25T10:32:43Z",
            "content": "The owner of B&amp;Q and Screwfix has warned that profits will fall for the second year in a row as homeowners hold off on big projects including bathroom and kitchen refits amid a lacklustre housing market. Kingfisher, which also owns DIY stores in France, Poland, Spain and Portugal under the Castorama and Brico D\u00e9p\u00f4t brands, expects underlying pre-tax profits to fall to between \u00a3490 and \u00a3550m for the 12 months to 31 January 2025, down 25% on the \u00a3560m analysts expected at the start of the year. It comes after Kingfisher made underlying pre-tax profit of \u00a3568m for the year to January 2024, which was well below the \u00a3758m posted last year. Thierry Garnier, the chief executive of Kingfisher, said that while short-term repairs, maintenance and renovation on existing homes would support \u201cresilient demand\u201d in the UK, the group was \u201ccautious on the outlook for market growth in 2024\u201d. \u201cWe see early positive signs in housing market activity but we know there is a lag in housing activity and home improvement demand,\u201d he said. The group said sales in the UK were flat year on year but it was mindful of continued uncertainties facing households due to mortgage rates and the job market. In France, sales are expected to continue to fall amid weak consumer confidence, while sales in Poland are expected to improve as inflation and interest rates fall. The statement on 2024 annual profits follows two profit warnings in the past six months after poor sales in France and Poland. The company revised its profit forecast for the year to this January down from \u00a3590m to \u00a3569m after a challenging third quarter saw sales decline by 4%. This followed a downgrade in September in which it cut its forecast from \u00a3634m in profits to \u00a3590m. Kingfisher shares were down 2% on Monday after the results were announced, making it one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100. Garnier said Kingfisher would be saving \u00a3120m of costs and \u201cproductivity gains\u201d in the year ahead, suggesting a fall in store staff numbers, as well as improved deals with suppliers and landlords, as he said the group was deploying technology including more automated tills. \u201cDuring Covid we recruited a massive amount. When times are tougher we have to flex to demand,\u201d he said. The group will also be making changes at a third of its Castorama outlets in France \u2013 either shifting them to its budget Brico D\u00e9p\u00f4t brand, decreasing store size or investing to modernise. Up to 40 more Screwfix stores in the UK and Ireland and up to 15 more in France will be opening, as well as 75 new Castorama stores in Poland. The group has also just launched its online marketplace service in France, where home improvement brands can sell direct to B&amp;Q customers. It plans to launch the service in Poland this year. Total sales across the business for the year, which also includes stores in Poland, were down 1.8% to almost \u00a313bn for the year. This was driven by its French arm, where low consumer confidence led to a 5.9% drop in underlying sales, while a weak trading environment in Poland meant that sales dropped by 9.5%. However, UK like-for-like sales were up by 0.8%, with the business attributing this to growth in internet trade, led by strong sales from trade customers and its online marketplace service."

            "date": "2024-03-06T19:24:12Z",
            "content": "The recent pronounced increase in public discussion of the menopause has been a welcome shift. Like miscarriage and birth injuries, this aspect of women\u2019s life experience \u2013 and healthcare \u2013 has often been shrouded in embarrassment. In the UK, a \u201cmenopause revolution\u201d led by the Labour MP Carolyn Harris succeeded in getting the cost of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) reduced to less than \u00a320 a year. Between 2021 and 2023 the proportion of UK women aged 45 to 64 prescribed HRT rose from 11% to about 15%. This is widely viewed as a corrective after many years during which it was underprescribed due to exaggerated fears about side-effects, including an increased risk of some cancers. Women with debilitating symptoms such as broken sleep and low mood too often went without any treatment at all. Last month the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) issued new guidance asserting that if symptoms are serious and long-lasting, they can be regarded as a disability \u2013 meaning employers must make reasonable adjustments. Meanwhile, a new series of papers in the Lancet has called for more support for the one in 10 women who experience early menopause, before they are 40. The goals of raising awareness, improving treatment and challenging the stigma associated with female ageing and loss of fertility are widely shared. But there are also differences in approach. At issue is the extent to which menopause is regarded as a condition to be treated, with the authors of one new paper arguing that this is a problem in high-income countries, including the UK and Australia. They propose that menopause should not be viewed as an endocrine deficiency, but as a \u201cnormal event that affects everyone\u201d. Using similar language, the South African activist Sue Mbaya describes menopause as \u201ca normal developmental stage\u201d. The Lancet authors believe women are being targeted by a growing menopause industry that is eager to capitalise on their anxieties, and cite evidence that for most women menopause symptoms are not severe. The recent UK campaign was guided by new research on dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s, and heightened awareness of the importance of bone strength for older women \u2013 who have an elevated risk of developing osteoporosis. But the evidence about the long-term use of HRT is weak. Pharmaceuticals businesses, as well as unregulated online influencers, play a part in shaping public opinion in the UK as elsewhere. New, non-hormonal treatments are being developed. Research also supports a role for talking therapies in helping women navigate what used to be called the \u201cchange of life\u201d. But while women ought to benefit from a more diverse approach to treatment, a form of polarisation can be observed in some reactions to these developments \u2013 with pro- and anti-HRT voices on opposite sides. Many people have strong feelings about negotiating the ageing process. Distrust about the way that menopause is dealt with, both socially and medically, is part of a wider critique of the way women and their bodies have historically been overlooked. But discussion of menopause must not be reduced to a question of yes or no: for or against HRT \u2013 particularly since there are many women whom it doesn\u2019t suit (including those with a history of cancer). In an imperfect world, we must hold on to the ideal of each woman deciding, in consultation with her doctor, what is right for her."

Addressing a diplomatic conference in Turkey, Sergei Lavrov said Hamas had agreed in writing for the first time to respect the platform of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), though he said it remained to be seen whether this would turn into more than words on a piece of paper. The meaning of \u201crecognition\u201d is open to interpretation, but it may take Hamas closer to the longstanding position of Fatah, the dominant faction in the PLO, of a state of Palestine alongside Israel. Hamas refused to recognise Israel\u2019s right to exist, but has used various formulas to fudge this position under diplomatic pressure. A statement on Friday by the Palestinian factions represented in Moscow said there would be an \u201cupcoming dialogue\u201d to bring them under the banner of the PLO. Lavrov said the joint communique issued by the factions was an advance on five years ago when he hosted talks in Moscow and the sides could not agree on any written statement. The two main Palestinian factions have been geographically divided since 2007 when Fatah, which runs the Palestinian Authority on the West Bank, was expelled from Gaza by Hamas fighters after legislative elections in the previous year. Various other Palestinian factions add to the disunity, and as many as 14 groups attended the Moscow talks. Addressing the same event, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said the whole world had failed the Palestinian people and that Turkey was prepared to act as a guarantor of peace in Palestine \u2013 an offer that suggests he is prepared to provide peacekeeping forces in Gaza, something Israel would reject. Lavrov urged the Palestinian factions to unify, saying disunity played into the hands of Benjamin Netanyahu, as the Israeli prime minister had repeatedly claimed there was no legitimate organisation with which he could negotiate over the future of Gaza. The war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack on southern Israel, is approaching the five-month mark. Earlier this week the Palestinian Authority government, including the prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, had resigned to make way for a technocratic government that will be chosen after consultations with the factions. Some senior western officials have privately acknowledged in recent weeks that Russia is playing a constructive role in trying to bring the factions together. A clear statement by Hamas that it respects the view of the PLO would make it easier for western powers to make the case to Israel that its offensive has forced Hamas to adjust its political position and be less antagonistic to Israel. Before the talks on Thursday, Lavrov told the factions: \u201cIf you announce such a step \u2013 restoring Palestinian unity on the basis of the PLO programme \u2013 it will remove the trump cards from the hands of those forces that refer to the internal problems in the Palestinian territories and use them to obstruct the settlement process in the Middle East.\u201d The Egyptian foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, stressed on Friday that a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian resistance factions should be reached before the holy month of Ramadan, which begins on 10 March. \u201cIt is imperative to reach a ceasefire before Ramadan for the safety of the Palestinian people,\u201d he told the forum."

            "content": "The urgency of PGA Tour golfers to sit around a table with Yasir al\u2011Rumayyan is no coincidence. Golf industry leaders, many of whom have been present at this week\u2019s Players Championship, privately believe it could already be 2026 until any unification of the sport delivers a schedule that combines LIV and the traditional tours. Rumayyan, the governor of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, is keen to explain his vision for golf\u2019s future to player directors of the PGA Tour. Those include Tiger Woods, widely understood to be a Saudi sceptic. Until now \u2013 and quite incredibly, given the kingdom\u2019s relentless march into the sport via the rebel LIV circuit \u2013 there has been no such discussion. The Strategic Sports Group, which has invested $1.5bn into a new commercial entity, has been present at Sawgrass for detailed talks with the PGA and DP World Tours over recent days. The ultimate aim involves the globalisation of golf, with further investment from the PIF. However, there is private acceptance that with the 2024 schedule ongoing and plans naturally under way for 2025, huge leaps must be made even to alter the professional landscape in two years\u2019 time. The 50th staging of the Players Championship is taking place without two reigning major champions because of their LIV connections. Peter Malnati, a player director of the PGA Tour, articulated his belief that rapid action is needed. \u201cI think something needs to happen for our sport,\u201d Malnati said. \u201cI would love to see a unified game. I want there to be different tours where guys can play, I want that, but I want to see a unified game where, when we have events like the Players Championship, that we have all the best players in the world and we\u2019re proud to call them PGA Tour members. That\u2019s what I want. I don\u2019t know how we get there, but that\u2019s what I want. \u201cOur commissioner has been saying for months that the next step is to have Yasir meet with players of the PGA Tour. He has been saying that for months. There\u2019s been, obviously, all sorts of challenges to making that happen but that\u2019s essential. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely essential because at its core players have no business running the PGA Tour, but this is a members\u2019 organisation. We should have input in the direction it goes.\u201d Inside the ropes, Wyndham Clark started day three with a four-stroke lead and finished it one shy of Xander Schauffele. A 65 from Schauffele took him to 17 under par. Clark\u2019s 70 included the possibly decisive finding of water at the iconic 17th. Brian Harman rampaged through the pack, with the Open champion\u2019s 64 moving him to 15 under. \u201cThis is my favourite PGA Tour event of the year,\u201d Harman said. \u201cI love coming here. They treat us like kings when we show up. The golf course is incredible. I\u2019ve been close here a couple of times. I\u2019m really excited for tomorrow.\u201d Matt Fitzpatrick and Maverick McNealy are minus 13. Rory McIlroy\u2019s race looked to be run as he double bogeyed the 14th to move back to level par for the day. The Northern Irishman responded impressively, producing birdies at the last three holes for a 69 and nine under total. McIlroy will retain hopes of a second Players crown but overall unease about the state of his game was emphasised by the 34-year-old heading straight to the driving range after round three. Ludvig \u00c5berg\u2019s 67 means he has tied McIlroy\u2019s 54-hole score. The 24-year-old Swede\u2019s emergence at elite level continues apace. \u00c5berg bogeyed the 1st and 18th but delivered seven birdies in between."

            "content": "\u2018An opera of dazzling surfaces, knowing theatrical tropes and deliberate distancing effects,\u201d is how director Polly Graham describes The Rake\u2019s Progress, in a programme note for her new staging for English Touring Opera. Completed in 1951, Stravinsky\u2019s ironic Hogarthian parable ranges allusively through operatic history in its exploration of the relationship between indolent Tom Rakewell and demonic Nick Shadow, deploying the formalities of 18th-century opera \u2013 recitative, aria and ensemble \u2013 to distance us from the protagonists even as the music itself exposes their thoughts and feelings with extraordinary poignancy. But where Stravinsky strives for narrative clarity, Graham on occasion tips stylisation towards surrealism, with uneven results. April Dalton\u2019s designs elide Rococo frippery with the distortion of Dal\u00ed, as pictures of eyes and lips materialise on the walls of Mother Goose\u2019s brothel, and bizarre bric-a-brac fills the house where Baba (Lauren Young) lives with Tom (Frederick Jones, unwell on opening night; his understudy, Brenton Spiteri, sang the last two acts from the side of the stage). Some of it is unduly busy. The opening scene between Tom and Anne (Nazan Fikret) now takes place at a May Day festival, during which Tom is already being eyed by Shadow (Jerome Knox), while masked pagan figures, half-human, half animal, dance round a maypole. There\u2019s more maypole later on in the graveyard scene, which proves distracting. Some of it is striking. Casting a younger baritone than usual as Shadow allows her to present the pair as alter egos rather than middle-aged mentor and hapless protege. We\u2019re never quite sure whether or not London is a hell on earth populated by Shadows\u2019s demonic minions, while Bedlam, ironically, seems the only calm place in a world where \u201cgood or bad, all men are mad,\u201d as Baba puts it. Elsewhere, however, Graham\u2019s ideas sometimes don\u2019t quite work. Anne sets out to redeem Tom as a warrior heroine in trousers and chainmail, brandishing a sword like Bradamante in Handel\u2019s Alcina, which comes close to undermining Stravinsky\u2019s depiction of her courage as born of simple goodness. That it does not is due to Fikret, who sings with a wonderfully silvery tone and great depth of feeling throughout. This is one of several superb performances in an evening which, musically, is consistently fine. Knox\u2019s elegant Shadow is all the more dangerous for being so plausibly charming, even when he is at his most malevolent. A couple of moments of wayward intonation apart, Jones didn\u2019t sound as if he was struggling in Act I: Spiteri\u2019s voice is slightly darker, nicely combining weight with lyricism. Young, meanwhile, makes a really fine Baba, funny, self-assured, tellingly compassionate beneath the self-dramatisation. In the pit, Jack Sheen propels the score urgently forwards. It\u2019s beautifully played with some wonderfully precise, elegant instrumental solos, and the choral singing is first rate. \u2022 At Norwich Theatre Royal on 8 March, then touring"

            "content": "As results from Ireland\u2019s referendums began to trickle in, I cringed as I imagined the international headlines that would follow: \u201cIreland votes to keep women in the home\u201d and \u201cReferendums to modernise Irish constitution fail\u201d were likely interpretations of the \u201cno-no\u201d vote. This was the latest in a series of referendums that have seen Ireland progress into the 21st century. I\u2019m sure the government felt that winning it would be easy, considering the success of the same-sex marriage and abortion referendums, which helped to earn Ireland a status as a beacon of liberal progressivism. But now I fear that, after Ireland\u2019s recent flirtation with the far right, we\u2019ll be seen as a backward country. On Friday, International Women\u2019s Day, Irish citizens took to the polls to vote in two referendums intended to modernise the country\u2019s constitution, which has been in place since 1937. From the get-go, Ireland\u2019s rightwing and conservative groups campaigned for no votes in both the family referendum and the care referendum. For me and many others, a yes to the family referendum was a no-brainer: it proposed broadening the definition of a family beyond marriage to include those in \u201cdurable relationships\u201d. But the care referendum was much more complex. The referendum proposed removing article 41.2, dubbed the \u201cwoman in the home\u201d provision, and replacing it with wording that could see families saddled with the responsibility to provide care, while the state would \u201cstrive\u201d to support them. In its analysis of the amendments, the Free Legal Advice Centres (FLAC) worried that the wording of the proposed amendment was \u201cineffective\u201d and was \u201cunlikely to provide carers, people with disabilities or older people with any new enforceable rights or to require the state to provide improved childcare, personal assistance services, supports for independent-living, respite care or supports for children with disabilities\u201d. I resented the government for trading social inequalities, and replacing sexist language with ableist language. My identities as a woman and as a disabled person were in conflict. My relationship with feminism has been a tumultuous one. As a disabled woman, my experience of inequality differs from that of my non-disabled peers. My younger brother and both I have the progressive neuromuscular condition Friedreich\u2019s ataxia, so the concept of care plays a big role in our lives. His condition is much more advanced than mine, and he is 100% reliant on my parents and his nine hours of weekly government-funded care. For able-bodied women, this referendum is about relieving an obligation to care \u2013 an obligation that women have been unfairly saddled with for centuries. But as a disabled woman, I need society to be more caring, not less. The failure of the yes campaign to even acknowledge this tension has been a great source of vexation for me over recent weeks. I felt that the rights of disabled people were being sacrificed by mainstream activists and NGOs who campaigned for a yes vote, ignoring the pleas of disabled people and carers. I worry constantly about my ageing parents, who are already struggling to cope with the physically laborious task of caring. What will happen to my brother as my parents get older? Who will take care of them in their old age? And what about me? I despair when I think about a future in which my husband is forced to give up his job, rely on carer\u2019s allowance and dedicate his life to my care. I want to live an independent life, which only state-provided care can offer me. I felt the tide turning towards a no vote when an interview clip of Ireland\u2019s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, on Virgin Media One amassed huge popularity on social media. In the clip, Varadkar spoke about caring for his family members and said: \u201cI don\u2019t actually think that\u2019s the state\u2019s responsibility to be honest. I think it\u2019s very much a family responsibility.\u201d The outrage was immediately palpable online. Varadkar was eager to clarify his statement and claim that he had been misinterpreted, but the damage was done. The wording of the care referendum was perceived as yet another government failure over disability rights, the most recent of which was a \u201cdegrading and humiliating\u201d proposal to reform welfare payments. Voters had their different reasons for choosing \u201cno-no\u201d on Friday. For many, their vote was against the confusing wording of the text or the haphazard conduct of the yes campaign, or simply against a government that has failed to deliver on health, housing and education. Some feminists rejected the proposals because they didn\u2019t go far enough \u2013 and yes, some people will have voted them down because they want to keep women in the home. But the decisive defeat of the care referendum wasn\u2019t a win for Ireland\u2019s far right. Anyone who suggests that is glossing over the admirable work of disabled people, carers and their allies who want to hold the state accountable. The government would be making a grave mistake if it underestimates the political appetite for change and chalks the result up to conservative groups. Instead it must recognise the public desire for true equality and progress rather than tokenistic referendums that divide activists and NGOs. I would be very happy to revisit a care referendum with a different text in the future, under a different government that respects the autonomy of disabled people. That would guarantee a yes from me. The failure of the referendum is a victory for Ireland\u2019s disability community, and I am relieved that Ireland did not vote to abdicate the state\u2019s responsibility to care for its citizens. But the archaic language that defines women\u2019s role as in the home will continue to sit in our country\u2019s constitution until a government is willing to deliver equality for all. We take no comfort in that. Niamh N\u00ed Hoireabhaird is a disability activist and journalist"

            "date": "2024-03-09T14:03:08Z",
            "content": "Two serving ministers have called for a \u201cmuch greater pace\u201d of investment in defence spending, putting pressure on Rishi Sunak a day after the Commons\u2019 spending watchdog warned that the Ministry of Defence had no credible plan to fund the military capabilities the government wants. The Foreign Office minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan and Home Office minister Tom Tugendhat said in a post on LinkedIn that the UK needed to \u201clead the way\u201d by increasing defence and security spending to at least 2.5% of gross domestic product, a measure of the size of the economy. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has said \u201cour spending will rise to 2.5% as soon as economic conditions allow\u201d \u2013 surpassing the Nato-wide target of 2% \u2013 but provided no details of how that would happen. \u201cThe sad truth is that the world is no longer benign,\u201d Trevelyan and Tugendhat wrote. \u201cProtecting ourselves requires investment. And effective investment means that our industrial complex must grow and strengthen at much greater pace than at present.\u201d The article was not required to be cleared by No 10 because it was a social media post. It was also in line with government policy on increasing spending to 2.5%. But the article by the senior Tories signals unease within the ranks over defence spending \u2013 an unease reflected in the findings of the public accounts committee. On Friday, the committee published a report calling for the government to get firmer control of defence procurement, noting that the defence ministry had become \u201cincreasingly reliant on the UK\u2019s allies to protect our national interests\u201d. The report found that the gap between the defence ministry\u2019s budget and the cost of the UK\u2019s desired military capabilities had increased to \u00a316.9bn \u2013 its largest deficit to date \u2013 but the committee warned that the real deficit could be closer to \u00a329bn. \u201cIn an increasingly volatile world, the Ministry of Defence\u2019s lack of a credible plan to deliver fully funded military capability as desired by government leaves us in an alarming place,\u201d said Dame Meg Hillier, the chair of the committee. In response to the report, a No 10 spokesperson told the PA news agency: \u201cThe prime minister has overseen the largest sustained defence spending increase since the end of the cold war and a \u00a324bn uplift in cash terms over the spending review period. \u201cWe are ensuring that we have the largest defence budget in history, increasing spend and ensuring that we have the funding that we need to protect UK national interests.\u201d In their article, Trevelyan, the Indo-Pacific minister, and security minister Tugendhat said they were concerned about the level of defence spending needed to respond to China, which announced this week that it was increasing its defence spending by another 7.2%, and Russia, which has committed to spending 40% of its expenditure on defence \u2013 much of that in Ukraine. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to us that the UK needs to lead the way in increasing our own domestic defence and security spending commitments to 2.5% and beyond,\u201d they wrote. \u201cFormer defence secretary Ben Wallace and prime minister Boris Johnson made inroads into growing our defence budgets, which had been shrinking in real terms for years. But that only filled the hole. Now we need growth.\u201d They called for an investment in defence and security industry, a strengthening of the UK\u2019s nuclear deterrent and a growing of the country\u2019s munitions lines, in part to help bolster the efforts in Ukraine. \u201cWe cannot turn on the complex platforms and weapons which ensure military advantage overnight,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe must start that growth now, invest at pace to support our allies and stay ahead of our adversaries.\u201d"

            "content": "Opportunities to revive the UK\u2019s flagging economy by boosting green industry were missed in one of the least green budgets of recent years, experts have said. Several said this failure to recognise one of the fastest-expanding areas of business \u2013 the net zero economy grew by 9% in key areas last year, while the rest of the economy was stagnant, according to CBI estimates \u2013 would drag down the UK in the short and long term. Alasdair Johnstone, of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: \u201cAt a time when the US and EU are competing over investment in clean industries, there was little here to attract investment.\u201d He said this could prove costly, pointing to forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility that found instability in the Middle East could drive up energy costs again, leading to a need to borrow fresh billions on top of the government debt already accrued in combating the current gas crisis. \u201cSpeeding up the deployment of renewables, the insulation of homes, the rollout of heat pumps and the uptake of electric vehicles would boost our energy security,\u201d Johnstone said. None of these received much attention in Wednesday\u2019s budget. Instead, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, opted to freeze fuel duty for a 14th year running, a move likely to benefit richer people and do little for those on low incomes. Rail prices have risen annually over the same period, and J\u00fcrgen Maier, a former chief executive of Siemens in the UK and a strong advocate of HS2, who is now advising Labour on a green industrial strategy, said the move sent the wrong signal. \u201cIt sends the message that we want you to drive your petrol and diesel cars,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere are the incentives to get people back on public transport?\u201d Hunt, a self-described green Tory before he became chancellor, flourished a few minor measures with a green tinge. There was \u00a3120m for the green industries growth accelerator initiative, to be spent on emerging low-carbon technologies; a \u00a3270m push for zero-carbon aviation and road vehicles; a \u00a31.5bn extension of the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas to 2029; more money for offshore wind developers, to encourage them to bid to build new projects after previous offshore wind auctions failed; and slightly higher duties on business class flights. Advocates of new nuclear power were buoyed up by the next phase of the competition to select a small modular reactor design, and the purchase of the Wylfa and Oldbury sites for potential new reactors, to be bought from Hitachi for \u00a3160m. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: \u201cThis is a pivotal moment for the future of nuclear in the UK and should mark the beginning of new projects at these sites. The success of ramping up nuclear capacity for energy security and net zero rests a great deal on whether we develop at these sites and others.\u201d Also missing from Hunt was any detail on the government\u2019s proposal, aired in December, for a carbon tariff on imports. The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) is intended to level the playing field for UK companies that are investing in cutting their greenhouse gas emissions, by penalising imports from countries with high emissions. Judith Richardson, the head of sustainability at the consultancy Argon &amp; Co, said: \u201cIt was hoped that the budget would give much-needed clarity over the UK\u2019s plans to implement the CBAM. However, this opportunity was missed and businesses are still largely in the dark.\u201d It was the lack of a clear strategy for combining the need to reach net zero by 2050 with the growth opportunities offered by low-carbon technologies that most dismayed green economists. Esin Serin, a policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, at the London School of Economics, said: \u201cThe budget unfortunately fails to offer the kind of changes that would unleash public and private investment and drive sustainable growth \u2026 We pointed out that an additional \u00a326bn a year in public investment is needed towards the sustainable economy to drive improvements in productivity and growth. The budget falls far short of this.\u201d Ed Matthew, a campaigns director at E3G, said: \u201cThis government has no credible plan for growth. Uncertainty on how the UK will decarbonise industry, homes, power and transport has led to chronic under-investment. This is compounded by a lack of green tax breaks, low levels of public investment and not having a long-term net zero investment plan. The UK economy is flatlining and this budget will fail to bring it back to life.\u201d Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, said: \u201cThis budget confirms once and for all that the Sunak government has given up when it comes to making Britain a clean energy superpower. There was no ambition, no vision, no commitment. \u201cWhere there should have been a plan to build the future in Britain, the inevitable consequence of five more years of the Conservatives will be higher bills, energy insecurity, and jobs going overseas. After 14 years of Tory failure, only Labour can make Britain energy-independent with Great British Energy, our new publicly owned energy company, and our national wealth fund to invest in good jobs across our country.\u201d"

Diamond has also said that up to 20 players from the Premiership\u2019s bottom club will be departing at the end of the season. Diamond, who has taken charge with Newcastle still winless after 12 matches, is preparing for a squad shakeup but is not anticipating an instant cash windfall after the club\u2019s chairman, Semore Kurdi, travelled to Saudi Arabia for talks. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s potential investment at the minute,\u201d said Diamond. \u201cSemore and Matt Thompson went out and met all the rugby union dignitaries in Saudi Arabia. I don\u2019t think for a minute they\u2019re expecting us to put a game on before the Tyson Fury fight in May but they want to investigate how we can help them and reciprocate if there is any potential investment. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a natural connection with the soccer team here \u2026 and I know they\u2019re coming over to one of our home games. They\u2019re embracing many sports at the moment and they want rugby to be a focus point in Saudi Arabia. That\u2019s what the discussions were about. It wasn\u2019t about going there, opening the war chest and saying: \u2018Steve, go and buy the All Black team.\u2019 I\u2019d like that but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s happened.\u201d On a day when the foreign ownership of sporting organisations was a topic of heated debate in the House of Lords, Diamond also said rugby was not financially strong enough to reject completely the idea of Saudi investment because of human rights concerns. \u201cI\u2019m not skilled enough to talk about human rights but it doesn\u2019t seem to bother any other sport performing in Saudi Arabia. Club rugby is obviously still in a very delicate position. It needs to get itself out of the jam it\u2019s found itself in. Bizarrely, the salary cap is going up. It beggars belief really.\u201d In the more immediate term, Diamond has confirmed that highly rated youngsters Guy Pepper and Louie Johnson will depart the club this summer, with the duo poised to join Bath and Saracens respectively. Others are due to learn their fate early next month. \u201cIt\u2019s not nice telling people they\u2019ve no longer got a job but some of them will be expecting it. It needs to be articulated in an honest and direct way and I\u2019ve always behaved like that.\u201d The Premiership resumes on Friday evening after an eight-week hiatus with Leicester facing Gloucester and Bristol hosting leaders Northampton. England\u2019s fit-again Jack van Poortvliet makes a long awaited return to Leicester\u2019s matchday squad, with Ollie Chessum, Dan Cole and Tommy Reffell catapulted straight back into the starting XV six days after the final round of Six Nations games.

Critics said it was ushering in a \u201cnew era of authoritarianism\u201d, and would scare off the international business and investment that the city\u2019s chief executive, John Lee, is trying to draw back to Hong Kong. Many of the listed crimes were already covered by the national security law (NSL) imposed by Beijing in 2020, but the new law contains additional targets on foreign entities and Hongkongers who interact with them. Lee said was it was \u201cneeded to guard against people who invade our home\u201d. Thomas Kellogg, a law professor at Georgetown University, told Bloomberg last month that the provisions on foreign contact could limit the activity of chambers of commerce and economic research groups. \u201cThe free flow of information is the lifeblood of any vibrant market economy,\u201d Kellogg said. Some business groups had expressed particular concern about broad definitions in the new law, particularly around definitions of state secrets and espionage. Another legal academic, who was formerly based in Hong Kong and requested anonymity, said: \u201cMultinationals in general will now think twice about basing themselves in Hong Kong or moving senior people to Hong Kong, simply because article 23 can be used quite liberally to frame people on the grounds of espionage or theft of state secrets.\u201d The EU said in a statement that the new law \u201craises questions about Hong Kong\u2019s long-term attractiveness as an international business hub\u201d. It said the bill had the potential to \u201csignificantly\u201d affect the work of its office in the city, as well other organisations and companies. UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, said it would \u201cmake it harder for those who live, work and do business in Hong Kong\u201d. The Hong Kong Media Overseas (HKMO) group said there was now an increased risk of foreign media outlets, particularly those covering \u201cdissenting voices\u201d, leaving. Some, like Radio Free Asia, have already decided to. \u201cThis legislation creates a very low threshold for criminalising statements claimed to be false or misleading,\u201d HKMO said. The government rejects claims that the laws will affect international business and investment. Lee says the national security laws will help. \u201cAll economic and social activities require a secure and stable environment,\u201d he said in February. China\u2019s leadership should be heeding the international concerns, said the veteran pro-democracy politician Emily Lau, noting data on the exodus of foreigners, finance and locals from Hong Kong. \u201cPresident Xi Jinping and other officials have said many times that they want Hong Kong to continue to be an international business and financial centre,\u201d she said. Lau said enacting domestic national security legislation was a constitutional requirement \u2013 and in fact two decades overdue \u2013 but she said the rush of article 23 was unlike anything she\u2019d seen in her 25-years as a legislator, and she had major concerns about the lack of response to parties like the UN human rights commissioner. \u201cDoing it is one thing, but how you do it, and whether you give people inside or outside Hong Kong the time to raise questions and concerns and get replies \u2013 is another.\u201d The government\u2019s activity is not popular. Lee\u2019s approval rating is at a record low since he took office \u2013 unopposed \u2013 in July 2022. Observers say the Hong Kong government is carrying out the wishes of Beijing, rather than those of its own people. In practice, Hong Kong is not balancing its two aims of tightening security and maintaining its international status. New visa schemes, slashed stamp duties on property and big international events were supposed to draw back foreign visitors after the pandemic and a reputation-shattering crackdown on the city\u2019s pro-democracy movement. But the schemes and property sales have been dominated by people from mainland China, and there has been reporting for months on multinational corporations quietly shifting to Singapore. Johannes Hack, the president of the German Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, said: \u201cWith Article 23 legislation in place, we hope that Hong Kong can now focus on those qualities that have traditionally contributed so much to its success: its openness, its straightforward legal regime and ease of doing business and its connector function between East and West.\u201d The European and British chambers declined to comment. The law will come into force on Saturday. \u201cThe reputation of Hong Kong as an international financial hub is long gone,\u201d said the anonymous Hong Kong academic. \u201cIt didn\u2019t begin with article 23 \u2013 it was particularly after the passing of the NSL in 2020 \u2013 but it\u2019s all been down hill.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 24 March 2024 to expand the quote from Johannes Hack, president of the German Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong."

            "date": "2024-03-12T14:00:47Z",
            "content": "The federal government is one step closer to fully funding all public schools after reaching an agreement with the Northern Territory to double the commonwealth\u2019s funding contribution. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, chief minister of the NT, Eva Lawler, and education minister Jason Clare and his counterpart Mark Monaghan will sign the statement of intent on Wednesday morning. It outlines a $1bn investment that will see all public schools in the NT reach 100% of the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) by 2029 \u2013 more than two decades earlier than would have been the case under current settings. The SRS is the benchmark for required funding based on student needs. Under the proposed agreement, the federal government would double its SRS contribution to 40%, investing at least $748m in additional funding from 2025 to 2029. The territory government would contribute the remaining 60%, estimated to be $350m over the same period. The most disadvantaged schools would receive additional funding first and reach the SRS before 2029, with the schools to come first to be decided in the final agreement. Albanese said his government was \u201ccommitted to making sure that no Australian child is left behind\u201d, pointing to specific challenges facing the territory, including concentrations of disadvantage. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup It follows a $40.4m funding boost outlined in last year\u2019s budget for disadvantaged Central Australian schools to reach 100% of the SRS by the end of 2024. The funding needed for a public school student in the NT to bridge the gap is almost double the national average, which is why the commonwealth is paying a higher percentage of the SRS in the Territory. In the NT, public schools have reached just over 80% of their SRS, while private schools are at more than 97%, according to a Department of Education internal briefing. \u201cEducation and equality go hand in hand, however access to quality education has been out of reach for many in the Northern Territory,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cThis historic agreement is yet another example of how my government is working constructively with state and territory governments across the country.\u201d It\u2019s the second statement of intent secured by the commonwealth, as Clare continues to negotiate the next National School Reform Agreement (NSRA) with education ministers. The Turnbull government\u2019s Gonski 2.0 education reforms required states to fund public schools at 75% of the SRS on top of the federal contribution of 20%, leaving a funding gap of at least 5%. No public school in Australia, except for schools in the Australian Capital Territory, is funded at the SRS level. Western Australia was the first state or territory to ink a deal with the commonwealth in January that would see the federal government lift its funding contribution to 22.5% \u2013 equating to an extra $777m. Under the statement of intent, WA\u2019s public schools would get to the full SRS by 2026 in return for the state implementing teacher quality and student wellbeing reforms. The deal was criticised by education experts and the Australian Education Union (AEU) for locking in underfunding by continuing to allow about 4% of the SRS to be claimed by states on non-school expenditures such as depreciation, school transport and early childhood education. The Morrison-era clause will remain in the NT agreement, the education minister confirmed, equating to about $40m of the territory\u2019s annual school funding. The clause will be considered in negotiations for the next NSRA, the education minister said. State governments also poured cold water on the WA deal, with New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia banding together to demand a 5% commonwealth funding increase. The NT response was muted. Clare has until the end of the year to reach a deal with the remaining states and territories. He said it was an \u201chistoric day\u201d for public education in the NT and a \u201cgreat example\u201d of governments working together for aligned outcomes. \u201cAt the moment, Northern Territory public schools only get less than 80% of the funding that David Gonski said they should,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, one in five kids are not receiving funding. This agreement fixes that \u2026 the most underfunded schools in Australia will now be fully funded.\u201d The NT government has consistently lobbied the federal government to increase its funding share to 40%, while failing for two years to meet its own bilateral funding targets. The NT and WA are the only jurisdictions where state and territory funding to public schools declined in real terms between 2012 and 2021. The AEU has similarly called for the Albanese government to lift its share of public school funding from 20% to 25% of the SRS, and 40% in the NT due to the additional need. Monaghan said the deal was a \u201clandmark investment\u201d that would make an \u201cimmediate difference\u201d in schools. He said the funding would contribute to better salaries, smaller class sizes and improved technology."

            "date": "2024-03-16T23:04:10Z",
            "content": "The Chicago Bears are trading quarterback Justin Fields to the Pittsburgh Steelers for a 2025 sixth-round pick that could be upgraded to a fourth-round pick based on playing time, ESPN reported on Saturday, citing multiple team sources. The team confirmed the news later on Saturday. The trade was reported five days after the Steelers signed nine-time Pro Bowl quarterback Russell Wilson to a one-year deal. ESPN reported that Fields, a first-round pick in 2021, will not be competiting with Wilson for the starting job and will serve as his understudy in the quarterback room. The deal clears the way for the Bears to draft a quarterback with the No 1 overall pick \u2013 perhaps USC\u2019s Caleb Williams. \u201cWe have engaged in multiple trade conversations in recent weeks and believe trading Justin at this time to Pittsburgh is what is best for both Justin and the Bears,\u201d general manager Ryan Poles said in a statement. \u201cToday we spoke to Justin to inform him of the trade and the rationale behind it for us as a club. \u201cWe want to thank him for his tireless dedication, leadership and all he poured into our franchise and community the last three years and wish him the best towards a long and successful NFL career.\u201d Fields thanked Chicago and the organization, as well as his teammates in a post on X. \u201cCan\u2019t say thank you enough to the city of Chicago for taking me in and embracing me,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThank you to the entire Bears organization and ownership for allowing me the opportunity to be part of such a historic franchise. But most of all thank you to my all my brothers that I played with. You all were the reason I attacked each day the way I did. I can\u2019t thank you all enough for what y\u2019all have meant to me over the last 3 years through the ups and downs. I wish each one of you nothing but success. \u201cReady for this next chapter!\u201d Wilson tweeted a picture of him and Fields shaking hands with the message: \u201cLet\u2019s get it @justnfields! QB room bout to be (fire).\u201d Fields, drafted 11th overall in 2021 by the Bears and former general manager Ryan Pace, struggled as a rookie under former coach Matt Nagy. Though he produced big plays with his legs and arms, he did not develop as a passer the way the team hoped the past two years under Poles and coach Matt Eberflus. Fields completed 578 of 958 passes for 6,674 yards with 40 touchdowns and 30 interceptions in three seasons. He has just one 300-yard passing game in his career. Chicago could have gotten a big haul by trading the No. 1 pick. But it\u2019s not often the historically quarterback-challenged Bears have a chance to draft a prospect such as Williams. The 2022 Heisman Trophy winner is largely expected to be picked first overall after he threw 72 touchdown passes with only 10 interceptions the past two seasons at USC after a year at Oklahoma. The trade of Fields comes two days after the Bears acquired Keenan Allen from the Los Angeles Chargers in their second deal for a star receiver in as many years. They dealt the No 1 pick in 2023 to Carolina for DJ Moore last March. The Bears also got the Panthers\u2019 first-rounder this year. And with Carolina finishing a league-worst 2-15 record, Chicago wound up with the No. 1 pick this year. Fields, meanwhile, gets a chance at a fresh start in Pittsburgh. The Steelers totally revamped their quarterback room over the last month, with Pickett, Mitch Trubisky (cut) and Mason Rudolph (signed with Tennessee) gone. President Art Rooney II made it very clear in January that it was \u201ctime to get some wins\u201d in the postseason. While the team publicly backed Pickett in the aftermath of a year that ended with the former first-round pick serving as Rudolph\u2019s backup, in a way the Steelers had no choice at the time with Trubisky all but assured of being a salary cap casualty and Rudolph set to become a free agent. Things have changed rapidly, an uncharacteristic development for a team that prides itself on stability in a league built on the opposite in most places. There is little doubt Wilson will be the starter in Week 1, allowing Fields time to get familiar with first-year offensive coordinator Arthur Smith\u2019s system and hit the reset button on a career that hasn\u2019t gone to plan. While Fields has had accuracy issues, he also offers the kind of mobility that Steelers coach Mike Tomlin has craved for years. Tomlin hoped Pickett would be able to offer a portion of it. Instead, Pickett struggled to make significant strides during his first full season as a starter in 2023. He threw for just six touchdowns and four interceptions in 12 games, the kind of production that sent Pittsburgh into the offseason with more questions than answers about the most important position on the field. Four days into the new league year, those questions are very different. Can Wilson regain the winning touch he had during his highly successful run in Seattle? And can Fields develop into the kind of player Chicago envisioned when it took him with the 11th overall pick in 2021?"

            "date": "2024-03-14T12:44:53Z",
            "content": "The UK and Turkey have started talks about a post-Brexit free trade agreement targeting the service sector of the economy. The UK government said there were \u201chuge opportunities\u201d for British businesses in exporting to Turkey, as one of the fastest-growing economies in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development group of nations, with trade between the two countries worth \u00a326bn in 2022. Ministers had announced in July last year their intention to hold trade talks with Turkey, and last November began months of consultation with businesses and trade groups over the UK\u2019s priorities for an agreement. The government said UK businesses including Deloitte, Diageo and Vodafone had helped to shape negotiation objectives through a public call for input, before the first round of detailed discussions scheduled for the summer. The talks come at a delicate moment in ties between Turkey and western governments after the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who holds warmer relations with Russia than other Nato member states, held up the progress of Sweden\u2019s membership until his government granted its backing in January. Kemi Badenoch, the UK trade secretary, said Turkey was an \u201cimportant economic and strategic partner\u201d and that a trade deal could help boost exports of British services. Badenoch launched the talks in London on Thursday alongside her Turkish counterpart, \u00d6mer Bolat. A deal could also give British consumers improved choice and better access to imported Turkish goods such as nuts, bulgar wheat and tomatoes, the government said. Britain already has a trade deal with Turkey, which was rolled over after Brexit in a continuity agreement to minimise disruption. Before leaving the EU, the UK benefited from trading with Turkey through an EU-Turkey customs union. Turkey had launched membership talks with the EU in 2005, but the accession process and efforts to expand its customs deal have since stalled amid concerns in EU capitals over the gradual erosion of democracy under Erdo\u011fan. While Turkey\u2019s economy has grown at a rapid pace over Erdo\u011fan\u2019s 20 years in power, it has also been rocked by successive crises, including bouts of galloping inflation and crashes in the Turkish lira triggered by the president\u2019s unorthodox stance on economic policy. The UK government said Turkey presented significant opportunities for British businesses, including in transport, engineering, financial services, manufacturing and tech, driven in part by the country\u2019s decarbonisation efforts and significant investment in rail. It said the deal would focus on the UK\u2019s strengths in services, which make up 80% of GDP, while highlighting that in 2020 there were 57,000 UK jobs supported by exports to Turkey, of which 68% were in services. \u201cAn upgraded deal will give the UK\u2019s world-leading services sector a competitive edge in this growing market and has the potential to support jobs across the UK,\u201d Badenoch said."

            "date": "2024-03-26T15:56:30Z",
            "content": "Major League Soccer referees will return to work this weekend after ratifying a new collective bargaining agreement that ends a month-long lockout, the league said on Tuesday. The seven-year agreement between the Professional Referee Organization (PRO) and Professional Soccer Referees Association (PSRA) runs through 2030 and is the longest labor deal for match officials in MLS history, according to the league. PRSA is the labor union representing referees who work MLS matches. PRO, which was formed in a 2012 partnership between between MLS and US Soccer, manages MLS match officials. \u201cWe look forward to having the PRO match officials return this weekend, and we thank MLS players, coaches and clubs for their professionalism, and our fans for their support throughout the opening month of the season,\u201d MLS executive vice-president Nelson Rodriguez said in a statement. After the PSRA rejected a proposed new labor pact in mid-February, the PRO locked out referees before the 2024 MLS season opener featuring Lionel Messi\u2019s Inter Miami. At the time, the PSRA said the failed ratification was driven by issues with the compensation and benefits PRO was offering, as well as a lack of improvements to travel, scheduling and other quality-of-life concerns. \u201cThe skyrocketing growth of MLS has significantly increased demands on officials mentally and physically, and as such has increased demands on both our professional and personal time,\u201d PSRA president and lead negotiator Peter Manikowski said in a statement when announcing the lockout. Replacement officials from the lower divisions of US Soccer, Jamaica, Brazil, Turkey, Spain, Poland, Mexico and Italy were drafted in to cover the 37-day lockout. PRO last locked out MLS referees over labor talks in 2014, when replacement officials were used for the first two weeks of the season. That lock out passed largely without incident, but the early stages of this season have been blighted by errors. As the weeks passed, managers and players started to vocalize their frustrations at the quality of the replacement officials. \u201cTwenty-two added minutes, red card on the [Chicago] goalkeeper that isn\u2019t given, their third goal came from a corner that shouldn\u2019t have been, their first goal was offside,\u201d CF Montr\u00e9al head coach Laurent Courtois said after his team lost 4-3 to Chicago Fire. \u201cSomething was taken away from my guys.\u201d During the opening weekend of the season, Mark Delgado was incorrectly sent off for the LA Galaxy just minutes before Inter Miami scored an equalizer. The next week, an official incorrectly awarded a throw-in that led to Philadelphia Union scoring against Sporting KC. \u201cIt\u2019s just so infuriating when you work so hard for the time you do, and then such a blatant mistake really costs you,\u201d Sporting KC captain Johnny Russell said after the match. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult. It leaves sort of a sour taste in your mouth.\u201d PRO general manager Mark Geiger said in an interview with ESPN earlier this month that the replacement referees used this season failed to meet the standard set by the unionized officials in 2023. As part of the new CBA, referees, assistant referees and assistant video referees will receive raises. Under the previous CBA, officials with less than two years experience were paid $50,000 a year, according to the Athletic. That will jump to $85,000 under the new terms. Officials with more experience will see their pay increase to $142,000, up from the $108,000 they were paid under the old agreement. By 2030, the salary for officials with under 200 games of experience will rise to $110,000. Officials with 200 games or more of experience will be paid $182,000 a year. \u201cWe thank the hundreds of officials in the US and Canada who stood in solidarity with us showing their strength and professionalism,\u201d Manikowski said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cTogether, we have won much-needed improvements while demonstrating the value of having the best referees in Major League Soccer on the pitch.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-18T06:00:04Z",
            "content": "The company run by the Tory donor Frank Hester, whose remarks about Diane Abbott have been widely condemned as racist, paid a Conservative peer \u00a3148,000 to act as a trade envoy, the Guardian can reveal, as evidence of his links to the party deepen. Zahida Manzoor, a former deputy chair of the Commission for Racial Equality in the 1990s who went on to be a Lords whip under Theresa May\u2019s government, took on the part-time role as chair of a Middle East advisory council for Hester\u2019s health tech TPP in September 2016. The \u00a312,300-a-month role, which ended in September 2017, shows that Hester\u2019s ties to the Conservatives go back longer than previously thought. Lady Manzoor confirmed the role at the Phoenix Partnership (TPP) and pointed out that it was declared in the register of members\u2019 interests at the time. She joined the widespread condemnation of the Hester\u2019s remarks last week, and told the Guardian she did not witness any racism when working for TPP. Hester has donated \u00a310m to the party in the last year, in two \u00a35m tranches in May and November, and is reported to have donated a further \u00a35m, which has yet to be declared. The Guardian also revealed that Rishi Sunak was flown to Leeds by Hester for a private tour of TPP\u2019s offices last November. When she took on the role, Manzoor was an not affiliated to a party after resigning the Liberal Democrat whip over Brexit. In October 2016, three weeks after taking the role with TPP, she announced that she had joined the Conservatives. Manzoor left TPP in June 2017. She said: \u201cThe contract was ended by mutual agreement as the business decided to focus on China rather than the Middle East \u2026 This was purely a commercial decision.\u201d She did not deny the sums involved. \u201cMy remuneration is a contractual matter as agreed between TPP and myself,\u201d she said. Asked to comment on Hester\u2019s remarks about Abbott, she said: \u201cThat type of language is totally inappropriate and unacceptable in any circumstance. No forms of racism or discrimination should be condoned or tolerated. However, during my short time with TPP, I never heard any comments of this nature and certainly nothing was said to me or in my presence by Mr Hester or anyone else at TPP.\u201d TPP has received more than \u00a3400m in contracts from the NHS and other government bodies since 2016. It also manages the software for more than 60m patient records across the UK. Last week the BMA\u2019s general practice committee urged Hester to resign from TPP and noted that his remarks \u201ccontravened NHS England\u2019s fit and proper person test\u201d. Asked if TPP should be given any further NHS contracts, Manzoor, who is also a former regional chair of NHS, said: \u201cProcurement of IT/patient administration systems are a matter for GPs, NHS health boards and NHS England. \u201cClearly, it\u2019s important the fit and proper test should be applied when contracts are awarded. I would suggest this test is re-evaluated periodically \u2013 particularly when contracts are up for renewal or if new information comes to light. \u201cAny donations to the Conservative party are a matter for the party itself.\u201d TPP has been approached for comment."

The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, will announce the fund in Melbourne on Tuesday when he addresses a gathering of 100 chief executives from Australia and south-east Asia. Albanese will say in a speech that he is pursuing \u201cthe most significant upgrade of Australia\u2019s economic engagement with Asean for a generation\u201d, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. He will also promise to improve access to longer-term visas for south-east Asian travellers, saying this \u201cdemonstrates unequivocally that Australia is open for business, tourism and trade\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The $2bn south-east Asia investment financing facility is to be managed by Export Finance Australia. It is expected to provide loans, guarantees, equity and insurance to increase Australian trade and investment in south-east Asia. \u201cThe government I lead has made it clear: more than any other region, south-east Asia is where Australia\u2019s future lies,\u201d Albanese will tell business leaders, according to speech notes distributed to media in advance. He will say Australia\u2019s two-way trade with Asean member states topped $178bn in 2022 \u2013 and two-way investment was worth $307bn \u2013 \u201cbut we want to do more to support regional growth and to realise mutual benefits\u201d. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said he would speak to the same gathering of investors on Tuesday \u201cbecause we really believe we can turbocharge these relationships with Asean countries\u201d. Chalmers said Asean was \u201cthe hope of the side when it comes to two-way trade\u201d. As a bloc, he said, it was already Australia\u2019s second-biggest trading partner. \u201c[It is] bigger than the US, bigger than Japan, bigger than the EU, second only to China,\u201d Chalmers told Sky News. \u201cThis is where the action is \u2013 in Asean \u2013 and we want to get a bigger slice of that action.\u201d On Tuesday the government will also earmark $140m over four years to extend the Partnerships for Infrastructure Program. The program has helped fund transport, clean energy and telecommunications projects since launching in 2021. Australia will set up regional \u201clanding pads\u201d in Jakarta and Ho Chi Minh City to \u201cprovide on-the-ground support to help Australian businesses to boost technology services exports to south-east Asian markets\u201d. Trade and investment are a major focus of this week\u2019s special summit in Melbourne, held to mark 50 years since Australia became Asean\u2019s first dialogue partner. But security and great power rivalry between China and the US also loom large. China, like Australia, is not a member of Asean but is a dialogue partner to the regional bloc. Some Asean members have tensions with China over competing maritime and territorial claims in the South China Sea, but the regional bloc resists taking sides in the strategic contest between Beijing and Washington. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, warned on Monday that \u201cthe region\u2019s character\u201d was under challenge, including in the South China Sea. In a veiled reference to China, Wong said: \u201cWe face destabilising, provocative and coercive actions, including unsafe conduct at sea and in the air and militarisation of disputed features.\u201d Addressing a maritime cooperation forum at the special summit, Wong called for a regional balance \u201cwhere no country dominates and no country is dominated\u201d and \u201cwhere each country can pursue its own aspirations\u201d. Wong welcomed the resumption of leader-level and military-level dialogue between China and the US as \u201cimportant steps on the path towards stability that the region has called for\u201d. But she said all countries, not just the major powers, must \u201cshape habits of cooperation that sustain the character of our region\u201d. She said all countries should \u201cinsist differences are managed through dialogue, not force\u201d and \u201cinsist that communication never be withheld as a punishment or offered as a reward\u201d. \u201cWe want to support Asean member states to ensure, collectively, we all have the practical tools we need to be able to rapidly and effectively deescalate tensions and crises.\u201d Wong said the government would commit $64m over the next four years to help Asean countries \u201cincrease resilience to coercion and ensure waterways that serve us all remain open and accessible\u201d. Albanese met the Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, in Melbourne on Monday and promised closer collaboration on issues including cybersecurity and nuclear non-proliferation. Malaysia was an early critic of Australia\u2019s plan to acquire nuclear-powered submarines, but Anwar avoided direct criticism of the Aukus pact at his joint press conference with Albanese. Anwar expanded on his recent comments about a rise of \u201cChina-phobia\u201d in the west. \u201cWe are an independent nation. We are fiercely independent. We do not want to be dictated by any force,\u201d Anwar told reporters. He said Malaysia remained \u201can important friend to the US and Europe and here in Australia\u201d but that \u201cshould not preclude us from being friendly to one of our important neighbours, precisely China\u201d. \u201cAnd if they have problems with China, they should not impose it upon us. We do not have a problem with China.\u201d"

            "content": "\u201cWhen I was young, it grew on me by the minute That we were outside Europe and should be in it Now I am old and we are back outside it I simply can\u2019t abide it.\u201d This clerihew was sent to me out of the blue by Martin Bell, the celebrated former BBC foreign correspondent who became known as the Man in the White Suit during his 1997-2001 spell in parliament as the independent MP for Tatton. It seems to me to capture the feelings of so many people I meet or who write to me. We are of course still part of the continent of Europe, and always will be, but the European Economic Community, or the European Union it became, would not fit so well in such a neat, Ogden Nash-style verse. We know what he means when he says we are now outside Europe. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, knows too, as he dots the i\u2019s and crosses the t\u2019s on his much-trailed budget, to be unveiled \u2013 finally! \u2013 on Wednesday. Hunt was a Remainer and fully aware of the self-harm, and indeed absurdity, of Brexit. With the Office for Budget Responsibility estimating a hit to the economy of 4% of GDP, Goldman Sachs putting it at 5%, and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research calculating up to 6%, Hunt knows that anything up to \u00a340bn (the Centre for European Reform estimate) may have been knocked off the \u201cheadroom\u201d he has for budgetary concessions. The tax-cutting Brexiters have been hoist by their own petard. A combination of speculation and inspired \u2013 or uninspired \u2013 leaks has produced a situation where Hunt is said to have limited scope for tax cuts. But the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned that the kind of tax cuts the Tories want would have to be counterbalanced by reductions in public expenditure. And this at a time when the budgets of so many public services have been pared to the bone. As the IFS says: \u201cThe economic case for tax cuts is weak. The public finances remain in a poor position.\u201d The irony is that the foreseeable strains on much-needed public spending indicate that taxes will have to rise to enable the nation to cope with the many demands now being made on the public weal. The International Monetary Fund says the same. Yet neither main party admits this. It is obvious that the government, with all this stuff about tax cuts to help working people, wishes to bribe the electorate by claiming to ease the hardship imposed by cost of living pressures, while effecting this at the cost of even more austerity in the public sector. In fact, the main beneficiaries of tax cuts would be middle- and upper-income earners, not \u201chard-pressed working people\u201d. This ailing government is presumably making the cynical political calculation that short-term tax relief is worth trying even at the cost of yet more austerity. Older readers may recall that early on in the post-2010 era of austerity, I quoted my late friend David Cornwell, aka John le Carr\u00e9, who told me: \u201cIt\u2019s planned penury.\u201d And so it turned out for so many people in this benighted country. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, was recently quoted by my colleague Larry Elliott as saying: \u201cThe next government \u2013 Conservative or Labour \u2013 will inherit the worst set of economic circumstances since the second world war.\u201d The problems facing the country do evoke parallels with the immediate post-1945 situation. Moreover, they demand an Attlee-style grasp of the need for bold measures, starting with a vast investment programme founded not on the kind of fiscal rules that imply continued austerity, but on the assumption that sensible investment pays dividends if you take the long view, and are not hidebound by annual budgets and arbitrarily chosen fiscal rules. The Attlee government knew about the need for regional policy, well described in the memoirs of Douglas Jay, a prominent member of Attlee\u2019s cabinet. Regional policy is now known as \u201cdevolution\u201d. Under the auspices of Harvard University and King\u2019s College London, a new report examining the UK\u2019s feeble growth performance argues in favour of a more equitable regional balance, with more power given to local leaders throughout the regions. At a panel discussion on the report, Sir John Kingman, a former senior Treasury official, and now chairman of Legal &amp; General, complained that international investors get a poor reception here. Brexit, I could not help thinking. He said \u2013 I suspect only half-jokingly \u2013 that Gordon Brown\u2019s chancellorship had brought lots of money to the regions but no devolution, whereas George Osborne\u2019s brought plenty of devolution but no money. Yes, Osborne was the chief begetter of Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s \u201cplanned penury\u201d, and if Labour win they will be saddled with the consequences, as Reeves knows only too well."

            "date": "2024-03-09T21:12:34Z",
            "content": "Jeremy Hunt\u2019s budget appears to have backfired - with almost twice as many voters believing it will increase taxes overall, as those who think it will mean tax cuts. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer, conducted after the budget, also shows that the Tories have fallen two points in the past two weeks, suffering the reverse of a \u201cbudget bounce\u201d. Hunt and prime minister Rishi Sunak had wanted what is likely to be the last budget before a general election to be seen as evidence that the economy was on the mend. Sunak, in particular, wanted to deliver an eye-catching tax cut to demonstrate the government was putting money back in people\u2019s pockets. The centrepiece of the budget was a two percentage point cut in employees\u2019 national insurance (NI) contributions, worth \u00a3450 a year to an employee on an average salary of \u00a335,000. However, economists and thinktanks pointed out that other less trumpeted measures in the budget, including the continued freezing of thresholds at which people start paying higher rates of tax, had the effect of increasing taxes overall. Compared with two weeks ago, the Tories have dropped two points to just 25%, while Labour has fallen one point to 41%. This puts Labour\u2019s lead up one point at 16 points. Asked whether they thought that as a result of the budget levels of tax had gone up or down, some 31% of respondents said they believed they had gone up despite the national insurance cut, with just 17% believing they had gone down. A total of 29% thought they had not changed. Hunt\u2019s net approval rating has also fallen marginally compared with the previous poll by Opinium two weeks ago. Just 22% of people approve of the way he is doing his job, compared with 21% a fortnight ago. But 45% now disapprove of Hunt\u2019s performance, an increase of three points, giving him a net rating of \u201322%. James Crouch, head of public affairs and policy at Opinium, said: \u201cFew were expecting one budget to turn around a double-digit polling deficit but Jeremy Hunt will be disappointed that the headline tax-cut he spent so long trying to find headroom for has failed to register. \u201cUltimately, if the Conservatives want this budget to have a positive impact on their electoral chances then they have to hope that voters feel the effect of the NI cut and any economic recovery more than they feel the other pressures on cost of living that have dominated for the past two years.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 March 2024 to correct the graph on voting intentions. The Green party is on 7%, not 3% as an earlier version showed; and the first Labour party bar was resized to show the correct percentage."

            "date": "2024-03-03T09:08:59Z",
            "content": "Originally built for the grand Ibero-American Exposition of 1929, Seville\u2019s flamboyant neo-Moorish Plaza de Espa\u00f1a has for nearly a century been one of the city\u2019s major attractions, an ornate showcase for Spanish architecture and decorative tiling. But the several thousand visitors from around the world who throng the plaza every day, on foot or in horse-drawn carriages, may soon have to pay for the privilege, with proceeds from a planned entry fee going towards its upkeep. \u201cWe are planning to close the Plaza de Espa\u00f1a and charge tourists to finance its conservation and ensure its safety,\u201d Seville\u2019s mayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Sanz, announced on X last week, posting a video showing missing tiles and damaged facades. Sanz made clear local residents and visitors from Andaluc\u00eda province would not have to cough up to visit the plaza, which served as a backdrop in a Star Wars film, and is used regularly for concerts, fashion shows and theatrical performances. Many residents objected to the scheme nonetheless \u2013 but their criticism was mostly that it would be complicated to administer and not very effective. Far better, many locals said, would be a hefty tourism tax on all visitors to Seville. \u201cMass tourism,\u201d said one, \u201cis destroying our city.\u201d It\u2019s a refrain heard in historic cities across Europe, from Prague to Barcelona, Athens to Amsterdam. Mass tourism, promoted by cash-hungry councils since the 2008 crash and fuelled by cheap flights and online room rentals, has become a monster. After plummeting during Covid, tourism numbers are soaring again and set to exceed pre-pandemic levels this summer. The number of low-cost airline seats in Europe, which rose 10% annually from 2010 and hit 500m in 2019, could pass 800m in 2024. Before lockdown, Airbnb, the biggest but far from only platform for short lets, saw triple-digit growth in some European cities. The net result is that the most popular city break destinations now annually host 20 or more visitors for each local. What to do about it, though, is no easy question. Delicate balances need to be struck between the much-needed revenues and jobs generated by tourism, and the quality of life of residents; between managing tourism and discouraging it. One strategy that Seville \u2013 3 million tourists a year for 700,000 inhabitants \u2013 may adopt is to charge for the big attractions. Since January, foreign visitors to Istanbul\u2019s Hagia Sophia, which gets about 3.5m visits a year, have been paying \u20ac25 for the privilege. Venice is so overrun by visitors it has introduced what amounts to an entrance fee for the entire city, ranging from \u20ac3 to \u20ac10. Paris has almost trebled its tourist tax rates, from \u2013 depending on area and accommodation type \u2013 \u20ac0.25-\u20ac5 to \u20ac0.65-\u20ac14.95. Other cities are relying on better management \u2013 Athens, for example, last summer introduced a time-slot system for visits to the Acropolis, while summer access to Marseille\u2019s Calanques is now regulated through a free reservation scheme. Some places are launching information campaigns aiming to reshape tourist flows. France, where 80% of visits are concentrated in 20% of the country, will this spring roll out a \u20ac1m campaign urging domestic and foreign tourists to head more off the beaten track. From Mont Saint-Michel and the seaside resort of \u00c9tretat in Normandy to the Atlantic beaches of the south-west and the Riviera, peak-season influxes now threaten the environment, locals\u2019 quality of life and the visitor experience, authorities say. They are also setting up a tourism observatory to accurately measure flows and identify possible overloads. \u201cFrance is the world\u2019s biggest tourist destination, but we have a serious lack of data to help manage the crowds,\u201d the government said. Some anti-tourism measures, however, turn out to be just rumours. Last summer, the walled Croatian town of Dubrovnik, said to be the most over-visited destination in Europe, with 36 visitors per resident, was widely reported to have banned wheelie suitcases. In fact, as part of a Respect the City campaign urging visitors to dress appropriately in the historic centre and avoid climbing on monuments, the town hall had just asked them to carry their bags over cobblestones to reduce the noise level for locals. The Netherlands In the capital of the country that coined the term overtoerisme, tourist might be a dirty word \u2013 but Amsterdam is also increasingly desperate for visitors\u2019 cash. A plan last March to dissuade partying young British men with \u201cstay away\u201d videos warning of fines, hospital and criminal records made headlines worldwide. It\u2019s unclear what effect it had, though, as Amsterdam\u2019s overnight tourist numbers last year hit almost pre-pandemic levels at 9 million \u2013 21% more than in 2022. A soft-soap Renew your View campaign highlighting positive aspects off the beaten track (rather than sex and drugs) launched in November. Meanwhile the city is expected to expand its stay-away campaign to dissuade nuisance tourists from Germany, France, Spain and Italy after the summer. Since last spring there has been a ban on smoking cannabis in public space in the red light district, while bar closures at 2am instead of 4am have reduced street numbers by between 30% and 60%. However, after complaints about safety, sex-worker brothel windows are open until 6am again rather than 3am. Amsterdam is reducing the number of licensed B&amp;B premises by 30%, has voted to close a city centre cruise terminal and is trialling tougher licensing measures to remove \u201crogue\u201d tourist businesses such as candy shops suspected of being criminal fronts. The council says it is monitoring tourist numbers to try to maintain a balance. But multimillion budget shortfalls and a bill of billions to repair crumbling canalsides mean tourism is essential for Amsterdam: this year, the tourist tax rose from 7% to 12.5%, the highest in Europe, with a day tax of \u20ac14 a head for visiting cruise ships. Senay Boztas Spain Spain received 85 million tourists in 2023, nearly 2% up on pre-pandemic 2019 \u2013 and in a country where tourism generates 13% of GDP, after the economic devastation of the Covid years, voices calling for curbs on numbers have been virtually silenced. The hospitality business, however, continues to chant the mantra of quality over quantity \u2013 nowhere more so than in the Balearic Islands, where a new law is being drafted to crack down on drunk tourists. Last year about 15 million people visited the Balearics (population 2 million), more than half British and German, with a significant percentage coming for what the regional government calls \u201ctourism of excess\u201d: a week-long drinking binge. The new law to crack down on booze tourism is expected to be in force when the season kicks off at Easter. Under a 2020 law, areas such as Magaluf in Mallorca and Sant Antoni in Ibiza were named as trouble spots. Heavy fines were imposed for \u201cbalconing\u201d (leaping into a pool from a balcony), shops were banned from selling alcohol after 9.30pm, and organised pub crawls, beach parties, party boats and two-for-one happy hours outlawed, Local businesses faced fines of up to \u20ac600,000. But after areas such as Magaluf complained of being stigmatised, the new law will focus more on individuals. Among the planned measures are deportation for antisocial behaviour and a blacklist of people banned from visiting the islands. Lawyers warn that this would infringe the EU\u2019s principle of freedom of movement, although as the UK is no longer a member, rowdy Brits \u2013 who are among the worst offenders \u2013 could soon find themselves personae non gratae. Stephen Burgen Italy After years of talk, Venice is the first major tourist hotspot in Italy to introduce an entrance fee for day trippers. The measure kicks off at the start of peak season on 25 April, and in a first experimental phase will apply only on certain days until 14 July. The \u20ac5 tickets have been bookable online since mid-January. Time will tell whether the controversial initiative works, but with visitor numbers back to pre-pandemic levels \u2013 an average of 40,000 day trippers on peak days \u2013 and the perennial threat of the fragile lagoon city losing its Unesco heritage status, authorities were forced to act. The city is also poised to limit tourist groups to 25 people from June and to ban the use of loudspeakers because they \u201cgenerate confusion and disturbances\u201d, Venice council said in late December. Florence has long suffered from similar overtourism woes and an exodus of residents from its historic centre, prompting the council in October last year to ban new short-term lets in the historic centre from Airbnb and similar platforms. The city\u2019s mayor, Dario Nardella, said that while the initiative was not a \u201cpanacea\u201d, it was a \u201cconcrete step\u201d for tackling the issue in a city with a population of about 720,000 that records, on average, more than 16 miilion overnight visitor stays a year. Elsewhere in Italy, drivers along the Amalfi coast will again be hit by a measure aimed at preventing a perpetual jam along the winding 35km coastal road described as \u201ca nightmare\u201d by locals. Cars with number plates ending in an odd number are allowed to use the road one day, and those ending in an even number the next. In Cinque Terre, another Unesco site, local authorities are also pondering how to manage overtourism. \u201cWe don\u2019t want fewer tourists, but we want to be able to manage [tourism] in a sustainable way,\u201d Donatella Bianchi, president of Cinque Terre national park, said last month. Angela Giuffrida Greece In Greece, one of the most visited places in the world, soaring tourist numbers are not only straining infrastructure on island idylls but increasingly stretching capacity in Athens, where residents, as elsewhere, are up in arms. Once a stopover for travellers en route to isles, the Greek metropolis is now a \u201cmust-see\u201d destination in its own right, drawing more than 7 million tourists \u2013 an all-time record \u2013 in 2023, with Americans and Britons topping arrivals. To cope with an influx that is only expected to grow when the Asian market rebounds, Greek authorities have announced that crowd control policies \u2013 implemented in pilot form at the Acropolis in September \u2013 will be expanded to other archaeological sites next month. Last year, at the height of the season, more than 20,000 tourists a day climbed the hill to see the fifth-century BC site. \u201cWe got to the point of as many as 23,000 a day,\u201d the Greek culture minister, Lina Mendoni, said. \u201cTourism is obviously desirable for the country, for all of us, but we have to ensure overtourism doesn\u2019t harm the monument.\u201d The visitor zone scheme, in operation from 8am to 8pm, aims to ease congestion, with authorities introducing a time-slot system, electronic ticketing and fast-lane entry points for organised groups. \u201cIt will help ensure the safety of the monument and those who work there, and improve the experience of visitors,\u201d Mendoni said. Museums will also cap visitor numbers from April. The spectre of the country enjoying another bumper year of tourism has been met with mounting fears among environmentalists on islands where communities have increasingly struggled with waste management, water scarcity, insufficient public services and illegal construction. In the face of local disgruntlement the government has been forced to step in. On Santorini, where complaints of oversaturation have grown steadily over the years, a berth-allocation system for cruise ships was introduced, with the number of disembarkations in any 24-hour period being limited to 8,000 passengers. On Mykonos \u2013 like Santorini, one of the most popular islands in the Cycladic chain \u2013 authorities have clamped down on illicit construction, bulldozing illegally built bars and eateries in prime sites.

Ration cards were still in use and the NHS still on the maternity ward, having been born that July. The previous month, the Empire Windrush had made its historic arrival in Tilbury. Earlier that year, Myanmar and Sri Lanka \u2013 then named Burma and Ceylon \u2013 had gained independence from the British empire. And, in the summer, Portsmouth ascended the summit of domestic football for the first time \u2013 winning the English title. Pompey have only hit that height once more in the subsequent 76 years. As has the amount of tax we pay \u2013 this week. According to official forecasts, the offsetting of a second successive 2p cut to national insurance with a series of small tax increases elsewhere in Wednesday\u2019s budget have left tax as a share of national income at 37.1%. Among those stealth increases were taxes on vaping, tobacco, holiday home lets, business class flights and non-doms. Reporting on 1948\u2019s budget by the chancellor of the day, Labour\u2019s Stafford Cripps, the Guardian said: \u201cThe real interest in the budget proposals is to discover whether the heavy worker who likes a smoke and a drink will feel benefit from the income-tax concessions, or will find himself financially to be just about where he is now. This is an elaborate sum to work out. Against income-tax reliefs must be set extra duties on beer, spirits, and tobacco.\u201d In 2024, it is a Conservative chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, hoping voters will begin to feel the benefits of his economic tinkering \u2013 and perhaps not notice too keenly increases in what could be termed lifestyle taxes. Hunt will also be hoping not too many voters will be put off by the clear implication that any pre-election giveaway will be balanced out by post-election cuts to public spending. With polls suggesting voters see the state of the UK\u2019s public services \u2013 as well as the economy \u2013 among the top issues facing the country, Hunt has perhaps seen the political imperative in postponing any cuts he believed necessary until after the general election. According to the Resolution Foundation, they will be huge. \u201cThis rising tax burden, alongside post-election spending plans, will leave a sour taste for whoever is in office at that point,\u201d it said on Wednesday. The thinktank suggested the chancellor was planning cuts to government bodies such as the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office and local government of \u00a319bn a year. To put that into context, between 2024-25 and 2028-29, such cuts \u2013 expressed per person \u2013 would be about three-quarters the levels seen during the Tory-led austerity drive from 2010-11 to 2014-15. Rewind to the budget of April 1948, and Cripps had a very different take. \u201cWe have, I think, done everything practical to make as large a contribution as possible by economy of government expenditure. We do not propose to cut the social services, as that is not in our view a fair or a desirable thing to do. We are proud of our record on the social services, and are anxious to improve on it,\u201d he told the Commons. The Guardian reported that year that \u201cthe April budget [would] be a severe test\u201d for the government in which Cripps served. But Cripps and his Labour party had another three years before they had to go to the country. Hunt and the current crop of Tories have only a few months."

            "date": "2024-03-06T19:49:00Z",
            "content": "Britain will go into the next general election with taxes at their highest level since 1948 despite Jeremy Hunt\u2019s 2p budget cut in national insurance contributions \u2013 with the threat of a fresh squeeze on public spending to come after polling day. The chancellor used a combination of higher borrowing and a range of stealth taxes to fund a \u00a314bn giveaway package and said his ambition was to phase out NICs for employees and the self-employed altogether. But the lack of any real surprises in the budget \u2013 other than an increase in the child benefit threshold to \u00a360,000 \u2013 appeared to reduce significantly the prospect of a snap general election in May, when the UK will still officially be in recession. Many Conservative MPs had hoped for a headline-grabbing budget that would finally leave people feeling better off and help to close the gap with Labour in the polls, acting as a launchpad for the election later this year. However, living standards remain squeezed and millions of people face being dragged into higher tax bands, while the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) showed that incomes are likely to remain below their level at the last general election, in 2019, at the end of this parliament. Hunt\u2019s heavily trailed 2p cut in national insurance will be funded by scrapping non-dom rules \u2013 a flagship Labour policy \u2013 and other revenue-raising measures that will push taxation to the highest level since the second world war. \u201cWe will continue to cut national insurance contributions as we have done today so we truly make work pay,\u201d Hunt told MPs. \u201cWe stick to our plan with a budget for long-term growth; it delivers more investment, more jobs, better public services and lower taxes.\u201d Labour, however, accused the Conservatives of having overseen 14 years of economic failure. Sir Keir Starmer, the party leader, called the budget \u201cthe last desperate act of a party that has failed\u201d. He added: \u201cAn economy smaller than when the prime minister entered Downing Street \u2013 the textbook definition of decline \u2013 that is their record. I mean, after 14 years, who do they actually think feels better off?\u201d Experts said the \u00a3900-a-year tax cut for the average worker from the NICs cuts in the budget and last year\u2019s autumn statement would be dwarfed by tax increases previously announced. Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, said: \u201cCome the election, tax revenues will be 3.9% of national income, or around \u00a3100bn, higher than at the time of the last election. This remains a parliament of record tax rises.\u201d Hunt raised money through a number of small tax increases, on vaping, tobacco, holiday home lets, business class flights and non-doms. That allowed him to meet his fiscal rule \u2013 to reduce debt as a share of GDP in five years\u2019 time \u2013 by what the OBR described as the \u201chistorically modest margin\u201d of \u00a39bn. Hunt also announced the extension of a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, which had led to reports of a \u201cheated\u201d row with Douglas Ross, the Tory leader in Scotland. Hunt\u2019s decision to axe the tax breaks for foreign nationals who live in the UK and who do not pay UK tax on their overseas income and gains is a significant U-turn that mirrors Labour policy and blows a hole in the opposition\u2019s spending plans. The chancellor said this was because he believed \u201cthose with the broadest shoulders should pay their fair share\u201d. Labour had planned to use the \u00a32.7bn raised from scrapping non-dom status for public services including the NHS, leaving the party facing a choice of dropping plans or finding money elsewhere. Starmer said Labour would back the national insurance cut, leaving him the option of raising other taxes to pay for his spending plans, or dropping them altogether. The decision to prioritise tax cuts will, however, mean imposing a tougher austerity drive on government departments at a time when public services are crumbling, with elevated NHS waiting lists and councils facing bankruptcy. Heralding a fresh austerity drive pencilled in for after the election, the government\u2019s economic and spending watchdog, the OBR, said Hunt\u2019s plans meant funding for non-ringfenced government departments \u2013 including local government and prison services \u2013 was on track to fall by 2.3% per year. The chancellor said the tax cuts were part of a plan to create a high-wage, high-skill economy \u2013 and that the sort of growth that would lead to higher living standards could not come from \u201cunlimited migration\u201d. Yet the OBR said it had raised its 2028-9 forecast for net migration from 245,000 to 315,000 a year since last November\u2019s autumn statement. Noting that the medium-term outlook for the economy remained challenging, the OBR said: \u201cOne of the biggest changes to our economy forecast is an increase in the size and growth of the UK population. But higher and rising levels of inactivity offset its impact on the overall size of the workforce, leaving our forecast for the level of GDP in five years virtually unchanged from the autumn, and the level of GDP per person slightly lower.\u201d The OBR revised up its growth forecast for 2024 from 0.7% to 0.8% and its estimate for 2025 from 1.4% to 1.9%, but pencilled in unchanged or slightly lower growth figures for the following three years. Despite the cumulative 4p off NICs announced in the budget and the autumn statement, the OBR said taxes as a share of national output would still be at a postwar record at the end of its five-year forecast. Tax was 33.1% of gross domestic product before the Covid 19 pandemic but is on course to be 37.1% of GDP by 2028-29. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cThe tax cuts announced today to sweeten the government\u2019s election pitch rely on the prospect of a sour \u00a319bn of post-election tax rises, and the fiscal fiction that another \u00a319bn of cuts to public services can be delivered in a spending review that the Treasury today confirmed will not take place until after polling day. \u201cFor all that, the big picture has not changed at all with this budget. Britain remains a country where taxes are heading up, not down \u2013 rising by the equivalent of \u00a33,900 per household \u2013 and where incomes are set to remain below their level at the last general election when voters return to the polls.\u201d \u201cThis didn\u2019t feel like a pre-election budget,\u201d Tory former minister Stephen Hammond said. \u201cPretty much everything had been trailed. There were no rabbits today, so from a purely political point of view, I think this still plays back into the narrative that it\u2019s an autumn election.\u201d Hunt briefed Kristalina Georgieva, the head of the International Monetary Fund \u2013 which had warned against budget tax cuts \u2013 about his plans. An IMF spokesperson said Georgieva \u201cacknowledged the UK authorities\u2019 efforts to navigate complex economic challenges through policies to support growth while stabilising debt. IMF staff will be analysing the announced policies in greater detail, but the aim to continue the fiscal consolidation pursued since November 2022 to reduce inflation and stabilise debt is welcome.\u201d"

            "content": "Jeremy Hunt has promised to voluntarily pay more capital gains tax on his properties so that he does not benefit from a tax cut he introduced. The chancellor refused to disclose how many houses he owned but said he would pay a higher tax rate on any proceeds from selling his property. Asked on ITV\u2019s Peston programme on Wednesday night how many houses he had, Hunt said: \u201cThese are personal questions.\u201d When announcing a capital gains tax cut in the budget on Wednesday, Hunt aimed a jibe at Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, who has faced questions about the sale of her former council house. \u201cI see the deputy leader of the Labour party paying close attention, given her multiple dwellings,\u201d he said. Hunt cut the rate of capital gains tax paid by higher-rate taxpayers when selling second homes from 28% to 24%. Asked whether he himself would benefit from this, Hunt told Peston: \u201cI won\u2019t benefit from the CGT change. When it comes to the properties I own, it would be wrong to benefit from a direct decision like that, so I will pay tax at the previous rate.\u201d He confirmed that he would voluntarily pay 28% capital gains tax if he sold one of his properties. Pressed on why he would not say how many houses he had when he had joked about the sale of Rayner\u2019s home in the Commons, Hunt said: \u201cI was teasing Angela Rayner. We declare all these things.\u201d According to the ministerial register of interests, Hunt and his wife own Mare Pond Properties Limited, a property holding company. His parliamentary interests say this includes seven apartments in Southampton. The chancellor also owns a half share of a holiday house in Italy and a half share of an office building in London, according to his declarations. His ministerial register states that some proceeds from his \u201cresidential investment property\u201d are donated to charity. In 2018, when he was health secretary, Hunt had to apologise for a delay in notifying Companies House and parliamentary authorities about his interest in the Mare Pond Properties company. Hunt and his family are thought to live between three houses in the UK. They have use of the official chancellor\u2019s residence at No 11 Downing Street. According to the Evening Standard, Hunt owns a \u00a31.7m townhouse in Pimlico, near Westminster, which he bought in 2010. His personal website says he divides his time between London and his constituency home in Hambledon, a village in Surrey. Hunt\u2019s seven flats in Southampton are part of a luxury waterside development called Ocean Village. The value of his property is not known, but according to Rightmove, individual flats in the development sold last year for an average of \u00a3225,7111. Some second-home owners reacted angrily to the budget because Hunt abolished tax breaks for furnished holiday lets, such as those advertised on Airbnb. He said this was to make more property available for residents in tourist hotspots such as Cornwall and central London. \u201cI am concerned that this tax regime is creating a distortion, meaning that there are not enough properties available for long-term rental by local people,\u201d Hunt told MPs in his budget speech on Wednesday. \u201cSo, to make the tax system work better for local communities, I am going to abolish the furnished holiday lettings regime.\u201d It comes after Downing Street revealed that the prime minister was recused from policy talks on the scrapping of the non-dom tax status to avoid any conflict of interest. Rishi Sunak\u2019s wife, Akshata Murty, who owns shares in Infosys, the Indian IT company founded by her father, is a non-domiciled UK resident, which means she does not have to pay UK taxes on her overseas income. After her non-dom tax status was revealed while Sunak was chancellor, Murty announced she would voluntarily pay UK tax on all her worldwide income."

            "date": "2024-03-04T07:00:23Z",
            "content": "As my train heads north-west from Madrid towards the green hills of Asturias, I eagerly await views of the lush landscape \u2013 but instead, I\u2019m plunged into darkness. A new series of tunnels is leading me to the northern region\u2019s capital, Oviedo, and among them is the seventh-longest in Europe: at 15 miles, it\u2019s a complex work of engineering that cuts through the Cantabrian Mountains. It\u2019s much less scenic, but this new route \u2013 a \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.4bn) infrastructure project launched last November \u2013 has reduced travel time between Madrid and Asturias by more than an hour, with an even shorter journey time expected later this year. The speedier connection means weekend breaks for madrile\u00f1os and two-in-one holidays for visitors are more appealing than ever \u2013 not least for foodies drawn to the gastronomy of Spain\u2019s greener, cooler regions. Long traditions in fishing, livestock and agriculture in Asturias mean its seafood, meat, beans, corn, milk and cider are famed across Spain. Local dishes such as cachopo (breaded veal fillet stuffed with cheese and ham) and fabada (bean and pork stew) are common fare in Madrid too, at Asturian restaurants such as Casa Hortensia or El \u00d1eru \u2013 but the spotlight is now on Oviedo itself, named Spain\u2019s gastronomy capital for 2024. By the time I\u2019ve checked into the Barcel\u00f3 Oviedo Cervantes hotel, in the chic, modern side of this compact city, I\u2019m feeling hungry. It\u2019s a short walk across San Francisco park leading to the old town, where I check out the single-towered gothic cathedral and soak up the atmosphere of its medieval plazas before hitting the cake shops for a range of traditional sweets: moscovitas (crisp almond and chocolate wafers) at Rialto and carbayones (glazed almond cream-filled pastries) at Camilo de Blas. They\u2019re delectable, but even more than its food, this part of Spain is best known for its cider. \u201cThe first cider of the year is smooth and refreshing,\u201d says Andr\u00e9s Alonso at Llagar Herminio, a cider press on the outskirts of Oviedo that was founded in 1943. He\u2019s the third generation to run the family business and he shows me around the factory, from the machines that treat the apples to the fermenting and bottling process. Home to more than 70 such mills, Asturias is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of natural cider, which has protected denomination of origin status when made from any of 76 approved varieties of apple. The unique culture around Asturian cider \u2013 from production methods to drinking habits \u2013 is now being considered for classification by Unesco as intangible heritage. Herminio is the only llagar (cider mill) in Oviedo but sidrer\u00edas (cider bars) are found all over \u2013 particularly on Calle Gascona, which local people call \u201cCider Boulevard\u201d. El Ferroviario, La Manzana and La Finca are all good places to admire the art of escanciar (pouring from a great height). Alonso says the distance is crucial for producing a frothy, carbonated drink. \u201cIt\u2019s full of molecules that have to burst,\u201d he says, as a narrow jet shoots from the barrel\u2019s spout. He he captures it in a glass held at arm\u2019s length and angled so that the liquid bubbles on impact. I swap cider for wine at La Corte de Pelayo, a restaurant in central Oviedo, tasting a white by Siluvio and a red by Monasterio de Corias, both local wineries. With views of the Asturias parliament and Plaza de la Escandalera, this classic spot offers traditional cuisine, thoughtful preparation and local produce ranging from fish such as alfonsino (red bream) and pix\u00edn (monkfish) to cachopo. The restaurant\u2019s owner, Lorena Mart\u00ednez, says cachopo first emerged in the late 1940s, a local take on French veal cordon bleu. It was always considered rather basic comfort food, but Mart\u00ednez wanted to make it more refined. The secret is in the ingredients, she says: a juicy, tender cut of veal; a suitably light cheese that doesn\u2019t detract from the meat\u2019s flavour; and Japanese panko breadcrumbs for the coating. Whether finessing the classics or excelling in contemporary innovation, many chefs have been upping Oviedo\u2019s game. Gloria is a smart dining house serving traditional dishes with modern flair \u2013 such as pitu de caleya (traditional free-range chicken), served either with rice or in rich cannelloni. It\u2019s headed by Nacho Manzano, one of Asturias\u2019s most-feted chefs and owner of the London chain Ib\u00e9rica; he\u2019s also just won a Michelin star for his fine dining restaurant NM, adding to his original two-starred Casa Marcial in the remote village of Arriondas, his birthplace. At NM \u2013 an intimate space with just four tables \u2013 the tasting menu has 11 courses, all packed with flavour and texture. Hake from Avil\u00e9s comes with a silky reduction made of its own collagen; squid strips and enoki mushrooms are wrapped in a casing of clotted milk; and the acidity of a sharp vinaigrette cuts the fat of a tender, salty pancetta. It\u2019s a tribute to the region\u2019s natural offering, too \u2013 the moss in the mushroom broth and the grass in the granizado (shaved ice) are meant to take diners through the woods and meadows of Asturias. Longing for just such a rural setting, I take a 10-minute drive out of the city to Casa Chema, in a quiet spot overlooking pastures. In the kitchen, the head chef, Joaquina Rodr\u00edguez, is stirring a broth made of acorns \u2013 the same kind the region\u2019s asturcelta pigs feast on. The chef also uses dried acorn flour to make tortos (crisp savoury cakes), to serve with slow-cooked pork ribs. The most revered produce in this kitchen, however, is the faba, Asturias\u2019s plump, white bean: Casa Chema serves about 2,300kg of them a year. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a place in Asturias that does a bad fabada,\u201d says Rodr\u00edguez, but I feel she is too modest \u2013 twice now, hers has been named the best in the world. Beans are most commonly bought dried, but Rodr\u00edguez prefers fresh ones for their soft, pillowy texture; a good faba should melt, she says, when pushed into the roof of your mouth with your tongue. One by one, she pulls out the various pork pieces \u2013 belly, shoulder, morcilla (black pudding) and chorizo \u2013 that give the stew its rich flavour; she lifts another lid to reveal the pote asturiano, also a bean stew, but made with potato and cabbage. There\u2019s a vegan menu at Casa Chema too, including plant-based sausages and cheeses. But this part of Spain is paradise for dairy lovers, with more than 40 varieties of regional cheese. \u201cAsturias is the Spanish Switzerland,\u201d says the manager at Manduca Selecci\u00f3n, a shop in Oviedo that works with locally renowned cheesemakers such as Rey Silo, Teyedu, Lazana and La Cueva de Llon\u00edn. I try an intense, punchy cabrales \u2013 usually matured in caves \u2013 as well as other varieties such as gamon\u00e9u, cas\u00edn and afuega\u2019l pitu. A similar selection can be enjoyed at tables in nearby wine bar Coalla, along with oysters, charcuterie, caviar and a glass of vino. From its 250-mile coastline to the Picos de Europa mountains, the natural geography of Asturias is as diverse as its culinary produce. \u201cThere are many Asturiases within Asturias,\u201d says Manzano. \u201cCustoms are different all along the coastal strip \u2013 and if you go just 5km inland, it\u2019s like a different planet.\u201d He adds that regions such as these \u2013 unlike Madrid and Catalonia \u2013 tend to experience greater culinary revolution outside their capital cities. He still wants me to make a pilgrimage to Arriondas \u2013 but in the meantime, he\u2019s doing his bit to let Oviedo take centre stage.

            "content": "Nuclear energy ranks last on the list of climate technologies that big institutional investors want exposure to, according to a survey of climate conscious investors with $37tn under management. Fewer than one in 10 investors were exploring new investments in nuclear technology in the survey of the Investor Group on Climate Change, whose 100 members include super funds and asset managers looking after the funds of 15 million Australians. The survey found a rebound in confidence in Australia\u2019s climate policy but a growing appetite for clear timelines for the phase-out of coal, oil and gas. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The opposition, led by Peter Dutton, plans to propose locating nuclear power plants on the site of retiring coal power plants, claiming that this would save having to build new transmission infrastructure for renewables. But the plan has been widely panned. The energy department has estimated it would cost $387bn to go nuclear, and Dutton faces opposition from his own state colleagues. Australia\u2019s big private electricity generators have dismissed nuclear energy as a viable source of power for their customers for at least another decade, and likely more. In the yearly survey by the Investor Group on Climate Change investors were asked which energy and climate solutions they believed had good long-term returns. Nuclear energy was ranked last of 14 possible responses, along with sustainable oceans. \u201cThis is due to nuclear energy\u2019s very high cost, and the lack of maturity and deployment in next generation technologies,\u201d a policy brief on the survey said, citing the CSIRO\u2019s gencost report. The five most popular options were: renewable energy (backed by 47% of respondents); nature solutions, including biodiversity or nature capital (34%); energy storage (32%); low carbon transport (32%); and industry/materials, including critical minerals (32%). In 2021 about 70% of investors cited policy and regulatory uncertainty as a barrier to investing in climate solutions, a figure that dropped to 40% in the 2023 data released on Monday. Asked to nominate the policies they wanted the government to prioritise, most investors (56%) called for sector-by-sector decarbonisation plans to keep global heating under the 1.5C threshold. There was also majority support for improved carbon pricing through the safeguard mechanism (54%), funding support for new technology (53%), and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies (51%). The policy brief said \u201cemerging priorities\u201d included mandatory climate-related disclosures, timelines for the phase-out of coal, oil and gas, and clear policies to build resilience and adapt to the physical damages of climate change. Erwin Jackson, Investor Group on Climate Change\u2019s managing director of policy, said: \u201cInvestors have given the government a pretty good report card. \u201cThey\u2019re also sending the message that credible, investible and durable policy frameworks put in place today will support strong investor and beneficiary returns into the future, enhance Australia\u2019s economic competitiveness, and help attract international capital. \u201cWe must have a fair and fast transition to net zero emissions, but we must also adapt. \u201cInvestors look forward to working with governments on initiatives that can incentivise and remove barriers for private sector investment in adaptation across the economy.\u201d In the 2023 budget the Albanese government gave $2bn to help establish Australia\u2019s hydrogen industry and a further $1bn for households. In February Anthony Albanese raised expectations of another major energy package in this year\u2019s budget, telling the Hunter Nexus dinner that Australia \u201cmust be prepared to think big\u201d to help regions diversify their economies and achieve the energy transition. Albanese said that \u201cevery nation needs to decarbonise and electrify\u201d and this was \u201ca race that Australia can win\u201d. \u201cNo nation is better placed than Australia to achieve this transition here at home \u2013 and power it in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a task that traverses far more than energy policy, or industry policy. \u201cThis is a whole-of-nation opportunity and it demands a whole-of-economy approach.\u201d"

            "content": "Gunmen have assaulted two upscale neighborhoods in Haiti\u2019s capital in an attack that left at least a dozen people dead in surrounding areas and suggested that a gang insurrection that prompted the prime minister to resign is far from over. Assailants looted homes in the communities of Laboule and Thomassin before sunrise on Monday, forcing residents to flee as some called radio stations pleading for police. Both neighborhoods had previously remained largely peaceful despite a surge in gang attacks across Port-au-Prince that began on 29 February. Afterwards, the bodies of at least 12 men lay strewn on the streets of nearby P\u00e9tion-Ville. One was lying face up on the street surrounded by a scattered deck of cards and another found face down inside a pick-up truck known as a \u201ctap-tap\u201d that operates as a taxi. A woman at one of the scenes collapsed and had to be held by others after learning that a relative of hers was killed. \u201cAbuse! This is abuse!\u201d cried out one man who stood nearby. \u201cPeople of Haiti! Wake up!\u201d The attacks raised concerns that the violence would not cease despite the announcement by the prime minister, Ariel Henry, last week that he would resign once a transitional presidential council was created, a move that gangs had been demanding. The council has yet to be appointed, as political coalitions jockey for power, and one faction rejected the plan outright. Gangs have long opposed Henry, saying he was never elected by the people as they blame him for deepening poverty, but the armed groups have themselves been accused of trying to seize power for themselves or for unidentified Haitian politicians. Meanwhile, the capital has been paralyzed as fresh attacks broke out late last week, including a fire at the main prison that days earlier had been emptied of prisoners and the residence of the national police chief. On Monday, Haiti\u2019s power company announced that four substations in the capital and elsewhere \u201cwere destroyed and rendered completely dysfunctional\u201d. As a result, swaths of Port-au-Prince were without power, including the Cit\u00e9 Soleil slum, the Croix-des-Bouquets community and a hospital. The company said criminals also seized important documents, cables, inverters, batteries and other items. Meanwhile, the deployment of a UN-backed Kenyan police force to fight gangs in Haiti has been delayed, with the east African country saying it would wait until the transitional council is established. In an effort to curb the relentless violence, Haiti\u2019s government announced on Sunday that it was extending a night-time curfew through 20 March. Also on Sunday, a government-chartered flight carrying more than 30 US citizens fleeing the violence landed in Miami after the US embassy in Port-au-Prince earlier this month urged US citizens to leave \u201cas soon as possible\u201d."

            "content": "So sad to see the Conservative party talking down Britain in its new attack ad for the London mayoral elections, which \u2013 among other deliberate and unethical lies \u2013 included footage of commuters fleeing false reports of gunfire in New York\u2019s Penn station in 2017. That bit has now been edited out, but what remains of the ad purports to be a 90-second portrait of life in the capital since London mayor Sadiq Khan \u201cseized power\u201d. Given that Khan has twice won the London mayoralty in free and fair votes, this feels somewhat punchy talk from a party led by an unelected man who himself \u201cseized power\u201d from the salad-vanquished political corpse of an unelected woman. But look, what\u2019s the worst that can happen if political parties tell blatant untruths to people, debase campaigning standards and conduct knowing assaults on trust? If only there were places in the world to which we could point in order to answer that question. If you haven\u2019t seen this advert, it\u2019s a grainy black-and-white montage supposedly showing life in \u201ca crime capital of the world\u201d (London). Apart from all the obviously disprovable fakery and dishonest manipulations and misrepresentations that we\u2019ll come to in a minute, the entire ad is inexplicably voiced by an actor doing a bad American accent. Why? He doesn\u2019t even go here. And yes \u2013 I get that on the one hand, this opens me up to the possibility of the actor who voiced the ad identifying himself and crossly declaring himself to be an actual American, perhaps hailing from one of the regions where they have unconvincing American accents. On the other hand, this course of action would involve him identifying himself as the person who voiced this embarrassing ad, so \u2026 I\u2019m feeling relatively safe. Indeed, given I live in London I am feeling relatively safe anyway, what with the Crime Survey for England and Wales reporting that residents of the capital are less likely to be victims of crime than across the country as a whole. Anyway: the ad. Suffice to say that every creative decision taken on the script seems to have been signed off by a beta version of ChatGPT or someone who has suffered a recent head trauma. Sample writing: \u201cGripped by the tendrils of rising crime, London\u2019s citizens stay inside \u2026 the metropolis teetering on the brink of chaos.\u201d \u201cIn the depths of these narrow passageways,\u201d growls the unconvincing American, \u201ctread squads of Ulez enforcers, dressed in black, faces covered with masks, terrorising communities.\u201d Mm. But do they? Of similar concern is the decision to use a scare graph that, upon closer inspection, appears to resemble a graph showing crime in England and Wales significantly overtaking crime in London. But hey, it\u2019s a graph, it looks the part, it\u2019s got two lines crossing in a way that looks the right stripe of worrying. The wider purpose of the ad is an attempt to cast London as a Gotham desperately in need of a Batman. Off the back of that statement, can I bring myself to type the words \u201cEnter Susan Hall\u201d? Yes I think I can, just for the mirthless laugh. Enter Susan Hall. If you\u2019re not familiar with Susan, she\u2019s the Conservative candidate running against Khan, and is arguably the final form in a long series of Tory mayoral hopefuls of whom the only question that can ever be asked is, \u201cOh wow \u2013 where on earth did they find that one?\u201d Where DID they find Susan? Possibly on account of her lurid social media history, she\u2019s been described as a populist, and for much of her time since selection has come off as the best kind of populist \u2013 one who is not very popular. Having said that, the picture has distinctly shifted in recent months, and noises from the Labour campaign are increasingly strangulated. There is at least a small possibility that Hall could win \u2013 which would ironically be one of the most compelling arguments that London is having some form of existential crisis. None of which is to suggest that Khan is the most exceptional of rivals. For my money he has been a very indifferent mayor, and anyone seeking a third term should be expected to be judged and attacked on their record. But the fact that he isn\u2019t, in ads like this, does matter. It does matter if parties fake scenes of terror in a London Underground station that turns out to be in New York. It does matter if untruths are told because it\u2019s easier than fighting truthfully. And \u2013 as discussed here previously \u2013 it matters when the other side do it too. It mattered when Keir Starmer decided to release an attack ad featuring a picture of a grinning Rishi Sunak and the slogan: \u201cDo you think adults convicted of sexually assaulting children should go to prison? Rishi Sunak doesn\u2019t.\u201d All of these things matter and don\u2019t result in anything good. We already know where assaults on truth lead, because we\u2019ve seen them happen in other countries and in some cases our own, and people on all sides have spent a lot of the past decade lamenting it. The tragedy is that we all know it, and even the people who come up with the ads know it \u2013 but they\u2019re still doing it because they think that it works in the very short term. Yet in the long term, it really, really doesn\u2019t \u2013 which makes doing it anyway pretty criminal in itself. Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"

After Israel alleged that Unrwa staff members took part in the 7 October attacks, which killed more than 1,200 people, donors threatened to cut $450m (\u00a3350m) funding from the $880m budget, just as the need for its services in Gaza was at its peak. Cuts also threaten its activities in the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The Lebanese government is warning that the suspension of Unrwa\u2019s services could create a humanitarian catastrophe that threatens the country\u2019s stability. Unrwa runs 150 sites across Lebanon on a budget of about $180m a year, according to Unrwa\u2019s director there, Doroth\u00e9e Klaus. In places such as Mar Elias, these services are a lifeline for Palestinians. In addition to the clinic, Unrwa runs a primary school for 277 pupils \u2013 at 95%, the attendance rate for Palestinians in Lebanon is higher than the regional average \u2013 and a small water-treatment facility. It also runs waste-collection services and has helped to pave the narrow streets between Mar Elias\u2019s colourfully painted tenements with concrete patterned to resemble flagstones. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a village,\u201d says Unrwa\u2019s camp services officer, Ferial Kiwan. She says Mar Elias is quiet and clean, as well as being smaller and more peaceful than most of Lebanon\u2019s 12 camps, the worst of which suffer from high crime rates and poor sanitation. The camp was established on church grounds to host Christian Palestinians after the 1948 Nakba (\u201cCatastrophe\u201d), in which more than 750,000 people were displaced or expelled from their homes during the creation of Israel and the resulting Arab-Israeli war. It has since become home to 1,700 residents of different faiths, the majority of whom were born in Lebanon. Despite its peacefulness, unemployment is rife and deprivation is high. Across the country, 80% of Palestinians live in poverty. Growing up in the camps, Kiwan says, \u201cmakes you a different person\u201d. Palestinians are barred from attending Lebanon\u2019s schools, accessing state healthcare or owning property in the country. Most Palestinians in employment have low-paying jobs in the informal sector, but since the economic crisis hit in 2019, these jobs have become harder to find. A recent Unrwa recruitment drive for 30 sanitation workers received 38,000 applicants, including many with higher degrees. Unrwa is one of the few employers offering white-collar positions to Palestinians. \u201cIt is the dream of every Palestinian to find a job there,\u201d says Tarek Moneim, chief executive of Initiate, a programme that supports empowerment and entrepreneurship among young Palestinians in Lebanon. Unrwa employs about 3,500 people in Lebanon; the vast majority, like Kiwan, are Palestinian. With so many of their relatives out of work, she says, \u201cevery Unrwa staff member is supporting two or three families\u201d. For young Palestinians in particular, Moneim says it is \u201csuper-difficult\u201d to earn an income. Children growing up in the camps \u201cstart to lose hope and ambition\u201d, he says, seeing few opportunities for themselves beyond emigrating to Europe or joining a militant group at home. \u201cWithout Unrwa, I see a lot of violence inside the camps and a humanitarian crisis,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it ever collapses, it will be a black day.\u201d Lebanon is already suffering from an economic crisis that has wiped out more than half its economy, and a border conflict between Hezbollah and Israeli forces that has displaced thousands of people and threatens to spread to the rest of the country. Speaking in Beirut earlier this month, the caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, warned that Unrwa was critical for maintaining stability in Lebanon and that its collapse could result in \u201cunforeseen consequences\u201d. The potential for unrest in the camps was made clear last summer, when three months of interfactional fighting in the Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp left dozens of people dead and many more wounded, according to reports. Gunmen from Fatah, the dominant faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, fought street battles with Islamist militants after the assassination of a Fatah commander. More than 2,500 families were forced to find temporary accommodation, according to Unrwa. According to Abdelnasser el-Ayi, the director of the Lebanese Palestinian Dialogue Committee, unrest in the camps poses \u201ca security threat for Lebanon\u2019s stability\u201d. \u201cUnrwa is a stabilising actor,\u201d he says. \u201cLeaving the people without any services would make people much more inclined to join the [militant] groups, who actually can offer them money and can offer them survival. They are already in terrible living conditions.\u201d One of Unrwa\u2019s most effective interventions in Lebanon is the quarterly distribution of small cash payments to the most vulnerable individuals, which go to 65% of the 145,000 registered refugees. The organisation\u2019s distribution of $50 handouts four times a year for children, elderly and chronically ill people has reduced poverty levels from 93% to 80%, Unrwa says. But the threat of funding cuts has put this quarter\u2019s payments in jeopardy and the people who rely on them \u201care already getting restless\u201d, says Klaus. \u201cWe\u2019re having to see where we can still find a bit of money,\u201d she says, \u201cand then we will have to make some hard decisions.\u201d"

            "content": "When Fern Stroud was growing up, she would tag along with her father as he drove a tour bus taking visitors from their hometown of Berkeley, California, to Napa valley\u2019s wine country. She would notice how happy people were after a couple hours into the trip, and think: \u201cI can\u2019t wait until I\u2019m 21.\u201d However, Stroud\u2019s first visit to wine country as an adult was anything but pleasant. The name of the winery has faded from her memory, but Stroud, who\u2019s now 45 and identifies as LGBTQ, remembers the feeling and her unhealthy efforts to belong. \u201cI would go into that space with my braids, just being me and be ignored,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel very welcomed. I would overdo it, spending way too much money to prove to them that I can be in that space. \u2026 I was like, that\u2019s BS. Why can\u2019t I just be treated like anyone else?\u201d Stroud turned that frustration into action, creating and curating Black Vines, a community of Black vintners who pour their wines for people in the Bay Area who look like them. Starting with a small event at an art gallery in 2012, Black Vines now holds a yearly event that\u2019s become a social highlight for Black wine connoisseurs in the Bay Area, including being named one of the best wine festivals in Alameda county by USA Today. It organizes other live events and has a membership program and has grown into a powerful economic engine for Black-owned wine businesses, connecting them with consumers who have largely been ignored by the mainstream wine industry. \u201cIt\u2019s about building a Black economic ecosystem through wine,\u201d says Freda Statom-Greene, a non-profit executive who helps Stroud produce events. \u201cFern is all about connecting people and creating community.\u201d These days, Black Vines\u2019 annual event in February \u2013 during Black History Month \u2013 draws nearly 1,000 people. Women with flowing braids and locs in fashionable clothing and blingy nails sip wines ranging from central coast pinot noir by Indigen\u00e9 Cellars to Ayaba\u2019s peach sparkling wine named after the Egyptian queen Nefertiti. Most wineries pouring are emerging brands, but wine stars come out, too. Earl Stevens, also known as the rapper E-40, attended the event this year, with his eponymous label. \u201cFern is a connector and passionate about Black wine and how it\u2019s experienced,\u201d says Robin McBride, co-founder of McBride Sisters Wine Co, one of the largest Black-owned wine brands in the US. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s ever met Fern knows that everything she does comes from a place of love and respect.\u201d Building community, sip by sip As a young software developer, Stroud never intended to build a large wine event. She was just enjoying meeting people. \u201cIt was more about the people behind the wine,\u201d she says. She was impressed with the Sterling family of Esterlina Vineyards who then owned the entire Cole Ranch monopole in Anderson Valley, saying: \u201cFor them to have the smallest AVA [American viticultural area] in the country and for it to be Black-owned \u2026 When I tasted their Riesling, it blew my mind.\u201d One tasting at a time, Stroud made the connections to create Black Vines. Lou Garcia, the owner of Stover Oaks Winery, introduced her to members of the Association of African American Vintners and Mac McDonald, the founder of Vision Cellars and the dean of Black winemakers in the US. Over wine, they shared stories of how it felt to be the only Black winemaker at many events. \u201cFor me to hear those stories of being the only Black person in the room reminded me so much of my experience being in tech,\u201d Stroud recalls. In 2012, Stroud was making decent money for her age, and wanted to host a Black History Month event. She invited mixed-media artists to show sculpture and painting at a small gallery and booked a band, but wanted one more element \u2013 wine tasting. Garcia of Stover Oaks remembers helping deliver the wine for the very first tasting. \u201cThey were small and we could talk to people about our wine,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThose were the good old days.\u201d That first event inspired Stroud to learn more about wine\u2019s origins. She headed to South Africa, which has a winemaking tradition dating back 300 years. Touring the city of Stellenbosch, she learned to identify the taste of limestone in a viognier, sipped her first pinotage and met Ntsiki Biyela, South Africa\u2019s first Black woman winemaker. \u201cThat\u2019s when the bug really hit me,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, this is dope and there\u2019s so much learning that comes with it and it\u2019s never-ending.\u201d In 2019, Stroud spent three weeks in France with her Black Vines team and wine educator and mentor, Melody Fuller. Stroud developed her palate and grew more confident in her wine knowledge, she says. She was still reveling in her French wine tour when the pandemic hit in 2020, and she was laid off from her tech job. \u201cI went full speed into entrepreneurship and it was the best decision I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d Stroud says. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown exponentially.\u201d Thanks to business development grants from the McBride Sisters She Can fund, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s BeyGood Foundation, and others, she\u2019s been able to do more advertising, and elevate the event. Expanding the focus While Black Vines began as a safe space for Black consumers in the US to learn about wine, Stroud and her team are expanding their focus. They hosted an event in Belize in 2023, and they\u2019re looking to offer business-development support and create programming for LGBTQ+, women and Latino winemakers. \u201cWe\u2019re reppin\u2019 the underdogs in this wine space,\u201d Stroud says. \u201cActually, I can\u2019t call them the underdogs. They\u2019re the thread and the fabric that allowed this industry to be.\u201d For Black wine lovers in the Bay Area, Black Vines has been a refuge. \u201cI\u2019ve been to damn near every Black Vines event,\u201d says Brianna Rogers, an initiative officer with the San Francisco Foundation. Her all-time favorite wine is the sparkling ros\u00e9 from Black Excellence Wine Co, but this year she fell in love with Kh\u0113mia, a smooth Napa valley cabernet sauvignon made by Hendersons\u2019 Harvest. \u201cI come because I\u2019m trying to have more intentionality with how I operate as a consumer. Coming to a space like this makes it super easy to engage with Black winemakers, she says. Newcomer Savannah Bundy was drawn to Wade Cellars\u2019 chenin blanc and a Proven\u00e7al ros\u00e9 by La F\u00eate Wine Co. \u201cAside from being a fun and chic party, Black Vines shines a light on how much gate-keeping there\u2019s been as far as winemaking and selling go,\u201d says Bundy, a chef and food writer. \u201cIt\u2019s an important space for making the wine world feel accessible to Black people.\u201d \u2022 The headline to this article was amended on 1 April 2024. A previous version incorrectly stated Fern Stroud is a winemaker; she is a wine event curator."

            "content": "It was the new van that gave Paul Major the idea of changing his \u201c&amp; Sons\u201d construction business to \u201c&amp; Daughters\u201d. \u201cMy wife had seen an \u2018&amp; Daughters\u2019 coach driving along a motorway when she was younger and it had stuck in her head,\u201d said Major, from Sevenoaks, Kent. \u201cYears later when my dad had passed away and our fourth and final daughter had been born, I bought our new van and my wife said changing the name would be great branding, and also the obvious thing to do.\u201d Ten years on and Major still gets a comment on the name at least once a week. \u201cOften it\u2019s a group of us blokes sitting around during a job, and someone will come up and say: \u2018So, you\u2019re the daughters, are you?\u2019 Never fails to make us laugh. \u201cI can\u2019t put my finger on why but people really like it,\u201d he added. \u201cI think it gives them more trust in us \u2013 it\u2019s somehow more meaningful than an \u2018&amp; Sons\u2019 name \u2013 and in the construction industry it does stand out. I think we do probably get more calls from female customers.\u201d Major\u2019s eldest daughter, Ruby, worked for the company for a while but has moved on now. \u201cMy younger teenage daughters have their moments, showing interest in following in their dad\u2019s footprints,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be lovely if they did.\u201d There has been a 75% growth in the use of the \u201c&amp; Daughter(s)\u201d suffix in companies registered at Companies House over the past five years. The more traditional \u201c&amp; Son(s)\u201d suffix has increased by 51% over the same period. Numbers are still small: over the past five years, there were 114 new companies registered under the \u201c&amp; Daughter(s)\u201d suffix, compared with 2,379 new companies with \u201c&amp; Son(s)\u201d. There are now 152 companies registered as \u201c&amp; Daughter(s)\u201d. It\u2019s a change that has been slow to take root. Britain\u2019s earliest registered \u201c&amp; Daughter\u201d company was the fishmongers H Marment &amp; Daughter in Caterham, Surrey, which operated from 1928 to 2022. The company made headlines at the time, with a front-page story in the Daily Mirror reporting how Marment had made the decision to reflect \u201cthe excellent leadership of his daughter, Miss Amy F Marment, during her time running the business during the first world war\u201d. The 31 January 1928 edition of the Brechin Advertiser stated: \u201cThis is certainly the age of women. H Marment &amp; Daughter has established a precedent which will, probably, be often followed.\u201d Almost a century later, however, just 19% of the UK\u2019s small and medium-sized enterprises are led by women \u2013 even though women typically invest a higher proportion of their earnings in their families and communities than men, creating a strong base for economic growth and prosperity. \u201cWomen are indispensable for economic growth and female entrepreneurship is about more than just economic empowerment, it\u2019s about paving the way for future generations of women in business,\u201d said Corin Camenisch, the global product marketing lead at SumUp, a London-based global financial technology company. Charlotte Hearnden-Smith is the daughter at the Middlesex-based Hearnden-Smith &amp; Daughters Funeral Directors, and she hopes to be joined by her younger sister in a few years\u2019 time. \u201cMy mother, Suzanne, set this business up in 1998 with her father,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was the driving force: this was her vision, her dream and her goal.\u201d Hearnden-Smith said the name emphasised a feminine touch in a male-dominated industry. \u201cPeople often like to have hugs at this difficult moment in their lives,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople rarely turn down a hug, but a hug from a woman is usually especially welcome.\u201d Mick Aldred recently founded the R Carter &amp; Daughter Delicatessen in Bamburgh, Northumberland, next to his family business, R Carter &amp; Son Butchers. His daughter worked there at the time but he said the \u201c&amp; Daughters\u201d suffix was a tribute to the line of \u201cincredibly strong\u201d women who had built the business up, more than it was a nod to the future. \u201cMy grandmother Jane was an amazing businesswomen who kept the shop going after her husband drank it dry,\u201d he said. \u201cThen my mother, Kathleen, took over. She was amazing too. \u201cThe \u2018&amp; Daughters\u2019 name was partly a branding exercise,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut mainly it was to pay tribute to the women of our family who are now dead and gone but who we owe it all to.\u201d Gediminas Ju\u0161kys, the strategy director at the female-run branding company Sons and Daughters ID, said the \u201c&amp; Daughter(s)\u201d moniker was so powerful that they had used it for their own marketing company despite there being no daughters in the company. \u201cIt is a statement of difference in attitude towards how our business is run and the role of women in business and life in general,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes you think and that\u2019s a great thing for a brand.\u201d Matt Waksman, the head of strategy, advertising, at Ogilvy UK, believes that adding an \u201c&amp; Daughter\u201d name to a business can bring in a different type of clientele and exude a sense of openness. \u201cUsing a daughter\u2019s name instead of a son\u2019s name reflects family values by showing a business\u2019s respect for tradition while also being future-facing,\u201d he said. Sairah Ashman, the global CEO at the branding consultancy Wolff Olins, said that with increasing numbers of women setting up businesses and making a virtue of passing that on to daughters, the suffix \u201cfeels like it\u2019s an obvious thing to do\u201d."

            "title": "Obama opened a door between Cuba and the US. Why is Biden closing it again? | Bhaskar Sunkara",
            "date": "2024-03-26T10:05:15Z",
            "content": "On 6 April 1960, the US diplomat Lester D Mallory wrote a memo advocating an embargo \u201cdenying money and supplies to Cuba, to decrease monetary and real wages, to bring about hunger, desperation and overthrow of government\u201d. Sixty-four years later and the policy that Cubans call el bloqueo (the blockade) is still in force. It hasn\u2019t achieved its stated aim of overturning the Cuban Revolution \u2013 but it has fueled years of desperation and justified anger. Barack Obama came to recognize this by his second term. During a historic 2016 visit to Havana, he said that he had come \u201cto bury the last remnant of the cold war in the Americas\u201d and \u201cto extend the hand of friendship to the Cuban people\u201d. By then his administration had already made tangible steps in that direction. US restrictions on travel and remittances were eased and the countries\u2019 respective embassies were reopened in Havana and Washington DC. Crucially, Cuba was also removed from the state-sponsors-of-terrorism list and allowed to do business with US banks that are the linchpin of the world financial system. History\u2019s longest standing sanctions regime was not completely dismantled, but the progress was immense, with benefits seen almost immediately by Cuban workers. The surprise election of Donald Trump changed all of that. Influenced by Cuban-American politicians like Marco Rubio and a vocal lobby in Miami, he restored travel restrictions and banned dealings with state companies that comprise the bulk of Cuba\u2019s economy. But Trump\u2019s most provocative action came just days before he left office in January 2021, when he returned Cuba to the state-sponsors-of-terrorism list. This despite the two countries cooperating extensively on counterterrorism and successful Cuban efforts to encourage Latin American guerrilla groups like Farc to end armed struggle. On the campaign trail, Joe Biden promised a return to Obama\u2019s approach, but he has delivered little change. Cuba remains isolated from important sources of trade and finance \u2013 even from non-US actors \u2013 as a result. These difficult conditions led to recent protests against food shortages and electricity outages in Santiago and much more widespread demonstrations throughout the island in July 2021. Hawks in the US see a state in its weakest position in decades and believe that inflicting even more pressure on the Cuban people will lead to the end of Communist party rule. In reality, the embargo has only slowed down promising reform efforts and allowed the government to credibly blame economic conditions on an outside force. Actions against Cuba started before Mallory\u2019s memo, immediately following the 1959 victory of Fidel Castro\u2019s revolutionary forces against the hated Fulgencio Batista dictatorship. Ironically, considering the longstanding US designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism, actions supported by Washington ranged from small acts of industrial sabotage to attacks on civilians to a full-scale invasion in 1961. Despite this pressure, the Castro government implemented important measures. A literacy campaign reached more than 700,000 people, mostly in neglected rural areas. These Cubans also benefited from sweeping land reform, rural electrification and the nationwide establishment of free, high-quality healthcare and education. A one-party state was established, but there was widespread support for and participation in these efforts. Abroad, the work of Cuban doctors and technical specialists continues to be praised across the developing world. Medical brigades have been sent to over 100 countries since the revolution, including after the 2010 Haitian earthquake and the 2014 west African Ebola outbreak. In the last two decades, another effort has cured 3 million patients in developing countries of visual impairments. The role of Cuban military forces was also instrumental in the defeat of apartheid. At the cost of thousands dead and wounded, Cuba and their Angolan allies beat back the South African army in an effort that Nelson Mandela said \u201cdestroyed the myth of the invincibility of the white oppressor\u201d and \u201cserved as an inspiration to the struggling people of South Africa\u201d. Yet the economy underwriting these efforts was built on a shaky foundation. To counteract the impact of US embargo, Cuba became dependent on Soviet bloc support. Comecon countries provided subsidized oil, food and machine parts. They also offered a market for sugar, nickel and other exports at above-market rates. In 1989, 13m tons of fuel were imported from the Soviet Union alone, which also supplied Cuba with 63% of its food imports and 80% of its imported machinery. Meanwhile, most of Cuba\u2019s sugar, citrus and nickel exports were sold to the USSR. Eastern bloc support managed to mask some of the weaknesses in Cuba\u2019s state-run economy, but the embargo itself predetermined the over-reliance on subsidies that Washington directly pressured Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev to wind up. After the final collapse of European state socialism, the economic situation in Cuba went from strained to catastrophic. With popular discontent mounting in the early 1990s, Castro declared \u201ca special period in time of peace\u201d. Investment projects were put on hold; electricity consumption was slashed, along with food and clothing rations. Key factories were forced to shutter for absence of imported inputs. A lack of fertilizers and spare parts for tractors led to a freefall in agriculture. Cuban GDP dropped 40% in the early 1990s alone. In Washington, the crisis was seen as an opportunity to score a final cold war victory. The rightwing Heritage Foundation called Castro not just \u201can anachronism, but a dangerous one\u201d and pressed for a heightening of the embargo to finally produce \u201cits intended result of destabilizing the island\u2019s communist government\u201d. The Clinton administration followed their script in lockstep. A tightening economic embargo was headlined by the 1996 Helms-Burton Act, which expanded the scope of prohibited transactions and increased sanctions on violators, including foreign companies. For America\u2019s ideologues, questions of property rights were always foregrounded. Helms-Burton allowed US citizens whose wealth was redistributed by the Cuban revolution to sue individuals and companies that \u201ctrafficked\u201d in those long-expropriated assets. Despite some Democratic opposition in Congress, Bill Clinton trumpeted the act as a measure that would \u201cencourage the development of a market economy\u201d. Yet, Cuba adapted during the special period and survived. It opened itself to foreign investment, promoted tourism as a source of hard currency and decentralized some of its economy. The country also found new allies, with the election of a wave of leftwing governments in the region. Venezuela, in particular, provided vital oil and financial aid in return for Cuban medical and teaching assistance. Reform efforts hastened after Raul Castro succeeded his brother in 2008, with a tripartite model of growth that married the traditional state economy with international investment and private entrepreneurship. Economic performance was mixed, particularly in agricultural and energy sectors, but more open debates about necessary changes and new experiments showed a government on the right track. Obama\u2019s fleeting opening encouraged these positive tendencies. Trump\u2019s U-turn from his predecessor couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time for the Cuban people. Already suffering from the health effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on international tourism, the Cuban economy sharply contracted in 2020. High fuel and food prices were made worse by the country\u2019s virtual inability to trade in even exempted items with its superpower neighbor. Even banks not headquartered in the US feared processing state-owned companies\u2019 payments to international suppliers, much less financing development efforts. Long insulated from austerity, it was clear that the island\u2019s lauded health and education programs also suffered in this environment. Cubans were deprived of their material necessities, but Washington wasn\u2019t any closer to its \u201cregime change\u201d ambitions. On the campaign trail, Biden rightly spoke of Trump\u2019s \u201cfailed Cuba policy\u201d and signaled a willingness to return to Obama\u2019s approach. In office, however, he has done little to change course. The embargo has not just stymied Cuban president Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel\u2019s recent reform efforts, it has colored 65 years of his country\u2019s development. By some counts, it has cost more than $140bn in total, far outweighing Soviet support for Cuba, which in any case lasted less than half of the revolution\u2019s history. Simply, the US owes a debt to the Cuban people for its decades of economic warfare. At the very least, the president should make good on his campaign promises and immediately remove Cuba\u2019s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. If the US can establish full relations with Vietnam, a one-party state that it engaged in bloody armed conflict against for years, there is no reason why its cold war with Cuba cannot end. Our message should be simple: let Cubans decide the future of Cuba without coercion. It\u2019s time to overcome the objections of a small lobby of hawks and cease a policy that stands against the interests of ordinary Americans and Cubans alike.

Employers cut back on hiring new staff, pushing the number of advertised vacancies down on the quarter by 43,000 to 908,000, indicating that the recession during the last six months of 2023 took a slightly bigger toll on the labour market than first estimated. The Bank of England has waited to see signs that wage growth is slowing before making a move to reduce interest rates, and is expected to view the latest figures as another reason to begin that process this year. However, more recent surveys have shown UK businesses regaining confidence in the economic outlook and preparing to raise prices as employees continue to receive pay rises above the rate of headline inflation, which is now 4% \u2013 still double the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. A rise in the number of people leaving the labour market, mostly due to ill-health, will also likely mean that employers struggle to find staff and wages growth falls slowly over the coming months. Tony Wilson, the director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said: \u201cIn all, there are well over half a million more people out of work than before the pandemic began. This is being driven by more young people and older people outside the labour force, and in particular because of more people reporting long-term health conditions that stop them from working. \u201cIn our view this is holding back the recovery as the economy is continuing to create jobs, with nearly a million unfilled vacancies reported today.\u201d The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the figures showed his plans to increase incomes were working. \u201cOur plan is working. Even with inflation falling, real wages have risen for the seventh month in a row. And take home pay is set for another boost thanks to our cuts to national insurance which in total are putting more than \u00a3900 a year back into the average earner\u2019s pocket,\u201d he said. Wilson said the rise in inactivity meant the government needed \u201ca different approach to how we reach and engage with people who are out of work and may want to come back to work\u201d. He added: \u201cIn particular our employment services need to be more accessible, inclusive and supportive. Employers need to play their part too, and do more to keep people in work and to open up opportunities for those who may need more support.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-06T22:20:19Z",
            "content": "Chemical pollution tied to fossil fuel operations poses serious risks to human health, warns a new analysis published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday. Citing data from dozens of studies, the report points to an alarming rise in neurodevelopmental issues, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and certain cancers in young people taking place amid what the paper\u2019s author calls \u201cexplosive growth\u201d in the petrochemical industry. Between 1990 and 2019, rates of certain cancers in people under 50 increased dramatically. Meanwhile, fossil fuel use and petrochemical production have increased fifteen-fold since the 1950s, according to the report. \u201cOne of the major factors driving climate change is also increasing our exposures to chemicals that are adversely impacting health,\u201d said the report\u2019s author, Tracey Woodruff, a professor at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). \u201cTypically people say cancer is a disease of the aging, but now we\u2019re seeing it increasing in people under 50.\u201d The report points to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), chemicals commonly found in plastics and other products that interfere with healthy hormonal function, as a key threat. \u201cNumerous medical societies, government agencies, and systematic reviews have concluded that exposure to chemicals and pollution, including EDCs is an important risk factor for multiple diseases and health inequities and probably contributes to these increases,\u201d the report notes, adding that increases in disease and petrochemical production at the same time \u201calone cannot be interpreted as causal\u201d. Phil Landrigan, an epidemiologist at Boston College who was not involved with the study, said he agreed with the paper\u2019s conclusions. \u201cAll of this plastic is laden with over 10,000 chemicals,\u201d Landrigan said. \u201cThese chemicals include carcinogens, developmental neurotoxicants, endocrine disruptors and hundreds more that have never been tested for toxicity.\u201d He added that these chemicals leach out of plastics where they can cause a range of ailments including cancer, cardiovascular disease and infertility. Altering hormones Endocrine systems regulate an array of key biological processes, including brain and nervous system development, reproduction, and metabolism and blood sugar levels. Exposure to EDCs, including through contaminated food, air and water, can lead to problems with male and female fertility and fetal development in both people and animals. Even small disturbances to endocrine function, especially during pregnancy, can lead to \u201cprofound and lasting effects\u201d, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. EDCs are found in several everyday materials, including pesticides, building materials and cosmetics, as well as in many fabrics and children\u2019s toys, according to the new analysis. These chemicals are part of a broader pollution burden that has become the leading cause of premature deaths around the world, according to the analysis. Chemical pollution is estimated to be responsible for at least 1.8 million deaths each year, the paper states. People of color and those living in low-income areas, or otherwise disadvantaged communities are often the most exposed to harmful chemicals. The analysis cites data showing levels of EDCs in urine and blood of Black and Hispanic women \u201cpersistently higher\u201d than levels found in non-Hispanic White women. Due in part to a boom in single-use plastics production, petrochemical production continues to climb despite growing use of renewable energy sources to power homes and vehicles. The paper published Wednesday calls for stricter safety testing of chemicals, more tracking of chemical exposures and full or partial bans on single chemicals and single-use plastics. \u201cWe need to have government policies that ensure that chemicals that are being used and produced in the US are not creating toxic exposures to people,\u201d Woodruff said. \u201cThis can really only be accomplished through improved public policies.\u201d This story is co-published with the New Lede, a journalism project of the Environmental Working Group"

            "date": "2024-03-29T14:17:46Z",
            "content": "Chinese telecoms firm Huawei grew faster in 2023 than it has for four years, as it shrugged off the impact of US sanctions. Revenues rose by nearly 10% to 704.2bn yuan (\u00a377bn) as the Shenzhen-based company enjoyed a rebound within its consumer segment, which includes smartphone handsets. The performance meant Huawei defied the effect of sanctions imposed by the US in 2019, when Donald Trump\u2019s White House accused the firm of being a security risk, something Huawei denies. The UK also vowed in 2020 to remove Huawei from 5G infrastructure by 2027, due to similar concerns, prompting fury from China at a decision taken by the British government, but for which Trump appeared to take credit. Despite the restrictions, last year marked the third consecutive year of growth for Huawei, which had reported a fall in revenues in 2021, when it exhausted its stocks of microchip reserves. However, revenues remains below its 2020 peak of 891.3bn yuan. At a company event last year, Meng Wangzhou, Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer and the daughter of the company founder, announced that Huawei was no longer in crisis mode. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot over the past few years but through one challenge after another, we\u2019ve managed to grow,\u201d said Huawei\u2019s chair, Ken Hu, on Friday. Huawei\u2019s net profit for 2023 rose by 144.5% to 87bn yuan, with the margin more than doubling on a year earlier to more than 12%. Some of that came from ongoing income from the sale of its Honor smartphone brand, which Huawei off-loaded in November 2020, the company said. Huawei\u2019s smartphone business has thrived despite hostility from the UK government and US sanctions, which hamper its ability to make key chipmaking tools In September, Huawei produced a 5G smartphone using an advanced silicon chip on a scale of miniaturisation thought beyond its capabilities due to US-led export restrictions, analysts said. Its Mate 60 Pro is powered by a new Kirin 9000s chip that was made in China by the partly state-owned Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), the analysis firm TechInsights said. While Huawei\u2019s core IT infrastructure business remained stable, its cloud business grew by more than a fifth, generating revenue of 55.3bn yuan. Huawei\u2019s four-year-old smart car software and components business also recorded rapid growth, albeit from a much smaller base, up by 128.1% year on year to 4.7bn yuan. Huawei announced last year it would spin-off the smart car unit into a new company."

            "date": "2024-03-18T22:30:13Z",
            "content": "The Treasury under a Labour government would \u201chardwire\u201d raising Britain\u2019s growth rate into its budget tax and spending decisions as part of plans to shake up Whitehall\u2019s most powerful department, Rachel Reeves is to announce. The shadow chancellor will use a lecture in London on Tuesday to say that a decade of national renewal must start with \u201cday one\u201d reform after a Labour election victory to make growth more pivotal to the Treasury\u2019s work. Rejecting calls from some critics for the Treasury to be broken up into separate economy and public finance arms, Reeves will say she wants to beef up its in-house enterprise and growth unit and for the first time integrate its work with the department\u2019s tax and spending divisions. \u201cIn 1997, the last Labour government established the enterprise and growth unit within the Treasury. Squarely focused on driving economic growth. It was a source of important policy ideas, including the reform of competition law and the creation of a longer-term science funding framework,\u201d Reeves is due to say in the Mais lecture at City University\u2019s Bayes Business School. \u201cHowever, as the Institute for Government noted last month, that unit is widely seen to be underpowered, its influence diminished compared to 20 years ago. And crucially it is not involved in the management of fiscal events. \u201cSo, we will build on that success. Hardwiring economic growth into budget and spending review processes, with a reformed and strengthened enterprise and growth unit augmenting the existing so-called \u2018fiscal triangle\u2019.\u201d Labour\u2019s election victory in 1997 was followed within days by Gordon Brown\u2019s announcement of operational independence for the Bank of England, and Reeves will make reform of the Treasury part of her first 100-day agenda. Earlier this month, Brown said Britain would need to be put on an economic war footing if it was to break out of a vicious cycle of low growth. The annual Mais lecture has become a set-piece event for economic policymakers to set out their worldview. In 2022, Rishi Sunak, then the chancellor, said he wanted to cut taxes \u201csustainably\u201d and downgrade the role played by the state as an engine of growth. In her lecture, Reeves will say Labour\u2019s plan for growth is to be built on three pillars: stability, investment and unlocking the untapped potential of Britain\u2019s workers. \u201cWe need to do more to enshrine that core growth mission within our economic architecture,\u201d Reeves will say. She will call for the public and private sectors to join together in a national mission to restore strong economic growth across the country. \u201cWhen we speak of a decade of national renewal, that is what we mean. As we did at the end of the 1970s, we stand at an inflection point, and as in earlier decades, the solution lies in wide-ranging supply-side reform to drive investment, remove the blockages constraining our productive capacity, and fashion a new economic settlement, drawing on evolutions in economic thought.\u201d Unlike the 1980s, growth in the years to come must be broad-based, inclusive and resilient, Reeves will say, driven by planning reform, strengthening devolution and a new industrial strategy. She will promise to create half a million jobs across the UK through a new national wealth fund that will invest in the \u201cindustries of the future\u201d. A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cThe Treasury\u2019s role as an economics ministry is at the fore of what it does and particularly seen in recent fiscal events, with measures taken to increase labour supply and boost business investment. [The enterprise and growth unit] has expanded significantly over time, now under the direction of a director general.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-14T17:00:25Z",
            "content": "The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that the only way to boost global economic growth over the next century is by tackling soaring inequality to achieve a ninefold increase in living standards. Kristalina Georgieva said world leaders had a responsibility to future generations to build an economy that dealt with global heating, deployed AI technology responsibly and slashed elevated levels of inequality. \u201cWe have an obligation to correct what has been most seriously wrong over the last 100 years \u2013 the persistence of high economic inequality. IMF research shows that lower income inequality can be associated with higher and more durable growth,\u201d she said. \u201cWe simply cannot get to the \u2018high ambition scenario\u2019 for growth unless we foster a fairer global economy.\u201d In a speech at King\u2019s College, Cambridge, she argued the world was a turning point, making a comparison with the Great Depression of the 1930s, when the leading British economist John Maynard Keynes wrote his seminal essay Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren. She said Keynes had been right to predict that technology gains could deliver an eightfold increase in living standards in 100 years\u2019 time, but that the founding father of modern economics had been too optimistic about how the benefits of growth would be shared. Keynes, who was a fellow and academic administrator at King\u2019s and played an integral role in the creation of the IMF after the second world war, predicted that technology gains driving up productivity would allow for more leisure time with a 15-hour working week. However, Georgieva said the proceeds of growth had been too heavily concentrated among particular groups and in rich countries. \u201cHe [Keynes] was also too optimistic about how the benefits of growth would be shared. Economic inequality remains too high, within and across countries,\u201d she said. Setting out two possible scenarios for the next 100 years, developed by IMF staff, Georgieva said the world could expect either a \u201clow ambition\u201d path with global gross domestic product about three times larger and living standards twice as high as today. Alternatively a \u201chigh ambition\u201d scenario based on building a more sustainable and equitable global economy could leave global GDP 13 times larger after a century, with living standards about nine times higher. The Bulgarian economist, who is seeking a second five-year term as IMF managing director after being nominated by a string of European countries to lead the institution, said this would rely on the world pursuing a \u201cdifferent kind of growth\u201d in future. Calling on governments around the world to focus attention on three key priority areas, she said it was vital to address the climate emergency, invest in new technologies such as AI, and invest in people through tackling inequality. \u201cWe also recognise the need to put in place better measurement of wealth that goes beyond the traditional GDP, that values not only produced capital, but also nature, people, and the fabric of societies,\u201d Georgieva said. Highlighting Keynes\u2019s maxim that \u201cin the long run, we are all dead\u201d in her speech, she said the economist had meant the phrase as a call to action. \u201cHe meant the following: instead of waiting for market forces to fix things over the long run, policymakers should try to resolve problems in the short run,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a call to which I for one am determined to respond \u2013 to do my part for my grandchildren\u2019s better future. Because, as Keynes put it in 1942: \u2018In the long run almost anything is possible.\u2019\u201d"

            "content": "The governor of the Bank of England has said interest rate cuts will be \u201cin play\u201d at forthcoming policy meetings amid progress in sharply reducing the UK\u2019s headline rate of inflation over the past year. In a signal that Threadneedle Street is preparing the ground for a cut in borrowing costs within months, Andrew Bailey told the Financial Times: \u201cAll our meetings are in play. We take a fresh decision every time.\u201d The central bank kept interest rates on hold at 5.25% on Thursday for a fifth consecutive time. However, its rate-setting monetary policy committee said there were \u201cencouraging signs\u201d of falling inflation that could open the door for interest rate cuts in future. Official figures show retail sales in Great Britain beat analysts\u2019 expectations of a decline in February, with zero growth in spending on the high street and online after wet weather put a dampener on consumer spending. City economists had predicted a 0.3% fall in sales for the month. February was one of the wettest months on record, with southern England experiencing more than twice the average level of rainfall. Analysts said the figures indicated household spending was holding up better than expected, in a positive sign for the UK economy, which went into recession at the end of last year. However, household finances remained under pressure from elevated interest rates and higher prices for essentials. Danni Hewson, the head of financial analysis at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: \u201cThings are improving slowly but the next barrage of bill increases is just around the corner and wage increases, tax cuts and falling inflation won\u2019t mitigate those completely. \u201cThe retail sector is likely to remain volatile for months to come as people continue to feel less well-off and more vulnerable to shocks.\u201d Bailey\u2019s comments came as financial markets bet on a first quarter-point cut in June, with expectations for two more reductions before the end of the year to about 4.5% amid a sharp fall in inflation over recent months. In tacit agreement with the City predictions, the Bank\u2019s governor said: \u201cThe fact that we have a curve that has cuts in it for the year as a whole is not unreasonable to me.\u201d Inflation has fallen back from more than 10% a year ago to 3.4% in February. Most economists expect it will drop further in the months ahead to dip below the Bank\u2019s 2% target, helped by a widely expected fall in energy bills from April. However, the Bank has warned that inflation could return above its target later this year amid resilient levels of wage growth and rising prices in the service sector of the economy. Economists believe the central bank will therefore wait for at least two more months of official inflation and jobs market data before taking action. Bailey said he was \u201cnot seeing a lot of sticky persistence [in inflation] coming through at the moment\u201d, while suggesting progress was being made in the economy to recover from a shallow recession at the end of 2023. \u201cSome people are more comfortable with the evidence they are beginning to see, and others feel, no, we are further off from being confident,\u201d he added. Asked if he was in the former category, he said: \u201cWhat we are seeing is encouraging to me.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-26T10:47:37Z",
            "content": "A senior Bank of England policymaker has warned that financial markets are expecting too many interest rate cuts this year and that the UK central bank is unlikely to move before the US Federal Reserve. Catherine Mann, an external member of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), said there were risks that UK inflation could persist at higher levels than in the US or the eurozone. City traders are pricing in three quarter-point interest rate cuts this year, with a possible first downward shift from as early as May or June. Money markets give a 20% chance of a cut in May, before the Fed or the European Central Bank. However, dampening expectations for large interest rate cuts this year, Mann told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday: \u201cThey\u2019re pricing in too many cuts \u2013 that would be my personal view \u2013 and so in some sense, I don\u2019t have to cut because the market already is.\u201d \u201cWage dynamics in the UK are stronger and more persistent than the wage dynamics in either the US or the euro area,\u201d she said. \u201cUnderlying services dynamics are also stickier more persistent than either the US or the euro area. So on that basis, it\u2019s hard to argue that the BoE would be ahead of the other two regions, particularly the US.\u201d Mann last week voted with most of the MPC to hold interest rates at the current level of 5.25%, switching from her previous stance as one of the nine-member panel\u2019s toughest advocates for a further rise in borrowing costs. The Bank\u2019s policymakers said they were seeing \u201cencouraging signs\u201d of falling inflation after keeping interest rates on hold for a fifth time at the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. The Bank has been watching closely for signs that inflation is heading back towards its 2% target after a sustained period of rapid price rises. The latest official data last week showed the headline rate fell to 3.4% in February, its lowest level for two and a half years, driven in part by a slowdown in the pace of food and restaurant price rises. The Bank expects the government\u2019s fuel duty freeze and recent falls in the price of energy and food to push inflation below 2% in the second quarter. It peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. Andrew Bailey, the Bank\u2019s governor, has signalled that rate cuts will be \u201cin play\u201d at forthcoming policy meetings. He said last week he believed the central bank was \u201cnot yet at the point where we can cut interest rates, but things are moving in the right direction\u201d. Mann said she had changed her vote from a rate rise to a hold because there were signs of a slowing jobs market, with companies more reluctant to hire. However, she said financial markets pricing in deep interest rate cuts meant high street banks were already offering cheaper loans to households and businesses \u2013 doing some of the Bank\u2019s job to support the economy before it took official action on borrowing costs. \u201cThere has been a substantial easing, even since the vote last week,\u201d she said about market rates. \u201cI think that perhaps markets are a bit too complacent about how long they think the BoE overall \u2013 the MPC \u2013 will hold rates.\u201d"

A record high would be welcome news for investors in the UK stock market. But\u2026Alex Wright, portfolio manager of the Fidelity Special Situations Fund and Fidelity Special Values, says there has been \u201clittle change in the generally weak sentiment towards UK equities\u201d since the Brexit referendum in 2016. Wright adds: The strength of US equities, led by the \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 tech-related stocks, has continued to dominate the market narrative in the opening months of 2024. This can be seen in valuation multiples, with the UK trading on an estimated PE multiple of c.11x for 2024, which compares to nearly double that for US equities at over 21x, or even Europe and Japan on c.15x. Wall Street stocks are in a lacklustre mood today, after a strong week. The S&amp;P 500 has dipped by 0.1%, with Nike (-8%) dragging on the index, but still on track for its best week this year. Donald Trump has moved a step closer to collecting a $3bn windfall from his social media firm Truth Social. Shareholders in Digital World Acquisition Corporation have voted today to approve a merger with Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, the private firm that owns the Truth Social app platform. Digital World Acquisition is a special purpose acquisition company, or Spac, a vehicle floated on the stock market with the goal of buying another company. The merger would mean Trump Media would be listed on the market; and at Digital World\u2019s share price this week, it would make Trump\u2019s stake worth $3.3bn. Digital World shares have risen 140% this year, amid a meme-stock flurry of images urging people to buy its shares. This has driven its value steadily higher, even though Trump Media has posted sales of less than $5m. However, Trump wouldn\u2019t be able to cash in shares for six months, meaning the eventual value of his stake could end up being rather lower (or higher! You never really know with meme stocks..) In New York, shares in Nike have dropped 8% at the start of trading after it issued a weak sales forecast last night. Nike\u2019s shares have dropped to $92.76, having closed at $100.82 last night. The selloff somes after Nike told analysts last night it is \u201cprudently planning\u201d for revenue in the first half of fiscal 2025 to fell by a low single-digit amount, reflecting \u201ca subdued macro-outlook around the world.\u201d According to Reuters, Nike is planning to trim supplies of classic shoes such as its Air Force 1 and Pegasus, as it focuss on reviving its running shoe category. The warning came after Nike reported a small rise in revenues in the third quarter of its current financial year (ending on 29 February) John Donahoe, President &amp; CEO of NIKE, Inc, said: \u201cWe are making the necessary adjustments to drive NIKE\u2019s next chapter of growth. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve seen, as we build a multiyear cycle of new innovation, sharpen our brand storytelling and work with our wholesale partners to elevate and grow the marketplace.\u201d One of Nike\u2019s \u2018innovation\u2019s is causing a storm in the UK today, though. It\u2019s being criticised for using a multicoloured St George\u2019s Cross on the new England shirt, instead of the traditional red and white one on the shirt. Rishi Sunak has said the cross of St George should not be messed with, while Keir Starmer says the new kit should be scrapped. Nike\u2019s warning that its revenues will fall in the first half of the next financial year has knocked the leisure sector; Shares in UK retailer JD Sport are down 7% today, while Germany\u2019s Puma are down 1.8%. HSBC has brought forward its expectations for the first cut in UK interest rates to June, having previously expected the first 25 basis cut in August. It also kept its forecast of one rate cut per quarter from August onwards, which would lower Bank rate to 3.5% by the end of 2025. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, says: This shift in rate cut expectations from the Bank of England is like a red flag to a bull, and markets have rallied sharply. The FTSE 250 has also made strong gains this week, and\u2026 is only 400 points away from the record high made in 2021. Markets are relieved that this month\u2019s central bank policy decisions have not repeated the more hawkish tone of the January meetings, says Raffi Boyadjian, lead investment analyst at XM: Shares on Wall Street are headed for strong weekly gains following the conclusion of the March central bank meetings that cemented rate cut expectations for 2024. After the European Central Bank paved the way for lower rates at the beginning of the month, the Federal Reserve and Bank of England became the latest this week to not push back on market bets for a series of rate reductions later this year. The Swiss National Bank went a step further and announced a surprise 25-basis-point cut, becoming the first major central bank to commence with an easing cycle, and even the Bank of Japan\u2019s much-anticipated exit from negative rates turned out to be a dovish hike. Britain\u2019s blue-chip share index is climbing towards its alltime high this morning, as hopes build that interest rates will be cut this year. The FTSE 100 index has jumped by 64 points, or 0.8%, to 7947 points, adding to the 145 points it jumped yesterday \u2013 its best day in over a year. The Footsie has now gained over 4% since the start of March. It is now just 1.2%, or 100 points, away from the all-time high of 8,047 points set in February 2023. It\u2019s part of a global stock market rally, which saw Japan\u2019s Nikkei hit record highs this week, and the main US share indices also hit record levels. The prospect of cuts to UK interest rates this year \u2013 hinted at by the Bank of England governor \u2013 are cheering traders, as lower borrowing costs should stimulate the economy. But it\u2019s a wider issue too \u2013 the US Federal Reserve lifted markets on Wednesday by sticking to its forecast of three rate cuts this year. Yesterday, Switzerland got the rate cut ball rolling by unexpectedly lowering its policy rate, after its inflation rate fell. Neil Wilson, analyst at Markets.com, says there is a definite sense that central banks are prepared to tolerate higher inflation and are ready to cut \u2013 or already have. He adds: Suppressing yields and pushing up inflation has been their stated aim for well over a decade. Now they have it and want to keep it \u2013 hiking interest rates into the oblivion of unemployment and recession was never the plan. Interestingly, the Nikkei rallied despite the Bank of Japan bucking the trend and raising rates this month, out of negative territory. In the foreign exchange markets, the pound continues to trade at its lowest level since the start of the month, down three quarters of a cent at $1.258. Newsflash: Russia\u2019s central bank has left interest rates on hold, at 16%. At the end of a busy week for central banks, the Bank of Russia says it maintained borrowing costs as inflationary pressures \u201cgradually ease but remain high\u201d. It says: Domestic demand is still outstripping the capabilities to expand the production of goods and services. Labour market tightness has increased again. For the moment, it is premature to judge the pace of future disinflationary trends. Russian inflation rose to a one-year high of 7.7% in February. The Bank of Russia says it expects annual inflation will fall to between 4% and 4.5% in 2024, and stabilise close to its 4% target further on. In the car sector, luxury automaker Aston Martin has named Bentley head Adrian Hallmark as its new CEO to replace Amedeo Felisa. Hallmark becomes the third CEO of Aston Martin since its largest shareholder, Lawrence Stroll, took over the carmaker in 2020. Hallmark will join Aston Martin by 1 October, with Felisa \u2013 who turns 78 in October \u2013 staying on until his replacement arrives. Stroll says: \u201cWhen Amedeo was appointed CEO, I spoke of him leading a new phase of growth and development. Two years on, we have delivered on that promise, as we near completion of our thrilling new product portfolio and move closer to our vision of becoming the world\u2019s most desirable, ultra-luxury British performance brand.\u201d Shares in Aston Martin are up 1% this morning at 172p, but have dropped by almost a quarter so far this year. Five years ago, they were worth around \u00a325. Last year, Aston Martin\u2019s pre-tax losses narrowed to \u00a3239.8m, from \u00a3495m in 2022. On an adjusted EBITDA basis, earnings rose to \u00a3305.9m from \u00a3190.2m Bentley, which is owned by Germany\u2019s Volkswagen, make operating profits of \u20ac589m (\u00a3502m) last year. It has benefitted from the boom in the world\u2019s richest people opt to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds to personalise their vehicles: Over in Germany, business morale has picked up. The IFO institute\u2019s business climate index has risen this month, to 87.8 points, up from 85.5 and higher than expected. Companies\u2019 expectations were less pessimistic in March, while their assessments of the current business situation also improved. Ifo president Clemens Fuest says: \u201cThe German economy glimpses light on the horizon.\u201d The planned merger between Vodafone and Three UK, which would create the UK\u2019s largest mobile phone operator, has been referred to an in-depth investigation by the competition regulator. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it intended to refer the deal to a more detailed phase 2 investigation amid concerns that mobile customers could face higher prices and reduced quality. The merger combines two of the four mobile network operators in the UK and will bring 27 million customers under a single network provider, leapfrogging EE, owned by BT, and Virgin Media O2, owned by Spain\u2019s Telef\u00f3nica and the US-listed company Liberty Global. The CMA had already carried out an initial phase 1 investigation looking at whether the deal might lead to a \u201csubstantial lessening of competition\u201d and said on Friday it had identified concerns that the transaction could lead to higher prices for customers and lower investment in UK mobile networks. Shares in pub chain JD Wetherspoon have dropped by 6% this morning, after it revealed sales growth has slowed. JD reported that like-for-like sales grew by 9.9% in the 26 weeks to 28 January, with pre-tax profits swelling by 682% to \u00a336m, from \u00a34.6m a year before. But growth since the end of January has slowed, with like-for-like sales up 5.8% in the last seven weeks. The recovery in sales comes after pandemic restrictions were eased, but Wetherspoon\u2019s chairman Tim Martin remains concerned about Covid-19, telling shareholders: \u201cSales continue to improve. In the last 7 weeks, to 17 March 2024, like-for-like sales increased by 5.8%. The company continues to be concerned about the possibility of further lockdowns and about the efficacy of the government enquiry into the pandemic, which will not be concluded for several years. Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, says today\u2019s results are impressive, but growth has taken a step down. Nathan explains: \u201cPub Chain J D Wetherspoon\u2019s half year results tell a story of an impressive recovery. But the strong operating profit growth reflects the low-base to which this set of numbers were compared to. At under 7%, margins are still pretty thin and there was little in the statement to help see where an improvement might come from. The Group\u2019s been steadily reducing and optimising its footprint and has a good record of outperforming its peers. A lot of capacity has come out of the market and the hint that there might be potential of about 1,000 pubs compared to a current total of 814, could see the estate start to grow again. That may see the return of dividends kicked further down the road. Location is key and recent openings include the Stargazer at the old Millenium Dome in Greenwich and the Star Light at Heathrow Airport. Overall, returning the estate to growth could be a welcome development. But there\u2019s only so much you can grow if pub numbers remain static, and for now like-for-like growth has taken a step down. 5.8% isn\u2019t awful but if it stays at this level for the rest of the year the market\u2019s likely to be disappointed.\u201d JD Wetherspoon\u2019s shares are the second-biggest faller on the FTSE 250 index this morning, with investors giving scant appreciation for a 1930% increase in earnings per share in the six months to the end of January. The weaker pound is helping to push share prices up in London. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has risen over 7,900 points for the first time since last April, up 25 points this morning at 7,907. But, JD Sports shares are weighing on the index. They\u2019re down 3.8% after sportswear maker Nike warned last night that its revenues will shrink slightly in the first half of its 2025 financial year. Ouch. The pound has now dropped below the $1.26 level, as rate cut expectations weigh on the currency. Sterling has now hit $1.2582, the lowest since 20 February. Morgan Stanley predict the Bank of England will cut interest rates by a whole percentage point during 2024, which would bring Base Rate down from 5.25% to 4.25%. In a research note this morning, following yesterday\u2019s BoE rate decision, they say: For the first time since September 2021, there were no votes for hikes at an MPC meeting. The guidance was unchanged, but the minutes offered some interesting (dovish) shifts. We leave our call unchanged \u2013 May start, 100bp of cuts this year \u2013 but continue to acknowledge the risks of a later move. That said, after today, we have somewhat greater conviction that \u201clater\u201d means June and not August. The key question, they add, is how many BoE members are very close to voting for a cut already, and how many require more than just one set of data prints to move. The latter camp almost certainly includes [Catherine] Mann and [Jonathan] Haskel. for example, and [Megan] Greene, too. Indeed, with his term expiring in August, Haskel will almost certainly not vote for a cut in this cycle. [Mann and Haskel both gave up voting for interest rate rises at this week\u2019s meeting, meaning eight of the nine MPC members voted for no change.] The pound has dropped to a three-week low this morning, as City traders anticipate cuts to UK interest rates soon. Sterling has lost half a cent against the US dollar this morning, to trade just above $1.26, the lowest since 1 March, adding to yesterday\u2019s losses. The dire wet weather that hit the UK last month hit spending in stores, as consumers avoided getting a soaking on the high street. Heather Bovill, the ONS\u2019s senior statistician, says: Many shops told us that an extremely wet February reduced in-store sales. But with people staying indoors, we saw a boost of 2.1% on the amount spent online. February was certainly soggy; the south of England had its wettest February on record, in a series going back to 1836, according to Met Office data. Just in: retail sales volumes across Great Britain stagnated in February, new data shows. The Office for National Statistics has reported that sales volumes were flat last month, following the strong 3.6% growth in January, after December\u2019s slump. That\u2019s slightly stronger than expected, with economists forecasting a 0.3% drop in February. The ONS says: Sales volumes in clothing and department stores grew because of new collections but falls in food stores and fuel retailers offset this growth. Meanwhile online sales increased, particularly for clothing retailers, as wet weather affected footfall. On an annual basis, volumes were 0.4% lower than a year ago, and were 1.3% below their pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic level in February 2020. More broadly, sales volumes fell by 0.4% in the three months to February 2024 when compared with the previous three months. And on an annual basis, retail sales volumes were 1.0% lower than in the quarter to February 2023. UK consumer confidence stalled in negative territory this month, but people are slightly more positive about their own finances. The GfK consumer confidence index remained at -21 in March, unchanged from February, amid pessimism over the economic situation. But households have turned positive about the outlook for their personal finances for the first time in more than two years. GfK\u2019s index of personal finances over the next 12 months rose by two points at +2, which is 23 points higher than this time last year. Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, says the improved Personal Finance measure is encouraging, adding: This is welcome news given the challenges faced by Britons of fiscal drag, higher costs for fuel, rising council taxes and utilities eroding any increases in wages or other income. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the economy. A day after leaving UK interest rates on hold again, the governor of the Bank of England has dropped a hint that cuts are coming. Andrew Bailey has declared that rate cuts will be \u201cin play\u201d at future meetings of the BoE Monetary Policy Committee amid signs that tighter policy had quelled the risk of a wage-price spiral. The Bank has been worried for many months that inflationary expectations will become embedded in the economy. But in an upbeat interview with the Financial Times, Bailey says: \u201cIt\u2019s like the Sherlock Holmes dog that doesn\u2019t bark. If the second-round effects don\u2019t come through, that\u2019s good because monetary policy has done its job. We have an increasingly positive story to tell on that.\u201d Bailey pointed out that the global shocks that pushed up UK inflation to the highest since the 1970s are now unwinding. He was speaking after the BoE left interest rates at 5.25%, with two BoE policymakers dropping their calls for even higher borrowing costs. The Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-1, with Swati Dhingra continuing to vote, alone, for a cut in rates. The financial markets now predict the first cut will come by June, with a cut at the next meeting in May seen as a 23% chance, according to the money markets this morning. Some economists think the Bank could wait until August to start cutting. At least three quarter-point rate cuts are priced in by the end of the year. Gabriella Dickens, G7 economist at AXA Investment Managers, says: A decision of when to ease will be finely balanced between June and August, but on balance we now see the first move as more likely in June. We continue to expect two further 25 basis points (bps) cuts in November and December. Bailey told the FT that he feels it is \u201cnot unreasonable\u201d for the financial markets to expect rate cuts this year. And, ssked if all the upcoming MPC meetings were live when it comes to possible policy moves, he confirmed: \u201cAll our meetings are in play. We take a fresh decision every time.\u201d Hopes of global interest rate cuts this year triggered a market rally yesterday \u2013 with the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 jumping 1.9% to a near one-year high. Wall Street hit record highs, again.

            "date": "2024-03-12T22:00:04Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s economy is experiencing another \u201cvery soft quarter\u201d of growth, all but ruling out another interest rate rise by the Reserve Bank despite inflation easing at a slower pace, said Steven Halmarick, CBA\u2019s chief economist. CommBank\u2019s household spending index, which is based on the outlays of about seven million CBA customers, fell 0.3% in February to 141.6 points. The tally was lower than in November, indicating spending over summer shrank. The decline last month came despite a splurge on concerts, including seven by US star Taylor Swift. Spending at music festivals was up 76% from January, while transactions at function and event centres, such as on merchandise, leapt 115%. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201c[T]he jump in hospitality and recreation spending wasn\u2019t enough to offset weakness across seven of the 12 categories of the index, which paints a picture of consumers cutting back,\u201d Halmarick said. Queensland was the only state to report an increase in spending in February 2024 \u2013 despite not hosting a Swift concert. From a year earlier, national spending was up 3.5%, or roughly in line with inflation. Halmarick said the November interest rate rise by the Reserve Bank started to take effect for many borrowers last month. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be another very soft quarter [for GDP growth], which combined with the deceleration in inflation makes us increasingly confident that the RBA rate hikes are done and the next move is down.\u201d The RBA board meets for a second time in 2024 next Monday and Tuesday. Financial markets were rating a 25 basis-point cut in the cash rate to 4.1% as about a one-in-10 chance. CBA continues to pencil the first rate cut to land in September. Australia\u2019s economy expanded 0.2% in the December quarter, slowing from 0.3% in the previous three months, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said last week. A similar pace can be expected for the first half of 2024, Halmarick said, adding the RBA would likely wait until it got the March quarter inflation figures \u2013 scheduled for release on 24 April \u2013 before deciding whether to remove its tightening bias or not. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said last week the latest GDP figures showed \u201cthe balance of risks in our economy is shifting from inflation to growth\u201d, stoking expectations the federal budget to be released on 14 May will include extra spending measures. Chalmers received an indirect endorsement of his performance from his predecessor, Josh Frydenberg, at an AFR business summit in Sydney on Tuesday. Some households were \u201churting, no doubt\u201d given the many interest rate rises and the cost of living. The RBA, though, had likely hit peak interest rates and inflation was heading down, Frydenberg, now chair of the local operations of Goldman Sachs, said. Unemployment might tick up but \u201cit\u2019s still relatively low\u201d, he said. \u201cOverall, I think the economy is in pretty good shape.\u201d NAB\u2019s monthly business survey, out on Tuesday, also showed the economy was remaining \u201cresilient\u201d as conditions improved last month to be back above the long-run average. \u201c[I]t is really too early to say if this is just a temporary lift or the beginning of a more meaningful turnaround,\u201d Alan Oster, NAB\u2019s chief economist, said. \u201cConditions look very robust in some of the services sectors such as transport, recreation and personal services, finance, business and property,\u201d Oster said. \u201cOn the other hand, retail and construction both look fairly weak, which reflects direct exposure to the high level of interest rates.\u201d One asset that has withstood higher interest rates has been housing. The value of the nation\u2019s dwellings rose almost 2% \u2013 or $196.8bn \u2013 in the final three months of 2023, to just shy of $10.4tn, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday. All states and territories saw a pickup in values, with NSW dwellings worth almost $1.2m on average. By contrast, those in Victoria came in at $895,000 on average, with those in all regions except the ACT lower still, underscoring the relatively high housing cost pressures in Sydney and elsewhere in NSW."

            "content": "Australian borrowers have been granted another reprieve by the Reserve Bank but should not expect an early rate cut because the war against inflation \u201cisn\u2019t yet won\u201d, governor Michele Bullock said. The RBA board left its cash rate unchanged at a 12-year high of 4.35% after its second two-day gathering of 2024 concluded on Tuesday afternoon. The result was widely expected by economists. \u201cWe\u2019re making progress in our fight against inflation but it does remain high,\u201d Bullock told journalists at a post-decision media conference in Sydney. \u201cRecent data suggests we are on the right track but the interest rate path that best ensures we bring inflation down to target remains uncertain.\u201d The central bank has left itself the option of raising interest rates again if necessary as the risks to the outlook are \u201cfinely balanced\u201d, Bullock said. \u201cWhile recent data indicate that inflation is easing, it remains high,\u201d the RBA said in a statement. \u201cThe board expects that it will be some time yet before inflation is sustainably in the target range [of 2%-3%].\u201d \u201cThe path of interest rates that will best ensure that inflation returns to target in a reasonable timeframe remains uncertain and the board is not ruling anything in or out,\u201d it said. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, told parliament the decision was \u201ca reflection of the good progress we\u2019re making as a country in the fight against inflation\u201d. \u201cIt gives us confidence that inflation is moderating in welcome and encouraging ways,\u201d he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Australia\u2019s interest rates started rising later than many similar economies as the central bank sought to stem inflation that peaked in the December quarter of 2022 at 7.8%. The RBA targets prices to rise between 2% and 3% a year. The economy all but stalled at the end of 2023, with GDP expanding just 0.2% for the December quarter. Excluding population growth, economic activity per person contracted 1% from a year earlier, the worst result outside the Covid pandemic period since the 1990s. Before today\u2019s decision, economists such as Timo Henckel, the chair of the Australian National University\u2019s shadow RBA board, said the central bank would likely hold rates steady until it was \u201creally sure\u201d inflation would fall to its target range by mid-2025. Henckel noted inflation in the US had fallen \u201cbut that easing seems to have stalled a little bit\u201d, a trend that would likely make the RBA cautious about acting too soon to cut interest rates here. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong case and push to keep [rates] on hold.\u201d While some households were definitely enduring difficult conditions, \u201cothers were doing really well\u201d, he said. While the unemployment rate had lately climbed to 4.1%, the labour market was \u201cstill travelling by historical standards reasonably well\u201d, Henckel said. February jobs figures are scheduled to be released on Thursday. Market reaction saw the dollar ease slightly against the US dollar to 65.5 US cents, while stocks added to gains to be about 0.3% higher for the day. Bullock said the board needed \u201cgreater confidence\u201d that inflation remained firmly on course to reach the mid-point of 2.5% by 2026. Her comments implied the RBA did not consider a rate cut at the meeting since demand in the economy continued to exceed supply. That said, the unemployment rate remained \u201cfirmly on the board\u2019s radar\u201d, she said. \u201cWe think monetary policy is slightly restrictive,\u201d she said, adding that it was too early to say when the RBA would end that tightening. One reason why demand continued to exceed supply in the economy was the \u201celevated\u201d level of population growth, she said. As to setting interest rates at a level that did not allow unemployment to rise above a \u201csustainable\u201d rate, \u201call we can do is to tread carefully\u201d, Bullock said. A financial stability review out on Friday will also look at market conditions, including \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d from rising asset prices in Australia and elsewhere. The RBA noted the outlook remained \u201chighly uncertain\u201d, and the board remained \u201chighly attentive to inflation risks\u201d. China\u2019s economy and conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East were among the uncertainties. \u201cEmployment is expected to continue to grow moderately and the unemployment rate and the broader underutilisation rate are expected to increase a bit further,\u201d the statement said. EY\u2019s chief economist Cherelle Murphy said the RBA had \u201ctoned down its language ever so slightly\u201d. Murphy said the RBA would get first-quarter consumer price inflation on 24 April, in time for the board\u2019s next meeting on 6-7 May. \u201cA rate cut by the third quarter is far from a done deal in our view,\u201d Murphy said. The decision to hold rates steady may add to confidence for buyers in the property market, Tim Lawless, the research director at CoreLogic Asia Pacific, said prior to today\u2019s decision. \u201cFollowing the 6.2% rise in the February consumer sentiment reading from Westpac and the Melbourne Institute, a further lift in confidence could be accompanied by a rise in home purchasing,\u201d Lawless said. \u201cThis could add to housing demand that has already remained quite resilient despite the higher interest rate environment and cost-of-living pressures.\u201d"

            "content": "Good morning. I know what you\u2019re thinking: AI again?! Though it can feel tiresome, there is a reason behind all of the fervour this technology creates. AI, a term that encompasses a number of emergent tools inspired by human intelligence, has the potential to redefine and transform almost all aspects of life. From personalised medicine to increased powers in policing, AI has become increasingly integrated in the way society functions, bringing with it a slew of malign side effects that have only recently become apparent. Scientists have been working on AI for decades, and that is where the story starts in the new Guardian podcast Black Box: at its genesis 50 years ago. The seven-episode series illuminates what in reality is an incredibly complex and at times impenetrable tech story through human experiences. The second episode, in which host Michael Safi and producers Alex Atack and Joshua Kelly search for the creators of deepfake porn app ClothOff, is an amazing listen. You can subscribe to the podcast here. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke with Joshua Kelly and Prof Lilian Edwards, a leading academic in the field of internet law, about the way artificial intelligence is shaping society and how it could be regulated in the future. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories Extremism | Leading counter-terror experts and three former Conservative home secretaries have warned against using extremism to score political points, as the communities secretary, Michael Gove, prepares to announce his controversial new anti-extremism plan. Critics say a new definition of extremism risks exacerbating community tensions and leaves ministers open to legal challenge. Portugal | The leader of Portugal\u2019s centre-right Democratic Alliance, Luis Montenegro, has claimed victory after a closely contested parliamentary election that saw the far-right surge. Montenegro reiterated his election promise not to rely on far-right party Chega, although it was unclear if he could govern without their support. UK news | A man and woman have been arrested on suspicion of prevention of lawful and decent burial after police removed 34 bodies from a funeral parlour in Hull. Concerns had been raised about \u201cstorage and management processes relating to care of the deceased\u201d at Legacy Independent Funeral Directors. Monarchy | The first official photograph of the Princess of Wales to be released after her abdominal surgery two months ago has been recalled by some of the world\u2019s biggest picture agencies over concerns that the image had been manipulated. Kensington Palace declined to comment. Oscars | Christopher Nolan\u2019s blockbuster Oppenheimer has taken home seven Academy awards. Cillian Murphy was named best actor and Robert Downey Jr best supporting actor. Nolan picked up his first best director Oscar. The film also won for editing, cinematography and score. Emma Stone won best actress for her role in Poor Things. See more Oscars coverage below. In depth: \u2018There\u2019s no accountability in this space\u2019 Initially, the team behind Black Box cast a wide net into the world of AI in order to draw out some themes and areas of particular interest. What they ended up finding was \u201cthe early days of a collision between a new technology and the existing shape of society\u201d, Joshua says. *** A case in Spain One of the biggest challenges that has emerged from this technology is AI-driven synthetic media, more commonly referred to as deepfake technology. Deepfakes have become more sophisticated over the past decade, with AI making it easier than ever to produce convincing fake images and videos. In Black Box, the team went to Spain to report on how this technology has caused mayhem in a small rural town, after parents realised that teenage boys were creating nude and explicit images of their female classmates on an AI app called ClothOff. \u201cWe imagined that a single person, like maybe a sad guy in his basement, was making a little bit of money off the app but we realised it was much more sophisticated than that,\u201d Joshua says. Those who run ClothOff likely run other similar apps, and over the course of their reporting Joshua noticed an increasing number of them. The supply is meeting a growing demand: ClothOff alone had more than 700,000 subscribers on its Telegram channel and 12m views in the last three months. Joshua adds that ClothOff was brazen about its rapid growth: \u201cThey told us their value had doubled since we first started talking to them in autumn.\u201d Back in Spain the local authorities in the rural town didn\u2019t know how to deal with the problem: those using the app were all minors, which complicated criminal prosecution, and those who created the app were operating from a foreign country. \u201cWe wondered if it was true that there\u2019s no accountability in this space,\u201d Joshua says. *** Who is regulating AI? As the consequences of artificial intelligence grow clearer and more existential with every passing day, there has been a growing concerted effort to put up safeguards. Different countries are taking different approaches. Here are a few of the biggest players: EU: The European Union has been the leading player on the global stage when it comes to AI regulation. The bloc recently passed the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA), the world\u2019s first such comprehensive law, which comes into effect in 2025. It includes new rules on the use of facial recognition technology in public places by the police, large generative models like ChatGPT and many other aspects of AI. Even though it is now \u201cthe gold standard model in the world\u201d, Lilian Edwards says that the AIA is still fairly limited. US: The AIA has \u201cspooked\u201d the US, Edwards says, because it forces American companies that are trying to sell in the EU, the second largest market in the world, to meet its standards. \u201cIt\u2019s effectively a kind of legal land grab by the EU,\u201d Edwards adds. This, coupled with a president who has made it a priority to rein in big tech companies, has changed the tenor of the conversation in the US, which has historically been extremely anti-regulation when it comes to tech. True to his word, Biden issued an ambitious executive order that purportedly took on the safe deployment of AI in October and has given more power to NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology. UK: In short, the UK\u2019s stance is to do nothing. The government wants to be the \u201cSingapore of tech\u201d, Edwards says, and so has taken an anti-regulatory, \u201cpro-innovation\u201d stance with the hopes that Silicon Valley giants will come flocking to Britain, though, so far, not much has happened. China: China is already one of the world leaders in AI research and has been trying to tackle head on what that could mean for its society. It has spearheaded a vertical legislation approach, meaning that instead of pushing through one very broad law like the AIA, the Chinese government has been trying to regulate individual aspects of AI. *** Are we all doomed? The evolving nature of AI will be challenging to regulate within institutions that are by nature slow moving, but Edwards believes that the difficulty can be overblown. Not only are politicians and regulators creating new legislation in many countries, there are also existing legal frameworks that can and do protect people from AI. \u201cCopyright and privacy laws and the rules of product liability, consumer protection and consumer safety, all already exist. When you apply this huge amount of existing law to novel technologies, sometimes it works and sometimes you get snagging problems that you have to amend and change,\u201d Edwards says, but that does not mean that the situation is a total free for all. The longer it takes though, the more harrowing the consequences could be. In the small Spanish town at least 20 girls between the ages of 11 and 17 had deepfake nude images created of them, and the effects were profound and devastating. \u201cSome of the girls felt they were unable to leave their homes, their academic performances were dropping, they were suffering from anxiety attacks,\u201d Joshua says. And this was just one group of children, in one place, who used one app. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising if, this time next year, there were 10 times as many [of these apps] that are even more powerful than what we\u2019re seeing now.\u201d For more on AI and how tech is changing the world around us, click here to get Alex Hern\u2019s TechScape newsletter every Tuesday What else we\u2019ve been reading There\u2019s a mountain of Oscars coverage to sate your hunger this morning: Peter Bradshaw\u2019s view of \u201can Oscars night with a British accent \u2013 and no real upsets\u201d, a round-up of the most entertaining viral moments, pictures from the ceremony and the best red carpet looks (including an Ariana Grande outfit memorably described as \u201cbring your duvet to work day\u201d), and a full list of winners.

            "date": "2024-03-27T05:00:42Z",
            "content": "Almost 8 million UK jobs could be lost to artificial intelligence in a \u201cjobs apocalypse\u201d, according to a report warning that women, younger workers and those on lower wages are at most risk from automation. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said that entry level, part-time and administrative jobs were most exposed to being replaced by AI under a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d for the rollout of new technologies in the next three to five years. The thinktank warned that the UK was facing a \u201csliding doors\u201d moment as growing numbers of companies adopt generative AI technologies \u2013 which can read and create text, data and software code \u2013 to automate everyday workplace tasks. The report said this first wave of AI adoption was already putting jobs at risk as growing numbers of companies introduce the technology. However, a second wave could lead to the automation of more jobs amid rapid advances in AI. Analysing 22,000 tasks in the economy covering every type of job, the IPPR said 11% of tasks currently done by workers were at risk. This could, though, increase to 59% of tasks in the second wave as technologies develop to handle increasingly complex processes. It said routine cognitive tasks \u2013 including database management, scheduling and stocktaking \u2013 were already at risk, with potential to displace entry level and part-time jobs in secretarial work, administration and customer services. However, the second wave of AI adoption could impact non-routine tasks involving the creation of databases, copywriting and graphic design, which would affect increasingly higher earning jobs. Women would be significantly more affected, as \u201cthey are more likely to work in the most exposed occupations, such as secretarial and administrative occupations\u201d, the IPPR said. In the worst-case scenario for the second wave of AI, 7.9m jobs could be displaced, the report said, with any gains for the economy from productivity improvements cancelled out with zero growth in GDP within three to five years. In a best-case scenario for full augmentation of the workforce with generative AI, no jobs would be lost, while the size of the economy could be increased by 4%, or about \u00a392bn a year. Sounding the alarm over the impact on workers, the left-of-centre thinktank said government action could prevent a \u201cjobs apocalypse\u201d, and help to harness the power of AI to boost economic growth and raise living standards. Carsten Jung, senior economist at IPPR, said: \u201cAlready existing generative AI could lead to big labour market disruption or it could hugely boost economic growth. Either way, it is set to be a gamechanger for millions of us. \u201cBut technology isn\u2019t destiny and a jobs apocalypse is not inevitable \u2013 government, employers and unions have the opportunity to make crucial design decisions now that ensure we manage this new technology well. If they don\u2019t act soon, it may be too late.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-06T12:00:38Z",
            "content": "When Ty landed an introductory phone interview with a finance and banking company last month, they assumed it would be a quick chat with a recruiter. And when they got on the phone, Ty assumed the recruiter, who introduced herself as Jaime, was human. But things got robotic. \u201cThe voice sounded similar to Siri,\u201d said Ty, who is 29 and lives in the DC metro area. \u201cIt was creepy.\u201d Ty realized they weren\u2019t speaking to a living, breathing person. Their interviewer was an AI system, and one with a rather rude habit. Jaime asked Ty all the right questions \u2013 what\u2019s your management style? are you a good fit for this role? \u2013 but she wouldn\u2019t let Ty fully answer them. \u201cAfter cutting me off, the AI would respond, \u2018Great! Sounds good! Perfect!\u2019 and move on to the next question,\u201d Ty said. \u201cAfter the third or fourth question, the AI just stopped after a short pause and told me that the interview was completed and someone from the team would reach out later.\u201d (Ty asked that their last name not be used because their current employer doesn\u2019t know they\u2019re looking for a job.) A survey from Resume Builder released last summer found that by 2024, four in 10 companies would use AI to \u201ctalk with\u201d candidates in interviews. Of those companies, 15% said hiring decisions would be made with no input from a human at all. As Laura Michelle Davis wrote for CNET: \u201cToday, it\u2019s not uncommon for applicants to be rejected by a robot before they\u2019re connected with an actual human in human resources.\u201d To make the grueling process of getting hired even more demoralizing, many people are afraid generative AI \u2013 which uses data sets to create text, video, audio, images and yes, robo-recruiters \u2013 will take our jobs altogether. But could AI help us find a new gig in the meantime? The human element is lost Ask an employer who uses AI in their hiring process about the choice, and they\u2019ll share a common refrain: these systems are used to cross quotidian tasks off a recruiter\u2019s daily schedule; AI helps weed through the top 1,000 applicants, but once you get to the top 10, it\u2019s a strictly human process. In 2019, ZipRecruiter noted that AI systems could streamline boring tasks \u2013 like writing job descriptions or scanning r\u00e9sum\u00e9s \u2013 and give hiring professionals \u201cback time to spend on more strategic tasks\u201d. (Imagine how it feels to be on the other side, applying to dozens of jobs a day.) A survey conducted in 2020, sponsored by the AI interview system Sapia.ai, found that 55% of companies were increasing investment in automated recruiting measures. \u201cI do not use AI to write job descriptions, but I know many employers who do,\u201d said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. Pollak said that a manager might also ask an AI program to give them a list of reasons why they should, or should not, hire a final-round candidate. \u201cEmployers use it as a coach, as a guide, as a friend to bounce ideas off,\u201d she added. But, as applicants like Ty now know, employers\u2019 use of AI goes beyond it being a sounding board. Experts advise applicants to act as though they\u2019re speaking to a human during AI-led interviews, although that\u2019s easier said than done. Adele Walton, a 24-year-old journalist and content creator from Brighton, England, recently sat through an AI interview that felt extremely unnatural. \u201cI expected a person or a panel,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I clicked on the call, I was surprised to enter a chat room with just myself.\u201d Questions flashed on a screen that also showed her own face. Walton had 60 seconds to answer. \u201cI was looking at how my face was moving, looking at how I looked on screen,\u201d she said. \u201cAs someone who\u2019s struggled with body dysmorphia, I found that my face was an unnecessary distraction in the interview process. I know I would have done better if there was another person there.\u201d Walton did not get another interview. \u201cIn an in-person meeting, you get more social prompts from the other person,\u201d she said. \u201cIn this case, I was just talking to myself \u2013 or an AI system \u2013 with no measure of how well I was doing. I couldn\u2019t read anyone\u2019s face, body language, or see them nod yes. That small type of human reassurance that you get in a real interview is completely lost when companies outsource interviews to AI.\u201d Applicants are gaming the system If employers use AI to make their hiring process easier, why shouldn\u2019t applicants? That\u2019s Fanta-Marie Tour\u00e9\u2019s mindset. The 24-year-old, who lives in Atlanta and works in cybersecurity, has used AI tools to tailor her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, write cover letters and even auto-apply to jobs. She does this through a program called Massive. \u201cIt\u2019s very expensive to hire someone to help you with your r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d Tour\u00e9 said. \u201cA lot of people charge $150 an hour to do r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reviews. That\u2019s a lot, so why not use a tool that costs me maybe $30 a month?\u201d Tour\u00e9 maintains that it\u2019s still important to \u201cpersonalize\u201d application materials \u2013 adding relevant anecdotes, for example. \u201cOtherwise, everybody who uses AI is getting the same result,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to tweak.\u201d Sometimes, supposed hacks on how to game the AI recruitment process hit social media. A few years ago, Tour\u00e9 heard one trick: a TikTok creator advised applicants to copy and paste a job description on to their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, and then change the font of that description to a tiny size that matched the r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u2019s white background. A human wouldn\u2019t be able to see it, but AI would scan it, recognize the text verbatim and send it to the front of the pack. Or so the theory went. \u201cI never got any hits from that,\u201d Tour\u00e9 said. \u201cThat was a couple of years ago, and I bet the systems are smarter now.\u201d It\u2019s a move that\u2019s familiar to Pollak, the ZipRecruiter economist. \u201cThat tactic has been used so widely that most job site algorithms now know to penalize it. Don\u2019t try to be too smart with your r\u00e9sum\u00e9: if a match is too close, it will be kicked out.\u201d According to Pollak, employers are more suspicious of AI-generated r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and cover letters these days. \u201cI\u2019m hearing that employers are now discounting a lot of the information they receive that\u2019s in written form, and want to get to a face-to-face conversation as quickly as possible with the candidates so they can properly vet them,\u201d she explained. Even on video interviews \u2013 with humans or robots \u2013 applicants can still call on AI programs to assist. Michael G is the founder of Final Round AI, an \u201cinterview co-pilot\u201d that listens to recruiters\u2019 questions and prompts personalized answers in real time, based on the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and cover letter uploaded by the interviewee. (Michael asked that his last name not be used because Final Round AI is still in \u201cstealth mode\u201d, a startup\u2019s temporary state of secretiveness to quell competition.) \u201cUsers can quickly glance through the AI\u2019s response, and then develop their own response to the question,\u201d Michael said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they need to read the text verbatim off the screen. It\u2019s natural: you have celebrities, TV hosts looking at teleprompters all the time. Why can\u2019t ordinary people use a teleprompter?\u201d According to Michael, Final Round AI has over half a million users, some of whom send him job offers they credit in part to the service. (That\u2019s tough to factcheck \u2013 Final Round AI has less than 2,000 followers across its social platforms.) Michael added that about 40% of users come from the tech industry, and 30% work in the banking or finance fields. The cost to use it can range from $0 to $100 a month. Michael says all personal data is deleted at the end of the call, but generally, AI systems learn from the data they are fed over time. Is it cheating? \u201cI believe that because of AI, there are new boundaries and it\u2019s hard to define whether someone is cheating or not,\u201d Michael said, somewhat terrifyingly. \u201cAnd, if I were an employer, I would prefer candidates who know how to use AI, because they bring value and a productivity boost to the company.\u201d Michael said he used Final Round AI at points while answering questions for this interview; yes, you could tell. Who\u2019s hit the hardest by AI hiring? AI systems encode bias. You don\u2019t need to be a wildly imaginative person to consider how that might affect job-seekers \u2013 Amazon reportedly scrapped an in-house hiring algorithm, trained on data submitted by applicants, that favored men and penalized r\u00e9sum\u00e9s that included the word \u201cwomen\u201d. Will automated hiring processes also reject people who are not white, male and able-bodied? \u201cThe current wave of AI uses algorithms that are probabilistic models, which means they simply rely on patterns in past data to make likely predictions,\u201d said Rory Mir, associate director of community organizing at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cThe problem is, patterns in past data include the patterns which emerge from systemic bias.\u201d Racial bias is present when humans do the hiring: studies have found that hiring managers are likely to pass over names that are perceived as Black while reviewing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Pollak said that to avoid such bias, ZipRecruiter strips \u201cany kind of identifiable information\u201d like names and zip codes from r\u00e9sum\u00e9s before putting them through an AI system. But if a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 still includes education, AI systems could theoretically learn to favor applicants who went to Ivy League schools. Pollak defended the practice of retaining education because \u201cemployers do want to know something like [that]\u201d. Higher-ups in the corporate world rarely apply for jobs \u2013 at a certain pay grade, you network instead. Mir believes that early-stage or low-level applicants will \u201cbear the brunt\u201d of AI hiring: \u201cAI won\u2019t pick a CEO. It might filter applicants for management, and it may have the final say on hiring a gig worker,\u201d they said. \u201cAutomated hiring will have an outsized impact on marginalized folks who rely on more precarious lines of work.\u201d Case in point: 404 Media recently reported on a company called Paradox.ai, used by FedEx, McDonald\u2019s and the company that operates Olive Garden, which recruited people in customer and food service jobs with a \u201clong and bizarre personality quiz\u201d illustrated with \u201cblue humanoid aliens\u201d. The goal was to discover how candidates \u201crank in terms of \u2018agreeableness\u2019 and \u2018emotional stability\u2019\u201d. Ty never heard back from anyone at the company after speaking with its AI recruiter; they assume they won\u2019t. They aren\u2019t surprised that the interview process is becoming more artificial. \u201cI\u2019ve been in interviews where human recruiters ask me directly how I feel about using apps like ChatGPT for creative work, and if I would feel comfortable doing that at my job,\u201d they said. \u201cSo I guess it was only a matter of time before I got straight-up interviewed by a robot.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-10T07:00:13Z",
            "content": "In 1914, on the eve of the First World War, HG Wells published a novel about the possibilities of an even greater conflagration. The World Set Free imagines, 30 years before the Manhattan Project, the creation of atomic weapons that allow \u201ca man [to] carry about in a handbag an amount of latent energy sufficient to wreck half a city\u201d. Global war breaks out, leading to an atomic apocalypse. It takes the \u201cestablishment of a world government\u201d to bring about peace. What concerned Wells was not simply the perils of a new technology, it was also the dangers of democracy. Wells\u2019 world government was not created through democratic will but imposed as a benign dictatorship. \u201cThe governed will show their consent by silence,\u201d England\u2019s King Egbert menacingly remarks. For Wells, the \u201ccommon man\u201d was \u201ca violent fool in social and public affairs\u201d. Only an educated, scientifically minded elite could \u201csave democracy from itself\u201d. A century on, another technology provokes a similar kind of awe and fear \u2013 artificial intelligence. From the boardrooms of Silicon Valley to the backrooms of Davos, political leaders, tech moguls and academics exult in the immense benefits that AI will bring, but fear that it may also herald humanity\u2019s demise as superintelligent machines come to rule the world. And, as a century ago, at the heart of the debate are questions of democracy and social control. In 2015, the journalist Steven Levy interviewed Elon Musk and Sam Altman, two founders of OpenAI, the tech company that burst into public consciousness two years ago with the release of ChatGPT, the seemingly human-like chatbot. A galaxy of Silicon Valley heavyweights, fearful of the potential consequences of AI, created the company as a non-profit-making charitable trust with the aim of developing technology in an ethical fashion to benefit \u201chumanity as a whole\u201d. Levy quizzed Musk and Altman about the future of AI. \u201cThere\u2019s two schools of thought,\u201d Musk mused. \u201cDo you want many AIs, or a small number of AIs? We think probably many is good.\u201d \u201cIf I\u2019m Dr Evil and I use it, won\u2019t you be empowering me?\u201d Levy asked. Dr Evil is more likely to be empowered, Altman replied, if only a few people control the technology: \u201cThen we\u2019re really in a bad place.\u201d In reality, that \u201cbad place\u201d is being built by the tech companies themselves. Musk, who stepped down from OpenAI\u2019s board six years ago to develop his own AI projects, is now suing his former company for breach of contract for having put profits ahead of the public good and failing to develop AI \u201cfor the benefit of humanity\u201d. In 2019, OpenAI created a for-profit subsidiary to raise money from investors, notably Microsoft. When it released ChatGPT in 2022, the model\u2019s inner workings were kept hidden. It was necessary to be less open, Ilya Sutskever, another of OpenAI\u2019s founders and at the time the company\u2019s chief scientist, claimed in response to criticism, to prevent those with malevolent intent from using it \u201cto cause a great deal of harm\u201d. Fear of the technology has become the cover for creating a shield from scrutiny. In response to Musk\u2019s lawsuit, OpenAI published last week a series of emails between Musk and other members of the board. These make clear that from the beginning all board members agreed that \u201cOpenAI\u201d could not actually be open. As AI develops, Sutskever wrote to Musk, \u201cit will make sense to start being less open. The Open in openAI means that everyone should benefit from the fruits of AI after its [sic] built, but it\u2019s totally OK to not share the science.\u201d \u201cYup,\u201d responded Musk. Whatever his lawsuit might say, Musk is no more open to openness than other tech moguls. The legal challenge to OpenAI is more a power struggle within Silicon Valley than an attempt to bring about accountability. Wells wrote The World Set Free at a time of great political turmoil when many questioned the wisdom of extending suffrage to the working class. \u201cWas it desirable, was it even safe to entrust [the masses],\u201d the Fabian Beatrice Webb wondered, with \u201cthe ballot box, with making and controlling the Government of Great Britain with its enormous wealth and its far-flung dominions?\u201d This was the question at the heart of Wells\u2019 novel too \u2013 to whom could one entrust the future? A century later, we are again having a fierce debate about the virtues of democracy. For some, the political turmoil of recent years has been the product of too much democracy, of allowing the irrational and uneducated to make important decisions. \u201cIt is unfair to thrust on to unqualified simpletons the responsibility to take historic decisions of great complexity and sophistication,\u201d as Richard Dawkins put it after the Brexit referendum, a sentiment with which Wells would have agreed. For others, it is precisely such disdain for ordinary people that has helped create a democratic deficit in which large sections of the population feel deprived of a say in how society is run. It is a disdain that feeds into discussions of technology too. As in The World Set Free, the AI debate centres around questions not just about the technology but also about openness and control. Despite the alarmism, we are a long way from \u201csuperintelligent\u201d machines. Today\u2019s AI models, such as ChatGPT, or Claude 3, released last week by another AI company, Anthropic, are so good at predicting what should be the next word in a sequence that they can fool us into imagining they can hold a human-like conversation. They are, however, not intelligent in any human sense, have negligible understanding of the real world and are not about to extinguish humanity. The problems that AI poses are not existential, but social. From algorithmic bias to mass surveillance, from disinformation and censorship to copyright theft, our concern should not be that machines may one day exercise power over humans but that they already work in ways that reinforce inequalities and injustices, providing tools by which those in power can consolidate their authority. That is why what we might call the \u201cEgbert manoeuvre\u201d \u2013 the insistence that some technologies are so dangerous that they must be put beyond democratic pressure and controlled by a select few \u2013 is so menacing. The problem is not just Dr Evil but those who use the fear of Dr Evil to protect themselves from scrutiny. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist"

            "content": "Whether you prefer a fruity lambic or a complex Trappist, Belgian beers have long been famed for their variety, quality and heritage. Now, researchers say they have harnessed the power of artificial intelligence to make brews even better. Prof Kevin Verstrepen, of KU Leuven university, who led the research, said AI could help tease apart the complex relationships involved in human aroma perception. \u201cBeer \u2013 like most food products \u2013 contains hundreds of different aroma molecules that get picked up by our tongue and nose, and our brain then integrates these into one picture. However, the compounds interact with each other, so how we perceive one depends also on the concentrations of the others,\u201d he said. Writing in the journal Nature Communications, Verstrepen and his colleagues report how they analysed the chemical makeup of 250 commercial Belgian beers of 22 different styles including lagers, fruit beers, blonds, West Flanders ales, and non-alcoholic beers. Among the properties studied were alcohol content, pH, sugar concentration, and the presence and concentration of more than 200 different compounds involved in flavour \u2013 such as esters that are produced by yeasts and terpenoids from hops, both of which are involved in creating fruity notes. A tasting panel of 16 participants sampled and scored each of the 250 beers for 50 different attributes, such as hop flavours, sweetness, and acidity \u2013 a process that took three years. The researchers also collected 180,000 reviews of different beers from the online consumer review platform RateBeer, finding that while appreciation of the brews was biased by features such as price meaning they differed from the tasting panel\u2019s ratings, the ratings and comments relating to other features \u2013 such as bitterness, sweetness, alcohol and malt aroma \u2013 these correlated well with those from the tasting panel. \u201cTiny changes in the concentrations of chemicals can have a big impact, especially when multiple components start changing,\u201d said Verstrepen, adding that one surprise was that some substances traditionally known to be a turn-off could be positive if present in lower concentrations, and occur in combination with other aroma compounds. Using the different sets of data, the team constructed models based on machine learning \u2013 a form of AI \u2013 to predict how a beer would taste, and its appreciation, based on its composition. They then used the results to enhance an existing commercial beer, essentially spiking it with substances flagged by the models as being important predictors of overall appreciation \u2013 such as lactic acid and glycerol. The results from the tasting panel revealed the additions improved ratings for both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beers across metrics including sweetness, body, and overall appreciation. While the models have limitations, including that they were only developed using datasets based on high-quality, commercial beers, Verstrepen said their biggest application could be in tweaking non-alcoholic beers to make them better. But beer lovers need not worry that new technology could disrupt a rich heritage, with Verstrepen noting the skill of brewers remains vital. \u201cThe AI models predict the chemical changes that could optimise a beer, but it is still up to brewers to make that happen starting from the recipe and brewing methods,\u201d he said."

            "content": "It is 5pm in Gaza and Tel Aviv. Here are the headlines \u2026 Israel\u2019s military has conducted what it called \u201cprecise operational activity\u201d at the al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza. It claimed to have killed a senior Hamas figure \u2013 Faiq Mabhouh \u2013 during the attack. Israeli media has reported that 80 people were detained. Al Jazeera reports that Israeli forces detained one of its journalists, with witnesses saying Ismail al-Ghoul was beaten, and that a number of people were wounded during the assault on the hospital. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said he is \u201cterribly worried about the situation\u201d and that \u201chospitals should never be battlegrounds\u201d. A new report by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has said that famine is imminent in northern Gaza, and that 1.1 million \u2013 half the population \u2013 in the territory are facing \u201ccatastrophic\u201d food supply conditions. Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy insisted on social media that \u201cIsrael is facilitating the delivery of unlimited quantities of aid by air, land, and sea.\u201d The EU\u2019s chief diplomat Josep Borrell condemned Israel for creating what he said was a \u201cman-made famine\u201d in Gaza, and urged Israel to allow road deliveries of food immediately. He said European leaders have told Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu they cannot stand by and watch Palestinians starve to death. \u201cThis famine is not a natural disaster. It is not a flaw. It is not an earthquake. It is entirely man-made\u201d he said in Brussels. Israel\u2019s foreign minister Israel Katz, told Borrell he should \u201cstop attacking Israel\u201d. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini has been refused entry to Gaza by Israel. He said his trip had been intended \u201cto coordinate and improve the humanitarian response\u201d in the territory, which he said is facing unprecedented levels of \u201cman-made starvation\u201d. Israel has accused members of UNRWA staff of participating in the 7 October attack by Hamas, although it is yet to hand over evidence to the agency. Reuters and Axios are both reporting that US president Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu are expected to speak today. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid has issued another call for Netanyahu to stand down, and asked the Knesset to vote no confidence in Israel\u2019s war government. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, has sent a telegram to Russian president Vladimir Putin congratulating him on his election victory. Germany\u2019s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters Monday ahead of an EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels that they were planning to impose sanctions on Hamas and on Israeli West Bank settlers. UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres on Monday said a report saying that famine is now imminent in northern Gaza was an \u201cappalling indictment\u201d of conditions on the ground. \u201cThis is an entirely man-made disaster \u2013 and the report makes clear that it can be halted,\u201d Reuters reports Guterres told the media at the UN headquarters in New York, calling on Israel to ensure access for humanitarian goods throughout Gaza. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid has issued another call for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stand down, and asked the Knesset to vote no confidence in Israel\u2019s war government. In a series of posts on social media, Lapid said: We have become used to the crazy, weird, crooked and strange idea that it\u2019s OK that Benjamin Netanyahu is still prime minister. In what other country in the world would he have stayed a minute in office? In what other country in the world do you bring upon your citizens the most terrible disaster in their history, after you have been warned time and time again, after you have received every possible warning, and still you insist on holding on to the throne. On your watch, babies were burned, women were raped, towns were occupied by terrorists, you could have prevented it, and you didn\u2019t, and you continue as if nothing happened. Citing comments by finance minister Bezalel Smotrich that the appointment of senior positions in Israel\u2019s military should be done by the government, Lapid said \u201cThe Israeli government against the IDF, during wartime. Is there anything crazier than this?\u201d He concluded \u201cI want to remind the citizens of Israel, the Knesset of Israel, that what is happening here today is not normal. It has to stop, they have to go. I call on the Knesset to vote no confidence in the craziest government in the country\u2019s history.\u201d Here is a video report which includes some footage from the al-Shifa hospital complex, which has been targeted by Israeli forces inside the Gaza Strip. Israel\u2019s military has claimed it killed a senior Hamas figure during the course of what it described as \u201cprecise operational activity\u201d. Energy minister Eli Cohen has added his voice to a number of Israelis who have criticised the EU\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, for comments he made earlier today accusing Israel of provoking famine in Gaza. Cohen accused Borrell of \u201cemboldening\u201d Hamas. Cohen said \u201cEU foreign minister Borrell\u2019s unfounded accusations embolden the terrorist organization Hamas. Israel consistently delivers humanitarian aid in compliance with international law. Only Hamas is responsible for the shortages in the Gaza Strip. They are the ones starving their people just as they are the ones who neglected them for years.\u201d Borrell\u2019s comments came the same day a new report by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has said that famine is imminent in northern Gaza, and that 1.1 million \u2013 half the population \u2013 in the territory are facing \u201ccatastrophic\u201d food supply conditions, and that Oxfam criticised Israel for controlling an \u201cunpredictable and chaotic regime of approval, scanning and inspection\u201d of humanitarian aid. Reuters and Axios are both reporting that US president Joe Biden and Israel\u2019s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu are expected to speak today. Here are some more images from inside Gaza City today where crowds have been trying to receive humanitarian aid at an UNRWA warehouse. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, has sent a telegram to Russian president Vladimir Putin congratulating him on his election victory. Wafa reports that Abbas wished Putin \u201ccontinued success\u201d, and \u201caffirmed his pride in the relations of friendship and solidarity that bring together the two countries and peoples, and his great appreciation for Russia\u2019s support for the rights of Palestinian people.\u201d According to UN figures, at least 10,000 civilians, including more than 560 children, have been killed and over 18,500 injured since Russia launched its a full-scale armed attack against Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Russia has partially occupied and claimed to annex four Ukrainian regions, in addition to the Crimea peninsula, which Russia has occupied since 2014. The international criminal court has issued a warrant for Putin\u2019s arrest over claims of the forced deportation of Ukrainian children. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini, has posted a statement after Israel\u2019s refusal to allow him to enter Gaza, saying his trip had been intended \u201cto coordinate and improve the humanitarian response\u201d in the territory, which he said is facing unprecedented levels of \u201cman-made starvation\u201d. In a lengthy post on social media, he wrote: On the day new data is out on famine in Gaza, the Israeli authorities deny my entry to Gaza. Famine is imminent in the northern Gaza Strip, expected to arrive between now and May. Two million people \u2013 the entire population of Gaza \u2013 is facing crisis levels of food insecurity or worse. Half the population has completely exhausted food supplies and coping capacities. They are struggling with catastrophic hunger and starvation. This is the highest number of people ever recorded as facing catastrophic hunger by the IPC system and double the number just three months ago. Earlier, Unicef warned that the number of children under two years old suffering from acute malnutrition has doubled in one month. Children are now dying of dehydration and hunger. The statement continues UNRWA has by far the largest presence among all humanitarian organisations in Gaza. My visit today was supposed to coordinate and improve the humanitarian response. This man-made starvation under our watch is a stain on our collective humanity. Too much time was wasted, all land crossings must open now. Famine can be averted with political will. Al Jazeera has more details on the detention of its journalist Ismail al-Ghoul at the al-Shifa hospital by Israeli forces. Reporting from Rafah, Hani Mahmoud writes: Our Al Jazeera Arabic colleague Ismail al-Ghoul and his crew who were sheltering inside the hospital were detained. Witnesses inside the hospital said they were beaten before being taken to an undisclosed location. On the situation in the medical complex, the news network reports: We are getting confirmed reports from a doctor inside the hospital that the Israeli military is inside the courtyard of the hospital where bodies are on the ground. There are also multiple injuries, by the tens. Medical staff and paramedics are unable to get to them and move them inside the building. Additionally, Al Jazeera reports: Israeli forces have destroyed the broadcasting vehicles of press crews at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza. The hospital was a base for journalists to report from throughout Israel\u2019s war on the Gaza Strip. Israeli media reports that Israel\u2019s forces have detained 80 people during the assault on the al-Shifa hospital. Israel\u2019s military has claimed to have killed a senior member of Hamas at the al-Shifa hospital complex during its combat operation there this morning. In a statement, the IDF said: Eliminated: Faiq Mabhouh, head of the Operations Directorate of Hamas\u2019 Internal Security. Mabhouh was hiding in a compound at the Shifa hospital, from which he operated and advanced terrorist activity. The claims have not been independently verified. Israeli authorities denied permission for the head of the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) to enter the Gaza Strip, Reuters reported. UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said that he had intended to go to Rafah today \u201cbut I have been informed an hour ago that my entry into Rafah is declined\u201d. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said today that he is \u201cterribly worried about the situation at Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza.\u201d In a post on social media, he said \u201chospitals should never be battlegrounds\u201d and called for a ceasefire. Egypt\u2019s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, said today that Washington should make clear to Israel what the consequences of a military push into Rafah on the border with Egypt would be, Reuters reported. \u201cIt is not enough for rhetoric, it is not enough to state opposition, it is also important to indicate what if that position is circumvented, what if that position is not respected,\u201d Shoukry said. \u201cIt is also up to the international community and the United States, who have indicated their refusal to such an eventuality, to make clear what are the consequences if their appeals are not heeded,\u201d he added. The Palestinian unemployment rate is set to rise to 57% during first quarter of 2024, the International Labour Organization said today. In a statement, the ILO said: Some 507,000 jobs have been lost across the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) as of the end of January 2024 due to the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, according to new estimates issued by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS). The new data estimates that, as of 31 January, around 201,000 jobs were lost in the Gaza Strip, accounting for around two thirds of total employment in the enclave. In addition, 306,000 jobs \u2013 or over one third of total employment - were also lost in the West Bank, where economic conditions have been severely impacted. A new report by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has said that famine is imminent in northern Gaza, and that 1.1 million \u2013 half the population \u2013 in the territory are facing \u201ccatastrophic\u201d food supply conditions. The report states: The IPC acute food insecurity analysis conducted in December 2023 warned of a risk that famine may occur by the end of May 2024 if an immediate cessation of hostilities and sustained access for the provision of essential supplies and services to the population did not take place. Since then, the conditions necessary to prevent famine have not been met and the latest evidence confirms that famine is imminent in the northern governorates and projected to occur anytime between mid-March and May 2024. It continues: According to the most likely scenario, both North Gaza and Gaza Governorates are classified in IPC Phase 5 (famine) with reasonable evidence, with 70% (around 210,000 people) of the population in IPC Phase 5 (catastrophe). Continued conflict and the near-complete lack of access to the northern governorates for humanitarian organizations and commercial trucks will likely compound heightened vulnerabilities and extremely limited food availability, access and utilization, as well as access to healthcare, water, and sanitation. The famine threshold for household acute food insecurity has already been far exceeded. It concludes: The entire population in the Gaza Strip (2.2 million) is facing high levels of acute food insecurity. Between mid-March and mid-July, in the most likely scenario and under the assumption of an escalation of the conflict including a ground offensive in Rafah, half of the population of the Gaza Strip (1.1 million people) is expected to face catastrophic conditions. Plan International, an NGO that works to advance children\u2019s rights, has responded to the report. CEO Rose Caldwell said: After months of unimaginable trauma and indiscriminate bombing, the children of Gaza are now facing the horror of starvation and the threat of imminent famine. This entirely man-made catastrophe should be a source of shame for the international community. There can be no excuses: preventing access for humanitarian aid is a clear violation of international humanitarian law. The starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is illegal and immoral. Earlier, Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy, responding to comments from the EU\u2019s diplomatic chief Josep Borrell that famine in Gaza was man-made, insisted on social media that \u201cIsrael is facilitating the delivery of unlimited quantities of aid by air, land, and sea.\u201d German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters Monday ahead of an EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels that they were planning to impose sanctions on Hamas and on Israeli West Bank settlers. \u201cWe will finally initiate sanctions against Hamas \u2026 in light of this terrible rape, the sexual violence against women in Israel,\u201d she said, referring to acts claimed to have been committed by Hamas during the 7 October attack inside Israel. \u201cAnd at the same time we are making it clear here in Brussels: The suffering in Gaza must finally come to an end,\u201d the minister said. \u201cThis war, but this conflict as a whole, can only come to an end if we reach a two-state solution,\u201d Baerbock added. \u201cThat is why it is so important for us to make it clear that the construction of settlements, and in particular the violence of radical settlers, is not in line with international law. We will also initiate a sanctions regime for this.\u201d The UN\u2019s special envoy on sexual violence in conflict has reported \u201cclear and convincing information\u201d that some women and children hostages held by Hamas had been subjected to rape and sexualised torture. In January, Bethan McKernan in Jerusalem reported for the Guardian that there were at least six sexual assaults for which multiple corroborating pieces of evidence exist. Two of those victims, who were murdered, were aged under 18. Here is a video clip of the EU\u2019s chief diplomat Josep Borrell accusing Israel of provoking famine in Gaza. Al Jazeera reports that Israeli forces have arrested one of its journalists at al-Shifa hospital. Other local media have also reported that Ismail al-Ghoul has been detained. Al Jazeera writes: We\u2019re getting reports that Israeli forces have arrested Al Jazeera Arabic\u2019s correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul from inside the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. According to Palestinian writer and journalist Imad Zaqqout and other witnesses, al-Ghoul was beaten severely by Israeli soldiers before he was arrested with dozens of men and women within the hospital. More details soon \u2026 Israel\u2019s foreign minister has said that the EU\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, should \u201cstop attacking Israel\u201d. In comments on social media, Israel Katz said: Israel allows extensive humanitarian aid into Gaza by land, air, and sea for anyone willing to help. Despite Hamas violently disrupting aid convoys and UNRWA\u2019s collaboration with them, we persist. It\u2019s time for EU Foreign Minister Josep Borrell to stop attacking Israel and recognise our right to self-defence against Hamas\u2019 crimes. Israel has accused UNRWA staff members of being involved in the Hamas attack inside Israel on 7 October. It has yet to present evidence of the accusations directly to UNRWA or the UN. The IDF has announced that a soldier has been killed in the northern Gaza Strip. Lisa O\u2019Carroll, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent, has more on those comments by Josep Borrell: The EU\u2019s chief diplomat Josep Borrell condemned Benjamin Netanyahu this morning for creating what he said was a \u201cmanmade famine\u201d in Gaza, and urged Israel to allow road deliveries of food immediately. Arriving at a summit of foreign ministers in Brussels, he said European leaders have told the Israeli prime minister they cannot stand by and watch Palestinians starve to death. In Gaza we are no longer on the brink of famine, we are in a state of famine affecting thousands of people. Chancellor Sholz told Benjamin Netanyahu \u2018we cannot stand by and watch Palestinians starve\u2019. This famine is not a natural disaster. It is not a flaw. It is not an earthquake. It is entirely manmade. Chancellor Scholz is saying Europeans cannot sit and watch Palestinian starving, when on the other side of the border there is food for months accumulated in stocks, while on the other side of the road there are people dying of hunger. This requires some action. The EU, which funds much of the aid to Gaza, said the land border used to handle 500 tonnes of aid a day before the war. At present it was functioning at a level of 100 tonnes a day. Borrell added: \u201cBefore the war, Gaza was the greatest open air prison. Today it is the greatest open air graveyard\u201d. Yesterday European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, one of Israel\u2019s staunchest supporters in the EU said: \u201cGaza is facing famine and we cannot accept this.\u201d Oxfam has accused Israel of controlling \u201can unpredictable and chaotic regime of approval, scanning and inspection\u201d of humanitarian aid destined for the Gaza Strip. In a new report, the NGO says \u201cpeople living in Gaza will suffer mass death from disease and starvation far beyond the current 31,000 Palestinian war casualties unless Israel takes immediate steps to end its violations.\u201d The report claims that Israel is \u201cleading a dysfunctional and undersized inspection system that keeps aid snarled up, subjected to onerous, repetitive and unpredictable bureaucratic procedures that are contributing to trucks being stranded in giant queues for 20 days on average.\u201d It adds that Israeli authorities are \u201croutinely and arbitrarily rejecting items of aid as having \u2018dual [military] use\u2019\u201d. Aid sent by the UK government that has been rejected, for example, included water filters and solar-powered lights. It accuses Israel of having \u201ccracked down on humanitarian missions, largely sealing off northern Gaza, and restricting international humanitarian workers\u2019 access not only into Gaza, but Israel and the West Bank including East Jerusalem too.\u201d The report claims that in February there was a 44% reduction in the number of trucks allowed to enter Gaza compared to the month before. Israel has repeatedly claimed that it could process more aid than is being delivered to Gaza, but that the UN, NGOs and other aid agencies are causing the hold-up through lack of supplies. In January the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague ordered that \u201cIsrael must take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\u201d Sally Abi Khalil, Oxfam\u2019s Middle East and North Africa Director, said The ICJ order should have shocked Israeli leaders to change course, but since then conditions in Gaza have actually worsened. The fact that other governments have not challenged Israel hard enough, but instead turned to less effective methods like airdrops and maritime corridors is a huge red flag, signalling that Israel continues to deny the full potential of better ways to deliver more aid. In an operational update, Israel\u2019s military has said that it \u201cstruck a Hezbollah military structure and an observation post\u201d in Ramyeh inside Lebanon. The village is situated just north of the UN-drawn blue line that separates Israel and Lebanon. Israel is provoking famine in Gaza and using starvation as a weapon of war, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday. \u201cIn Gaza we are no longer on the brink of famine, we are in a state of famine, affecting thousands of people,\u201d Reuters reports Borrell said at the opening of a conference on humanitarian aid for Gaza in Brussels. \u201cThis is unacceptable. Starvation is used as a weapon of war. Israel is provoking famine.\u201d The Palestinian death toll in Gaza due to Israeli military action has risen to at least 31,726, according to officials there. 73,792 people have been injured since 7 October. Reuters reports the Hamas-led ministry said 81 Palestinians were killed and 116 injured in the past 24 hours. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify casualty figures being issued in the conflict. Reuters has spoken to a witness of events at the al-Shifa hospital complex via a chat app. It reports: \u201cSuddenly, we started to hear sounds of explosions, several bombings, and soon tanks started to roll, they came from the western road and headed toward Al Shifa, then sounds of gunfire and explosions increased,\u201d Mohammad Ali, 32, who lives around one kilometre from the hospital, told Reuters via a chat app. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what is happening, but it looked as if it was a re-invasion of the Gaza City,\u201d he added, saying that the military activities began at about 1am. Israeli media is reporting that Israel\u2019s military claims to have arrested 80 people during its raid on the al-Shifa hospital complex in Gaza City. More details soon \u2026 In an operational briefing at just after 9am local time, Israel\u2019s military released a video of what it claimed was \u201cterrorist fire toward them from a number of hospital buildings\u201d. In the statement, the IDF said it was \u201ccontinuing to conduct precise operational activity to thwart terrorism in the area of the al-Shifa hospital\u201d. It added \u201cOver the past few hours, the troops identified terrorist fire toward them from a number of hospital buildings. The forces engaged the terrorists and identified several hits.\u201d The claims have not been independently verified. Israel has used its Arabic language military spokesperson to issue an instruction for civilians to evacuate if they are in the vicinity of the al-Shifa hospital. It has instructed them to move south. During its five month military campaign against the Gaza Strip, Israel has repeatedly carried out airstrikes on the south of the territory, where huge numbers of people are being forced to live in makeshift tent camps. The Israeli army has launched an operation around Gaza\u2019s largest hospital, al-Shifa, saying in a statement that it is \u201cbased on intelligence information indicating the use of the hospital by senior Hamas terrorists\u201d. The IDF also described the operation as \u201cprecise\u201d. In the wake of the raid, Palestinian health authorities say there is now a fierce fire burning in one of the buildings. Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry says the blaze broke out at the entrance of the complex, causing cases of suffocation among displaced women and children in the hospital. It said communication had been cut off, with people trapped inside the surgery and emergency units of one of the buildings. \u201cThere are casualties, including deaths and injuries, and it\u2019s impossible to rescue anyone due to the intensity of the fire and targeting of anyone approaching the windows,\u201d the ministry said, accusing Israeli forces of \u201canother crime against health institutions\u201d. The Israeli military says soldiers entering the compound were fired on, according to Reuters. \u201cThe troops responded with live fire and hits were identified. Our troops are continuing to operate in the area of the hospital.\u201d Neither the IDF\u2019s nor the Hamas claims could immediately be verified. It has just gone 9am in Gaza and Tel Aviv. This is our latest live blog on the Israel-Gaza war and the wider Middle East crisis. I am Martin Belam and I\u2019ll be with you for the next while. The Israeli army has launched an operation around Gaza\u2019s largest hospital al-Shifa, with witnesses reporting airstrikes on the devastated neighbourhood where it is located. The IDF also carried out a November operation in al-Shifa, sparking an international outcry. More on that in a moment, but first, here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, confirmed on Sunday he would launch an offensive into the southern city of Rafah despite growing international concern over the fate of Palestinian civilians sheltering there. Netanyahu said \u201cno amount of international pressure will stop us from realising all the goals of the war\u201d. Netanyahu also said that civilians would be able to leave before troops enter Rafah. \u201cOur goal in eliminating the remaining terrorist battalions in Rafah goes hand-in-hand with enabling the civilian population to leave Rafah,\u201d Netanyahu said at a press appearance alongside visiting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that we will do while keeping the population locked in place.\u201d But as others have done, Scholz raised the question: \u201cWhere should they go?\u201d Germany\u2019s chancellor warned that an Israeli assault on Rafah would make regional peace \u201cvery difficult\u201d, after talks with Jordanian King Abdullah. Netanyahu responded to a call by Chuck Schumer, the US Senate leader and ally of Joe Biden for Israel to hold new elections. On Thursday, Schumer said he believed Netanyahu \u201chas lost his way by allowing his political survival to take precedence over the best interests of Israel\u201d. The Israeli prime minister responded on Sunday, saying that a pause in fighting to allow for elections to take place would paralyse the country for months. Netanyahu told CNN that he believed the Schumer intervention was \u201ctotally inappropriate\u201d. White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Sunday that Biden believed it was up to Israel to make its own decisions about internal politics. \u201cWe respect the sovereignty of the Israeli people,\u201d Kirby told Fox News Sunday. \u201cThe president believes it\u2019s up to the Israeli people and the Israeli government to determine if and when there\u2019s going to be new elections.\u201d Anti-poverty charity Oxfam on Monday accused Israel of intentionally preventing the delivery of aid into Gaza during its war with Hamas, in violation of international humanitarian law. The non-governmental organisation said in a report that Israel continued to \u201csystematically and deliberately block and undermine any meaningful international humanitarian response\u201d in the Palestinian territory."

            "title": "Foreign Office summons senior Chinese diplomat over \u2018malicious cyber activity\u2019",
            "date": "2024-03-26T18:06:33Z",
            "content": "Ministers summoned a senior Chinese diplomat to the Foreign Office on Tuesday after accusing Beijing-backed hackers of a cyber-attack on the British elections watchdog and a surveillance operation on politicians. The department called in China\u2019s charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires and told him the UK would not tolerate \u201cthreatening\u201d cyber-attacks. An FCDO spokesperson said the ministry had \u201cset out the government\u2019s unequivocal condemnation of Chinese state-affiliated organisations and individuals undertaking malicious cyber activity against UK democratic institutions and parliamentarians\u201d. \u201cThe UK government would not tolerate such threatening activity, and would continue to take strong action with partners across the globe to respond,\u201d they said. The summons came after the deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, announced sanctions on Monday on a company and two individuals accused of involvement in China\u2019s malicious cyber activity. But ministers faced criticism from Tory MPs including Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister, and Alicia Kearns, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, who called the government\u2019s actions \u201cfeeble\u201d and \u201cinsufficient\u201d. Rishi Sunak defended his approach to China, insisting the UK was \u201cundoubtedly more robust than most of our allies\u201d. MPs on the liaison committee challenged him on the government\u2019s reluctance to act on Chinese-owned companies such as ByteDance, which owns TikTok. The prime minister told MPs the UK had introduced stronger export controls for sensitive technologies and a tougher foreign investment scheme than other countries. \u201cOn trade, we are already less dependent on China for trade than Australia, Korea, Japan, the US, Germany and many other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cI am entirely confident that our approach to dealing with the risk that China poses is very much in line with our allies and in most cases goes further in protecting ourselves.\u201d Sunak also cited the government\u2019s decision to remove Huawei equipment from the UK\u2019s telecommunications networks, which Boris Johnson took in 2020 after a major rebellion by Tory backbenchers. Dowden indicated on Tuesday that the government was preparing to put China in the enhanced tier of the government\u2019s new foreign influence registration scheme. This would require organisations or individuals to register with the government if they carry out advocacy or campaigning activities on Beijing\u2019s behalf. The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said the scheme was \u201cin the process of being finalised and no countries have been specified yet\u201d. Dowden told MPs on Monday that ministers were \u201cin the process of collective government agreement\u201d on the matter and that \u201cthe conduct that I have described today will have a very strong bearing on the decision that we make in respect of it\u201d. Ministers are also under pressure to formally designate China a threat to UK security in the government\u2019s integrated review, which sets out the country\u2019s foreign, defence and security policies. It currently refers to China as an \u201cepoch-defining challenge\u201d. The education secretary, Gillian Keegan, told Times Radio that China was \u201cobviously a security threat\u201d. There are differing views in government about how robust an approach to take against China, which is one of the UK\u2019s biggest trading partners. The sanctions announced on Monday were part of a joint action by the UK and its allies to reveal the scale of Chinese cyber-espionage activities, with the US charging seven alleged Chinese hackers."

            "title": "Foreign Office merger has diminished UK\u2019s aid capability, finds watchdog",
            "date": "2024-03-25T05:00:11Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s capability and expertise on foreign aid has been diminished since international development was merged into the Foreign Office, the UK\u2019s public spending watchdog has found. The National Audit Office, which reports to parliament on public spending, said the transfer of the department to the Foreign Office, overseen by Boris Johnson, had caused a loss of dedicated senior roles in development. It said this had undermined credibility and accountability of the UK\u2019s development power, on top of the government\u2019s cuts to the aid budget after the abandonment of the target to spend 0.7% of national income. Charities said the findings of the report were accurate, as there had been a lack of preparation and consultation around the merger of the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development, which took place in 2020. The NAO said the new department had made substantial progress in the merger but that more work was needed to clarify its needs, resolve outstanding HR and IT issues, and move ahead with culture change. It also said the merger had cost at least \u00a324m but that the potential benefits and savings of the merger had not been tracked. \u201cFCDO\u2019s development capability has reduced since the merger. FCDO has changed leadership structures and roles to integrate development and diplomacy. \u201cAs a consequence, in some overseas posts the loss of dedicated senior development roles has reduced capacity and undermined FCDO\u2019s credibility and official development assistance (ODA) accountability,\u201d the report said. \u201cWhile there has been some replacement through internal accreditation and external recruitment, the number of expert development adviser roles fell by 14% from 867 in 2019 to 747 in 2022 \u2026 FCDO has been aware of the risk of not sustaining its international development skills and expertise, which it currently rates as \u2018severe\u2019, and is working to mitigate this risk.\u201d Gareth Davies, the auditor general, praised the Foreign Office for taking \u201csensible action\u201d to get the merger back on track against a backdrop of global challenges, including the pandemic and geopolitical crises in Afghanistan and Ukraine. He added: \u201cHowever, more than three years on from the merger, there is still work to do to resolve remaining issues, ensure the basics are delivered and achieve the long-term benefits of a fully integrated department. \u201cMore broadly, government needs to understand the costs of such major change, including the disruption and consumption of management capacity, and weigh these carefully against the anticipated benefits.\u201d Aid organisations and political opponents have repeatedly criticised the government\u2019s decision to go ahead with the merger, arguing it would damage the effectiveness of Britain\u2019s aid spending. Gideon Rabinowitz, the director of policy at Bond, the UK network for organisations working in international development, said: \u201cThe FCDO merger was undertaken without consultation and adequate preparation and has led to a damaging reduction in the government\u2019s development expertise. Three years on, it is alarming that the department itself rates the risk of not sustaining its international development skills and expertise as \u2018severe.\u2019 \u201cThese critical shortcomings must urgently be addressed to ensure the FCDO can effectively champion development goals within the department and across government and respond to urgent development needs.\u201d Oxfam said it was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d that international development expertise had been a \u201ccasualty\u201d of the \u201cill-advised\u201d merger. A spokesperson for the charity said: \u201cThere were plenty of warnings that the biggest losers from the merger would be people living in poverty around the world, yet the government chose not to listen. \u201cIts decision to spend large parts of the aid budget in the UK has made matters much worse. With conflict, climate change and inequality hurting low-income communities around the world, we need a strong, independent and properly resourced international development department that is committed to forging partnerships with the global south and making a real difference in the fight against poverty.\u201d An FCDO spokesperson said: \u201cThe merger has given us the integrated capability needed to grow, and drive our foreign policy, national security and international development objectives in a more effective and joined-up way. \u201cAs the report notes, we have made significant progress in our aims, bringing together our expertise to tackle crises and further UK interests. \u201cWe know there is more to do, and remain committed to the mission of the FCDO. Our recent actions, such as the appointment of a second permanent undersecretary with a focus on development, have allowed us to better bring together diplomacy, consular support and development to achieve more for the UK.\u201d"

Here are the highlights from today: Anthony Albanese met with the Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, in Melbourne today on the first day of a three-day Asean summit. The pair announced a range of deals ensuring closer collaboration on issues including cybersecurity and nuclear non-proliferation. The federal government is pressing ahead with planning for a possible visit by King Charles later this year. The shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, has said housing will be a \u201cvery compelling part\u201d of the Coalition\u2019s policy offering at the next election. Walter Sofronoff\u2019s extensive communications with a columnist at The Australian gave an impression of bias against the former ACT director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, during his inquiry into the Lehrmann trial, a court found. NSW premier Chris Minns said \u201cchange needs to be made\u201d to NSW police policies and procedures after Luke Davies and Jesse Baird were allegedly murdered by a serving police officer. Mines also said a pro-Palestine protest during the Sydney Mardi Gras parade on Saturday \u201cwasn\u2019t too much of a big deal on the night\u201d.

We\u2019ll be back bright and early tomorrow morning. See you then. ACT government considering response to Sofronoff inquiry The ACT government says it\u2019s still considering how to respond to today\u2019s judgment . Meanwhile, Ian Meagher, the solicitor for former ACT director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, said his client is \u201cdelighted\u201d with the court\u2019s decision and is \u201cnow looking forward to moving on with his life\u201d. Earlier this afternoon, Justice Stephen Kaye ruled Walter Sofronoff\u2019s extensive communications with The Australian columnist, Janet Albrechtsen, gave rise to an impression of bias against Drumgold. Sofronoff, who headed the inquiry into how the trial against Bruce Lehrmann was conducted, had interacted with Albrechtsen on 273 occasions leading up to and during the probe. Justice Kaye also overruled Sofronoff\u2019s finding that Drumgold had acted with \u201cgrossly unethical conduct\u201d during his cross-examination of retiring Liberal senator Linda Reynolds. The ACT government said this afternoon: The government is considering the terms of acting Justice Kaye\u2019s decision and will make no comment at this time. We observe, however, that the report\u2019s findings in relation to other persons and the recommendations in relation to the criminal justice system remain undisturbed. It is expected to deliver a more comprehensive response on Tuesday. Today, First Dog on the Moon has taken on the case of the man recovering from brain surgery who had his welfare payments suspended, despite him lodging a medical certificate with Services Australia, saying he had been unable to fulfil his obligations due to having surgery to remove a tumour. You can read the original news story from Cait Kelly, here: Clover Moore accuses NSW of \u2018massive\u2019 regulatory failure over asbestos mulch Sydney\u2019s lord mayor, Clover Moore, has accused the New South Wales government and the state\u2019s environment watchdog of a \u201cmassive\u201d and \u201ccostly\u201d regulatory failure over the ongoing asbestos contamination crisis. City of Sydney councillors gathered at an extraordinary general meeting on Monday to discuss how contaminated mulch came to be used across numerous city parks. Moore revealed testing alone had already cost the council more than $200,000. Asbestos has so far been found in mulch in more than a dozen City of Sydney parks, including friable asbestos at several sites. The NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has found asbestos-contaminated mulch at more than 60 sites across greater Sydney. Read more on this story from myself and environment reporter Lisa Cox, here: The shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, has spoken about how housing will be a \u201cvery compelling part\u201d of the Coalition\u2019s policy offering at the next election. Sukkar told ABC Afternoon Briefing the Coalition has recommitted to its policy \u201cproviding first home buyers with the opportunity to access up to $50,000 of their super with a requirement that it goes back into their super once they cease holding that property, to enable them to use their superannuation, which is their money, as a deposit for a first term\u201d. Then things got interesting when Sukkar was asked if the opposition might have to revise up how much people are able to withdraw due to rising house prices. Sukkar seemed open to it. He said: We will have more to say about that policy and the range of other policies. It is a fair point you make but we will consider that in the context of the full suite of policies for the election. Let\u2019s remember for a couple that is $50,000 each, so for a couple it is $100,000 towards your deposit, in addition to other savings, because we think it is a very compelling policy that we took to the last election. It will be refreshed in the context of what we take to the next election \u2026 I\u2019m not announcing that today. I think my point is, and you made a good point, that was a policy we took to the last election. We have recommitted to the policy in broad strokes, but we will be taking a suite of policies to support home ownership for the next election. In a joint statement, the leaders of Australia and Malaysia have \u201cexpressed their deep concern\u201d about the ongoing situation in Myanmar, three years after a military coup. The statement from Anthony Albanese and Anwar Ibrahim came after pro-democracy protesters gathered outside the Asean conference in Melbourne, urging the regional bloc of south-east Asian nations to take a more proactive stance in the nation. The leaders expressed their deep concern at the continued suffering of the people of Myanmar as a result of the 2021 military coup and strongly condemned the continued acts of violence. Leaders urged the military regime to take concrete action to immediately halt indiscriminate violence, denounce any escalation, release those unjustly detained, allow safe and unimpeded access for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and to engage in inclusive national dialogue. Insurance losses for catastrophes this summer top $1.2bn Insured losses from declared catastrophes this summer have hit $1.2bn, according to data released today by the Insurance Council of Australia. The disasters include ex-tropical cyclone Jasper, which hit northern Queensland in mid-December last year, and the Christmas and new year storms that caused damage across regions of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria between 23 December and 3 January. The Christmas and New Year storms caused $968m in losses from nearly 90,000 insurance claims, the data shows. Meanwhile, losses from ex-Tropical Cyclone Jasper have reached $278m from nearly 10,000 claims. Some $171m has reportedly been paid out from storm claims in February, up from the $22m paid out in January. While $62m has been paid out from Jasper so far. The ICA CEO, Andrew Hall, said in a statement that claims would remain open \u201cuntil all works were completed and approved, which may take some time depending on the severity of the damage caused and the complexity of the claim\u201d. University of Sydney removes entry requirements for some courses The University of Sydney is scrapping entry prerequisites for a number of courses in a bid to improve accessibility to the institution. Under the changes, students will not have to have completed advanced mathematics for entry to a string of courses from 2025, with the prerequisite to be replaced with targeted support throughout degrees. The vice-chancellor, Prof Mark Scott, said the changes acknowledged many disadvantaged students weren\u2019t able to take accelerated courses at school and enrolment rates in advanced mathematics had continued to decline. Through no fault of their own, many students don\u2019t have the opportunity to take advanced mathematics at school \u2013 a situation exacerbated by ongoing maths teacher shortages that affect some schools more than others. The prerequisite will remain in place for engineering honours courses, advanced computing and pharmacy. It follows the release of the Universities Accord report, which found disadvantaged students must be better represented at institutions in order to meet future workforce needs. Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, has said his government will not hesitate to reopen an investigation into the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 if there is credible evidence suggesting that should happen. Malaysia is in talks with the US marine robotics company Ocean Infinity to discuss a new search operation. The company says it is willing and able to return to the search, and has submitted a proposal to the Malaysian government. Flight MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, carrying 12 Malaysian crew members and 227 passengers, vanished from air traffic radar on 8 March 2014. Its disappearance sparked the largest ever search operation but the fate of the plane has never been resolved and remains one of the world\u2019s greatest aviation mysteries. Anwar was asked about the issue during a press conference with Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese: We have taken the position that if there is a compelling case and evidence that [an investigation] needs to be reopened then we will certainly be happy for it to be reopened. I don\u2019t think this is a technical issue, it is an issue affecting the lives of people. Whatever needs to be done, must be done. Anthony Albanese and his Malaysian counterpart, Anwar Ibrahim, have both been asked what official statement they\u2019d like Asean to deliver regarding the conflict in Gaza. At these international summits, negotiated statements are made once all parties agree on the phrasing. Here\u2019s Albanese: We have been very consistent \u2026. [about] our deep concern about civilian suffering, whether that be Israeli or Palestinian. Our call for a humanitarian ceasefire, a call for hostages to be released, a call for a political solution that must include a two-state solution, where Palestinians and Israelis can live with security and stability side-by-side. That is in the interest of everyone in the region. That is Australia\u2019s position, no doubt the world, including Asean leaders, are concerned about events that have occurred there and are concerned about instability that is created there as well. And Anwar: I think the general consensus is calling for a ceasefire. The ABC\u2019s Stephen Dziedzic has asked Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, whether his government is concerned about Australia\u2019s increased focus on defence spending, and for more context on his recent comments about a rise of \u201cChina-phobia\u201d in the west. Anwar began by joking that difficult questions should be addressed to the host nation, Australia, before offering this reply: We are an independent nation. We are fiercely independent. We do not want to be dictated by any force. So it remains to be an important friend to the US and Europe and here in Australia. They should not preclude us from being friendly to one of our important neighbours, precisely China. If they have problems with China, they should not impose it upon us. We do not have a problem with China. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and his Malaysian counterpart, Anwar Ibrahim, have announced a range of deals ensuring closer collaboration on issues including cybersecurity and nuclear non-proliferation. The two leaders are holding a press conference after a bilateral meeting at Government House in Melbourne on the first day of a three-day Asean summit. Australia is not a member of Asean \u2013 the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \u2013 but the special summit marks 50 years since Australia became the regional grouping\u2019s first dialogue partner. Albanese told reporters that the two leaders discussed progress on a joint defence program: We also announced a memorandum of understanding on the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty to enable data sharing and capacity building and nuclear non-proliferation between our two countries. The prime minister and I also discussed our joint commitment to better manage cyber threats. Going forward, Australia and Malaysia will be able to engage in more comprehensive information sharing and cyber skills development. And we will work closely together on immigration and border issues. Australian army \u2018one of the great pillars\u2019 of our security: Malaysian PM The prime minister has been making some announcements about cooperation between Malaysia, particularly in the areas of digital economy and energy transition, which Albanese is calling \u201ca digital economy MOU\u201d. We\u2019ll have more for you on those in a moment. The Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim says: The longstanding relations between Malaysia and Australia goes back prewar, and the enormous contribution of the Australian Armed Forces is something which we have considered one of the great pillars in terms of strengthening our security, securing our ultimate independence. Malaysia and Australia \u2018share the same aspirations for the region\u2019: PM The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking now from Asean with the Malaysian prime minister. Here are his opening remarks: Malaysia is one of Australia\u2019s oldest and most important friends in the region. We are bound together in so many ways, from family ties and close economic connections, to the tens of thousands of students and tourists each year drawn to Australian and Malaysian shores. Above all, we share the same aspirations for the region we call home. We believe in an Indo Pacific region that is open, stable and prosperous. And where sovereignty is respected and differences are settled through dialogue and agreed rules and norms. My meeting with the prime minister emphasised our state found commitment to this vision and a shared desire to bring our people and our economy is closer still. Australia stands ready to play a bigger role in Malaysia\u2019s pursuit of economic opportunity, investment, development and growth. NSW premier apologises for sinkhole The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, has apologised to the owners of a property after a sinkhole appeared in Sydney\u2019s south last week. The nearly 20-metre-wide sinkhole appeared at a Rockdale industrial park, above nearby M6 motorway tunnelling works on Friday. Minns said it was being investigated and work would be done to ensure it did not happen again. The premier said: My understanding is that engineers believed that this part of the project was always going to be tough. It\u2019s the \u2026 part of the project that\u2019s closest to the surface. I\u2019m not pretending anything other than something\u2019s gone wrong here. We need to make sure that we\u2019ve learned the lessons and it\u2019s not repeated. Of course, we apologise to the owners of the land and those that work there. We are very grateful there\u2019s been no injuries or worse on the site. Here\u2019s some background on what happened: Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, the lovely Stephanie Convery will be here to take you through the rest of today\u2019s news. Take care! Weak inventory result to lop 1 percentage point off GDP, economists say As noted in an earlier post, the surprisingly strong drop in inventories (stocks and stockpiles held by companies) might nudge the December quarter GDP figures close to zero or even negative when we get the full national accounts figures on Wednesday. Two missing pieces, from the trade sector and government spending, will land tomorrow, and so most economists will hold off on their final GDP forecasts until then. A few are already noting there are \u201cdownside risks\u201d to their existing predictions because inventories fell 1.7%, among the largest recorded, according to UBS. The drop will slash 1 percentage point from the quarterly result which might be hard to make up from trade, and recall that the September quarter only registered 0.2% GDP growth to start with. Trade could well be a bit of a drag for the rest of 2024, as it happens, especially if Chinese planners don\u2019t take some serious steps to revive domestic consumer confidence. Name your commodity and it\u2019s a fair chance China consumes more than any other nation, so what happens up north can make a big difference for exporters such as Australia (and budget coffers). It\u2019s been passing strange that the iron ore price has held up so well given the state of China\u2019s property sector. Real estate, after all, uses a lot of steel, much of made with red direct exported from Australia\u2019s Pilbara. The ANZ has an updated report on the sector today (timely as the Communist Party - plus a few token other groups - holds its annual gathering in Beijing\u2019s cavernous Great Hall of the People this week). The unsold residential property in China now exceeds 3bn square metres. If nobody built anything more, it would take 3.6 years to digest that inventory. That\u2019s about 50% more than during the last downturn, in 2014, and the overhang will get worse before it gets better, ANZ said. Resorting to the usual mix of interest rate cuts and other incentives stopped working in 2022, the bank says. \u201cThe shock from the pandemic, diminishing economic optimism and the lack of confidence in real estate as a store of wealth have affected the prospect of property investment,\u201d ANZ said. China\u2019s real estate sector now looks a lot like Japan after a monster bubble popped there in 1991. Perhaps the adjustment to Australia\u2019s inventories will look like a minor adjustment not too far down the track. Walter Sofronoff\u2019s extensive communications with a columnist at The Australian gave an impression of bias against former ACT director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, during his inquiry into the Lehrmann trial, a court has found. Justice Stephen Kaye handed down his judgment in Drumgold\u2019s case against Sofronoff and the ACT government on Monday afternoon, finding the inquiry head\u2019s 273 interactions with columnist, Janet Albrechtsen, gave the impression he \u201cmight have been influenced by the views held and publicly expressed\u201d by Albrechtsen. Drumgold had alleged Sofronoff\u2019s inquiry failed to give him a fair hearing, denied him natural justice, breached the law and \u201cgave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias\u201d. Drumgold\u2019s legal team had also attempted to overturn eight of Sofronoff\u2019s \u201cserious findings of misconduct\u201d, but was ultimately only successful in overturning one. That overturned finding related to his conclusion that Drumgold had acted with \u201cgrossly unethical conduct\u201d during his cross-examination of retiring Liberal senator Linda Reynolds. Justice Kaye also determined Drumgold had not been afforded natural justice on one count because he did not properly understand the rules around freedom of information. The parties are discussing the judge\u2019s proposal for relief and costs, which is expected to be unveiled later this afternoon. Guardian Australia published parts of a letter sent by Drumgold to the Australian federal police accusing Reynolds of \u201cdisturbing conduct\u201d during the Bruce Lehrmann trial. Reynolds sued Drumgold and the ACT government for defamation, which was settled on Monday morning for $90,000. WA power outage affects 37,000 Perth homes The power outage affecting metropolitan Perth and the hills districts is now affecting about 37,000 homes and businesses, as weather conditions cause pole top fires. Western Power has just provided an update and said about 70 pole fire incidents have been reported, which is the cause of the unplanned outages. As we reported earlier today, pole top fires can occur during light drizzling rain or misty, damp conditions when recent dust and pollution builds to create paths or \u201ctracks\u201d on the insulators, enabling electricity to jump across. The tracking electricity can heat elements of the pole, causing it to smoulder and burn. The latest Western Power update says: All available crews are working as quickly and safely as possible to make hazards safe. Customers may see crews attending a fault and then leaving before power has been restored. This is because our crews priority is to make hazards safe first before commencing repairs. Once all hazards have been made safe, crews will be able to assess poles for replacement and start repair work. Each pole change can take between 4 and 8 hours, depending on the type of pole, and unfortunately some customers may be without power until later in the day. The spokesperson said work has been ongoing to minimise the risk of pole top fires across the network, but climate change impacts on weather pattens \u201chave been challenging\u201d. A 19-year-old man has been taken into custody after a man died and a woman was seriously injured outside the Perth CBD. Around 8am local time this morning, Western Australia police were called to Greenwood after reports a man had been seriously injured. A man in his 80s and a woman in her 70s were located with serious injuries. The woman was taken to Royal Perth hospital where she remains in a stable condition, however the man died at the scene. About 9.20am a 19-year-old man was located in Kingsley and taken into custody. Inquiries are ongoing, police said in a statement. A large number of police resources attended the scene including police airwing, canine unit, local police and detectives. Investigation into Sydney sinkhole under way Transport for NSW has provided an update on the sinkhole that appeared in Sydney\u2019s south last Friday. Last Friday a nearly 20-metre-wide sinkhole appeared in a Rockdale industrial park, above nearby M6 motorway tunnelling works. You can read all the background on this here, in case you missed it. A spokesperson said the sinkhole was filled and stabilised with around 1800m3 of concrete, which was completed this morning. The affected area in Rockdale was handed over to the property owners on Sunday afternoon, and an exclusion zone is being maintained around the impacted building. This will be closed off until an engineering assessment is complete. A Transport for NSW spokesperson said: There are many complex factors that may have contributed to the subsidence. Investigations into the possible causes are under way and will take some time. The spokesperson said it is \u201cnot yet known\u201d when tunnelling will resume in the M6 south-bound tunnel: Tunnelling will only recommence under the impacted area after comprehensive safety and geotechnical reviews have taken place. New Zealand PM heading to Melbourne\u2019s Asean summit Chris Luxon, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, will enter the world of face-to-face international diplomacy this week after an invitation to the Asean summit in Melbourne, AAP reports. Luxon, who took office in November last year, will meet with several south-east Asian leaders tomorrow after taking up the prime minister, Anthony Albanese\u2019s offer to attend the Asean summit. Luxon will focus on trade during his two-day trip to Victoria before returning to New Zealand on Wednesday. He said: South-east Asia is incredibly important for New Zealand. The Asean bloc is our third largest goods export market. Stepping up our focus on the region reflects the impact it has on New Zealand\u2019s strategic and economic interests. Storm warning issued in SA A severe thunderstorm warning has been issued for the west coast and north-west pastoral districts of South Australia: The Bureau of Meteorology says a weak upper trough is leading to thunderstorm development in a moist environment moving across the border from Western Australia. Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding in the warning area over the next several hours. Nullarbor recorded 21.6mm in the 60 minutes to 12pm. An individual has been fined $8,250 by the NSW Environment Protection Authority for a mass crayfish kill in a Blue Mountains creek last year. About 1,000 dead and dying giant spiny crayfish were found in a tributary of Hazelbrook Creek, near Horseshoe Falls, by a tour guide in August last year. The EPA issued two penalty notices after its investigation found nearly 40 litres of the diluted pesticide Bifenthrin accidentally spilt on the driveway of a private property, flowing into the stormwater system and causing the mass crayfish kill. Bifenthrin is a highly toxic chemical commonly used to control termites, spiders, ants and cockroaches. The EPA detected it in the water, sediment and crayfish samples taken from Hazelbrook Creek. EPA\u2019s executive director of regulatory operations, Jason Gordon, said in a statement that the incident was preventable: The individual had the opportunity to clean up the spill to prevent further harm but failed to do so. While we are pleased the person responsible came forward on their own accord, we are committed to holding individuals accountable for actions that endanger our precious ecosystems. The misuse and mishandling of pesticides can have devastating impacts on our waterways, which are home to animals like the Giant Spiny Crayfish. This unfortunate incident serves as an important reminder of responsible pesticide use and handling practices to safeguard our waterways and ecosystems. You can read more background on the incident here: Car driven off ledge and crashes in Sydney A man has driven his car off a ledge and crashed on to the street below in Sydney\u2019s inner west. Officers from the Leichhardt police area command were told that a white Hyundai hatchback was travelling on Darghan Street in Glebe, before it crashed on to Railway Street below, about 10.10am today. The driver of hatchback, a 70-year-old man, was treated by paramedics and taken to Royal Prince Alfred hospital in a stable condition. A crime scene has been established and an investigation into the circumstances surrounding this incident has commenced. Talk of recession may loom after weak economic figures Continuing on from our last post, and two other numbers out today weren\u2019t very positive, either. To ease the housing squeeze, we could do with a lot more building. Unfortunately, the number of new dwellings retreated 1% in January, and while better than the 10.1% revised drop in December, economists had been predicting a 4% month-on-month uptick. For private houses, approvals slid 9.9%, and have been in retreat for four months in a row in trend terms. New South Wales led the retreat, with total dwelling approvals down 14.9% with Victoria\u2019s down almost 10%. In the other direction, Queensland somehow pulled out a 31.8% rise and WA 11.4%. Also on the weak side were job advertisements, which declined 2.8% in February, according to the ANZ-Indeed survey. The drop, though, was after January\u2019s figures were revised higher, to a 3.4% gain. As the ANZ said, the downward movement in job ads \u201csuggests there is scope for the unemployment rate to rise further, as do recent changes in labour market flows\u201d. All up, it looks like we might hear a lot about \u201crecession\u201d this week, setting up debate about how soon the Reserve Bank will be cutting interest rates. The RBA board meets on 18-19 March, and presumably won\u2019t be wasting a lot of time talking about lifting interest rates again. Latest economic numbers underscore weakness ahead of December quarter GDP On Wednesday, we\u2019ll get December quarter GDP figures and it\u2019s not out of the question we could get a negative result, at least in quarter-on-quarter terms. CBA, for instance, was predicting GDP would come in at 0.2% growth for the quarter and 1.4% compared with a year earlier. Those forecasts, though, were before a couple of December quarter stats dropped from the ABS. Inventories held by companies sank 1.7%, the ABS said, compared with economists\u2019 consensus of a flat result. This drop will shave off some of that 0.2% tally. Gross operating profits, though, were more promising. They rose 7.4%, or a lot higher than the 1.1% rise expected. (This figure seems to jump around a bit - profits sank 11.5% in the June quarter.) Balance of payments figures are out tomorrow from the ABS which will fill in more of the GDP components. Still on the inventory numbers at least, a few quills will be sharpened today to lower GDP forecasts. (Mind you, on a per capita basis, GDP has been in retreat for a few quarters already once you take out population growth.) A video has been released of the moment two men were rescued from Mount Bogong yesterday: The duo called emergency services for a welfare check on Saturday evening and spent the night on Mount Bogong. They had enough supplies for the evening, so a plan was made to rescue the pair on Sunday morning. The 63-year-old and 71-year-old men were winched to safety by Air Wing officers about 9.30am. Both were checked by paramedics but did not require treatment. Drizzle and humidity behind pole top fires causing WA power outages, Western Power says Western Power says a power outage affecting nearly 30,000 customers across WA is due to pole top fires, following drizzly rain and humid weather. A spokesperson said around 28,000 homes and businesses in the northern metropolitan areas of Wanneroo, Joondalup and Stirling are without power, with around 30 pole incidents. Pole top fires can occur during light drizzling rain or misty, damp conditions when recent dust and pollution builds to create paths or \u201ctracks\u201d on the insulators, enabling electricity to jump across, the spokesperson said. This tracking electricity can heat elements of the pole infrastructure to a point where they smoulder and burn. Crews are working to make hazards safe as a priority, and will assess poles for replacement. Each pole can take around 4 to 8 hours. Western Power said it is communicating with affected customers directly via SMS. Australia\u2019s vacancy rate has reached a new record low of 0.7%, Domain\u2019s February rate report has revealed. However there\u2019s a slight alleviation in tenant competition as the average views per rental listing declined in February and continues to remain lower compared to previous years. Domain\u2019s chief of research and economics, Dr Nicola Powell: While the vacancy rate hits a record low, it\u2019s crucial to consider the bigger rental market picture. The number of prospective tenants per rental listing is easing, indicating falling competition between renters. This supports the trend of slowing rental growth, suggesting demand is pulling back. This could be an early indicator of an increase in vacancy rates sometime this year. There are a number of first-home incentives across the states and the prospects of the hotly discussed Help to Buy scheme. We\u2019ve seen more first-home buyers entering the market. This trend will likely accelerate with the introduction of new incentives for first-time buyers, coupled with the possibility of interest rate cuts. This could translate to reduced demand in the rental market and an increase in available rental properties for tenants. Russian nationals charged after $2.3m cash and crypto seized Two Russian nationals have been charged with money laundering after more than $2.3m in cash and cryptocurrency was seized on the Gold Coast, AAP reports. Australian federal police will allege a man, 49, and a woman, 46, laundered money via hundreds of cash deposits at bank branches and ATMs across NSW, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia in 2022. The deposits were allegedly kept below $10,000 in a bid to avoid detection by authorities. A search of a Hope Island property and solicitor\u2019s office on the Gold Coast found $1.95m in cash and $425,000 in cryptocurrency in December 2023, the AFP said. Substantial financial records were also located. The man and woman have each been charged with three counts of dealing in the proceeds of crime with money or property worth more than $1m. They will appear in Southport magistrates court on Monday. More than 30,000 customers across Western Australia are currently without power. The Western Power outage map shows widespread outages, affecting thousands of customers in south-west parts of the state, including Perth\u2019s northern suburbs. The largest outage is affecting more than 5,000 customers across the City of Joondalup and further north in Caraban, Eglinton, Yanchep, Guilderton, Two Rocks, Wilbinga, Muckenburra, Neergabby, Carabooda, Woodridge, Gabbadah and Yeal. Western Power has not listed a cause of the outage on its map, but we have contacted them for more information and will bring you the latest as soon as we can. Monarchist league says NSW premier \u2018purposefully insulted\u2019 King Charles by not lighting up Opera House The Australian Monarchist League (AML) says it is hopeful that King Charles\u2019 cancer treatment will be successful so he will be \u201cwell enough to visit Australia\u201d later this year. In a statement, the AML said King Charles and Queen Camilla would potentially be visiting on their way to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Samoa, scheduled for late October. We earnestly trust that the premiers will respond positively to the Prime Minister\u2019s call and put forward a constructive case for Their Majesties to visit their State. This is exactly what the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, did this morning, making appeals across breakfast television for the King to visit Sydney (which you can read about here). But the AML was not impressed: This morning Mr Minns has said that \u2018Sydney was an obvious choice for the King to stop at\u2019. He should have thought of that before he purposefully insulted the King on his Coronation Day. Last May, Minns defended the state government\u2019s decision not to light the sails of the Sydney Opera House to mark King Charles\u2019 coronation. The AML argued \u201cthe matter of a republic should have nothing to do with the royal visit\u201d. A-Leagues investigating allegations of heavy-handed police behaviour at weekend matches in Sydney and Brisbane Two allegations of heavy-handed policing at football matches over the weekend are being investigated by the operator of the A-League Mens competition. Australian Professional Leagues issued a statement on X this morning saying the organisation will be seeking information from clubs, venues, police and fans as part of a review. Creating a safe and enjoyable environment both inside and outside our venues for all fans, stakeholders and staff is our number one priority. Many of Western Sydney Wanderers\u2019 so-called \u201cactive\u201d fans left Saturday night\u2019s Sydney derby in protest of behaviour by police, and a video on social media was posted on Sunday showing police officers arguing with and pushing Brisbane Roar fans. A NSW Police statement said its response was part of a \u201chigh-visibility policing operation\u201d. 14 people were ejected from Saturday\u2019s match and two people were issued infringement notices, \u201cone for offensive behaviour and a second for igniting a flare just before full time\u201d. A QPS spokesperson said police were \u201cmostly satisfied with crowd behaviour\u201d at Sunday\u2019s match. Two people were issued with move on directions following \u201calleged anti-social behaviour\u201d and a 16-year-old was arrested for \u201cdisorderly behaviour\u201d after allegedly igniting a flare. Severe thunderstorms possible across Queensland later today Severe thunderstorms are possible this afternoon and evening throughout central and north Queensland, and parts of south-east Queensland north of Toowoomba: More than 100 pieces of correspondence to the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, sent in the week the ABC pulled journalist Antoinette Lattouf off air, were blocked from release to Guardian Australia last week. In the week before Christmas, Lattouf was taken off her final two fill-in shifts on ABC Sydney for posting a Human Rights Watch story on her personal Instagram account. Guardian Australia sought access to communications to Rowland\u2019s office in the week Lattouf was on air, related to Lattouf or the ABC\u2019s coverage of the Israel war in Gaza. It came after WhatsApp group chats revealed a coordinated campaign to the ABC and the minister\u2019s office regarding the war coverage and Lattouf. On Friday, the minister\u2019s office refused to release the 102 pieces of correspondence received by her office in that week under freedom of information laws due to the claim it would \u201cresult in a real, significant or material possibility of prejudice to the impartial adjudication\u201d of the Fair Work Commission case brought by Lattouf against the ABC. A similar FOI request with the ABC is ongoing. Aukus and F-35 fighter costs are known, but why not a \u2018weather bureau\u2019 IT upgrade? Back in 2015, the Bureau of Meteorology was apparently hacked, prompting a major overhaul of its IT system that was labelled Robust. As we reported last August, there have been mounting costs and delays to the program, which should have been up and running by June 2023. There\u2019s already a new supercomputer, Australis 2, becoming less new as it waits for the all-clear. At the time, there were internal concerns about the pace of the program, including the widespread use of outside consultants, and whether critical services the BoM provides might be compromised as funds and staff get diverted to make Robust, well, live up to its name. Senators haven\u2019t been very impressed by the answers they\u2019ve been getting, particularly about the cost of the program. As we report today, BoM chief Andrew Johnson provided details to staff in a video presentation of Australia Day awards \u2013 numbers senators Barbara Pocock and Jonathon Duniam have been keen to know: As Pocock says, there had been rumours the project would cost up to $1bn but the number was considered inappropriate for a public airing. \u201cWhy on earth can\u2019t we find out how much an IT project at the weather bureau will cost?\u201d After all, we know what Aukus submarines and F-35 fighter aircraft are supposed to cost (before those sums are inevitably inflated). It\u2019s a fair guess the next senate estimates will be asking for a few more things from BoM, including making that video public. And, indeed, how soon Robust and Australis 2 will be fully operational. The latest update is in \u201ccalendar 2024\u201d, Johnson told estimates last week. Asked about another major event in Australia this week, the Asean leaders\u2019 summit in Melbourne, Albanese said he wouldn\u2019t be partaking in what\u2019s become a bit of a local tradition. I can assure you that there\u2019ll be no shoeys at Asean. ABC host Craig Reucassel had asked about Kylie Minogue doing a shoey at the Brit Awards over the weekend. Albanese replied: People who know me will be having a chuckle at even the question, the idea that I would ever do a shoey. I\u2019m far too neat and far too clean, it\u2019s something that I would never do. I think it\u2019s a bit weird myself. I am not judgmental about it, mind you. Here\u2019s Our Kylie, doing us proud: Palestine solidarity protest at Mardi Gras \u2018unfortunate\u2019, Albanese says Anthony Albanese said it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that some attenders at Saturday\u2019s Mardi Gras protested near the float holding the NSW premier, Chris Minns. NSW police said they\u2019d charged several people over the protest, where some attendees jumped the fence with a flare and a banner reading \u201cqueer solidarity with Palestinian resistance\u201d. Albanese said: It\u2019s unfortunate, I think, that some people jump the fence to protest about something that isn\u2019t related at all to what Mardi Gras about, which is a fantastic message about inclusiveness and people participating and people being valued for who they are. And I\u2019m sure that it was a good thing that Mardi Gras had Chris Minns, the premier, the first premier to march at Mardi Gras. Anthony Albanese said \u201cwe should\u201d have truth in political advertising laws. But when ABC radio host Craig Reucassel bluntly pointed out \u201cwell you\u2019re in charge of it\u201d, Albanese said they were difficult issues to manage. The PM went on the ABC this morning after the Dunkley by-election result on Saturday, where Labor retained the Melbourne seat. He said the result was \u201creassuring\u201d for the government. Some Labor people maintain the result, where the Liberals picked up a 3% swing but fell well short of winning the seat, means the government needs to do even more on cost of living issues, especially in suburban seats where mortgage and inflation pressures are still hurting many voters. But when asked what message he took from the result, Albanese said the message he saw was \u201cthat Jodie Belyea will take Peta Murphy\u2019s spot as the member for Dunkley.\u201d Which, you\u2019d have to say, is more of an indisputable fact rather than a message. Albanese said: We will work each and every day to make a difference for people. We know people have been under cost of living pressure. Asked about the result, he said the Liberals benefited from an absence of the \u201cfar-right sort of parties\u201d in United Australia and One Nation, which didn\u2019t contest the election. He went on to criticise the opposition and the Advance conservative lobby group, which strongly campaigned against Labor. The Liberal party under Peter Dutton, the lesson that they\u2019ve taken from the last election is to become more conservative and more rightwing. And we saw in the lead up to the byelection just a whole series of fear campaigns being run. And being run as well by Advance, this rightwing group that work hand-in-hand with the Liberal party, spent over a quarter of a million dollars on ads that were pretty disgusting, some of them. I don\u2019t want to see Australia going down that polarised road that we see United States politics going in. But we did see that with some of the advertising and some of the misinformation that was there in that campaign. Asked about truth in advertising laws, which the government has talked about but not made substantive moves to implement, Albanese replied: \u201cI think we should.\u201d When host Reucassel pointed out that Albanese is indeed the prime minister of the country and leader of the government, Albanese said they were tricky reforms. The difficulty is how you deliver it. The people who are putting the ads in, for example Advance, aren\u2019t politicians, they\u2019re not a political party. These things are not easy to achieve. We\u2019re examining, and there\u2019s been various committees look at, how you might achieve that. But it is difficult because some people will argue what the facts are essentially during a political campaign. We have reached the beautiful point in the meme life cycle where Australian agencies begin taking part, tailoring their social media posts and joining in on the fun. Sometimes they\u2019re a hit and sometimes they\u2019re a miss, but when it comes to the Glasgow Willy Wonka experience, there are no misses. Thank you, Environment Protection Authority Victoria: If you have no idea what I\u2019m talking about, you\u2019re *truly* missing out. Please enjoy: Penny Wong announces additional funding for Mekong subregion as Asean summit begins The foreign minister, Penny Wong, has announced a further $222.5m in funding for the Mekong subregion of south-east Asia as the Asean summit kicks off today. In a statement, Wong said the funding is part of the Mekong-Australia Partnership: Since its launch, the Mekong-Australia Partnership has supported the subregion\u2019s environmental and economic resilience, leadership and skills, and trade and investment. This second phase of funding over the next five years will address priorities and shared challenges with a focus on improving water security, responding to climate change and combatting transnational crime. Australia will contribute to strengthened leadership, institutions, and people to people connections to promote shared prosperity \u2026 Australia will continue to work with our Mekong subregion partners to shape and secure the future of the region and all those who rely on it. Push to remove kids from emergency hotel care in New South Wales The number of foster children living in emergency accommodation in NSW has fallen as the state government works to bring a \u201cspiralling\u201d protection system under control, AAP reports. The NSW Department of Communities and Justice created a specialist team in November 2023 to help shift children from emergency accommodation \u2013 such as hotels and motels \u2013 to more permanent arrangements. In November, there were 506 children in emergency arrangements but as of February the figure had dropped to 435. The department is also working to reduce reliance on alternative care arrangements, where for-profit labour hire firms provide staff to supervise children. The use of these private providers has dropped 42%, from 139 children in alternative care in November to 80 in February. The state families minister, Kate Washington, said she had made it clear to the department and child-protection sector that emergency arrangements were not appropriate for long-term care: We want to see children in safe and loving homes with people who care about them, not in a hotel or motel with rotating shift workers who might never see the child again. King Charles should attend NRL grand final, NSW premier suggests Chris Minns is already making the case for King Charles to visit Sydney, if he visits Australia later this year. Overnight, Anthony Albanese said his government was in talks with the states and territories \u201con options for a possible royal visit\u201d later this year. You can read more from Daniel Hurst earlier in the blog here. Speaking to ABC News Breakfast, Minns said: I think he would be warmly welcomed in New South Wales and Sydney and it is the most beautiful city on earth. I\u2019d let the beautiful town do the talking for me. Also we have the grand final coming in October, so maybe he could turn up to the rugby league grand final \u2013 I doubt he has been to a game in New South Wales. That could be a big opportunity for us as well. Minns also told Sunrise: \u201cI mean, this is one of the greatest cities on earth and if you don\u2019t come to Sydney then no one will believe that you came to Australia.\u201d And thus, the state spruiking begins. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, has been making the breakfast TV rounds this morning and commented on the independent inquiry into NSW police policies and procedures, following the killing of Luke Davies and Jesse Baird allegedly by a serving police officer. He told Nine\u2019s Today Show: \u2026 we know change needs to be made. I feel so desperately sorry for the family and friends of Luke and Jesse. Asked if he would back calls for police-issued weapons to be installed with GPS trackers, Minns said he would consider all recommendations from the review. He told Seven\u2019s Sunrise: I have to examine how ubiquitous those GPS trackers are on police equipment, whether they\u2019re available in every police car or on every police officer. We will look at [the recommendations] really closely. \u2013 with AAP 80% of people on low incomes report becoming severely unwell because of heatwaves, including more than 90% of First Nations communities, according to new research from the Australian Council of Social Service. Acoss CEO Cassandra Goldie told ABC News Breakfast around 15% of those people are seeking medical attention and dealing with severe health impacts. Overall, heatwaves are actually 80% of extreme weather hospitalisations, not floods \u2026 It\u2019s very serious, and it\u2019s particularly affecting people on lower incomes. Many people on lower incomes live in areas that are hotter already \u2013 sometimes up to 2% hotter than more wealthy areas where you live \u2013 and then if you\u2019re a renter, you don\u2019t have the same control over your property, and so we really need now these minimum energy efficiency standards brought in across rental properties, so that they are of good standard and the low-cost financing for landlords to do the retrofitting \u2013 that energy efficiency, solar panels, and electrification. We\u2019re nowhere near where we should be at this time. The research involved a survey of 1,007 people across Australia, conducted by Acoss in partnership with First Nations Clean Energy Network. Australia must reinstate funding to UNRWA as \u2018bare minimum\u2019, Save the Children says Save the Children Australia is calling on the federal government to immediately reinstate suspended funding to UNRWA, or it would \u201crisk allowing the collapse of a critical lifeline to more than a million children in Gaza who are deeply traumatised and at imminent risk of starvation\u201d. In a statement, Save the Children said it and other NGOs are doing \u201ceverything they can to support children and families in Gaza\u201d but \u201cit would be impossible for any other organisation or UN agency to replace UNRWA\u201d. Save the Children Australia\u2019s CEO, Mat Tinkler, said that by continuing to withhold funding from UNRWA, Australia and other donors \u201chave effectively removed the crumbs that Gaza\u2019s children are surviving on\u201d. Allowing the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza by refusing to restore funding to UNRWA during one of the worst humanitarian crises in modern history risks the deaths of many more children in this horrific war. The Foreign Minister [Penny Wong] has publicly acknowledged that the only way to stop children from starving to death in Gaza is to resume funding to UNRWA. Yet the Australian Government has not articulated a clear pathway forward that would allow funding to be restored, despite UNRWA warning it will soon have to cease its lifesaving work. Reinstating the suspended funding is the bare minimum Australia should be doing. The magnitude of this crisis requires Australia to take urgent action to help prevent further widespread suffering and death, by increasing its funding to organisations working in Gaza to save lives, including UNRWA and International NGOs. The clock is ticking, and fast. Marles confident Aukus will \u2018enjoy the support of any future American government\u2019 Moving to international matters, Richard Marles was asked whether Aukus is still possible if Donald Trump wins the next US election. He answered with a clear \u201cyes\u201d and said: And the reason I say that is because when you look at the support across the political spectrum in the United States, for Australia [and for Aukus specifically], it is there and we saw that on display at the end of last year when legislation passed through the United States Congress with the support of the full spectrum of American politics. Host Sally Sara noted there was some pushback. Marles continued: I actually think when you sit back and have a look at it, it was fulsome support across the political spectrum \u2026 when it came to the crunch, there was support for Australia but support for the Aukus arrangements across the spectrum, and that does give us a sense of confidence that no matter what the result is in the presidential election at the end of this year, Aukus is going to enjoy the support of any future American government. Government\u2019s cost of living policies \u2018received well\u2019 in Dunkley, Marles says Making the rounds this morning, the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, also spoke to ABC RN and commented on the Dunkley byelection result. The Liberal candidate, Nathan Conroy, received a swing of more than 3% but fell short of the 6.3% required, leaving the Labor candidate, Jodie Belyea, as the newest federal MP. Asked what lessons the government needed to take from Dunkley, Marles said: We\u2019ll go through these results in a lot of detail to really understand what is being said here, and we want to learn everything we can from this result. I mean, it is a matter of historical fact that there tends to be swings against governments in byelections, but that said, we do want to understand exactly all that\u2019s happened here. In the same breath, the fact that our primary vote held up given how popular Peta Murphy had been as a local member, I think says a lot about the campaign Jodie Belyea ran \u2026 It is clear the policies we put in place around cost of living, particularly Labor\u2019s tax cuts, were well received, but we will continue to work hard on our cost of living issues right through until the next election. \u2018Context has changed\u2019 since NSW lit up Opera House to support Israel, Minns says ABC News Breakfast host Michael Rowland: You ordered the lighting up of the Sydney Opera House sails in support of Israel after 1,200 Israelis were murdered by Hamas terrorists on October 7. Since then, 30,000 Palestinians have died. Will you consider lighting up the Sydney Opera House in support of Palestine? The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said \u201cthe context has changed\u201d. This is an international conflict now and I don\u2019t want to further exacerbate or pull apart Sydney\u2019s already quite volatile mix. I would make the point that much of what will be said in New South Wales will [not] affect the peace situation in the Middle East, but a lot of what could be said can affect peace right here in this state. So we need to be careful with our commentary, we need to focus on not exacerbating community tensions or divisions, and that\u2019s going to be the NSW government\u2019s approach over the coming months. \u2018Difficult to bring the community together right now\u2019 after iftar cancellation, Minns says Chris Minns said he can understand the concerns of Muslim and Arab communities in New South Wales about what\u2019s happening in Gaza. This comes as Muslim groups decided to boycott the state iftar dinner, before it was ultimately cancelled: Speaking to ABC News Breakfast Minns said: I don\u2019t pretend \u2026 that there\u2019s complete unanimity on these matters. This is a very complicated international [matter] in the Middle East. We\u2019ve got large expat communities on either side of that conflict in New South Wales. It\u2019s very difficult to bring the community together right now. What I would say is that my focus has got to be peace and security on the streets of Sydney in particular, and we\u2019ll do our best to promote harmony in NSW but that\u2019s going to take a bit of time. Chris Minns, said it is \u201ca bit strange\u201d that he was the first NSW premier to march in the Mardi Gras parade at the weekend, \u201cgiven that it [has been] a fixture on the calendar for decades\u201d. Speaking to ABC News Breakfast, Minns said a pro-Palestine protest that took place during the march on Saturday \u201cwasn\u2019t too much of a big deal on the night\u201d. He said: Look, a lot has been made of it, but to be honest, it wasn\u2019t too much of a big deal on the night. I mean, there was some coloured flares that went off, and I said yesterday, I thought that that was actually part of Mardi Gras. So I don\u2019t think that it disrupted me or the march too much. A little bit of protest at Mardi Gras is probably pretty standard, so not the end of the world. No tsunami threat after 6.8 magnitude earthquake off Macquarie Island A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit near Macquarie Island overnight. The Bureau of Meteorology said there is no tsunami threat to Australia: Macquarie Island is uninhabited, located around 1,500km south-east of Tasmania. Royal visit this year would be \u2018really tremendous and popular event\u2019: Marles Richard Marles was also asked about a potential visit from King Charles, following news the prime minister Anthony Albanese is going ahead with plans for a potential visit later this year. Q: Do you reckon people care? Will there be that much excitement about a visit if it happens later on this year? Marles told ABC News Breakfast: I think people care. And you\u2019re right \u2013 we are very much thinking about King Charles at the moment in terms of his battle with cancer. But King Charles has a long connection with this country. Obviously, he went to school in his youth here in Australia, and this would be his first visit to Australia as the King \u2026 I think that a royal visit by King Charles and Queen Camilla later in the year would be a really, really tremendous and popular event, and I do think that Australians would very much welcome seeing King Charles in our country later this year. Asean \u2018completely central\u2019 for Australia\u2019s economic and security future, defence minister says The defence minister, Richard Marles, says with the exception of Myanmar, every Asean leader is in Melbourne ready for the summit kicking off today. Speaking to ABC News Breakfast just earlier, Marles was asked how much the rise of China would be front and centre of discussion among leaders there. He said leaders would discuss China \u201cin the sense that they are part of the global landscape\u201d but the meeting itself is not about China. Marles, who is also deputy prime minister, said Asean is not only \u201ccompletely central\u201d in terms of Australia\u2019s economic future, but also central in terms of Australia\u2019s security future. The defence of Australia doesn\u2019t mean that much unless we have a stable and peaceful and secure south-east Asia. And so, we feel deeply connected both in an economic and a security sense with Asean, and I think that those countries feel the same in relation to Australia, which is why there is such a significant turnout of Asean. The host noted that diaspora communities from countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos are urging the government to raise human rights concerns in those countries. Marles said he wouldn\u2019t \u201cgo into the details of what will be said in every meeting\u201d, but said: Australia is always an advocate of human rights and we do that in the meetings that we have around the world. And so, you can be assured that we will carve out our business in the way that we normally would in the course of these meetings. Firefighters battle blazes in Tasmania and Western Australia overnight A caravan park has been evacuated and residents warned to leave as a bushfire rages in Tasmania\u2019s north-west, AAP reports. Fire crews were actively responding to the blaze at Port Latta on Sunday, with authorities evacuating the Crayfish Creek caravan park and setting up an evacuee centre at the Rocky Cape community hall. The fire was within containment lines on Sunday night but crews would remain on site overnight due to the risk of spot fires, Tasmania Fire Service said in a statement. Meanwhile, lives and homes were threatened after a bushfire in mid-west Western Australia jumped containment lines. A bushfire emergency warning was issued on Sunday for people in an area bounded by Brand Highway to the west, Skipper Road to the south and Correy Road to the east in parts of Arrowsmith and Arrowsmith East in WA\u2019s Irwin and Three Springs shires. The alert level was downgraded to watch and act last night after a change in wind direction. Emergency WA said the blaze had been sparked by lightning. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is due to meet the Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, in Melbourne today on the first day of a three-day special Asean summit. Australia is not a member of Asean \u2013 the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \u2013 but the special summit marks 50 years since Australia became the regional grouping\u2019s first dialogue partner. Timor-Leste, which wants to become an Asean member, will also attend the summit. There are a range of bilateral meetings planned while leaders are in Australia. Albanese has previously said Anwar would be honoured as a guest of government today. Albanese said in a statement issued in advance of the three-day summit: Australia sees Asean at the centre of a stable, peaceful, and prosperous region. Strengthening our relationship ensures our shared future prosperity and security. The Australian government is pressing ahead with planning for a possible visit by King Charles later this year. The idea doesn\u2019t come out of the blue: it was previously reported that King Charles might visit Australia and New Zealand in October 2024. But those plans were placed in doubt last month when Buckingham Palace revealed Charles had begun regular treatment for cancer. In a statement issued overnight, Anthony Albanese said his government was in talks with the states and territories \u201con options for a possible royal visit\u201d. The prime minister said: Australia is preparing for a possible visit from His Majesty The King to Australia later this year. The King has shown his compassion for Australians affected by recent natural disasters, just as Australians have shown compassion and support for the King following his cancer diagnosis. The King, Queen and members of the Royal Family are always welcome in Australia. Charles last visited Australia in 2018, when he was the Prince of Wales, to open the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. And happy Monday \u2013 welcome to a new week on the Australia news liveblog. I\u2019m Emily Wind, and I\u2019ll be taking you through our rolling coverage today. But first, here are some of the biggest stories from overnight: the Australian government is moving ahead with plans for a potential visit by King Charles later this year, despite the King\u2019s cancer diagnosis. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said his government was in talks with the states and territories \u201con options for a possible royal visit\u201d. Meanwhile, Albanese is due to meet the Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, in Melbourne today on the first day of a three-day special Asean summit. We will have more on both these stories from Daniel Hurst in a moment. Firefighters are battling two separate blazes \u2013 one at Port Latta in Tasmania\u2019s north-west, and one at Arrowsmith in midwest Western Australia. The fire at Port Latta was within containment lines but crews remained on site overnight due to the risk of spot fires, and in WA, an emergency warning was downgraded to a watch and act last night after a change in wind direction. More on these from AAP shortly. See something that needs attention? You can get in touch via X, @emilywindwrites, or send me an email: emily.wind@theguardian.com. Let\u2019s get started."

            "date": "2024-03-30T16:00:14Z",
            "content": "The catastrophic collapse of the Francis Scott Key bridge in Baltimore was shocking. Local people expressed dismay at the sudden disintegration of a familiar landmark they had known all their lives. The post-1945 international order is a bit like that bridge. It was always there. Its authority, rules and resilience were taken for granted. Now, alarmingly, the entire global edifice is in freefall as the usual supports are kicked away. The sense of things breaking apart is profound \u2013 and the negative ramifications are everywhere. The UN charter, bedrock of international law, is routinely flouted. The UN security council finally agreed an \u201cimmediate\u201d Gaza ceasefire last week, only to see it contemptuously ignored. In Ukraine, Myanmar and Sudan, war crimes and alleged genocide go unpunished and unchecked. Russia, Iran and India, among others, send assassins overseas to eliminate political opponents. Undeclared cyberwarfare knows no bounds. Perceptions of permanent, lawless rupture are especially strong in the Middle East following the 7 October attacks and the Israel-Hamas war. The scale of the atrocities is alarming. So, too, is the impunity with which they have been met. UN court of justice orders to prevent famine receive mere lip service. The relationship between the US and Israel, a regional keystone, is at breaking point. President Joe Biden and Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, barely speak. Biden demands more aid deliveries, a stop to threats of assault on Rafah, where 1.4 million Palestinians cower in fear and hunger, and postwar talks on a two-state solution. Netanyahu, dubbed Israel\u2019s self-harming \u201cagent of destruction\u201d, blocks him at every turn. Israel\u2019s internal crisis waxes existential as Netanyahu, his anti-democratic extremist allies and far-right settler groups turn insurrectionary. If critics are right, and Netanyahu is prolonging the war to stay in power, it follows he may escalate in the West Bank and Lebanon. This is already happening, judging by last week\u2019s Israeli attacks. The US volte-face at the UN, when it finally allowed a Gaza ceasefire resolution to pass, was encouraging, up to a point. Yet neither the US nor the UK has taken steps to enforce it. Permanent security council members Russia and China prefer grandstanding to pursuing peace and justice. The Arab states are a study in impotence. The US belatedly shifted ground not because it suddenly noticed that more than 32,000 people, including thousands of children, have been killed in Gaza or that food is being used as a weapon. State department lawyers are in denial about that. US pressure is growing because Biden is haemorrhaging support in an election year and feels humiliated by Netanyahu. Israeli commentators suggest the rift may prove irreparable. \u201cSenior US officials complain they don\u2019t understand what Netanyahu wants. But [it] is quite clear. Political survival is his top priority. And if continuing the war, even amid growing claims that Israel is violating the laws of war, is what will keep him in office, he\u2019s completely prepared to do so. All means are kosher, apparently, including further delay in finalising a hostage deal,\u201d wrote Amos Harel in Haaretz. Biden\u2019s Middle East policy \u2013 whether the issue is Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, Chinese influence-peddling, reviving Islamic State terrorism, a grand bargain with Saudi Arabia or the future of Palestine \u2013 is in tatters. The same might be said of Britain, another staunch ally of Israel which, in these meagre post-Brexit days, follows Washington\u2019s lead on almost everything. David Cameron, the UK foreign secretary and former prime minister, has taken a tougher line as the Gaza war drags on. He has confronted Netanyahu over aid and floated recognition of a Palestinian state in a future peace process. Britain went further than the US by backing last week\u2019s UN ceasefire. All this provides a welcome contrast to Cameron\u2019s lazy, incompetent Foreign Office predecessors, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Dominic Raab. Yet Britain is still supplying arms to Israel; has penalised the UN aid agency in Gaza, Unrwa, on spurious grounds; and, incredibly, will still not officially declare that Israel\u2019s actions breach humanitarian law. Cameron is an improvement but hardly a radical. The UK, as a permanent UN security council member and G7 country, shares responsibility for the overall breakdown in international law and order. Britain, for example, should be pushing for a more forceful Nato response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. It should be leading efforts to punish China for Hong Kong and abuses in Xinjiang and agree safer, humane ways to manage international migration. The UK should be increasing, not cutting, foreign aid. It should be setting an example by reducing its nuclear weapons arsenal, in line with treaty obligations. It should call out oppressive regimes like Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia. And it should be bolstering democracies around the world, not divorcing itself from those next door in Europe \u2013 which, of course, is the hapless Cameron\u2019s lasting, indelible legacy. What might be rescued from the wreckage in Palestine that could help reverse nihilistic global trends? Netanyahu\u2019s unthinking aggression is boosting, not beating, Hamas politically. He has transformed genuine revulsion at the terrorists\u2019 atrocities into swelling support for the cause they supposedly espouse and he detests \u2013 an independent, sovereign Palestinian state. This is the moderate Palestinian majority\u2019s chance. As a divided, traumatised, ill-led and ostracised Israel tears itself apart, as its historical, ideological and democratic credentials shred, re-establishing a credible negotiating process with the explicit, internationally endorsed aim of two states co-existing side by side may \u2013 ironically \u2013 be the best and only way of saving Israel from itself. It may also be the best hope of saving the community of nations from further descent into lawlessness. The world badly needs a win. The bridge in Baltimore can be rebuilt. But who will rebuild global trust? \u2022 Simon Tisdall is the Observer\u2019s foreign affairs commentator Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "date": "2024-03-27T16:21:45Z",
            "content": "A former Royal Air Force officer who has led Sellafield\u2019s information security for more than a decade is to leave the vast nuclear waste site in north-west England, it can be revealed. Richard Meal, who is chief information security officer at the Cumbrian site, is to leave later this year. Meal will be the second senior leader to depart the organisation this year, after the top director responsible for safety and security \u2013 Mark Neate \u2013 announced in January that he planned to leave. His imminent departure follows several safety and cybersecurity failings, as well as claims of a \u201ctoxic\u201d working culture, that were revealed in Nuclear Leaks, a year-long Guardian investigation into Sellafield, late last year. Sellafield said no staff departures were linked to the revelations. Sellafield, which has more than 11,000 staff, was placed into a form of \u201cspecial measures\u201d in 2022 for consistent failings on cybersecurity, according to sources at the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the security services. Sellafield said it did not have evidence of a successful cyber-attack after the Guardian revealed that groups linked to Russia and China had penetrated its networks. Meal joined Sellafield, the nuclear waste and decommissioning site in Cumbria that is also the world\u2019s largest store of plutonium, in late 2013. In his early career, he spent nearly two decades in the Royal Air Force in security positions until 2005. He then held a string of consultancy roles, including at industry giant KPMG. In 2016, Meal told Sellafield\u2019s in-house magazine that the cost of getting cybersecurity measures wrong was \u201chuge\u201d. \u201cFrom a financial level, the cost of returning a plant to service if it was shut down could be in the millions of pounds. That\u2019s before you consider the operational impact on delivering our mission, and the need to manage safety and reputational issues,\u201d he said. Last year, Meal was appointed to the North West Cyber Resilience Centre\u2019s guidance council, which helps businesses across the region protect themselves against the threat of cybercrime. It is chaired by Andrew Snowden, the police and crime commissioner for Lancashire. In response to the Guardian\u2019s investigation, the energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, said the reports were \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and wrote to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), the state-owned body that ultimately runs Sellafield, demanding a \u201cfull explanation\u201d. In his response, the NDA\u2019s chief executive, David Peattie, said there had been \u201cnecessary changes to the leadership, governance, and risk management of cyber\u201d and responsibility for its cyber function had been moved. A new head of cybersecurity took up the role in January. Sellafield declined to name the new appointee. On announcing his departure, Neate said that he had decided last year \u201cthat 2024 was the right time for me to move on\u201d. He will be replaced this week by the current head of the site\u2019s \u201cspent fuel management value stream\u201d, James Millington, on an interim basis. Separately, Nic Westcott, the former Openreach and Severn Trent executive, was seconded from Nuclear Waste Services in January as interim chief people officer. In its latest annual report, the ONR stated that \u201cimprovements are required\u201d from Sellafield and other sites in order to address cybersecurity risks. It also confirmed that the site was in \u201csignificantly enhanced attention\u201d for this activity. A spokesperson for Sellafield said: \u201cWe take cybersecurity extremely seriously at Sellafield. We work with our regulators to continuously review and improve where required.\u201d The spokesperson said: \u201cWe have not initiated or conducted an investigation nor have we made any personnel changes as a result of the Guardian\u2019s allegations.\u201d Britain\u2019s public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, last month launched an investigation into risks and costs at Sellafield. The Nuclear Leaks series detailed concerns over cracks in the concrete and asphalt skin of a toxic point known as the First Generation Magnox storage pond or informally as \u201cDirty 30\u201d. This week, Sellafield said that the building had been \u201cprioritised for cleanup\u201d by the NDA and that the first \u201czeolite skip\u201d \u2013 containers used to absorb radiation in the 1970s and 1980s \u2013 had been removed and placed in a shielded box. Separately, Sellafield released its gender pay report for the year to 5 April 2023, which showed the median gender pay gap had risen to 13.7% from 11.3% a year earlier. The proportion of women in the upper quartile of its pay scale was static, at 18%. Sellafield issued a range of responses to the Guardian\u2019s initial reports into its cybersecurity, safety and cultural issues, which it published online."

            "date": "2024-03-16T12:50:18Z",
            "content": "Leicester find themselves in a FA Cup quarter-final for the first time since going on to win the competition three years ago when, in front of the biggest crowd to attend a game since the coronavirus lockdown, they overcame Chelsea at Wembley. For Leicester, that day can be split into lasting snapshots of a momentous victory: Youri Tielemans locating the top corner with a screamer from 25 yards, Brendan Rodgers subsequently haring off down the touchline and Prince William handing Kasper Schmeichel the trophy. The confetti rained down as Schmeichel and Wes Morgan, all smiles, lifted the silverware overhead. Leicester, three points clear at the top of the Championship going into this weekend, may well get their hands on another trophy this season but, as they prepare to visit Chelsea in the Cup on Sunday, it is pertinent to remember the degree to which the weeks that followed that unforgettable Wembley win shaped their current predicament. Three days later, Leicester lost 2-1 at Stamford Bridge to leave them relying on favours when it came to qualifying for the Champions League. Then, on the final day, they lost at home to Tottenham to miss out on the top four in the last knockings of the season for successive years. After two near-misses at returning to Europe\u2019s elite competition and with the most prestigious domestic cup secured for the first time, Leicester set about trying to kick on. As the club statement accompanying their 2021-22 accounts detailing a record \u00a392.5m loss outlined: \u201cThe club sought to build on the successes of preceding seasons.\u201d They were, of course, the masters behind arguably the greatest footballing miracle when in 2016, two years after promotion from the Championship, they won the Premier League against all odds. Perhaps the key line came from the club\u2019s chief executive, Susan Whelan. \u201cIn order to remain compliant with the game\u2019s regulations both domestically and in Europe \u2013 where we aim to compete regularly \u2013 our ongoing investment strategy must continue to reflect our underlying revenue progression,\u201d she said, before referencing the importance of player trading \u2013 in effect buying cheap to sell high \u2013 and shrewd recruitment. Now we know Leicester are at serious risk of falling foul of those regulations; they face the potential double whammy of a points deduction from the Premier League after allegedly breaking its profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) relating to the three-year cycle ending 2022-23 and punishment from the English Football League if they breach its similar regulations in the three-year cycle that ends this summer. Unless Leicester generate funds through sales before 30 June, the EFL\u2019s club financial reporting unit, a panel set up two years ago to monitor compliance with the regulations, believes Leicester will exceed the permitted \u00a383m losses across the relevant period. Leicester have confirmed they are \u201cin discussions with football authorities regarding its profitability and sustainability calculations\u201d. After missing out on qualifying for the Champions League in 2020 and 2021 \u2013 losing out to Chelsea on the final day both years \u2013 the club were determined not to stand still. They spent about \u00a350m on players, including Patson Daka, Boubakary Soumar\u00e9, Ryan Bertrand and Jannik Vestergaard, none of whom made a lasting impact in the top flight before the disastrous relegation last season. Leicester\u2019s \u00a3182m wage bill in 2021-22 was the seventh-biggest in the Premier League and, for the first time since returning to the top flight, they did not sell a major asset. In the five previous years they commanded huge fees for N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, Danny Drinkwater, Riyad Mahrez, Harry Maguire and Ben Chilwell, generating more than \u00a3250m. Tielemans, who joined Aston Villa on a free last year, was thought to be next but the club received no bids. The impact of Covid hampered clubs\u2019 ability to sell players in a crashed market. Leicester, understandably, felt they could push on but finished eighth. And then 18th. The destabilising noises about Leicester\u2019s battle to meet PSR are nothing new. In the summer before they were relegated, Rodgers conceded the finances were far from ideal and told how he lost out on transfer targets after the club put the brakes on spending, despite the \u00a375m sale of Wesley Fofana, also to Chelsea. Since the January window Enzo Maresca, who took charge last summer, has sounded his frustration at not being able to add to his squad. His primary target was the Internazionale midfielder Stefano Sensi but he was told the club needed to sell players before any strengthening. All clubs are mindful sales of homegrown players generate pure profit \u2013 it is seen as a golden method to offset spending \u2013 though Leicester rejected a \u00a320m bid from Brighton for Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall in January. The off-pitch revenue streams that can make the world of difference on the balance sheets, such as lucrative commercial deals or increased ticket sales via stadium expansion, are slow-burners. It is also important to note that PSR rules include provisions for allowable expenditure, such as money invested in stadium and training-ground improvements, women\u2019s football and the community. As Leicester prepare to release their latest set of accounts, pertaining to 2022-23, at the end of this month, they are in a peculiar position. Their owner, King Power International, has deep pockets but Leicester, like all clubs intent on destabilising order in the top flight, have to play by the rules. The summer after one of their greatest days has proved a noose around their necks. Not so long ago Leicester were rightly championed as the model club but one fatal misstep, if they did not know it already, can prove extremely costly."

            "date": "2024-03-05T09:00:04Z",
            "content": "Women in rural areas suffer substantially greater economic losses from the impacts of climate breakdown than men in developing countries, research has shown, and the gap is likely to widen further. Households headed by women in rural areas lost about 8% more of their income to heat stress than male-headed households, and their reduction in income when floods struck was about 3% greater than the loss to men, according to data released by the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on Tuesday. The difference, taken across the world\u2019s low- and middle-income countries, adds up to about an extra $37bn lost to women from heat stress and $16bn extra from floods each year. The researchers estimate a 1C increase in long-term average temperatures is associated with a reduction of about a third in the incomes of female-headed households, compared with those of male-headed households. Children and women also tend to have to work more when extreme high temperatures strike, with children working nearly an hour extra a week in rural areas on average, according to the report. Lauren Phillips, the deputy director of inclusive rural transformation and gender equality at the FAO and a co-author of the report, said governments were failing to take into account the factors that disadvantage women, and climate aid was not targeted in ways that would address the gender gap. She said the report was the first to quantify this clearly. \u201cThis gender gap can have a very dramatic impact on GDP growth,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cWe could increase GDP by 1% globally if we could reduce food insecurity for 45 million people, by focusing on women.\u201d Less than 2% of climate finance globally is estimated to reach small-scale food producers. Women are hit harder than men by the climate crisis in part because the impacts exacerbate existing inequalities, such as unequal rights to land tenure and a lack of economic opportunities for women. Women also tend to bear more of the burden of providing water, fuel and food. Governments and donors could address these problems with better targeting of assistance, Phillips said. \u201cTargeting women in ways that ensure their empowerment has greater benefits,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are multiple gains and benefits from targeting climate finance at women. We need to intentionally focus on this, to get much higher returns on investment.\u201d The researchers analysed socioeconomic data from more than 100,000 rural households, representing more than 950 million people, across 24 low- and middle-income countries. They cross-referenced this with 70 years of daily precipitation and temperature data to build a detailed picture of how changes to the climate and extreme weather affected people\u2019s incomes, labour and lives. It adds to a growing body of research that shows women and vulnerable people suffer disproportionately from the impacts of the climate crisis. The report also found that older people tended to be more affected than the young, who may have more opportunities to move to escape the impacts of extreme weather, and the already poor were more vulnerable than those on higher incomes. Maximo Torero Cullen, the chief economist at the FAO, wrote in the foreword to the report: \u201cClimate change is widening even further existing income gaps in rural areas, pushing vulnerable people towards maladaptive coping strategies and ultimately making it harder for these groups to escape cycles of poverty and hunger.\u201d Poorer households were hit by losses about 5% greater on average than their better-off neighbours when flooding or extreme temperatures struck, the report found. Phillips said: \u201cWhat we found was that climate change was making the rural poor more dependent on agriculture. Agriculture will become more difficult as the climate changes further.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-18T13:41:01Z",
            "content": "Nottingham Forest said they were \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by a four-point deduction that plunged them into the Premier League relegation zone, despite receiving a lesser punishment than Everton for breaching profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) because they admitted guilt early and fully cooperated with the independent commission. Everton were given a 10-point deduction, reduced to six on appeal, for a \u00a319.5m overspend, whereas Forest breached permitted losses of \u00a361m by \u00a334.5m. The commission believed Forest were worthy of the same punishment but said a potential six-point loss was reduced to four owing to the club\u2019s \u201cearly plea and the cooperation together\u201d. The Premier League had argued for an eight-point deduction. Forest were left infuriated by the decision and process. They claimed spending restrictions on promoted clubs, whose permitted losses are reduced by \u00a322m for each season across the three-year accounting period they spend in the EFL, undermined the league\u2019s \u201cintegrity and competitiveness\u201d. They have dropped to 18th, one point behind Luton, and are considering whether to appeal. A Forest statement said: \u201cWe were extremely dismayed by the tone and content of the Premier League\u2019s submissions before the commission \u2026 We believe that the high levels of cooperation the club has shown during this process, and which are confirmed and recorded in the commission\u2019s decision, were not reciprocated by the Premier League.\u201d The commission rejected much of Forest\u2019s mitigating evidence. One of the club\u2019s key arguments related to the sale of Brennan Johnson. The forward was a key asset because, as an academy graduate, all money earned from his sale would count as profit. The club knew they would need to sell a player to comply with PSR by 30 June and described their failure to do so as a \u201cnear miss\u201d. They received an offer for Johnson of \u20ac50m (\u00a342.9m) on that date from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid but demanded \u20ac65m (\u00a355.8m). Three offers were received from Brentford between early July and late August but all were rejected, before Johnson was sold on 1 September to Tottenham for \u00a347.5m. The commission believes the club could have done more to complete Johnson\u2019s transfer by 30 June, with a number of teams interested, and that missing the deadline by more than two months could not be classified as a \u201cnear miss\u201d. Forest said: \u201cThe commission\u2019s decision raises issues of concern for all aspirant clubs \u2026 There will be occasions when a player transfer cannot be completed in the first half of a transfer window andcan only be completed at the end of that window. This should not be a reason for the condemnation of a club. For this not to be recognised by the commission or the Premier League should be a matter of extreme concern for all fans of our national game.\u201d Premier League clubs are allowed to lose \u00a3105m over a three-year period but Forest\u2019s permitted losses were limited to \u00a361m because they spent two years of that period in the Championship. This was another part of their defence, with the club claiming they were hamstrung after being promoted because investment is vital to challenge at a higher level against more established teams. \u201cWe were also surprised that the Premier League gave no consideration at all to the unique circumstances of the club and its mitigation,\u201d Forest said. \u201cIn circumstances where this approach is followed by future PSR commissions, it would make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for newly promoted clubs without parachute payments to compete, thus undermining the integrity and competitiveness of the Premier League.\u201d The commission said the punishment was \u201ca proportionate sanction to maintain the integrity of the Premier League\u201d and was designed \u201cto give the public confidence that when a club invests as Forest did to compete in the Premier League, it still needs to comply with the PSR threshold for losses\u201d. Forest have seven days to appeal. There is a deadline of 24 May \u2013 five days after the season \u2013 for any PSR appeals to be concluded."

            "content": "In advance of International Women\u2019s Day, your timely piece on the World Bank\u2019s new report finding no equality for working women in any country (5 March) was a stark reminder of the work left ahead. However, it\u2019s important ask whether there is equality for working women at the World Bank itself, or any of the seven major international financial institutions (IFIs) that my colleagues and I studied in 2023. At the time we found that, though the share of women in leadership at these important institutions has doubled in the last two decades, not a single IFI had reached gender parity in its management ranks. Since the study was released, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has achieved gender parity in management \u2013 which is to say that only one IFI has achieved this at any point in time. It\u2019s also worth noting that gender equality gains are easily reversed and prone to periods of stagnation. Most IFIs recognise the essential role women must play in development, and have put forth robust gender strategies. The World Bank places the engagement of female leaders as one of three strategic objectives. Yet only two out of nine IFIs have a female head; and no woman of colour has ever been the head of an IFI. Their boards of directors are even further from parity than the managerial positions filled by technocratic ranks. It\u2019s important that these institutions, collectively responsible for more than a quarter of a trillion dollars of lending in 2022, lead by example. They should do it because it\u2019s right, and central to their work. Closing the gender gap has been labelled \u201cmacrocritical\u201d: essential to economic growth, financial stability, and lower income inequality. As we ask what more can be done for gender equality this International Women\u2019s Day, we must also look at the role we all can and should play.

            "date": "2024-03-08T04:25:14Z",
            "content": "US forces will build a temporary dock on the Gaza shoreline to allow delivery of humanitarian aid on a large scale, Joe Biden announced in his State of the Union speech, amid warnings of a widespread famine among the territory\u2019s 2.3 million Palestinians. \u201cNearly two million more Palestinians under bombardment or displaced, homes destroyed, neighborhoods in rubble, cities in ruin, families without food, water, medicine. It\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Biden said on Thursday night, declaring that the US was leading humanitarian relief efforts. \u201cTonight, I\u2019m directing the US military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the Gaza coast that can receive large ships carrying food, water, medicine and temporary shelters,\u201d the president said. He promised \u201cno US boots will be on the ground\u201d, and said: \u201cThis temporary pier would enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day.\u201d But Biden warned Israel that it \u201cmust also do its part.\u201d \u201cTo the leadership of Israel I say this,\u201d he said. \u201cHumanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.\u201d The White House made clear that the decision to open a sea route for aid into Gaza had come with frustration of what is seen in Washington as Israeli obstruction of road deliveries on a substantial scale. \u201cWe are not waiting on the Israelis. This is a moment for American leadership,\u201d a senior official said. The scheme will take several weeks to put into action, however, carrying the risk of supplying too little relief, too late. While aid experts welcomed it as a step in the right direction, they said it was a less effective way of getting aid into Gaza than the US using its leverage to make Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government open more land routes to more humanitarian assistance. \u201cThis just shows the lengths to which President Biden is being forced to go to avoid actually putting meaningful pressure on Netanyahu,\u201d said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former senior aid official in the Biden administration, now president of the Refugees International aid advocacy organisation. The temporary pier will be built by US military engineers operating from ships off the coast of the old Gaza City port in the Rimal district, aid sources said. US troops would not need to step ashore, but could build the floating dock from ships offshore, according to US officials. The aid deliveries will be shipped from the port of Larnaca in Cyprus, which will become the main relief hub. \u201cTonight, the president will announce in his State of the Union address that he has directed the US military to undertake an emergency mission to establish a port in Gaza, working in partnership with like-minded countries and humanitarian partners,\u201d the official said. \u201cThis port, the main feature of which is a temporary pier, will provide the capacity for hundreds of additional truckloads of assistance each day.\u201d Biden\u2019s announcement on Thursday night is due to be followed by a joint statement by the countries and humanitarian organisations involved in the sea corridor. One of the nations involved is the United Arab Emirates, but it is unclear whether they would offer troops to secure the aid bridgehead. Aid groups have said that efforts to deliver desperately needed supplies to the beleaguered territory have been hampered by difficulties coordinating with the Israeli military, ongoing hostilities and the breakdown of public order. Biden has been fiercely criticised within his own party for the failure to open up Gaza to humanitarian aid, with a famine looming and 30,000 Palestinians dead already since the start of war on 7 October. The UN said in February that more than a quarter of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people were \u201cestimated to be facing catastrophic levels of deprivation and starvation\u201d. It said without action widespread famine could be \u201calmost inevitable\u201d. Israeli officials will be able to conduct inspections of the aid shipments in Larnaca, administration officials said. \u201cWe will coordinate with the Israelis on the security requirements on land and work with the UN and humanitarian NGOs on the distribution of assistance within Gaza,\u201d a senior official said. \u201cInitial shipments will come via Cyprus enabled by the US military and a coalition of partners and allies. This new significant capability will take a number of weeks to plan and execute. The forces that will be required to complete this mission there are either already in the region or will begin to move there soon.\u201d The White House said that the operation would not involve boots on the ground, as the port and its temporary pier could be built from off the coast. \u201cThe concept that\u2019s been planned involves the presence of US military personnel on military vessels offshore but does not require US military personnel to go ashore to install the pier or causeway facility that will allow the transportation and humanitarian assistance ashore,\u201d a senior official said. Israel \u201cfully supports\u201d creation of such a facility, an Israeli official told Reuters. The independent US senator Bernie Sanders welcomed the proposal, but said the obstructionism of the Israeli government \u201cled to this incredible situation, in which a US ally is using US weapons and equipment to block the delivery of US humanitarian aid\u201d. He added: \u201cAnd now American taxpayers have to pay even more to build a port to get aid into starving people, because Israel won\u2019t let it be driven safely and efficiently across the border.\u201d Until now, the only land access routes for food aid into Gaza have been at the southern end of the strip, at Rafah and Kerem Shalom, but the flow of assistance has rarely been more than a trickle in relation to the vast needs of 2.3 million Palestinians. Fewer than 100 trucks a day are getting across. Looting has become one of the problems hindering deliveries, but Israeli inspections have led to many truckloads of aid being rejected if they contained anything from a long list of prohibited goods. There has also been a lack of coordination, with aid convoys with official permission to go to northern Gaza being turned back by Israeli soldiers at checkpoints. US officials believe Benjamin Netanyahu is balancing different wings of his coalition \u2013 in which extreme rightwingers oppose any aid deliveries \u2013 with a compromise that only lets in a token amount. \u201cThe president has directed that we look at all options, that we not wait for the Israelis and we are pursuing every channel possible to get assistance into Gaza. So we will do it by air, by sea, by land \u2013 however we can get the maximum amount in,\u201d a senior US official said. US military transport planes, acting jointly with the Jordanian air force on Thursday, made a third airdrop of food aid over Gaza in a week, bringing the total of US military-style rations dropped to nearly 113,000. However, each airdrop is typically equivalent to a handful of truckloads of food, and nowhere near enough to meet the needs of a population on the brink of starvation. \u201cIn order to avert a famine, we need huge volumes of assistance. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people. Airdrops are not an option for averting famine,\u201d said the deputy executive director of the World Food Programme, Carl Skau, who appealed for a sea corridor to be opened. The White House said that Israel had also agreed to open a third road crossing into Gaza, giving more direct access to northern Gaza, where the threat of famine is the most imminent. \u201cOver recent days at our request, the government of Israel has prepared a new land crossing directly into northern Gaza. This third crossing will allow for aid to flow directly to the population in northern Gaza that is in dire need of assistance,\u201d an administration official said. James McGoldrick, the interim UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, confirmed on Thursday that the Israeli army had \u201cgiven the green light\u201d for use of a military road leading from east to northern Gaza."

            "title": "Moscow attack is grim reminder that large-scale acts of terror have not gone away",
            "date": "2024-03-23T15:55:33Z",
            "content": "It was a warning that proved grimly prophetic. Just over two weeks ago, as Russia\u2019s presidential election was reaching its final stages, the US embassy in Moscow said it was \u201cmonitoring reports that extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow, to include concerts\u201d over the ensuing 48 hours. The unusually clear public alert was repeated by the UK, which reiterated its longstanding advice, warning British citizens against going to Russia. As a close ally in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, Britain will have seen whatever raw intelligence the US warning was based on, most likely intercepted communications. No attack came within that timeframe, but it is now tragically clear the respite was only temporary. A terrorist attack on Friday night by a group of gunmen on crowds attending a pop concert on the outskirts of Moscow has left at least 133 dead and 140 wounded, responsibility for which was claimed by Islamic State. Whether more details underpinning the warning were passed from the US to their Russian counterparts is unclear, given the two countries are engaged in a proxy war in Ukraine, nor is it certain the alert would have been well received. But it is an uncomfortable reminder that large-scale terror attacks have not gone away. Moscow, meanwhile, is trying to promote an alternative theory. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, sought to accuse Ukraine of involvement, saying that the four suspects now apprehended had \u201ctried to hide and moved towards Ukraine, where, according to preliminary data, a window was prepared for them on the Ukrainian side to cross the state border\u201d. Given Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, the claim is unsurprising. But on any initial assessment it lacks credibility. While Ukraine has been seeking to strike military and industrial targets hundreds of miles inside Russia, its leaders well understand they would rapidly forfeit international support if they carried out a massacre of civilians. Ukraine has targeted airbases and seaports inside Russia, and it may even have flown two drones over the Kremlin. This year Kyiv almost certainly attacked a gas terminal in St Petersburg and refineries in Yaroslavl and Volgograd, escalation enough to prompt anxiety in the US, worried about the impact on global oil prices. But none of these are mass casualty attacks aimed at peacefully congregating civilians. Even if those apprehended by Moscow prove to be the gunmen and were heading south, it would not be obvious their best strategy would be to cross the frontlines of an active war. \u201cEverything in this war will be decided only on the battlefield,\u201d said Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Friday night, adding: \u201cTerrorist attacks do not solve any problems \u2026\u201d Moscow may appear far away from the west, but it is also far from Kerman, Iran, the site of a terror attack in January claimed by Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) that killed 84. If it is confirmed that the Moscow attack was carried out by the same group, it is uncomfortable reminder that it is on the rise. ISKP was also behind another suicide bomb attack at Kabul airport, Afghanistan, in August 2021, killing 170 Afghans and 13 US troops, in the process of carrying out the retreat from the country ordered by the US president, Joe Biden, a few months earlier. Its focus may have been Russia on Friday, but it was US forces less than three years ago. The mass killing at a concert venue also carries with it obvious chilling echoes of the murderous attack, also by IS gunmen, at the Bataclan in Paris in November 2015, which killed 89, and the suicide bombing at the Manchester Arena in 2017 after an Ariana Grande concert, which killed 22. Last year, leaks from US intelligence showed that ISKP, based in Afghanistan, was conducting \u201caspirational plotting\u201d in the US, Europe and Asia, with targets such as the last World Cup in Qatar in mind. Whatever the west\u2019s wider relationship with Moscow is, counter-terror investigators know it is time to be particularly vigilant."

            "content": "Donald Trump met with billionaire Elon Musk in Florida over the weekend as the former Republican president seeks a major cash infusion for his re-election campaign, The New York Times reported. According to the Times, Trump met with Musk \u2013 one of the world\u2019s richest people \u2013 and a number of wealthy Republican donors on Sunday and hopes to have a one-on-one discussion soon with Musk, the CEO of both Tesla Inc and SpaceX, and the owner-executive chairman of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. Neither Musk nor Trump\u2019s campaign immediately responded to requests for comment from the Reuters news agency. Trump, whose personal fortune took recent hits from judgments against him in a New York civil fraud case and a separate defamation trial, is aiming to line up additional major contributors to his campaign for president, the Times said. Musk has not said whether he plans to back Trump financially, but the South African-born billionaire entrepreneur has suggested in social media posts that he is opposed to incumbent Joe Biden \u2013 who defeated Trump in 2020 \u2013 winning a second term in November. Musk has long sought to cast himself as politically independent but has previously stated that he voted for Biden in 2020. Since then however, he has criticised the president and clashed with his administration In November, the White House labelled as \u201cabhorrent\u201d a tweet sent by Musk that was said to show indifference antisemitism. In December, Musk\u2019s mother accused the president of standing in the way of the billionaire\u2019s plans to make the world a better place. Last year Musk said that he would not vote for Biden again and \u2013 according to the Times report \u2013 he has made clear that defeating the president is a priority. With a net worth that Forbes magazine has put at around $200bn, Musk has the resources to almost single-handedly offset the huge financial advantage that Biden and his supporters are otherwise expected to wield over Trump in the 2024 general election campaign. Financial disclosures filed last month showed Trump\u2019s cash holdings fell to just over $30m as he waged successful Republican primary campaigns, down from around $33m a month earlier, his campaign said in a report to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Biden, who has faced a less competitive process for his Democratic Party\u2019s nomination, said in a separate disclosure to the FEC that his campaign ended January with about $56m in cash, up from $46m in December.

            "date": "2024-03-12T11:45:28Z",
            "content": "On\u00e9sio Nascimento has worked the land his whole life, moving from one Brazilian farming frontier to the next. During the coronavirus pandemic, he sold 20 hectares (50 acres) of land in northwest Mato Grosso state and used the money to buy another 100 hectares further north in the Amazon, in south Roraima. Today, he grows cassava and bananas on his land, an hour\u2019s drive down a bumpy dirt road, which turns to mud during the rainy season. Flanked by small herds of cattle, the road is used by loggers to extract valuable Amazon hardwoods from nearby pristine forest. Even in this far-flung part of the Amazon, Nascimento, 59, is not alone as an \u201coutsider\u201d. Almost all his neighbours on Road 34, in the banana and timber town of Caroebe, migrated from other Amazon states such as Mato Grosso, Rond\u00f4nia and Par\u00e1, attracted by cheap land. In recent years, infrastructure mega-projects, large-scale cattle farming operations and soy plantations have driven up land prices in settled regions of the Brazilian Amazon, many of which were colonised during the country\u2019s military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985. The spike in land prices, combined with other difficulties faced by family farmers in the region, such as access to credit, has encouraged many to sell up and search for opportunities on ever more distant frontiers, perpetuating a cycle of displacement and deforestation. South Roraima\u2019s vast expanse of \u201cvacant lands\u201d, which are not conservation areas or privately owned, have sparked interest from a range of groups, including small farmers, squatters, speculators, cattle ranchers and land-grabbers, who demarcate land and attempt to sell it to third parties. In many cases this is Indigenous land they have illegally entered and have no rights over. \u201cIt is one of the last frontiers of the Brazilian Amazon,\u201d says Paulo Barni, a professor of forestry management at the State University of Roraima. \u201cAnd the vacant lands are sitting there, available for people to demarcate and then take possession of.\u201d While attention has been focused on the billion-dollar illegal gold and tin ore mining industry operating in Roraima\u2019s Yanomami Indigenous land, Amazon deforestation in the state\u2019s southern municipalities has exploded in recent years. According to data from Brazil\u2019s National Space Research Institute (INPE), total deforestation in the four municipalities that make up south Roraima \u2013 Caroebe, Rorain\u00f3polis, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Baliza and S\u00e3o Luiz \u2013 more than doubled in the 2019-21 period from the previous three-year period, to 27,800 hectares from 12,700 hectares. The destruction continued to increase in 2022 and 2023, with 19,100 hectares cleared. Within the first few weeks of 2024, preliminary data suggests at least 800 hectares were cleared, half in Caroebe, where Nascimento lives. In February this year, Caroebe was the eighth worst- affected of the municipalities hit by Brazil\u2019s forest fires, as Roraima saw an unprecedented burning season. Meanwhile, invasions of Indigenous lands by loggers and land-grabbers have also increased in south Roraima. \u201cWe are surrounded on all sides by dirt roads,\u201d says Levi da Silva Kayk\u00fbw\u00fb, chief of the WaiW\u00e1i Indigenous people, whose 406,000-hectare territory is often targeted by loggers. \u201cThese days, they are getting ever closer.\u201d *** Nascimento had heard about the opportunity to buy land in south Roraima from an informal land broker, a travelling salesperson typical in the Brazilian Amazon, who profits from transactions between landowners and buyers. Born in Paran\u00e1 state in Brazil\u2019s south in the late 1970s, Nascimento\u2019s family were among millions of poor farmers who flocked north to the Amazon, squeezed out by a shift to mechanised agriculture and monoculture crops. They settled in Vilhena in the state of Rond\u00f4nia, where the family grew coffee, rice, beans and corn on a small patch of land but suffered great hardship, he says. By the time Nascimento was a young man, in the late 1980s, growing crops and working at a logging firm, large-scale cattle ranchers were moving into Rond\u00f4nia, putting the Amazon crisis firmly in the international spotlight. In 2020, after 18 years, he decided to sell his small farm in Aripuan\u00e3 \u2013 a logging and cattle-rearing town with one of the highest deforestation rates in the Amazon \u2013 in Mato Grosso state: by then, Brazil\u2019s agricultural powerhouse. Working conditions had become more difficult for smallholders as wealthier farmers with mechanised equipment moved in, outcompeting them on crop yields. Today, Nascimento lives next door to his ex-wife and her new husband, who also bought property on Road 34 in south Roraima. He says environmental officials began \u201cpersecuting\u201d him and his neighbours after Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who ran for president on a pro-environment platform, took office in January 2023. \u201cThey only go after the little guys,\u201d says Nascimento. \u201cWith Bolsonaro, at least we could work.\u201d Brazil\u2019s far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro, under whom Amazon deforestation rates soared, won Roraima with a higher percentage of votes than any other state in the 2022 elections. Nascimento has no real land title, just an informal sales document. This fragile paperwork doesn\u2019t allow him access to bank credit. \u201cTo legalise, you have to have a lot of money. It\u2019s difficult,\u201d he says. An hour\u2019s drive deeper down the road where Nascimento lives, which is being opened little by little \u2013 probably by illegal loggers according to local sources \u2013 recently cleared land abuts the native forest. Celia Regina da Silva, 53, arrived recently from Rond\u00f4nia, where she quit her job as a sales supervisor at a telephone company. Her husband and son were hired by the owner of a patch of land, 300 hectares of native forest, to take an inventory of which trees are valuable, so they can be removed and sold to sawmills in the region. \u201cI\u2019ve only been here a short time, but now my dream is to buy a piece of land and move in,\u201d da Silva says. Deeper down the dirt road, recently constructed wooden huts sit on cleared land, empty except for some basic furniture and sawdust, suggesting logging activity; roads used to remove hardwoods already snake through the forest. The road ends close to the Trombetas/Mapuera Indigenous Territory, which loggers and land-grabbers have targeted. *** South Roraima has long been a hotspot for the illegal logging trade. In 2020, a logger was killed during an enforcement operation in the municipality of Rorain\u00f3polis. The National Force, a joint military and civil police unit, was deployed there last year to protect the Pirititi Indigenous territory, home to an isolated Indigenous group, after land-grabbers invaded it. In December, the National Force\u2019s presence was extended for another 90 days. \u201cThere is an extremely well-organised group [of land-grabbers] working there,\u201d says Alisson Marugal, a federal prosecutor in Roraima. Such is the land boom in Roraima that dedicated brokers use social media to advertise large properties. But Evanilson Ribeiro da Silva, who uses Facebook to broker property sales, says the migration rush he has witnessed over the past six years in the region stalled in 2023. Fears about the Lula administration\u2019s crackdown on environmental violations has discouraged new settlers and large cattle ranchers from buying land, he says. \u201cPeople are desperate because they have a problem with the Workers\u2019 party government, which is very strict with inspections.\u201d Daniel Alves da Silva, 59, says he feels the same. A veteran Amazonian journeyman from S\u00e3o Paulo, he has bought and sold 13 properties in 26 years in Rond\u00f4nia and south Roraima, where he has lived for the past 11 years. \u201cAnyone who wants to sell land isn\u2019t selling because people are afraid of this change of government,\u201d says da Silva, who is returning to Rond\u00f4nia to take up sawmill work. If the BR-319 highway is paved, as planned, it would connect the Rond\u00f4nia capital of Porto Velho with Manaus, in Amazonas state, and Roraima would be less isolated from the rest of Brazil. Experts say this would raise land prices and the rate of deforestation. \u201cIt would be catastrophic for the region,\u201d says Barni, the forestry professor. \u201cOne of the things that keep the forests maintained is the state\u2019s relative isolation.\u201d Despite the drought that has affected his banana crops and the threat of environmental officials knocking on his door, after a lifetime of moving around, Nascimento hopes to stay in south Roraima. \u201cIt\u2019s more peaceful here,\u201d he says. \u201cGod willing, I\u2019ll bring my kids.\u201d This report was co-published with Mongabay and supported by the Pulitzer Center\u2019s Rainforest Journalism Fund"

            "date": "2024-03-26T22:21:35Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s main carbon offsets method is a failure on a global scale and doing little if anything to help address the climate crisis, according to a major new study. Research by 11 academics found the most popular technique used to create offsets in Australia, known as \u201chuman-induced regeneration\u201d and pledged to regenerate scrubby outback forests, had mostly not improved tree cover as promised between about 2015 and 2022. The peer-reviewed study, published in the nature journal Communications Earth &amp; Environment, analysed 182 projects in arid and semi-desert areas and found forest cover had either barely grown or gone backwards in nearly 80%. The academics said it meant these projects were therefore not reducing emissions as promised, and polluting companies that bought offsets created through these projects were often not reducing their impact on the climate as they claimed. They said this was a globally significant problem as Australia\u2019s forest regeneration method is the world\u2019s fifth biggest nature-based offsets program, with projects covering nearly 42m hectares, an area larger than Japan. More than 37m carbon credits \u2013 each meant to be worth a tonne of CO2 drawn from the atmosphere and worth between $750m and $1bn \u2013 had been issued for these projects by June last year. The authors of the study include Andrew Macintosh, an environmental law professor at the Australian National University (ANU), a former head of a carbon credit integrity assurance body and more recently a sharp critic of the management of the scheme. Two years ago he described it as a \u201csham\u201d and a fraud on taxpayers and the environment. The researchers said the findings add to growing scientific literature that highlighted \u201cthe practical limitations of offsets and the potential for offset schemes to credit abatement that is non-existent, non-additional and potentially impermanent\u201d. Megan Evans, a senior lecturer in environmental policy at the University of New South Wales in Canberra and a co-author of the new study, said the researchers found there was \u201cnowhere near the forest cover that you should see\u201d given the number of carbon credits issued. \u201cWhat this means is that the projects are not actually sequestering the amount of carbon claimed, and we\u2019ve got a whole bunch of carbon credits in the system that don\u2019t represent one tonne of CO2,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of these credits are being used to offset heavy emitters under the safeguard mechanism, so we\u2019re not actually reducing carbon emissions at all. The overall outcome is we\u2019re increasing the amount of carbon pollution. \u201cWe\u2019re ultimately getting worse outcomes for the climate than if we didn\u2019t have these [forest regeneration] projects.\u201d The researchers called on the Australian government to stop issuing carbon credits to regeneration projects in uncleared areas \u201cfor the sake of the integrity of Australia\u2019s carbon market and the country\u2019s decarbonisation efforts\u201d. The Clean Energy Regulator, which manages the scheme, said it had confidence in the integrity of the carbon credit scheme and the human-induced regeneration method. \u201cA number of reviews have confirmed the integrity of the HIR method,\u201d a spokesperson said. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen told the ABC\u2019s RN Breakfast on Wednesday that a review of the carbon credit scheme that he commissioned from Ian Chubb, a former Australian chief scientist, had backed the integrity of the system. Bowen said Chubb found the scheme was \u201cbasically sound\u201d, but needed some reforms that were being implemented. The Chubb review was not asked to examine individual projects. Bowen said the regulator had also asked Cris Brack, an honorary ANU associate professor and forest researcher, to review the performance of five-year-old projects and found they were \u201cdemonstrating regeneration, and proponents are implementing the project activities\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s been other checks in relation to the significant increase in vegetation that we\u2019re looking for and it has found that increasing vegetation exists,\u201d Bowen said. The carbon credits generated through forest regeneration can be used by companies to meet emissions reductions goals under the safeguard mechanism, a Coalition policy revamped under Labor to require the country\u2019s 215 biggest industrial polluting facilities to reduce their emissions intensity by up to 4.9% a year. The projects analysed in the new paper are mostly in dry outback areas in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. They do not involve tree planting, but are said to regenerate native forests by reducing the impact of grazing by livestock and feral animals. Critics, which have included the Australian Conservation Foundation, say research suggests grazing by livestock and feral animals mostly does not affect \u201cwoody vegetation cover\u201d. The study said the total amount of woody vegetation cover in the areas analysed increased by less than 1% after grazing was reduced. The researchers examined 75 projects that they said, based on the number of credits they received, should have had near 100% forest cover, but found the actual coverage in 2022 was only 21%. This was only a 1.8% increase since the projects were registered, they said. Don Butler, an ANU ecologist who led the statistical analysis, said the changes largely mirrored what happened in nearby areas not included in the projects. David Eldridge, another co-author and a longtime NSW government scientist now at the University of NSW\u2019s Centre for Ecosystem Science, said the results of the study were not a surprise. \u201cThey align perfectly with what decades of research in Australia\u2019s rangelands suggests would occur,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2024-03-12T08:23:30Z",
            "content": "Unemployment rose and wage growth slowed in the three months to January as the UK labour market showed signs of weakness, reflecting a broader slowdown in the economy. The unemployment rate rose unexpectedly to 3.9 in January from 3.8% in December according to the Office for National Statistics, while annual average wages growth including bonuses fell to 5.6% from 5.8% in the previous month. City economists had expected unemployment to reman flat and pay growth to slow to a more modest 5.7%. Pay without bonuses also ticked lower, to 6.1% from 6.2% over the same three-month period. Employers cut back on hiring new staff, pushing the number of advertised vacancies down on the quarter by 43,000 to 908,000, indicating that the recession during the last six months of 2023 took a slightly bigger toll on the labour market than first estimated. The Bank of England has waited to see signs that wage growth is slowing before making a move to reduce interest rates, and is expected to view the latest figures as another reason to begin that process this year. However, more recent surveys have shown UK businesses regaining confidence in the economic outlook and preparing to raise prices as employees continue to receive pay rises above the rate of headline inflation, which is now 4% \u2013 still double the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. A rise in the number of people leaving the labour market, mostly due to ill-health, will also likely mean that employers struggle to find staff and wages growth falls slowly over the coming months. Tony Wilson, the director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said: \u201cIn all, there are well over half a million more people out of work than before the pandemic began. This is being driven by more young people and older people outside the labour force, and in particular because of more people reporting long-term health conditions that stop them from working. \u201cIn our view this is holding back the recovery as the economy is continuing to create jobs, with nearly a million unfilled vacancies reported today.\u201d The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the figures showed his plans to increase incomes were working. \u201cOur plan is working. Even with inflation falling, real wages have risen for the seventh month in a row. And take home pay is set for another boost thanks to our cuts to national insurance which in total are putting more than \u00a3900 a year back into the average earner\u2019s pocket,\u201d he said. Wilson said the rise in inactivity meant the government needed \u201ca different approach to how we reach and engage with people who are out of work and may want to come back to work\u201d. He added: \u201cIn particular our employment services need to be more accessible, inclusive and supportive. Employers need to play their part too, and do more to keep people in work and to open up opportunities for those who may need more support.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-06T22:20:19Z",
            "content": "Chemical pollution tied to fossil fuel operations poses serious risks to human health, warns a new analysis published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday. Citing data from dozens of studies, the report points to an alarming rise in neurodevelopmental issues, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and certain cancers in young people taking place amid what the paper\u2019s author calls \u201cexplosive growth\u201d in the petrochemical industry. Between 1990 and 2019, rates of certain cancers in people under 50 increased dramatically. Meanwhile, fossil fuel use and petrochemical production have increased fifteen-fold since the 1950s, according to the report. \u201cOne of the major factors driving climate change is also increasing our exposures to chemicals that are adversely impacting health,\u201d said the report\u2019s author, Tracey Woodruff, a professor at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). \u201cTypically people say cancer is a disease of the aging, but now we\u2019re seeing it increasing in people under 50.\u201d The report points to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), chemicals commonly found in plastics and other products that interfere with healthy hormonal function, as a key threat. \u201cNumerous medical societies, government agencies, and systematic reviews have concluded that exposure to chemicals and pollution, including EDCs is an important risk factor for multiple diseases and health inequities and probably contributes to these increases,\u201d the report notes, adding that increases in disease and petrochemical production at the same time \u201calone cannot be interpreted as causal\u201d. Phil Landrigan, an epidemiologist at Boston College who was not involved with the study, said he agreed with the paper\u2019s conclusions. \u201cAll of this plastic is laden with over 10,000 chemicals,\u201d Landrigan said. \u201cThese chemicals include carcinogens, developmental neurotoxicants, endocrine disruptors and hundreds more that have never been tested for toxicity.\u201d He added that these chemicals leach out of plastics where they can cause a range of ailments including cancer, cardiovascular disease and infertility. Altering hormones Endocrine systems regulate an array of key biological processes, including brain and nervous system development, reproduction, and metabolism and blood sugar levels. Exposure to EDCs, including through contaminated food, air and water, can lead to problems with male and female fertility and fetal development in both people and animals. Even small disturbances to endocrine function, especially during pregnancy, can lead to \u201cprofound and lasting effects\u201d, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. EDCs are found in several everyday materials, including pesticides, building materials and cosmetics, as well as in many fabrics and children\u2019s toys, according to the new analysis. These chemicals are part of a broader pollution burden that has become the leading cause of premature deaths around the world, according to the analysis. Chemical pollution is estimated to be responsible for at least 1.8 million deaths each year, the paper states. People of color and those living in low-income areas, or otherwise disadvantaged communities are often the most exposed to harmful chemicals. The analysis cites data showing levels of EDCs in urine and blood of Black and Hispanic women \u201cpersistently higher\u201d than levels found in non-Hispanic White women. Due in part to a boom in single-use plastics production, petrochemical production continues to climb despite growing use of renewable energy sources to power homes and vehicles. The paper published Wednesday calls for stricter safety testing of chemicals, more tracking of chemical exposures and full or partial bans on single chemicals and single-use plastics. \u201cWe need to have government policies that ensure that chemicals that are being used and produced in the US are not creating toxic exposures to people,\u201d Woodruff said. \u201cThis can really only be accomplished through improved public policies.\u201d This story is co-published with the New Lede, a journalism project of the Environmental Working Group"

            "date": "2024-03-29T14:17:46Z",
            "content": "Chinese telecoms firm Huawei grew faster in 2023 than it has for four years, as it shrugged off the impact of US sanctions. Revenues rose by nearly 10% to 704.2bn yuan (\u00a377bn) as the Shenzhen-based company enjoyed a rebound within its consumer segment, which includes smartphone handsets. The performance meant Huawei defied the effect of sanctions imposed by the US in 2019, when Donald Trump\u2019s White House accused the firm of being a security risk, something Huawei denies. The UK also vowed in 2020 to remove Huawei from 5G infrastructure by 2027, due to similar concerns, prompting fury from China at a decision taken by the British government, but for which Trump appeared to take credit. Despite the restrictions, last year marked the third consecutive year of growth for Huawei, which had reported a fall in revenues in 2021, when it exhausted its stocks of microchip reserves. However, revenues remains below its 2020 peak of 891.3bn yuan. At a company event last year, Meng Wangzhou, Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer and the daughter of the company founder, announced that Huawei was no longer in crisis mode. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot over the past few years but through one challenge after another, we\u2019ve managed to grow,\u201d said Huawei\u2019s chair, Ken Hu, on Friday. Huawei\u2019s net profit for 2023 rose by 144.5% to 87bn yuan, with the margin more than doubling on a year earlier to more than 12%. Some of that came from ongoing income from the sale of its Honor smartphone brand, which Huawei off-loaded in November 2020, the company said. Huawei\u2019s smartphone business has thrived despite hostility from the UK government and US sanctions, which hamper its ability to make key chipmaking tools In September, Huawei produced a 5G smartphone using an advanced silicon chip on a scale of miniaturisation thought beyond its capabilities due to US-led export restrictions, analysts said. Its Mate 60 Pro is powered by a new Kirin 9000s chip that was made in China by the partly state-owned Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), the analysis firm TechInsights said. While Huawei\u2019s core IT infrastructure business remained stable, its cloud business grew by more than a fifth, generating revenue of 55.3bn yuan. Huawei\u2019s four-year-old smart car software and components business also recorded rapid growth, albeit from a much smaller base, up by 128.1% year on year to 4.7bn yuan. Huawei announced last year it would spin-off the smart car unit into a new company."

            "date": "2024-03-18T22:30:13Z",
            "content": "The Treasury under a Labour government would \u201chardwire\u201d raising Britain\u2019s growth rate into its budget tax and spending decisions as part of plans to shake up Whitehall\u2019s most powerful department, Rachel Reeves is to announce. The shadow chancellor will use a lecture in London on Tuesday to say that a decade of national renewal must start with \u201cday one\u201d reform after a Labour election victory to make growth more pivotal to the Treasury\u2019s work. Rejecting calls from some critics for the Treasury to be broken up into separate economy and public finance arms, Reeves will say she wants to beef up its in-house enterprise and growth unit and for the first time integrate its work with the department\u2019s tax and spending divisions. \u201cIn 1997, the last Labour government established the enterprise and growth unit within the Treasury. Squarely focused on driving economic growth. It was a source of important policy ideas, including the reform of competition law and the creation of a longer-term science funding framework,\u201d Reeves is due to say in the Mais lecture at City University\u2019s Bayes Business School. \u201cHowever, as the Institute for Government noted last month, that unit is widely seen to be underpowered, its influence diminished compared to 20 years ago. And crucially it is not involved in the management of fiscal events. \u201cSo, we will build on that success. Hardwiring economic growth into budget and spending review processes, with a reformed and strengthened enterprise and growth unit augmenting the existing so-called \u2018fiscal triangle\u2019.\u201d Labour\u2019s election victory in 1997 was followed within days by Gordon Brown\u2019s announcement of operational independence for the Bank of England, and Reeves will make reform of the Treasury part of her first 100-day agenda. Earlier this month, Brown said Britain would need to be put on an economic war footing if it was to break out of a vicious cycle of low growth. The annual Mais lecture has become a set-piece event for economic policymakers to set out their worldview. In 2022, Rishi Sunak, then the chancellor, said he wanted to cut taxes \u201csustainably\u201d and downgrade the role played by the state as an engine of growth. In her lecture, Reeves will say Labour\u2019s plan for growth is to be built on three pillars: stability, investment and unlocking the untapped potential of Britain\u2019s workers. \u201cWe need to do more to enshrine that core growth mission within our economic architecture,\u201d Reeves will say. She will call for the public and private sectors to join together in a national mission to restore strong economic growth across the country. \u201cWhen we speak of a decade of national renewal, that is what we mean. As we did at the end of the 1970s, we stand at an inflection point, and as in earlier decades, the solution lies in wide-ranging supply-side reform to drive investment, remove the blockages constraining our productive capacity, and fashion a new economic settlement, drawing on evolutions in economic thought.\u201d Unlike the 1980s, growth in the years to come must be broad-based, inclusive and resilient, Reeves will say, driven by planning reform, strengthening devolution and a new industrial strategy. She will promise to create half a million jobs across the UK through a new national wealth fund that will invest in the \u201cindustries of the future\u201d. A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cThe Treasury\u2019s role as an economics ministry is at the fore of what it does and particularly seen in recent fiscal events, with measures taken to increase labour supply and boost business investment. [The enterprise and growth unit] has expanded significantly over time, now under the direction of a director general.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-14T17:00:25Z",
            "content": "The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that the only way to boost global economic growth over the next century is by tackling soaring inequality to achieve a ninefold increase in living standards. Kristalina Georgieva said world leaders had a responsibility to future generations to build an economy that dealt with global heating, deployed AI technology responsibly and slashed elevated levels of inequality. \u201cWe have an obligation to correct what has been most seriously wrong over the last 100 years \u2013 the persistence of high economic inequality. IMF research shows that lower income inequality can be associated with higher and more durable growth,\u201d she said. \u201cWe simply cannot get to the \u2018high ambition scenario\u2019 for growth unless we foster a fairer global economy.\u201d In a speech at King\u2019s College, Cambridge, she argued the world was a turning point, making a comparison with the Great Depression of the 1930s, when the leading British economist John Maynard Keynes wrote his seminal essay Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren. She said Keynes had been right to predict that technology gains could deliver an eightfold increase in living standards in 100 years\u2019 time, but that the founding father of modern economics had been too optimistic about how the benefits of growth would be shared. Keynes, who was a fellow and academic administrator at King\u2019s and played an integral role in the creation of the IMF after the second world war, predicted that technology gains driving up productivity would allow for more leisure time with a 15-hour working week. However, Georgieva said the proceeds of growth had been too heavily concentrated among particular groups and in rich countries. \u201cHe [Keynes] was also too optimistic about how the benefits of growth would be shared. Economic inequality remains too high, within and across countries,\u201d she said. Setting out two possible scenarios for the next 100 years, developed by IMF staff, Georgieva said the world could expect either a \u201clow ambition\u201d path with global gross domestic product about three times larger and living standards twice as high as today. Alternatively a \u201chigh ambition\u201d scenario based on building a more sustainable and equitable global economy could leave global GDP 13 times larger after a century, with living standards about nine times higher. The Bulgarian economist, who is seeking a second five-year term as IMF managing director after being nominated by a string of European countries to lead the institution, said this would rely on the world pursuing a \u201cdifferent kind of growth\u201d in future. Calling on governments around the world to focus attention on three key priority areas, she said it was vital to address the climate emergency, invest in new technologies such as AI, and invest in people through tackling inequality. \u201cWe also recognise the need to put in place better measurement of wealth that goes beyond the traditional GDP, that values not only produced capital, but also nature, people, and the fabric of societies,\u201d Georgieva said. Highlighting Keynes\u2019s maxim that \u201cin the long run, we are all dead\u201d in her speech, she said the economist had meant the phrase as a call to action. \u201cHe meant the following: instead of waiting for market forces to fix things over the long run, policymakers should try to resolve problems in the short run,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a call to which I for one am determined to respond \u2013 to do my part for my grandchildren\u2019s better future. Because, as Keynes put it in 1942: \u2018In the long run almost anything is possible.\u2019\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-29T11:00:37Z",
            "content": "For a decade, Dayton in south-west Ohio has fought to shed its rust belt past. New apartment blocks, hotels and breweries have cut into a landscape dominated by derelict warehouses and general industrial decline. But today, that transformation is shifting gears and taking to the skies. A town that 120 years ago produced the pioneers of human flight the Wright brothers is set to build hundreds of futuristic flying taxis each year. It\u2019s here in Dayton \u2013 rather than in its home state of California \u2013 that Joby Aviation is planning to manufacture its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Joby\u2019s Didier Papadopoulos cites a couple of reasons for the company\u2019s plans to employ up to 2,000 people at a $500m facility north of Dayton scheduled to open next year. For one, it \u201chas a tremendous history in aviation \u2013 it\u2019s the birthplace of flight\u201d, Papadopoulos said recently. Also, he remarked, \u201cOhio is home to a talented and skilled manufacturing workforce, and we expect to hire and train a mixture of both local and national applicants.\u201d The aircraft, slated to appear at the Olympics in Paris this summer, are expected by some to reshape not just air travel but the wider mobility industry. A host of startups and established companies have dived into electric flying vehicles in recent years, and the global eVTOL market is expected to be worth $1tn by 2040. Joby has positioned itself as the \u201cUber of the skies\u201d. Its aircraft have space for a pilot and four passengers and can reach speeds up to 200mph (322km/h); in November it held a test flight in lower Manhattan and the company says it can reach JFK international airport from Manhattan in just seven minutes compared with the hour it can take by taxi or subway. The company hopes to launch commercial flights in New York City and Los Angeles in 2025 and has signed a home-to-airport taxi service with Delta Air Lines. With the Joe Biden White House committing billions of dollars to a new era of manufacturing, part of a wider move to reduce the US\u2019s dependency on other countries for key technological products, much of that money is landing in the industrial midwest. Millions of dollars of government incentives have been committed to new semiconductor and other mobility projects in Ohio, Michigan and other states that are often more commonly associated with socio-economic decline. For Dayton, a city that has lost close to half its population since the 1960s, the move could spark a major turnaround. \u201cOhio was the first state to put together an advanced air mobility plan,\u201d said a Joby liaison, Ted Angel, of the Dayton Development Coalition. \u201cNo other state had been leaning that far forward.\u201d Several miles east of Dayton, the Wright-Patterson air force base is the largest single-site employer in Ohio and boasts huge federal military research and development spending power that has, in turn, attracted a growing ecosystem of aviation and aerospace partners and startups to the area. In nearby Springfield, a city of 60,000 people that has also suffered through years of manufacturing closures, the US air force has been helping build a new National Advanced Air Mobility Center of Excellence, which is expected to serve as a working home for aviation companies from South Korea and elsewhere. \u201cFor a product like the one [Joby] is producing, there is both a defense and security market, and a consumer market,\u201d said the Ohio State University\u2019s Jennifer Clark, an expert in regional planning. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty normal for the aviation sector. Almost every aviation company you can think of has both defense and civilian manufacturing. The Dayton area is very familiar with that.\u201d While the creation of thousands of new skilled jobs in economically challenged regions such as Dayton has broadly been welcomed, some in those communities are likely to bear a cost. Known for years as a place with ample affordable housing, Dayton\u2019s rising rental prices last year prompted residents to form a tenants\u2019 union. In other cities, large manufacturing plants have fueled large property price increases. Ohio\u2019s state government is expected to deploy up to $325m in taxpayers\u2019 dollars to help Joby build its facilities. Dayton\u2019s Montgomery county has also proposed giving $1m to the company to help it with \u201cdevelopment costs\u201d. \u201cThere is a school of thought among economic development people that it is not the best use of taxpayer money to do these recruitment-retention-expansion deals with individual firms because it is risky,\u201d Clark said. \u201cMost of the research indicates that if you want to do sustainable economic development, you want to invest in your institutional infrastructure overall. But that\u2019s the long game.\u201d And while Joby\u2019s initial announcement suggested that 2,000 jobs would be created, that number is now expected to be closer to 1,200, with the potential to rise. Still, for a region whose population has declined for decades, investment from companies at the cutting edge of mobility is seen as a welcome shot in the arm. The fact that the new plant sits atop a former US post office airmail facility is evidence of that. Angel of the Dayton Development Coalition said a host of community colleges and universities around the region have adjusted by opening training programs to establish a pipeline of technicians for Joby and other aviation firms. \u201cI couldn\u2019t count how many tours with schoolchildren we have done,\u201d he said. \u201cThe [new] revolution of flight is happening right here.\u201d"

            "content": "Every sport today, from cricket to padel, wants to crack America. Soccer is already a major cultural force across the US, but its incursion into the American sporting psyche has been led by MLS and the top leagues of Europe, the English Premier League in particular. If you\u2019re a club battling away in the English Football League Two, how exactly do you stand out to the median US soccer fan? What place does a midweek cup fixture between Accrington Stanley and the Fulham Under-21s have in a footballing world of volcanically hyped top-flight matchups and potential super leagues? One solution for a lower league club fighting for international attention might be to get bought by Hollywood celebrities and launch a slickly produced, multi-season documentary about the club\u2019s quest for promotion through the lower tiers of British football on a popular US cable network. That, of course, is the solution that Wrexham famously devised to build its following among the American public, with the third season of Welcome to Wrexham set to premiere in the US on 18 April. Now the Welsh club, owned by actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney and currently sitting third in League Two, wants to build on its recent successes to help all 72 clubs across the three tiers of the English Football League gain a foothold in the American market. \u201cThe US is always going to be massively important to the EFL, because there\u2019s such a strong market and fanbase for football and the work has already been done by the Premier League to get a foothold there,\u201d says Shaun Harvey, the former chief executive of the English Football League who\u2019s been a director of Wrexham and adviser to the club\u2019s owners since 2021. \u201cThe challenge now is for clubs in the EFL to leverage that relationship and use it to build their own followings in the US.\u201d Lower-league English football is now shown in the US on ESPN+ and iFollow, the EFL\u2019s bespoke global streaming service \u2013 one of the many segments of global soccer fighting for visibility in the US on a bewildering patchwork of platforms and networks. No sport likes to have its broadcast rights split across a number of different locations, and for lower-league British football that fragmentation has proved particularly challenging as it attempts to build an identity in America. Wrexham regularly boasts that it has the biggest international following of any EFL club \u2013 including traditional giants of English football currently competing in the Championship like Leeds United and Leicester City \u2013 but the actual number of subscribers it\u2019s been able to retain for live broadcasts in the US on iFollow is relatively small. \u201cThere\u2019s probably 5,000 US households that have an annual subscription to watch Wrexham games live,\u201d Harvey says. \u201cIn isolation that might not sound like a lot, but it\u2019s a massive amount in comparison to the majority of other clubs in the EFL.\u201d The EFL is now in the process of negotiating a new international rights deal that will run from next season until 2027-28, and Harvey believes strongly that at least some lower-league matches should be shown live and free to air in the US. \u201cAccess is absolutely key,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom a marketing perspective the best rights deal, for the US or any other market, is one that makes matches free to air and accessible for anyone who wants to watch them. There\u2019s a balance to be struck between exposure and financial return so it makes sense to combine free to air with some direct to consumer subscription type channel.\u201d Though he declines to disclose the viewer numbers that led FX to approve the documentary\u2019s approaching third season (\u201cViewing numbers are a closely guarded secret\u201d), Harvey describes Welcome to Wrexham as \u201cthe club\u2019s biggest commercial asset\u201d. Thanks to the visibility and global profile the documentary has provided, Wrexham \u2013 unlike most other clubs in lower league English football \u2013 can afford the luxury of prioritizing free-to-air exposure over the guaranteed revenue that would come from restricting matches to cable or streaming services. But Harvey believes other clubs throughout the lower leagues can learn from Wrexham\u2019s example and find novel ways to stand out amid a culture saturated in sport and sport \u201ccontent\u201d. \u201cOur documentary isn\u2019t one that\u2019s built around telling the story of elite athletes in a pressure scenario, it\u2019s about a football club that\u2019s on a journey towards the top,\u201d Harvey says. \u201cIt\u2019s a story that resonates with many, many people who can relate to what Wrexham and its supporters are going through in some part of their own life.\u201d There\u2019s no dispute that Wrexham\u2019s celebrity ownership is the main driver behind the club\u2019s rise to global popularity, but in many ways that model of control goes against the trend across European football, where professional clubs are becoming less the plaything of rich individuals than giant investment funds. Compared to many of the high-profile clubs in the Premier League, which are juiced to maximize short-term gains and run according to the dictates of vast investment portfolios, there\u2019s something almost charmingly nostalgic about the spectacle of two wealthy North American dilettantes playing owner at the football club of a small former mining town and throwing themselves into the life of the local community. The themes and narratives at the heart of the documentary \u2013 the life and quirks of the town, the club\u2019s against-the-odds quest for promotion up the ranks of the EFL, the off-field characters and on-field strivers \u2013 make Welcome to Wrexham a very different viewing experience from, say, Amazon\u2019s All or Nothing series, or Apple TV+\u2019s shudderingly dull recent series about Leo Messi\u2019s arrival in Miami. Harvey believes it\u2019s the human scale of the documentary that has made it such a global success \u2013 \u201cThe town is the underdog in this story, more so than the football club\u201d \u2013 and that the drama of promotion and relegation across the three tiers of the EFL, combined with lower league football\u2019s mix of underdogs and fallen giants, can help British football below the Premier League carve out a meaningful cultural niche for itself in the US. Could the low-fi, everyday pleasures of lower league English football save the global institution of the fly-on-the-wall sports documentary from collapsing under the weight of its own importance? The story of lower league clubs, as Harvey paints it, is as much about changing demographics and urban revitalization away from the UK\u2019s core population centers as it is about football \u2013 and that\u2019s a narrative that will retain its potency for any club, not just Wrexham. In many ways the idealized future he paints is one in which the EFL gains mind share among the American public as a kind of antidote to the big-spending excesses of top-flight soccer across Europe, as the reverse side of the coin that\u2019s turned football at the elite level into a game of runaway salary inflation, private equity myopia, and serial financial fair play breaches. But critically \u2013 some might say paradoxically \u2013 the EFL can only build that identity for itself now that the likes of MLS and the Premier League have established such a strong beachhead for soccer in America. \u201cIt makes no sense for the EFL to go head to head in program slots with the Premier League,\u201d Harvey says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to try and work with broadcasters who are showing Premier League games and look to market EFL games on the back of that key hook that\u2019s bringing fans to the station in the first place.\u201d Whether that means Wrexham would support the EFL striking a new rights deal with current US Premier League rights holder NBC, Harvey declines to say. But as English lower league football starts to think seriously about expanding its presence overseas, clubs will have to pull all the same marketing levers familiar to teams in the European elite \u2013 the merchandising, social media campaigns, documentaries and inside accounts \u2013 while emphasizing that they represent a version of the sport that\u2019s fundamentally very different to what viewers would know from subsisting on a diet of Man City v Newcastle and Champions League knockouts alone."

            "date": "2024-03-31T15:31:37Z",
            "content": "Charlotte Higgins makes the familiar charge that \u201cArts funding has collapsed under 14 years of Tory rule\u201d (Opinion, 19 March). Frankly, we are in a different universe from 14 years ago. All government ministers and departments now agree, as Higgins says, \u201cThe arts are one of Britain\u2019s strongest suits.\u201d The Treasury has set creative industries as one of five key sectors of economic growth, adding billions of permanent tax relief support to help fund work, from film to orchestras. During the pandemic, the arts was the only sector to receive its own support package from the \u00a32bn culture recovery fund. The last Arts Council England budget was increased (not cut), bringing 275 new organisations around the country within its portfolio. Levelling up funds have prioritised further billions in cultural projects. Places such as Liverpool, Bradford, Barnsley, Leeds and Waltham Forest continue to invest in culture \u2013 understanding what it means for society. I could go on and talk about the opening of the Aviva in Manchester or the incredible East Bank quarter in Stratford. More funding is always welcome, but don\u2019t give any future government an easy ride. They must start from here \u2013 where culture is at the centre of government plans, not at the margin. Neil Mendoza Former commissioner for culture (2020-23), Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport \u2022 As a musician, I\u2019ve played for St John\u2019s Voices several times under Graham Walker and it\u2019s always been an absolute joy (Axing of Cambridge mixed choir \u2018regressive move for women\u2019, say supporters, 21 March). This is just the latest in a growing list of casualties of a starving music education sector, which has seen the recent closure of the departments of music at Kent and Oxford Brookes. Meanwhile, Goldsmiths is making at least a quarter of our entire academic staff redundant (130 full-time equivalent) all in the arts, humanities and social sciences, including my department, music. Any new government needs to understand that proper funding in education from early years to the highest level is essential for the arts to thrive. There\u2019s no suggestion, however, that the current government cares beyond token gestures. Dr Alexis Bennett Goldsmiths, University of London \u2022 James Purnell is right to advocate balanced funding across the whole educational spectrum, but wrong to perpetuate three damaging myths in doing so (Letters, 25 March). The first is to see the value of educational courses as being in terms of their economic input and contribution to growth. Education must always be about far more than that. The second is to see the arts and the sciences as separate and in competition with each other and, even worse, to use their wealth creation potential as the yardstick. Third, and perhaps worst of all, is to appropriate creativity as being unique to arts subjects. I wanted a creative career after school and I chose to study physics. The greatest creative mind of the last century was Einstein, whom we would label a scientist. I\u2019ve studied and worked across the traditional arts and science sectors over five decades and came to the conclusion long ago that there is no meaningful or useful distinction between an art and a science. These are outdated and overlapping labels for the same thing and it would be very beneficial to abandon them. Creativity, meanwhile, belongs to everyone and every discipline there is.

            "content": "Tracks from Plumpton to Ffos Las and at several points in between will be hoping to see Bank Holiday racegoers pouring through the turnstiles on Monday, but the undoubted highlight of the Easter weekend is the Irish Grand National at Fairyhouse \u2013 the most valuable race of the jumps season in the country that is, for the moment at least, the dominant force in National Hunt racing. It is unusual for a big race to be attached to a moveable feast, with a slot in the calendar that could be anywhere from the last week of March to late April. Some years, it is staged shortly after the Cheltenham Festival; in others, a week or more after the original Grand National at Aintree. It is perhaps not surprising in the circumstances that no horse has won the big race at Fairyhouse and Aintree in the same season, but there are still some all-time greats on the Irish National\u2019s roll of honour, including Arkle, who won under top weight of 12 stone in 1964, and Desert Orchid, who managed the same feat, and survived a horrible mistake at the last to boot, 26 years later. In recent years, the Irish Grand National has also been a useful guide towards the following season\u2019s Aintree showpiece. Bobbyjo (1998) and Numbersixvalverde (2005) both went on to win in Liverpool a year later, while I Am Maximus, who took this race in 2023, is among the favourites for the Grand National on Saturday week. Novices also have a decent record, while horses with less than 11 stone to carry have won 20 of the 23 races since 2000. The runners on Monday that fit the bill include Good Time Jonny, last year\u2019s Pertemps Handicap Hurdle Final winner at Cheltenham, who would add a dash of controversy were he to win as Tony Martin, his trainer, will lose his licence for three months from mid-May after a breach of the anti-doping rules. He goes to post with a live chance, but at the likely odds, Paul Nolan\u2019s Daily Present (5.00) also makes plenty of appeal. He needed four starts over fences to get off the mark, in a handicap at Down Royal in January, but then attracted plenty of support before finishing fifth in the Kim Muir at the Cheltenham Festival. He has just 10st 5lb on his back on Monday, and could well outrun his early price of around 20-1. Plumpton 2.25 Arriving in the form of his life having posted a career-best to win at Sandown last time, Scarface has winning form over this track and trip too. A 3lb rise for his latest success looks fair. Kempton 2.55 Dubai Honour, a dual Group One winner in Australia last year, is the class act here but was beaten at odds\u2011on on his only previous all\u2011weather start and faces a useful opponent in Lion\u2019s Pride. John Gosden\u2019s lightly raced four\u2011year-old beat a subsequent Group One winner on his final start at three and looks the type to make significant progress this year. Kempton 3.30 Despite having struggled to build on his win here in January in three subsequent starts, Liseo has shaped as if he is still in decent form and the return to this track and trip could be just what he needs. Kempton 4.05 A 5lb rise for The Thames Boatman\u2019s recent win might not be enough to prevent him following up, with Ethan Jones\u2019s 7lb claim also a positive. Kempton 4.40 At least eight of the 10 runners here would have a chance at their best but Vultar, a course-and-distance winner last time, could make the most of his handy draw in stall two."

            "date": "2024-03-26T17:09:04Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak has denied there is a \u201ccrisis\u201d in local government funding despite warnings that well-run councils are on the brink of bankruptcy and local services at risk without more support. The prime minister admitted that councils faced \u201cchallenges\u201d, in particular with inflation, which has significantly outpaced recent cash injections, at the cross-party liaison committee. The Local Government Association has warned that councils are starting this financial year in a \u201cprecarious position\u201d financially, and having to scale back or close a wide range of local services. It has calculated that English town halls need an extra \u00a34bn over two years just to maintain services at current levels, or risk a financial crisis, against a backdrop of significant spending cuts since the Conservatives came to power 14 years ago. Clive Betts, the chair of the levelling up, housing and communities committee, asked whether there was a crisis, to which Sunak responded: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t characterise it that way. \u201cOf course there are challenges, particularly with inflation, which is why \u2026 the overriding economic priority of the government was to bring inflation down because that will help local councils with their finances too, as well as helping families up and down the country. \u201cAnd if you look at what\u2019s happened from central government to local government over this parliament, since 2019, the grant in cash terms has more than doubled.\u201d However, Betts pointed out this was in the context of a 30% cut in councils\u2019 spending power since 2010. Tuesday\u2019s committee appearance was Sunak\u2019s last before local council elections on 2 May, in which the Tories are expected to face a wipeout. In a wide-ranging session, the prime minister promised that the public could \u201csafely assume\u201d the pensions triple lock would remain in place throughout the next parliament if the Tories win the election, after Jeremy Hunt confirmed it would be in the party\u2019s manifesto. The triple lock has become a hallmark of successive Tory governments since it was announced in 2010 but there has been a debate about its long-term future due to its costs. Sunak, however, insisted it was affordable. Sunak suggested that while public spending would continue to grow in real terms, public services must become 5% more productive. \u201cI do think it\u2019s right that we focus on productivity to get more out of the investment we\u2019re putting in to public services,\u201d he said. \u201cTo give just one statistic \u2013 public sector productivity is around 5% lower today than it was before the pandemic. So, no one is asking anything heroic; it\u2019s just a return to where we were. Obviously the private sector has managed that.\u201d There was a heated row over the government\u2019s flagship Rwanda deportation scheme, with Sunak objecting to the Scottish National party MP Joanna Cherry\u2019s question about whether he was proud of telling Tory MPs to vote against an amendment preventing Afghans who had supported British forces from being deported to Rwanda. \u201cI really disagree with that characterisation,\u201d he said, adding that in light of recent debates in parliament about MPs\u2019 intimidation, \u201cI actually think characterising like that is deeply unhelpful.\u201d The prime minister refused to say if the government had finally found an airline willing to fly asylum seekers to Rwanda, suggesting it would be subject to commercial confidentiality. Responding to other questions, Sunak declined to give a date for when defence spending would hit the 2.5% of GDP target. He also said the UK would continue to push Israel to allow more aid into Gaza, particularly by land. He acknowledged concerns that the UK had backed the UN security council\u2019s Gaza ceasefire resolution even though it did not explicitly condemn Hamas\u2019s actions. But he added that \u201cwhilst not perfect\u201d, the UN\u2019s position was \u201cclose enough\u201d to the UK\u2019s position that it should support it. In a lighter moment, the prime minister gently mocked his predecessor Liz Truss\u2019s claim that the \u201cdeep state\u201d had brought her down. Asked whether he was a member of the deep state, he replied: \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t tell you if I was.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-15T14:03:15Z",
            "content": "Civil War, Alex Garland\u2019s hotly anticipated dystopian drama on an America divided by military conflict, knows what we\u2019re looking for. The film opens with the president (Nick Offerman) in profile, practicing lines as he prepares to address the nation. His assurances of strength and patriotism are interwoven with seemingly real, recent news footage: a flash of riot gear, police armed like soldiers, masses against shields, two seconds of a body being dragged. Garland, the writer-director behind such modern sci-fi hits as Ex Machina and Annihilation, doesn\u2019t have to show much from 2020 or beyond to get the point across. We\u2019ll fill in the rest. This is good news for those who feared Civil War would swerve too close to the present election-year polarization for comfort, or wring entertainment out of the beyond oversaturated national presence and specter of Donald Trump. Civil War, which premiered at the SXSW film festival, introduces the connection and then summarily abandons recognizable politics for the dispassionate work of combat journalists in the moral gray area of the war zone. In a year of red-hot tension and fear, Civil War runs cold \u2013 decidedly anti-war but firmly unspecific, assiduously avoiding any direct correlation to current politics or, it turns out, any politics at all. The film begins well into a conflict in which Texas and California are allies in the \u201cWestern Front\u201d (Florida is also joining) against the federal government. The three-term president has authorized drone strikes against civilians and disbanded the FBI, we learn in clunky journalist chatter, but this is war: everyone is killing each other. Both sides have a military. There are no discernible ideologies beyond winning. To the protagonists of this film \u2013 hard-boiled Lee (an excellent Kirsten Dunst), adrenaline junkie Joel (Wagner Moura), hotshot newbie Jessie (Priscilla\u2019s Cailee Spaeny) and mentor Sammy (Stephen McKinley Henderson) \u2013 there is only work to do, conflict to follow, evidence to capture. Civil War is just as much road movie as war movie, as the journalists travel from contested New York, where residents scrounge and riot for water, through the eastern US (Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia) to the Western Front\u2019s frontline in Charlottesville and then DC. The goal is to score the last interview with the president in a zone where journalists are, as Sammy says, shot on sight. (\u201cInterviewing him is the only story left,\u201d says Joel, which never makes sense.) As a suspense thriller, Civil War is very successful \u2013 Garland has a knack for the choreography of conflict, for tuning up the mutual suspicion of every encounter with a stranger (as both sides use US army fatigues, it\u2019s hard to know who is who, and it doesn\u2019t matter as long as they\u2019re not trying to kill Lee\u2019s convoy). Civil War is A24\u2019s most expensive production, and it shows. Garland\u2019s rendering of the war-torn suburban US is a fascinating mix of beautiful and horrifying \u2013 a shellshocked JC Penney\u2019s, bodies hanging from a highway overpass, an abandoned Christmas festival in the summer. Perversions of Americans\u2019 sense of stability, lush and dexterously deployed. Civil War works on the level of intellectual exercise: a film clear-eyed on the horrors of war and trauma in which journalists are the unsentimental heroes, and which relies on the audience to supply their own assumptions of American politics rather than spoon-feed reality. But the distance makes for an at times frustrating watch \u2013 stimulating on the level of adrenaline, not emotions. In part, the internal logic feels off \u2013 who\u2019s the audience for these journalists, if there\u2019s no cell service and no one appears to use the internet? Why would these images matter, in a divided future nation that has, I presume, fully lost shared reality? There really aren\u2019t any bleeding hearts in this journalist crew? It\u2019s true that righteousness matters little to those caught in the violence of war, but Civil War\u2019s strict indifference to motivation rankles a little, considering the very stark ideological divide between political parties today or America\u2019s actual civil war, which was fought over the cut-and-dried issue of slavery and then strategically whitewashed over decades into a tale of \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d. Garland\u2019s Civil War gives little to hold on to on the level of character or world-building, which leaves us with effective but limited visual provocation \u2013 the capital in flames, empty highways, a viscerally tense shootout in the White House. The brutal images of war, but not the messy hearts or minds behind them. Civil War is screening at the SXSW festival and will be released in US and UK cinemas on 12 April"

Francis made his comments in an interview recorded last month with Swiss broadcaster RSI, well before Friday\u2019s latest offer by Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan to host a summit between Ukraine and Russia to end the war. \u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed to negotiate before things get worse,\u201d the 87-year-old pontiff said. Turkish and US officials have held comprehensive talks about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and various bilateral issues during meetings in Washington, Turkey\u2019s foreign minister said late on Friday. Hakan Fidan said he discussed ways to end Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine with officials including US counterpart Antony Blinken, reiterating that Ankara believed it is time to discuss paths toward an end to the war but that Turkey did not see this willingness from Kyiv and Moscow. \u201cWe need a basis for talking, for this war to stop, and a dialogue to prevent worse crises, and we call for this,\u201d Fidan said. British foreign minister David Cameron said he opposes sending western troops to Ukraine, even for training missions, in an interview with German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung published on Saturday. Cameron said training missions are best carried out abroad. Placing foreign soldiers in Ukraine would provide targets for Russia, he said. Poland\u2019s foreign minister says the presence of Nato forces in Ukraine \u201cis not unthinkable\u201d and that he appreciates the French president for not ruling out that idea. Last month Emmanuel Macron said the possibility of western troops being sent to Ukraine could not be ruled out. Radek Sikorski said he appreciated Macron\u2019s initiative \u201cbecause it is about Putin being afraid, not us being afraid of Putin\u201d. Ukrainian authorities said two people including a teenage boy were killed Saturday in Russian artillery attacks. Serhiy Lysak, governor of Ukraine\u2019s Dnipropetrovsk region, said a 16-year-old boy was killed and a 22-year-old man injured in a morning artillery attack that hit the town of Chervonohryhorivka. Ukrainian officials said Saturday a Russian bomb landed near a block of flats in the southern city of Kherson overnight wounding a child. It published a video of a destroyed building, with a large crater outside it. \u201cA seven-year-old boy who suffered from the shelling is under medical supervision,\u201d authorities said. Russian air defences have downed a Ukrainian MiG-29 fighter jet over Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region, the RIA news agency cited Russia\u2019s defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Ukrainian authorities have not reported any fighter jet losses in recent days. Car traffic was temporarily suspended over the Crimea Bridge on Saturday, Russian authorities said on the Telegram messaging app, a move often made because of expected or actual attacks. The bridge connects mainland Russia to Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, but which Kyiv still considers its territory. A Moscow court has sentenced a student to 10 days in jail after he renamed his wifi network with a pro-Kyiv slogan during the military offensive in Ukraine, the Ria-Novosti news agency reported on Saturday. The student at Moscow State University replaced the name of the network from his wifi router with Slava Ukraini, meaning \u2018Glory to Ukraine\u2019, the rallying cry of Ukraine forces. The court found him guilty of a \u201cpublic demonstration of Nazi symbolics \u2026 or symbols of extremist organisations,\u201d Ria-Novosti said. Russia said Saturday that it had destroyed 47 Ukrainian drones over its southern regions overnight, mostly in the Rostov area bordering Ukraine. Kyiv has regularly launched drones into Russia in response to Moscow\u2019s military offensive."

            "content": "An international bidding war is brewing for the UK packaging company DS Smith after a US-based paper producer put forward a \u00a35.7bn takeover proposal, gatecrashing a deal it had agreed with the British rival Mondi. DS Smith confirmed it was now in talks with International Paper, which is one of the largest paper and pulp companies in the world, over an all-stock offer, which would trump the \u00a35.14bn deal put forward by Mondi earlier this month. The news could lead to a bidding battle between both companies after Mondi agreed its all-share takeover deal in principle on 7 March. Shares at DS Smith rose 7.4% in early trading on Wednesday off the back of the proposal from the Tennessee-based papermaker. Under the terms, DS Smith shareholders would receive 0.1285 shares in International Paper for each share they own in DS Smith. If the proposed deal goes through, DS Smith shareholders will own just over a third (33.8%) of the combined company. Founded in east London in the 1940s as a box-making business, DS Smith has grown to become a market leader in packaging and paper products, and now operates in 30 different countries and employs more than 30,000 people. DS Smith said it was continuing discussions with Mondi, based in Weybridge in Surrey, over its offer to create a UK-based packaging company worth more than \u00a310bn. Previously both companies had said the deal was an exciting opportunity to create a pan-European industry leader in paper-based sustainable packaging solutions. Commenting on the International Paper offer on Tuesday, DS Smith said: \u201cThe board acknowledges the strategic merits and potential for value creation through a combination with International Paper. \u201cAccordingly, the board is progressing its discussions with International Paper regarding the proposal.\u201d International Paper said that a combination between both companies would create a truly global leader in sustainable packaging solutions that is well positioned in an attractive and growing market. It added that it would result in significant value creation for International Paper and DS Smith shareholders."

            "content": "Ukraine said it had not seen the \u20ac16bn (\u00a313.7bn) in proceeds from two donor conferences held in Poland in 2022, early on into Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. The two events in 2022 had raised 10 billion and six billion euros, respectively, the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmygal, told a press conference. A first-of-its-kind training exercise involving more than 20,000 soldiers from over a dozen countries has launched across northern Norway, Sweden and Finland as the region prepares to become a fully Nato territory within days. The training exercise across air, land and sea \u2013 which will also include soldiers from the UK, US, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Canada \u2013 will incorporate a cross-border operations exercise in the Arctic Circle. The Kremlin said a purported recording of German military discussions showed Germany\u2019s armed forces were discussing plans to launch strikes on Russian territory. Russian media on Friday published a 38-minute recording of a call in which German officers were heard discussing weapons for Ukraine and a potential strike by Kyiv on a bridge in Crimea. Germany\u2019s ambassador to Moscow, Alexander Graf Lamsdorff, was summoned to the Russian foreign ministry on Monday in order to explain the leaked discussion. Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the leaked discussions showed that the appetite for war in Europe \u201cstill remains very very high\u201d, and the aim was to ensure \u201cRussia\u2019s strategic defeat on the battlefield\u201d. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev commented that: \u201cGermany is planning a war with Russia\u201d. Germany\u2019s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, dismissed the reactions as \u201ccompletely absurd\u201d, accusing Moscow of wanting to sow distrust and discord in Germany. Disqualified Russian presidential candidate Boris Nadezhdin said he would keep filing challenges against his exclusion from this month\u2019s election after his latest appeal was rejected by the supreme court. Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence agency launched a cyber-attack against the servers of the Russian defence ministry, gaining access to \u201ca bulk of classified service documents,\u201d the agency said. Ukraine said it had not seen the \u20ac16bn (\u00a313.7bn) in proceeds from two donor conferences held in Poland in 2022, early on into Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. The announcement comes amid concerns in Kyiv surrounding military and financial support, with the war entering its third year. The two events in 2022 had raised 10 billion and six billion euros, respectively, the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmygal, told a press conference. \u201cUkraine received nothing from them. The funds were raised by Poland together with the European Commission to support Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere did they go, what did they support \u2026 Ukraine has received nothing,\u201d he added. Kyiv has warned it desperately needs more military and financial assistance as it waits for a fresh $60bn package of US aid held up in Washington. Here is more on the deal Poland signed a deal to buy anti-tank grenade launchers from Sweden\u2019s Saab. The deal concerns the Carl-Gustaf M4 grenade launcher, which is intended to combat all types of modern combat vehicles. Poland\u2019s defence minister, Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, said Poland would receive several thousand grenade launchers and several hundred thousand rounds of ammunition, as well as the necessary infrastructure, training and other elements necessary to use the weapon. Poland signed a deal to buy anti-tank grenade launchers from Sweden\u2019s Saab in a deal worth 6.5 billion z\u0142otys (\u00a31.3bn), Poland\u2019s defence minister, Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, has said. Warsaw has been one of Kyiv\u2019s staunchest supporters since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has said Ukraine must regain control over all of its territory in order to deter Moscow from further aggression. This year, Poland \u2013 which borders the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad \u2013 is spending about 4% of gross domestic product on defence as it seeks to strengthen its armed forces in the face of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. British soldiers are \u201con the ground\u201d in Ukraine helping Kyiv\u2019s forces fire long-range Storm Shadow missiles, according to a leak in Russian media of a top-secret call involving German air force officers. The Kremlin said the leak demonstrated the direct involvement of the \u201ccollective west\u201d in the war in Ukraine \u2013 while former British defence ministers expressed frustration with the German military in response to the revelations. Released on Friday by the editor of the Kremlin-controlled news channel RT, Margarita Simonyan, the audio recording \u2013 confirmed as authentic by Germany \u2013 captures Luftwaffe officers discussing how Berlin\u2019s Taurus missiles could be used to try to blow up the Kerch Bridge connecting Russia with occupied Crimea. During the conversation, Lt Gen Ingo Gerhartz, the head of the Luftwaffe, describes how Britain works with Ukraine on deploying Storm Shadow missiles against targets up to 150 miles behind Russian lines. \u201cWhen it comes to mission planning,\u201d the German commander says, \u201cI know how the English do it, they do it completely in reachback. They also have a few people on the ground, they do that, the French don\u2019t.\u201d Reachback is a military term to describe how intelligence, equipment and support from the rear is brought forward to units deployed on the front, but Gerhartz suggests the British approach is deeper, involving support on site. You can read the full story by my colleagues, Dan Sabbagh and Kate Connolly, here: Polish farmers\u2019 blockade of the border with Ukraine has not affected the delivery of military or humanitarian aid to the country, Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Denys Shmygal, has said. Farmers have been blocking the border and other highways to protest what they say is unfair competition from goods entering the Polish market from Ukraine. \u201cThere have been no cases of delivery of weapons and military equipment, humanitarian aid, or fuel to Ukraine being blocked,\u201d Shmygal told reporters in Kyiv. \u201cNo cargo officially registered as military or humanitarian has been detained,\u201d he added. Here are some of the latest images coming out from the newswires: A group of more than 40 countries reiterated calls for Russia to allow an independent international investigation into the death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny in prison. The call was made by EU ambassador Lotte Knudsen at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on behalf of all 27 EU states and 16 other countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States and Ukraine, according to Reuters. Knudsen said: We are outraged by the death of the Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, for which the ultimate responsibility lies with President [Vladimir] Putin and the Russian authorities. Russia must allow an independent and transparent international investigation into the circumstances of his sudden death. Navalny, Putin\u2019s fiercest critic inside Russia, died at the age of 47 in an Arctic penal colony on 16 February, sparking accusations from his supporters that he had been murdered. The Kremlin has denied any state involvement in the death of the opposition leader, who was laid to rest in Moscow on Friday. Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee says it has launched a procedural investigation into the death, and the Kremlin has said it does not bow to EU demands. UN Nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said he intends to discuss Russia\u2019s plans for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant it is occupying in Ukraine when he meets Russian President Vladimir Putin this week. Grossi is due to leave for Russia on Tuesday, he told a press conference on the opening day of a quarterly meeting of his agency\u2019s 35-nation Board of Governors at which envoys from various countries marked the second anniversary of Russian forces seizing the Zaporizhzhia plant, Reuters reports. Grossi\u2019s trip to Russia has long been planned. He originally intended to go there last month after a trip to Ukraine. When asked what he would discuss with Putin, Grossi said: There are issues related to the future operational status of the plant. Is it going to be started or not? What is the idea? What is the idea in terms of the external power supply lines, since what we see is extremely fragile and thin? Zaporizhzhia, Europe\u2019s largest nuclear power plant, has lost its connection to all its external power lines eight times in the past 18 months, forcing it to rely on diesel generators for essential functions like cooling fuel in its reactors to avoid a potentially catastrophic meltdown. While one of its main power lines is now functioning and its six reactors are in shutdown, which reduces the operational risk, the International Atomic Energy Agency says the situation at the plant remains precarious. Although Grossi stopped short of spelling out that he would meet Putin, he said: It\u2019s the idea \u2026 This is the intention. He left open what other issues might be discussed. I would not be coming with a fixed list of items. As it happens, when I have a meeting with a world leader that has responsibilities, and in particular a nuclear-weapon possessor state, permanent member of the security council, I cannot exclude that other things are discussed. A Russian prosecutor has asked for the jail term of a former staffer of Alexei Navalny to be increased, Navalny\u2019s team said on Telegram, in the first major court hearing related to an ally of the opposition politician since his death last month. Liliya Chanysheva, the former head of Navalny\u2019s office in the central Bashkortostan region, and her former colleague, Rustem Mulyukov, were the first Navalny staffers to be convicted of national security charges after his organisation was deemed \u201cextremist\u201d in 2021, Reuters reports. Navalny, one of president Vladimir Putin\u2019s fiercest critics inside Russia, died aged 47 in an Artic penal colony on 16 February. The Kremlin has angrily rejected claims it was involved in his death. Chanysheva was handed a seven-and-a-half year sentence last year for participating in Navalny\u2019s organisation, while Mulyukov received two-and-a-half years for similar charges. A prosecutor in a cassation court in Samara on Monday demanded Chanysheva\u2019s sentence be increased to ten years because she \u201cprovoked and incited Ufa residents\u201d to protest in the streets, referring to Bashkortostan\u2019s capital, independent outlet SOTA quoted the prosecutor as saying. The cassation court returned Chanysheva and Mulyukov\u2019s cases to Bashkortostan\u2019s supreme court for a new examination, her lawyer wrote on Telegram. At least two other Navalny staffers remain imprisoned in Russia: Vadim Ostanin, who ran Navalny\u2019s branch in Barnaul and Ksenia Fadeyeva, a local lawmaker and former head of Navalny\u2019s anti-corruption organisation in Tomsk. Several of Navalny\u2019s lawyers were also detained last year and are awaiting trial. Ukraine expects the European Commission to present a negotiation framework for Kyiv\u2019s accession to the EU \u201cno later than 12 March\u201d, deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Olga Stefanishyna has been quoted as saying. \u201cNo later than 12 March, we expect the European Commission to present a negotiation framework and assess the progress of reforms so that EU countries can make a decision on 19 March,\u201d Stefanishyna told journalists, according to Ukrinform. \u201cWe hope that there will be no delays,\u201d she added. The European Commission recommended last November that formal EU membership negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova should begin, which its president, Ursula von der Leyen, described as a response to \u201cthe call of history\u201d. It started screening Ukraine\u2019s legislation for compliance with EU laws in January, marking the initial step of the accession process, which includes meeting the necessary economic and legal criteria. Nato will start an exercise on Monday to defend its newly expanded Nordic territory when more than 20,000 soldiers from over a dozen countries take part in drills lasting nearly two weeks in the northern regions of Finland, Norway and Sweden. With over 4,000 Finnish soldiers taking part, the Norway-led Nordic Response 2024 drills are part of the largest Nato military exercise in decades. \u201cFor the first time, Finland will participate as a Nato member nation in exercising collective defense of the alliance\u2019s regions,\u201d the Finnish Defense Forces said. The Kremlin said a purported recording of German military discussions showed Germany\u2019s armed forces were discussing plans to launch strikes on Russian territory. Russian media on Friday published a 38-minute recording of a call in which German officers were heard discussing weapons for Ukraine and a potential strike by Kyiv on a bridge in Crimea. Germany\u2019s ambassador to Moscow, Alexander Graf Lamsdorff, was summoned to the Russian foreign ministry on Monday in order to explain the leaked discussion. Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the leaked discussions showed that the appetite for war in Europe \u201cstill remains very very high\u201d, and the aim was to ensure \u201cRussia\u2019s strategic defeat on the battlefield\u201d. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev commented that: \u201cGermany is planning a war with Russia\u201d. Germany\u2019s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, dismissed the reactions as \u201ccompletely absurd\u201d, accusing Moscow of wanting to sow distrust and discord in Germany. Disqualified Russian presidential candidate Boris Nadezhdin said he would keep filing challenges against his exclusion from this month\u2019s election after his latest appeal was rejected by the supreme court on Monday. Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence agency launched a cyber-attack against the servers of the Russian defence ministry, gaining access to \u201ca bulk of classified service documents,\u201d the agency said. Disqualified Russian presidential candidate Boris Nadezhdin said he would keep filing challenges against his exclusion from this month\u2019s election after his latest appeal was rejected by the supreme court on Monday (see earlier post at 10.33 for more details). Nadezhdin had tried to run against Vladimir Putin on an anti-war ticket but was barred from standing when the Central Election Commission said it had found irregularities, including names of dead people, in the list of supporters\u2019 signatures he had presented in support of his candidacy. He said on Monday he planned to file a further complaint to the presidium of the supreme court and then to the constitutional court. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop, I\u2019ll fight until the end,\u201d he said. Nadezhdin conceded weeks ago that he has \u201czero\u201d chance of appearing on the ballot for the March 15-17 election, but has used the protracted appeal process to portray himself as a fighter intent on playing a future role in Russia\u2019s politics. Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, will meet former US President Donald Trump this Friday in Florida, Reuters reports. \u201cIt is not gambling but actually betting on the only sensible chance, that we in Hungary bet on the return of President Trump,\u201d he told an economic forum on Monday. \u201cThe only chance of the world for a relatively fast peace deal is political change in the United States, and this is linked to who is the president.\u201d The Hungarian leader, who has refused to send weapons to Ukraine and kept up close economic ties with Russia since the full-scale invasion in 2022, has repeatedly said that only the return of Trump to the White House could bring peace in Ukraine. An object that fell in a field in Poland, a Nato member, was a weather balloon, it has been confirmed. The Fakt tabloid reported earlier on Monday that a military object had fallen in a field near the town of Milakowo, but police in nearby Ostroda clater onfirmed to Reuters that the object was a weather balloon. \u201cI confirm that this morning we received a report that an object fell in the fields near Milakowo, now we can confirm that it was a meteorological balloon,\u201d a police spokesperson said. \u201cOur activities here focused on securing this place until the arrival of the army, and at the moment we are trying to explain the origin of this object and why it was found in these fields in our area.\u201d In November 2022, a stray Ukrainian missile struck the Polish village of Przewodow in southern Poland, killing two people and raising fears at the time of the war in Ukraine spilling over the border. Poland plans to ask the EU to put sanctions on Russian and Belarusian agricultural products, the country\u2019s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said on Monday during a visit to the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. Tusk has said agricultural products from Russia and Belarus were causing market distortions. \u201cLatvia decided to implement an embargo on the import of (agricultural) products from Russia,\u201d he told a news conference last week. \u201cWe will analyse the case of Latvia, and I do not rule out that Poland will take an appropriate initiative.\u201d Germany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has ruled out arming Ukraine with long-range Taurus missiles if German soldiers needed to be involved to help operate them. \u201cYou cannot deliver a weapons system that has a very wide reach and then not think about how control over the weapons system can take place,\u201d he was quoted by Reuters as saying at a school function. \u201cAnd if you want to have control and it\u2019s only possible if German soldiers are involved, that\u2019s out of the question for me.\u201d Germany has so far resisted sending Taurus missiles to Ukraine, wary of widening the scope of the war and being dragged into a direct confrontation with Russia. Germany\u2019s ambassador to Moscow was summoned to the Russian foreign ministry on Monday in order to explain the leaked discussion between senior military personnel about sending weapons to Ukraine. Alexander Graf Lamsdorff arrived at the foreign ministry without responding to journalists\u2019 requests for comment, according to reports on Russian news agencies. Germany\u2019s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, has accused Russia of waging \u201can information war\u201d against Germany, by intercepting and then leaking a sensitive meeting among high-level military officers of the German military or Bundeswehr. Russia has accused Germany, backed by its allies, of planning an all-out war on Russia. Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the leaked discussions showed that the appetite for war in Europe \u201cstill remains very very high\u201d, and the aim was to ensure \u201cRussia\u2019s strategic defeat on the battlefield\u201d. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev commented that: \u201cGermany is planning a war with Russia\u201d. Pistorius dismissed the reactions as: \u201ccompletely absurd\u201d, accusing Moscow of wanting to sow distrust and discord in Germany. In the telephone conference, four officers, including the head of Germany\u2019s air force, Ingo Gerhartz, prepare for a discussion with defence minister Pistorius about the possible deployment of Taurus missiles to Ukraine, coming to the conclusion that a speedy delivery and the use of the missiles in the immediate future would only be possible if German soldiers were involved. Taurus training for Ukrainian soldiers in order to avoid putting German soldiers on Ukraine soil, was a possibility, but would take months of preparation. The officers also discussed the possibility of using the missiles to destroy the Russian-built bridge connecting the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula and Russia. Last week, Germany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, ruled out the sending of Taurus missiles because he said the operation would involve sending German troops to Ukraine. He said: \u201cGerman soldiers can at no point and in no place be linked with the targets that this (Taurus) system reaches. Not even in Germany.\u201d As the German government struggles to deal with the fallout from the leak, with questions asked about the security of its internal communications and speculation over what other discussions Russia has been able to listen in on, defence policy experts said the intercepted communication was clearly meant to undermine Germany\u2019s Ukraine strategy. Roderich Kiesewette, the opposition Christian Democrats\u2019 defence expert, said that Russia had leaked the meeting at this moment in time in order to specifically: \u201cundermine a German Taurus delivery\u201d. He suggested the leak was carried out \u201cin order to divert public conversation away\u201d from other issues, including the death of Alexei Navalny. Russia\u2019s supreme court has upheld a ruling barring opposition politician Boris Nadezhdin from running in this month\u2019s presidential election, Nadezhdin said. Nadezhdin was barred from standing when the Central Election Commission said it had found irregularities, including names of dead people, in the list of supporters\u2019 signatures he had presented in support of his candidacy. Nobody expected Nadezhdin, a centre-right candidate who has called himself a \u201cprincipled opponent\u201d of the war, to win even if he was allowed to participate, given Vladimir Putin\u2019s total dominance and control of the state. But his campaign has captured people\u2019s attention because of his outright opposition to Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Putin is set to secure another six-year term in the 15-17 March vote, which would keep him in the Kremlin until at least 2030. Dmitry Medvedev, former president of Russia and deputy chairman of its security council, said Ukraine belonged to Russia and tensions between Washington and Moscow were worse than during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, the RIA news agency reported. Medvedev said in a public lecture that American special forces and military advisers were already waging war against Russia, according to Reuters. The Kremlin said a purported recording of German military discussions showed Germany\u2019s armed forces were discussing plans to launch strikes on Russian territory. Russian media on Friday published a 38-minute recording of a call in which German officers were heard discussing weapons for Ukraine and a potential strike by Kyiv on a bridge in Crimea, prompting officials in Moscow to demand an explanation. On Saturday, Germany called it an apparent act of eavesdropping and said it was investigating. \u201cThe recording itself says that within the Bundeswehr, plans to launch strikes on Russian territory are being discussed substantively and concretely. This does not require any legal interpretation. Everything here is more than obvious,\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Monday. \u201cHere we have to find out whether the Bundeswehr is doing this on its own initiative. Then the question is: how controllable is the Bundeswehr and how much does Scholz control the situation? Or is it part of German government policy?\u201d Peskov said. \u201cBoth (scenarios) are very bad. Both once again emphasise the direct involvement of the countries of the collective west in the conflict around Ukraine.\u201d Germany is among the Nato countries that have supplied weaponry to Ukraine including tanks. Russian attacks against Ukraine killed one person and injured 21 over the past day, according to regional authorities. The Kyiv Independent reports: Russia targeted a total of nine Ukrainian oblasts \u2013 Chernihiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Kharkiv. Casualties were reported in the latter four regions. A total of 16 people, including a 15-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl, were injured in Kurakhove, Donetsk oblast, after Russian forces dropped a 500-kilogram guided missile on the roof of a residential building, Ukraine\u2019s National Police said. The attack damaged 15 apartment buildings, according to authorities. Russia also hit the city of Pokrovsk with an Iskander-M missile, injuring three people, police said. Four multi-apartment buildings, 12 cars, and roads were damaged, the statement read. One person was killed in Kherson oblast as a result of Russian attacks, said Oleksandr Prokudin, the regional governor. Russian troops launched 10 strikes against multiple settlements in Kherson oblast, damaging around 16 houses, nine apartment buildings, and administrative buildings in Kherson, Prokudin noted. In Kharkiv oblast, Russian troops shelled the city of Vovchansk and attacked the village of Velykyi Burluk with guided aerial bombs, according to governor Oleh Syniehubov. Five houses and a warehouse were damaged, he said. A 60-year-old man sought medical help after a Russian attack on the villages of Kruhliakivka and Petropavlivka in the Kupiansk district, the governor reported. A Russian artillery strike against Nikopol district in Dnipropetrovsk oblast injured a 51-year-old woman, governor Serhii Lysak said. On the evening of 3 March, a Russian kamikaze drone attacked Nikopol, damaging the post office, a private house, and a car, according to the report. The Kremlin said it had nothing to say about the funeral of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, which drew thousands of people to Moscow\u2019s streets last week. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters the Kremlin had \u201cnothing more to say on this subject\u201d when asked about it. Crowds of people chanted \u201cPutin is a murderer\u201d and \u201cNo to war\u201d as they marched, under heavy police presence, to the Borisovsky cemetery where Navalny, 47, was lowered into the ground on Friday to the strains of Frank Sinatra\u2019s My Way. Russian authorities claim Navalny, Vladimir Putin\u2019s most formidable domestic opponent, fell unconscious and died suddenly after a walk. His widow has accused Putin of murdering him. Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence agency launched a cyber-attack against the servers of the Russian defence ministry, gaining access to \u201ca bulk of classified service documents,\u201d the agency said. The main department of intelligence of Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Defence wrote on Telegram: Now the Ukrainian special service has the information protection and encryption software used by the morph, as well as an array of secret service documents of the Russian Ministry of War. These are orders, reports, orders, reports and other documents that circulated between \uff1e2,000 structural units of the Russian military service. The information obtained allows us to establish the complete structure of the system of the Russian Ministry of Defence and its units. These claims are yet to be independently verified. A railway bridge near the Russian city of Samara has been rocked by an explosion, the RIA news agency reported. Located on the Volga river in Russia\u2019s southwest, the Samara region is one of the country\u2019s heavy industry hubs. The incident, which happened around 6am, was reportedly caused by an explosive device. The bridge and the adjacent railway connection were used by Russia to transport military cargo, according to the main department of intelligence of Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Defence. Russia has in recent months reported a series of attacks on its industrial and logistics infrastructure which it blamed on Ukraine. No casualties have been reported, but traffic over the bridge has been suspended, the Russian Railways said, describing the incident as \u201cillegal interference\u201d. These claims are yet to be independently verified by the Guardian. Nato will begin large-scale military drills on Monday \u2013 which will last nearly two weeks \u2013 to defend its newly expanded Nordic territory. More than 20,000 soldiers from over a dozen countries will take part in the Norweigan-led Nordic Response 24 exercises in the northern regions of Finland, Norway and Sweden, with the participation of Finland as a Nato member for the first time. The other participating nations in the exercise that runs through to 15 March reportedly include: Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the US. \u201cThe exercise will demonstrate Nato\u2019s operating capability, cohesion, and will to defend all of the Alliance\u2019s area,\u201d the Finnish military said in a statement. \u201cAs Steadfast Defender 24 will be the most substantial training exercise of Nato in decades, its preparations and those of Nordic Response 24 have been underway now for a number of years already.\u201d Relations between Moscow and Helsinki deteriorated after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, prompting Finland to drop decades of military non-alignment and join the western military alliance Nato in April 2023. Russia, with which Finland shares an 830-mile (1,340km) border, swiftly warned of \u201ccountermeasures\u201d. With its bid now ratified by all Nato members, neighbouring Sweden is now finalising formalities to enter the military alliance as its 32nd member \u2013 most likely in March. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Nato will start an exercise on Monday to defend its newly expanded Nordic territory when more than 20,000 soldiers from over a dozen countries take part in drills lasting nearly two weeks in the northern regions of Finland, Norway and Sweden. With over 4,000 Finnish soldiers taking part, the Norway-led Nordic Response 2024 drills are part of the largest Nato military exercise in decades. \u201cFor the first time, Finland will participate as a Nato member nation in exercising collective defense of the alliance\u2019s regions,\u201d the Finnish Defense Forces said in a statement. We will bring you more on this shortly. In other key developments: Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for Ukraine\u2019s western partners to summon the political will to provide Kyiv with the necessary military supplies or the world will face \u201cone of the most shameful pages of history\u201d. The Ukrainian president issued his appeal as a US package to provide military and other assistance remains blocked by disagreements in Congress. A clearly angry Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, said the world had to \u201creact firmly\u201d to ensure that the war becomes a \u201chopeless\u201d enterprise for Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, who wants only \u201cwar and death.\u201d \u201cThe main thing is political will in order to realise this, to secure the level of supplies which will help,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this is not the case, it will become one of the most shameful pages of history, if America or Europe loses to Iranian \u201cShaheds\u201d [drones] or Russian fighter jets.\u201d Germany\u2019s defence minister has accused Russia of conducting an \u201cinformation war\u201d aimed at creating divisions within the country, in his first comments after the publication of an audio recording of a meeting of senior German military officials. Russian media on Friday published a 38-minute recording of a call in which German officers were heard discussing weapons for Ukraine and a potential strike by Kyiv on a bridge in Crimea, prompting officials in Moscow to demand an explanation. The death toll from a Russian drone strike on an apartment building in Odesa on Saturday rose to 12, after rescue workers found another four bodies. Among the dead was an eight-year-old girl, discovered near the body of her older brother, who had been uncovered earlier, regional governor Oleh Kiper said. The dead also included a mother who was found holding her baby, as well as a toddler and a second baby. Five people were injured overnight by Russian shelling on residential areas in Myrnohrad and Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, according to the regional prosecutor\u2019s office. Ukraine\u2019s interior ministry also reported one death and three people injured in the southern Kherson region on Sunday after Russian strikes. People were still queueing up to place flowers on Alexei Navalny\u2019s grave in Moscow\u2019s Borisovskoye cemetery on Sunday. The pile of floral tributes is growing despite state intimidation as Russians pay tribute to the late opposition leader. Turkey believes it is time for ceasefire talks to start in Ukraine, its foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, said at a press conference on Sunday. Fidan said: \u201cA dialogue for a ceasefire [in Ukraine] should start. That doesn\u2019t mean recognising the occupation [by Russia], but issues of sovereignty and ceasefire should be discussed separately.\u201d The wife of Vladimir Kara-Murza, one of Russia\u2019s most high profile political prisoners, says it has taken two years to secure a meeting with the UK government, despite him being a British citizen. Kara-Murza is serving a 25-year sentence in a Siberian jail and his wife, Evgenia, told the Observer she only met David Cameron on Friday. Ukraine\u2019s border with Poland remains blocked at all six checkpoints to trucks because of protests by Polish farmers about the import of grain from Ukraine, according to local reports. State Border Guard spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said on national television that about 2,400 trucks had been waiting to pass the border as of Sunday, according to a report in The Kyiv Independent. Ukraine launched a mass drone attack on the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula early on Sunday, with unconfirmed reports of powerful explosions near the port of Feodosia. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said Ukraine launched 38 drones and that its air defences destroyed all of them. It did not say whether any damage or casualties resulted from the attack in a statement on its Telegram channel."

            "date": "2024-03-16T16:46:33Z",
            "content": "Israeli negotiators are expected to arrive in Qatar on Sunday amid intense new efforts to bring the war in Gaza to at least a temporary halt, after Hamas abandoned key ceasefire demands last week following a series of setbacks. In recent days, the militant organisation has been disappointed by the failure of its calls for a wave of protest during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, angered by the appointment without consultation of a new prime minister by the Palestinian Authority (PA) and suffered the possible death of a key military commander in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. On Friday, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said he had approved plans for a military assault on Rafah, Gaza\u2019s southernmost city, which is Hamas\u2019s last main stronghold but also now home to more than 1 million people, mostly displaced from elsewhere in the territory. The developments have weakened Hamas\u2019s negotiating position even as casualties continue to rise in Gaza and global outrage continues to grow. On Saturday, ministry of health officials in the territory, which Hamas has ruled since 2007, said the total number of deaths since the beginning of the Israeli offensive had reached 31,490, mostly women and children. Sources close to Hamas said its leaders now recognise that they need to show Palestinians \u201ca big victory\u201d to avoid a popular backlash after the immense destruction and loss of lives in five months of war. \u201cThey know now that they need to demonstrate that they are really on the side of the people,\u201d said one source. Though the militant Islamist organisation is sticking to its demand for the release of between about 500 and 1,000 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails in return for 40 of more than 100 Israeli hostages that it is thought to be holding in Gaza, it has dropped a demand for a permanent ceasefire and has said it will accept a 40-day initial pause in hostilities. Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official, said on Friday that Netanyahu was \u201cnot interested in reaching an agreement\u201d. Israeli officials now believe that Marwan Issa, the deputy military leader of Hamas in Gaza, died in an airstrike a week ago that targeted a tunnel complex under the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. All Hamas communications systems between senior leaders \u2013 which rely on encrypted apps and couriers \u2013 went silent for more than 72 hours after the strike, as has happened on several previous occasions when senior Hamas leaders have been killed. The strike against Issa, one of the key organisers of the 7 October attack launched by Hamas on Israel, suggests Israel is getting information from a source high in the organisation, experts said. \u201cIsrael would have needed to know where and when Issa was hiding, that he would remain there with time for the cabinet to approve and [Israeli\u2019s military] to launch the operation, and would have needed to confirm that no Israeli captives were being held near him as human shields \u2013 something that could have only been confirmed via a human asset,\u201d said Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official and regional analyst. Hamas killed about 1,160 Israelis, mostly civilians, on 7 October and took approximately 250 hostages, of whom about half were released during a week-long ceasefire in November in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Thirty or more might have died in captivity. Hamas has also demanded a withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza, more humanitarian aid to be allowed into the territory and the return of displaced residents to its north, which has been devastated by the Israeli offensive. Israel has called the proposal \u201cunrealistic\u201d, but observers noted this was more moderate language than previously. The negotiations have divided Hamas, sources in touch with the organisation and analysts said. The principal split is between its leaders in Gaza, who planned last year\u2019s attack, and those in exile in Qatar, Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries, who were warned only that a big operation was imminent but were not told of its details. \u201cIt seems apparent that there are tensions within the movement. There have always been different factions \u2026 but this has clearly been exacerbated since October,\u201d said Hugh Lovatt, of the European Council on Foreign Relations. Hamas\u2019s political leadership outside Gaza is thinking carefully about what comes after any ceasefire, and could accept a plan for the PA, which partially governs the occupied West Bank, to assume responsibility for administering Gaza after the war as part of a broader Palestinian political agreement. \u201cBut that\u2019s not where the hardliners are and the external political wing can\u2019t act without the consent of the Gaza-based leadership. They are very much in control because they are on the ground,\u201d said Lovatt. In recent months, Hamas has sought to improve relations with Fatah, the long-term rival faction that is dominant in the PA, by including its leaders among those whose freedom it is demanding from Israel. One is Marwan Barghouti, one of the most popular politicians among Palestinians, who has spent more than 20 years in prison and is seen as a potential presidential candidate. \u201cA credible [ceasefire agreement] has to deal with prisoners as Palestinian national fighters, not as members of different groups,\u201d said Qadura Fares, the PA\u2019s minister of prisoner affairs. On Friday, Hamas issued a statement that was fiercely critical of the PA, after its president, Mahmoud Abbas, appointed a new prime minister without consulting the group. Hamas accused Abbas of \u201cmaking individual decisions, and engaging in formal steps that are devoid of substance [and] without national consensus\u201d and so reinforcing \u201ca policy of exclusion and the deepening of division\u201d. In response, Fatah complained that Hamas had not \u201cconsulted\u201d other Palestinian factions before launching its attack last year and accused the Islamist movement of \u201chaving caused a \u2026 catastrophe even more horrible and cruel than that of 1948\u201d \u2013 a reference to the displacement and expulsion of about 760,000 Palestinians from their lands during the wars surrounding the creation of Israel. \u201cThe real disconnection from reality and the Palestinian people is that of the Hamas leadership,\u201d said Fatah. Analysts said that Fatah\u2019s fierce criticism would resonate with many Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. \u201cThe largest amount of anger from the Palestinians is clearly at the Israelis, but after that, there is probably a lot of ire aimed at Hamas, because the October attack gave the excuse to the Israelis to carry out this bombardment of Gaza. It\u2019s hard to see anything since as a success for the day-to-day lives of Palestinians,\u201d said HA Hellyer, senior associate fellow at London\u2019s Royal United Services Institute. So far, Hamas calls for massive protests in the West Bank and East Jerusalem during Ramadan have gone unheeded. More than 60,000 attended prayers on Friday at al-Aqsa mosque on the Haram al-Sharif, the raised compound in the heart of Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, which is known as the Temple Mount to Jewish people and is sacred to both faiths. \u201cI prayed for a better life for all of us, for peace, for a change,\u201d said Ahmed Ali, 70, as he left the Old City of Jerusalem after prayers on Friday."

            "title": "EU and US pile on pressure for Gaza ceasefire",
            "date": "2024-03-21T21:48:02Z",
            "content": "EU leaders have overcome their differences to call for an \u201cimmediate humanitarian pause leading to a sustainable ceasefire\u201d in Gaza, hours before the US is expected to bring a resolution to a vote at the UN calling for a truce and a hostage deal without delay in the face of a looming famine. The EU declaration, at a Brussels summit late on Thursday, marked the first time European leaders had agreed a declaration on the Middle East since October. The US draft resolution to be put to a vote in the UN security council on Friday morning also reflects greater urgency in Washington\u2019s position. It is the first time the Biden administration has put forward language calling for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d, although it continues to link a truce with a hostage deal. The council will vote on the US resolution at the same time as CIA and the Mossad spy chiefs William Burns and David Barnea are expected to arrive in Qatar on Friday in the hope of clinching an elusive truce-for-hostages deal between Israel and Hamas. Speaking in Egypt, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said difficult work remained to be done but added: \u201cI continue to believe it\u2019s possible.\u201d The EU declaration calls for the \u201cunconditional release of all hostages\u201d by Hamas, but does not make its demand for a halt to Israeli military operations dependent on a deal. In Brussels, Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, said all 27 EU members had agreed \u201ca strong and unified statement on the Middle East\u201d which including a call for \u201cfull and safe humanitarian access into Gaza\u201d. The eight-paragraph EU text expressed deep concern over the \u201cimminent risk of famine caused by insufficient entry of aid into Gaza\u201d. A European diplomat said the shift in US language in its draft resolution helped clear the path to an EU consensus on a European declaration, allowing countries such as Austria and the Czech Republic to \u201crevisit their position\u201d. Blinken characterised the US draft resolution as calling for \u201can immediate ceasefire tied to the release of hostages\u201d. \u201cAfter many rounds of consultations with the Security Council, we will be bringing this resolution for a vote on Friday morning,\u201d the US mission spokesperson at the UN, Nate Evans said, noting it had been under discussion by council members for several weeks. \u201cThis resolution is an opportunity for the council to speak with one voice to support the diplomacy happening on the ground and pressure Hamas to accept the deal on the table.\u201d The Biden administration has argued that an unconditional ceasefire would undermine leverage on Hamas to release its captives, seized during its 7 October attack on Israel, in which hundreds of civilians were killed. If the hostage talks in Doha fail however, the Biden administration will be faced with a dilemma: whether to continue to insist on the linkage between hostages and a ceasefire in the face of a clear warning this week from a UN panel of experts that a catastrophic famine in Gaza is imminent. Thursday night\u2019s European declaration reinforced a consensus among Washington\u2019s allies that an unconditional ceasefire has to be implemented before a hostage deal if necessary, in the face of a humanitarian catastrophe. At the UN, the French envoy, Nicolas de Rivi\u00e8re, said: \u201cIt\u2019s time to save lives.\u201d \u201cThe death toll is around 32,000 men and women. It needs to stop now. This is why I will encourage the security council to take action before the end of the week, before the weekend,\u201d de Rivi\u00e8re said. \u201cEach time there is a crisis in the world, the first thing the security council is asking for a ceasefire, and then talks. This is what we have to do on Gaza as well. There should not be an exception.\u201d The wording of the new US draft resolution, presented on Thursday and seen by the Guardian, gives some ground to the demands of Washington\u2019s European and Arab partners, with stronger language demanding humanitarian access and more ambiguous wording on the linkage between a truce and a hostage deal. It said an \u201cimmediate and sustained ceasefire\u201d was \u201cimperative\u201d adding that \u201ctowards that end\u201d unequivocal support should be given to the hostage negotiations. A European diplomat at the UN said the stress on an \u201cimmediate\u201d ceasefire and the phrase \u201ctowards that end\u201d showed significant movement in the US position. \u201cI think it is a shift in saying that a ceasefire is not contingent on a specific deal,\u201d the diplomat said. The change in US language also increases the pressure on the Israeli government, which has been insisting it will carry out a new offensive on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, in the face of strong US objections. The hostage talks in Doha will focus on closing a stubborn gap between the negotiating positions of the two parties. Israel has rejected a Hamas proposal for hostage release in exchange for an agreement that would end the war. Israel is focused instead on a temporary pause, in which 40 particularly vulnerable hostages, elderly and sick people and some women, would be freed for a six-week cessation of hostilities. \u201cI think the gaps are narrowing, and I think an agreement is very much possible,\u201d Blinken told the Saudi news channel Al Hadath. \u201cThe Israeli team is present, has authority to reach an agreement.\u201d Blinken restated the US opposition to a planned Israeli offensive on Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza where more than 1 million Palestinians have take shelter from Israeli bombing. \u201cA major military operation in Rafah would be a mistake, something we don\u2019t support, and it\u2019s also not necessary to deal with Hamas,\u201d Blinken told a news conference in Cairo. The Biden administration has invited Israeli officials to Washington to discuss alternatives, a meeting that is expected next week. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is meanwhile threatening to use his political clout in the US and his close relationship with the Republican party to resist pressure from the administration. Netanyahu held a 45-minute call with Republican senators on Wednesday, in which he vowed to press ahead with a Rafah operation. The House speaker, Michael Johnson, said he intended to invite the Israeli leader to address a joint session of Congress, which would be an echo of Netanyahu\u2019s previous appearance in 2015, when he used it as a platform to voice opposition to Barack Obama\u2019s Middle East policies. The US draft resolution is unusually detailed, containing 26 operative paragraphs, stressing the demand for \u201cthe immediate, safe, sustained and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale directly to the Palestinian civilian population throughout the Gaza Strip\u201d. Details of the draft resolution were revealed as the UN released an analysis of satellite imagery showing that 35% of buildings in Gaza had been damaged or destroyed during Israel\u2019s offensive, which has claimed almost 32,000 Palestinian lives. The new text sends Israel the clearest message yet of the Biden administration\u2019s growing frustration with its prosecution of the war, and comes after a warning from the UN human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, that Israel may be committing a war crime by using \u201cstarvation as a method of war\u201d."

            "title": "Gaza ceasefire talks appear to stall days before Ramadan",
            "date": "2024-03-05T21:38:23Z",
            "content": "Negotiations aimed at brokering a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war appear to have stalled, days before an unofficial deadline of the beginning of Ramadan. Two days of talks between Hamas and international mediators in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, have not yielded any significant breakthroughs, Palestinian officials said, after Israel declined to send a delegation to the latest round of negotiations. \u201c[Benjamin] Netanyahu doesn\u2019t want to reach an agreement\u201d and \u201cthe ball now is in the Americans\u2019 court\u201d to press the Israeli prime minister to come back to the table, Basem Naim, the head of Hamas\u2019s political division in Gaza, told reporters in text messages. Egypt\u2019s Al-Qahera News, which is close to the country\u2019s intelligence services, said the \u201cnegotiations are difficult but they are continuing\u201d, citing an unnamed senior official. The Hamas team, meeting with Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators, agreed on Tuesday to stay for at least one more day of talks. Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A US official had said on Saturday that Israel had \u201cmore or less accepted\u201d the deal presented to an Israeli delegation in Qatar. International mediators have over the last two days put pressure on Hamas to produce a list of hostages to be released as the first step in a phased ceasefire agreement with Israel, according to officials familiar with the discussions. The US has also appeared to suggest that it was Hamas holding up progress rather than Israel, despite the fact that Israel did not send a delegation to the second day of talks in Cairo as hoped. \u201cNo excuses, we must get more aid into Gaza. Ceasefire is in the hands of Hamas right now,\u201d Joe Biden told reporters on Tuesday. The US president suggested that failure to agree a deal could lead to unrest spreading to other parts of Israel and Palestine. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a ceasefire because if we get into circumstances where this continues to Ramadan, Israel and Jerusalem could be very, very dangerous,\u201d Biden said. Israel has demanded that Hamas present a list of 40 elderly, sick and female hostages who would be the first to be released as part of a truce that would initially last six weeks, beginning with the month of Ramadan, which is expected to start on Sunday. Hamas has reiterated its position that all Israeli forces leave Gaza, large-scale humanitarian aid should be allowed in, and that Palestinians displaced from their homes in the north of the coastal territory be allowed to return. Diplomatic sources in Washington said on Monday it was unclear what was stopping the Palestinian militant group from producing a list identifying the first batch of hostages, noting that similar uncertainties ended up collapsing the last successful truce in November after a week. They suggested it could reflect communications issues between Hamas units inside and outside Gaza, that some hostages could be held by other groups, including the more hardline Palestinian Islamic Jihad, or that elements of Hamas were withholding the information as a way of obstructing a deal. While Washington\u2019s rhetoric on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has strengthened over the last few days, critics say Biden has opted not to use Washington\u2019s leverage as Israel\u2019s principal arms supplier and most important international ally to bring Israel to the negotiating table, or get the country to increase the flow of aid to Gaza\u2019s desperate civilians. The US air force on Saturday began airdrops of aid in a joint operation with Jordanian planes, delivering a total of 38,000 meals, after an announcement from Biden the previous day. On Tuesday, a second airdrop of 30,000 meals were delivered by transport planes, but the White House national security spokesperson, John Kirby, acknowledged that the only way to deliver assistance on the large scale required was by road or sea. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at both military and commercial options to move assistance by sea, there\u2019s still an awful lot of work that\u2019s being done to flesh it out,\u201d Kirby said. Even if a means of delivering aid by ship was organised, he pointed out, it would still have to be unloaded and put on trucks for distribution inside Gaza. Kirby said that the US continued to press for more deliveries by road, which have slowed to a trickle, as a result of looting by criminals and hungry crowds, as well as Israeli red tape and lack of coordination. The World Food Programme reported on Tuesday that a 14-truck convoy that had approval from the Israeli authorities to go to northern Gaza had been held up for three hours and then turned back by Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint at Wadi Gaza, halfway up the coastal strip. After it was turned back, the convoy was looted. Israel\u2019s offensive has killed more than 30,000 people, displaced 85% of the 2.3 million population from their homes, and left more than half of the Gaza Strip\u2019s infrastructure in ruins, according to data from Gaza\u2019s health ministry and the UN. Child malnutrition is soaring in the besieged territory, with UN officials reporting on Monday that one in six children under the age of two in the northern half of Gaza are acutely malnourished. The World Health Organization estimated on Tuesday that at least 8,000 patients needed to be evacuated for treatment, which would relieve pressure on the few remaining functioning hospitals. The war, now five months old, was sparked by Hamas\u2019s unprecedented surprise attack on communities across Israel in which, according to Israeli figures, about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 abducted. About 100 hostages were exchanged for 240 Palestinian women and children held in Israel jails in November, but progress on a second deal has proved evasive. While the start of Ramadan is not a hard deadline for a new ceasefire, the UN says a quarter of Gaza\u2019s population are facing starvation, making a comprehensive ceasefire in which sufficient aid can reach all areas of the besieged territory crucial. The longer the fighting lasts, the greater the risk of conflagration: Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen have already been drawn into the conflict. Ramadan is often accompanied by an uptick in violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, even in quieter years. Fighting continued in Gaza on Tuesday, with Hamas officials reporting dozens of Israeli airstrikes near the European hospital in Hamad, near the southern city of Khan Younis. Bombing, shelling and ground fighting across Gaza had killed another 97 people in the past 24 hours, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said, which does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths. Israel said its jets had struck 50 targets over the past day."

            "date": "2024-03-03T16:55:40Z",
            "content": "A Hamas delegation was in Cairo on Sunday for talks on efforts to broker a ceasefire in the war in Gaza after indications that Israel had provisionally accepted a six-week phased hostage and truce deal before the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Qatari and US mediators also arrived in the Egyptian capital on Sunday, according to the state-linked Al Qahera News. Talks involving Israeli negotiators took place in the Qatari city of Doha on Saturday and Hamas is expected to respond on Sunday or Monday as time runs out before the unofficial deadline of 10 or 11 March, when Ramadan starts. The month of fasting is often accompanied by an uptick in violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, even in quieter years. A Hamas official said that if Israel were to meet its demands \u2013 which include a complete military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and stepped-up humanitarian aid \u2013 this would \u201cpave the way for an agreement within the next 24-48 hours\u201d. Another unnamed Palestinian official told Reuters, however, that a ceasefire deal was still not imminent, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet.\u201d A US official said on Saturday that Israel had \u201cmore or less accepted\u201d a deal presented by mediators. However, Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has so far refused to pull troops out of Gaza before Hamas is destroyed and all hostages are freed. Israel had yet to confirm it had accepted the truce plan or whether it would attend the Cairo talks. Kamala Harris, the US vice president, called on Sunday for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and pressed Israel to increase the flow of aid to ease what she called \u201cinhumane\u201d conditions and a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe\u201d among the Palestinian people. Stemming the bloodshed in Gaza has been a difficult diplomatic task in the nearly five-month-old war sparked by Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel in which, according to Israeli figures, about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 abducted. Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 30,000 people, displaced more than 85% of the 2.3 million-strong population from their homes and left more than half of the strip\u2019s infrastructure in ruins, according to data from Gaza\u2019s health ministry and the UN. Increasing the flow of aid is crucial. The local health ministry said on Sunday that 16 children had died from malnutrition and dehydration at Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahiya, and the UN has said about a quarter of the 2.3 million population is \u201cone step away from famine\u201d. Hamas has indicated its negotiating position could be influenced by the deaths of 115 Palestinians in Gaza who were killed after Israeli troops opened fire near a crowd of people scrambling to get food from an aid convoy on Thursday. Israel\u2019s military said on Sunday that a preliminary review found its forces did not strike the convoy and that most Palestinians died in a crowd crush, although it acknowledged it fired at individuals who it said posed a threat to soldiers. The military spokesperson R Adm Daniel Hagari did not give details on the alleged threat but said \u201can independent, professional and expert body\u201d would do a more thorough examination that would be shared \u201chopefully in the coming days\u201d. UN officials visiting al-Shifa hospital the day after the attack said they saw many survivors with gunshot wounds, matching interviews with doctors treating the injured and witness accounts of the incident. The scale of the looming starvation has pushed the US to start airdropping food into the besieged territory, a move criticised by aid agencies and human rights groups as expensive and ineffective. Jordan and some other countries have already begun airdrops. On Sunday, local media broadcast footage of screaming Palestinian children running toward food parcels that drifted on black parachutes on to the strip\u2019s Mediterranean coastline. A November truce in which about 100 hostages were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinians in Israeli jails collapsed after a week, and progress on a second deal has proved elusive. With just a week left until Ramadan begins, civilians in Gaza, the relatives of the remaining hostages and international mediators are all aware that time may be running out to broker a comprehensive ceasefire. Fierce fighting across the strip continues despite the diplomatic talks. Another 90 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes in the last 24 hours, the health ministry said, including twin babies Baeem and Wissam Abu Anza, who were buried on Sunday as their mother, Rania, wept. A relative, Shehada Abu Anza, said \u201conly civilians\u201d were in the house when it was bombed, killing 14 members of one family. \u201cAll of them were sleeping when suddenly a missile hit and destroyed the whole house,\u201d he said as residents searched the rubble with their bare hands for bodies and also to salvage food. Residents said airstrikes hit Rafah, the strip\u2019s southernmost town, which has become the last place of relative safety for civilians fleeing the fighting, as well as Khan Younis, where Israeli forces are bogged down in ground battles with Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups. The Hamas media office also reported intense tank shelling in the northern half of Gaza. The Israeli military said it had hit about 50 targets, including \u201cunderground terrorist infrastructure\u201d. Critics of Joe Biden say he has opted not to use Washington\u2019s leverage as Israel\u2019s principal arms supplier and most important international ally to force Israel to draw down its campaign or increase the flow of aid to Gaza\u2019s desperate civilians.

            "date": "2024-03-09T06:00:25Z",
            "content": "Thousands of protesters are expected to gather again in central London to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the fifth major pro-Palestine demonstration in the capital so far this year. Saturday\u2019s protest comes a day after Dame Sara Khan, a UK government adviser on social cohesion, said attempts to portray protesters on pro-Palestinian marches as extremist were \u201coutrageous\u201d and dangerous. Khan, who is carrying out a review of the resilience of the UK\u2019s democracy for Michael Gove, said such claims risked further dividing the country. The Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) said its latest march was due to begin at noon at Hyde Park Corner and would finish at the US embassy in Nine Elms. The Metropolitan police has provided a map that attenders must follow to avoid being in breach of section 12 of the Public Order Act 2023. A section 14 condition is also in place that requires anyone who is participating in the PSC demo to assemble on the south side of Park Lane. The force said the protest must end with the crowd dispersing by 5pm and \u201canyone who fails to comply with these conditions will be dealt with by officers\u201d. The Met commander Karen Findlay, who will oversee policing across London on Saturday, said: \u201cTo minimise the impact of the protest we have consistently used our full range of legal powers over the last five months to manage these protests, and we will be doing so again this weekend. \u201cWe are clearly operating in a context where we understand our Jewish and Muslim communities continue to be highly concerned about antisemitic and anti-Muslim hate crime and their own sense of safety in London. \u201cWe recognise the very real anxiety and fear of individuals who are worried about perceived or actual threats they are subject to.\u201d Met officers will again be supported by colleagues from forces across the UK. The force said the protests since October had required 35,464 officer shifts and more than 5,200 officer rest days to be cancelled in addition to costs of \u00a332.3m. There is also a Million Women Rise demonstration in support of International Women\u2019s Weekend in the capital on Saturday, which includes a rally at Trafalgar Square. The former home secretary Suella Braverman has been condemned for describing the pro-Palestine demonstrations as \u201chate marches\u201d and the government\u2019s commissioner for counter-extremism, Robin Simcox, wrote in the Daily Telegraph on Friday that London had been \u201cpermitted to be turned into a no-go zone for Jews every weekend\u201d. Speaking to the Guardian, before Simcox\u2019s comments were published, Khan said: \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that we don\u2019t conflate those protesters, somehow saying or portraying them as somehow as being all extremists. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve been really uncomfortable with over the last couple of weeks is the kind of argument that they\u2019re all Islamist extremists on these demonstrations. I think that\u2019s actually outrageous. \u201cSome are not even pro-Palestinian people, just anti-war.\u201d The Israeli offensive was launched after the 7 October Hamas attack, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israeli strikes have killed more than 30,000 Palestinians in Gaza since October, two-thirds of them women and children."

            "date": "2024-03-28T16:27:27Z",
            "content": "Islamic State (IS) remains defeated in its core strongholds of the Middle East but has made significant progress in Africa and parts of south Asia, winning territory and resources that could serve as a launchpad for a new campaign of extremist violence, analysts and officials believe. European governments have moved to their highest levels of alert for years after the attack on a concert hall in Moscow last week by militants from IS which killed 140 people. Within 48 hours, France increased its surveillance and risk warning to the highest level and Italy too ordered enhanced measures. In Germany, officials described an \u201cacute risk\u201d. The attack in Moscow, the most lethal Islamist extremist operation ever in Europe, was claimed by IS which, officials believe, has been planning new operations against European targets for several years. Between 2015 and 2019, when IS ran a so-called caliphate across a swath of land it controlled across eastern Syria and western Iraq, the group\u2019s central leadership had little need of its newly established affiliates to launch operations in Europe as it had all resources to hand with foreign recruits, money and training camps. This led to a series of lethal attacks in France and Belgium. However, years of counter-terrorism operations by local security forces, the US and others, have degraded IS in its former strongholds and the group is fragmented and weak. Western security officials with close knowledge of IS in Iraq and Syria said the group had abandoned its project of rebuilding the so-called caliphate but that successful strikes at international targets were seen as \u201cgood for morale and the IS brand and compensate for failure closer to home\u201d. Recent US-led counter-terrorist operations have killed a series of IS leaders in Syria who were thought to have been planning attacks in Europe. \u201c[The US military\u2019s] decision to act against these individuals may indicate that the threat they posed needed to be dealt with immediately. It may also signal that IS is reprioritising external operations, which it has not had the capacity to do for some time,\u201d wrote analysts at the Washington Institute, a US-based thinktank. That new capability has come from affiliates, experts say. The Moscow attacks appear to have been the work of the group\u2019s branch in Afghanistan, known as Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP). ISKP, which was founded in 2015, has targeted propaganda and outreach on central Asia and has previously made multiple efforts to launch new recruits into Europe and Russia. Turkey has also been a focus of activity. The four suspects presented in court by Russia were from Tajikistan. Western security officials are focusing on communications among IS factions to answer the important question of how close links are between affiliates and the central leadership. Evidence from sub-Saharan Africa, where IS has expanded rapidly in recent years, suggests the central leadership is in close contact with affiliates and runs sophisticated communication networks. Habib Yusuf, the leader of the Islamic State\u2019s West Africa Province (ISWAP) now sits on the IS central leadership council, it is thought. The appointment is evidence of the enhanced status of successful affiliates. \u201cThere are testimonies of ISWAP commanders noting \u2026 requests for advice for bigger attacks, submitting proposals and intel. And there is a lot of technical and doctrinal advice that is sent. There are sometimes visitors \u2013 Arabs or Chechens, mostly \u2013 who come to advise, teach and confer, but the bulk of the conversation seems to happen online,\u201d said Vincent Foucher, research fellow with the French National Centre for Scientific Research. Caleb Weiss, editor at the Long War Journal, said IS had constructed an effective communications system via hubs located across sub-Saharan Africa. For example, the IS affiliate in Mozambique, now resurgent after suffering significant losses in a government and Rwanda-led offensive, was in touch with central leadership via IS militants elsewhere on the continent. \u201cIt is all coordinated through these regional offices so Mozambique is connected very strongly through Puntland \u2026 So that\u2019s how they\u2019re receiving training, funding, logistical support that is all being directed to them and status reports and requests get sent back,\u201d Weiss said. According to intelligence submitted by western and other agencies to the UN, similar systems link ISKP with the central leadership. A recent UN report found there has been significant communication between ISKP and the central leadership in recent years. On occasion, couriers have travelled to bring money or instructions to key central and south Asian leaders. A variety of encrypted social media platforms are being used for messages, western security officials say, and some might have been intercepted, leading to recent US warnings of an ISKP attack on venues in Russia such as concert halls that was relayed to Moscow but ignored. One concern is that the effectiveness of the campaign against IS in Syria and Iraq depended to a significant extent on the US and others having forces on the ground and being able to work with local partners. This is not the case in Afghanistan \u2013 though the Taliban has struggled to eradicate ISKP and launched repeated offensives against the group. In 2021, after its withdrawal from Kabul, the US said it would rely on an \u201cover the horizon\u201d capability to fight IS and other international extremist groups in Afghanistan. IS has also sought to exploit the conflict in Gaza to mobilise and radicalise new followers, issuing a series of calls for attacks around the world on civilian targets. In one statement, IS offered advice on \u201cpractical steps to fight the Jews\u201d but criticised Hamas for its links to Iran and narrow focus on Israel. The group called for attacks against Jews everywhere, but specifically in North America and in Europe. The annual US intelligence assessment, released two weeks ago, said the regional affiliates of IS and al-Qaida, the group responsible for 9/11 but now much weakened, were likely to expand in the future despite recent leadership losses. \u201cThis threat is mostly likely to manifest in small cells or individuals inspired by foreign terrorist organisations and violent extremist ideologies to conduct attacks,\u201d it said. Avril Haines, the US director of national intelligence, said this month that \u201cthe Gaza conflict will have a generational impact on terrorism\u201d."

            "title": "Socialism, anti-fascism and anti-abortion on Prevent list of terrorism warning signs",
            "date": "2024-03-07T13:38:09Z",
            "content": "A document from Prevent, the official scheme to stop radicalisation, includes believing in socialism, communism, anti-fascism and anti-abortion in a list of potential signs of ideologies leading to terrorism. It comes as the Conservative government considers widening what it will consider to be extremism. The document is part of online Prevent awareness training for those covered by the duty to inform if they suspect radicalisation. That includes teachers and youth workers. The guidance was updated last year and published with little or no fanfare, after William Shawcross\u2019s controversial government-ordered report on Prevent was released. A former head of counter-terrorism said it risked damaging Prevent, and human rights groups said the government was playing political games under the guise of stopping terrorism. In a section on the left wing it states: \u201cTwo broad ideologies: socialism and communism. Each are united by a set of grievance narratives which underline their cause.\u201d In a section on single-issue ideologies, the document reads: \u201cNarratives are likely to come from those who seek to change a specific policy or practice, as opposed to replacing the whole economic, political or social system. Examples include animal rights, anti-abortion or anti-fascism. Single-issue narratives can be politically agnostic, meaning they may be neither right nor left aligned.\u201d Neil Basu, a former police head of counter-terrorism, said: \u201cThat is far too nebulous, and there is no qualification. It might lead to unforeseen consequences such as overwhelming the system and bringing the system into disrepute. \u201cThe reputation of Prevent is still very fragile. It makes the haystack unnecessarily bigger in which you are trying to find the needle.\u201d Those completing the online course get a certificate to say they have awareness of Prevent. The government commissioned a review of Prevent by Shawcross, whose appointment led to a boycott of the review because of his alleged anti-Muslim and rightwing views. The guidance for those covered by the Prevent duty was updated afterwards in July 2023. The document details the main two ideologies driving the terrorist threat to the UK: Islamism, which makes up the bulk of the caseload, and the extreme right wing, which makes up about 20-30% of the caseloads, according to counter-terrorism sources. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cPrevent deals with all forms of radicalisation and it is important that this is effectively communicated within our training products so that frontline professionals are equipped to take the appropriate action. \u201cAll training products are regularly updated to ensure they are reflecting the latest threat picture.\u201d Jacob Smith, from Rights and Security International, a human rights advocacy group, said: \u201cFor years, we have expressed concern about how the government\u2019s broad concept of \u2018extremism\u2019 could be open to politicised abuses. It appears that this concern has now been realised through a blatant distinction between how the government wants to treat people on the \u2018left\u2019 versus people on the \u2018right\u2019 under Prevent. \u201cOur concern is only heightened by government rhetoric during the past few days that appears to be targeting British Muslims and protesters for Palestinian rights. If \u2018extremism\u2019 can mean anything the government wants it to mean, that\u2019s a clear problem for democracy.\u201d Ilyas Nagdee, from Amnesty International, said: \u201cThis is yet another crackdown from the UK government to stifle freedom of expression \u2013 including political speech and activism \u2013 using the blunt instrument that is Prevent. \u201cPrevent is brazenly being used here to target political expression as it has long been criticised of doing. The government should not be in the business of rolling out training and guidance on what they deem acceptable or unacceptable political ideologies and forms of activism.\u201d Other official training documents for Prevent state that \u201cunder the Prevent duty\u201d those covered by it must \u201csupport\u201d anyone at risk of radicalisation. It says: \u201cIt\u2019s not your responsibility to risk assess the level of radicalisation,\u201d and urges providing \u201cas much context as possible before it\u2019s shared with the police\u201d. Other official material says details that should be provided to the authorities about anyone being referred to Prevent should include name, religion, social media name, ethnicity, nationality, main language, immigration or asylum status, and any additional family details. It also says data that can be shared can include, neurodivergence, mental health, details about emotional health and cultural factors. It also asks any referral includes details of the \u201cideology of concern \u2026 provide details of the ideology which may be contributing to making the person susceptible to radicalisation\u201d. \u201cThis training is designed to make sure that when you share a concern that a person may be being radicalised into terrorism: it\u2019s informed; it\u2019s with good intention; the response to that concern is considered, and proportionate.\u201d"

            "content": "\u201cMadame, madame. They are putting fire everywhere. I just heard it on the radio.\u201d It was late morning last Thursday and Monique Clesca\u2019s gardener, Calixte, had come dashing into her home in the mountains above Haiti\u2019s capital with hair-raising news. \u201cHe was in shock,\u201d said the 71-year-old political activist and author. \u201cI knew something was wrong even before he spoke.\u201d All afternoon, Clesca flicked between Port-au-Prince\u2019s plethora of FM stations, trying to fathom the mayhem unfolding outside. Their progressively alarming broadcasts told of gang members with machine guns marauding through town, sending residents scattering for cover. One group of fighters was seen advancing on the international airport. Another mob had stormed a university, shooting a student in the ear. Police stations had been sprayed with bullets and burned. By the time Radio M\u00e9tropole\u2019s 6pm evening news came on air, Clesca had no doubt what had transpired. \u201cThe gangs had taken over the city,\u201d the writer said. Over the next seven days, members of Haiti\u2019s ruthless, politically connected gangs would launch an unremitting wave of attacks across the capital, leaving in their wake what the country\u2019s top newspaper, Le Nouvelliste, called \u201ca cortege of fire, blood, corpses, incalculable damage and fear\u201d. \u201cIt has been pure terror,\u201d Clesca said, describing the despairing mood among her peers. \u201cIt is sadness. It is terror. It is horror. It is anxiety. It is desolation.\u201d A full picture of the uprising \u2013 not to mention the tangled and obscure political and economic calculations driving it \u2013 is still emerging. On Thursday \u2013 one week after the turmoil began \u2013 the disorder and uncertainty continued, with one US official warning: \u201cThe government could fall at any time\u201d. If gang fighters seized the airport or presidential palace, \u201cit\u2019s over,\u201d the official told the news agency McClatchy. The death toll remains unclear, although numerous bodies have been dumped in the streets and at least six police officers have been killed. Haiti\u2019s debilitated government has said almost nothing about the convulsion bar a lackluster statement thanking citizens \u201cfor their calm, despite the very difficult times\u201d. Haiti\u2019s prime minister \u2013 and acting president \u2013 Ariel Henry, was abroad when the unrest began and has been unable to return. The future of the politician, who took power after President Jovenel Mo\u00efse\u2019s 2021 assassination plunged Haiti into a spiraling security crisis now reaching a crescendo, looks bleak. But a chronicle of Haiti\u2019s seven days of bedlam \u2013 and interviews with witnesses and experts \u2013 paints a startling portrait of how an already vulnerable country and its citizens have been pushed to the limit by a highly calculated revolt whose political architects remain in the shadows. \u201cThis not just random violence and this is not gangs taking power. It is gangs bringing down power,\u201d said Romain Le Cour, a security expert from the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime. Who or what would replace it with remains unclear. Daniel Foote, the outspoken former US special envoy to Haiti, said: \u201cI believe that the situation in Haiti has kind of crossed a Rubicon here. It\u2019s gone from being protests against Ariel Henry to a full-on revolution.\u201d Le Cour was in a \u201cred-orange\u201d zone of Haiti\u2019s violence-racked capital conducting research when the fighting broke out last Thursday morning. His first hunch something extraordinary was afoot came not over the radio, but from the man he was interviewing: a resident of Carrefour Feuilles, a strategically located suburb from where gang fighters were reputedly marching north towards the heart of the capital. \u201cThere is something big coming \u2013 this is not just like normal shootings,\u2019\u201d the man warned. Soon after, the researcher\u2019s phone confirmed that premonition. A barrage of WhatsApp alerts brought news of attacks in other parts of town, including the police academy just south of the US\u2019s fortress-like embassy. Gunmen and police were exchanging fire outside the Poste Marchand market near the city centre. \u201cThere was a lot of shooting for almost an hour,\u201d said Liline, a midwife in her 20s who lives nearby. Shortly before 2pm, a tweet from one of Haiti\u2019s police unions, the Syndicat de la Police Nationale d\u2019Ha\u00efti, captured the scope of the battle: \u201cThere are shootings all over downtown, students and vendors are running in all directions like crazy ants.\u201d The perpetrators of the violence quickly identified themselves. That morning, the infamous gang leader Jimmy Ch\u00e9rizier \u2013 a former special forces police officer nicknamed Barbecue \u2013 had summoned a small group of reporters to one of his strongholds. As anarchy spread, a nine-minute video was posted online in which Ch\u00e9rizier took responsibility and claimed he was leading a coalition of gangs that had united to bring down the unelected Henry, who has repeatedly resisted calls for a political transition. \u201cThe people of Haiti must be free \u2013 and we will achieve that with our guns,\u201d declared Ch\u00e9rizier, dressed in black tactical gloves and a balaclava and vowing to stop the prime minister coming home. Which, if any, political players lay behind the attempted power grab was not made clear. The next morning Port-au-Prince\u2019s stunned citizens woke to an uneasy calm. After a day of \u201chellish turmoil\u201d Haiti seemed to be on holiday, Le Nouvelliste reported, facetiously. The lull was short-lived. Within hours there were reports that fighters were trying to invade Port-au-Prince\u2019s container port. Ch\u00e9rizier called another outdoor press conference, appearing flanked by a dozen gun-toting bodyguards in ski masks and straw hats. The gangster\u2019s finger hovered near the trigger of his semi-automatic weapon as he gave further details of his anti-government crusade. \u201cIt was like a complete takeover,\u201d said Clesca, astonished that Haiti\u2019s government seemed to have almost entirely disappeared. \u201cIt was a massive assault on the city.\u201d Even more shocking developments lay ahead. At 9.21pm on Saturday, the police union tweeted another panicked appeal. It urged members of the security forces to race to the city\u2019s main prison to help repel a gang onslaught apparently designed to free thousands of dangerous inmates. If the criminals escaped, \u201cno one in the capital will be spared\u201d, the union warned. \u201cTOGETHER we can avoid the disaster.\u201d At around the same time, gunmen tried to overrun the international airport. \u201cThe gunfire was so intense, I thought they had reached my level in the building,\u201d said one of the terrified police officers inside, who asked not to be named. Airport security managed to beat back the assailants, but by daybreak on Sunday it became clear the national penitentiary had fallen. Nearly 4,000 inmates had fled, vanishing into the smoke and havoc consuming the second largest city in the Caribbean. Cadavers lay outside the jail\u2019s shattered entrance, putrefying in the sun. \u201cOur police officers \u2026 did not succeed in stopping the bandits from rescuing a large number of prisoners,\u201d the government admitted in a chastening press release \u2013 its only public statement on the violence to date. As Haiti\u2019s already fragile government appeared to crumble and gangsters occupied the city\u2019s football stadium, the airport terminal filled with anxious citizens and foreign visitors whose organizations or governments had advised them to get out. The mood in the check-in zone grew twitchy after an American Airlines flight to Miami was cancelled. Le Cour, who was among those trying to leave, secured a seat on one of the last flights to the US before the airport shut down. \u201cBefore we took off, people were just crossing themselves a thousand times,\u201d the security expert remembered. \u201cPeople were just praying for the plane to actually take off.\u201d Le Cour voiced relief at having departed but said he feared for the safety of Haitian colleagues and friends left behind to face a \u201cdevastating\u201d humanitarian emergency. Monique Clesca can see the besieged airport, which army troops are still battling to defend, from her hilltop home but has no plans to leave. Part of an opposition coalition known as the Montana Group, Clesca said she was determined not to capitulate to the growing sense of doom. Instead, she vowed to keep struggling for a peaceful, democratic future so Haiti was no longer continually disparaged by headline writers as the hopeless \u201cpoorest country in the whatever\u201d. \u201cTwo-thirds of the population is under 24. They are the ones who are going to inherit this country. And I think it is a responsibility, it is a duty, to leave something worthwhile for them ... so they don\u2019t think dying in the sea is better than staying and working in Haiti,\u201d Clesca said. \u201cI am fully into resistance mode. I\u2019m not putting my head down. No,\u201d the writer insisted. \u201cWe are fighting and we have been fighting for a long time and we are continuing to fight because I believe Haiti is worth it.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-03-28T06:41:05Z",
            "content": "Ukraine downed 26 Russian drones over Wednesday night, Mykola Oleshchuk, the head of Ukraine\u2019s air force, said on Thursday morning. \u201cThe enemy launched a missile air strike against Ukraine using three Kh-22 cruise missiles and an Kh-31P anti-radar missile (from the Black Sea), an S-300 anti-aircraft guided missile (Donetsk) and 28 attack UAVs of the Shahed-136/131 type. Twenty-six attack UAVs of the Shahed-136/131 type were destroyed within Odesa, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions,\u201d he said on Telegram, without providing details on the missile strikes. Russia has bombed the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, killing at least one civilian and wounding 16 others, according to authorities. The airstrikes caused widespread damage, hitting several residential buildings and damaging the city\u2019s institute for emergency surgery. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine\u2019s president, condemned the attack as \u201cRussian terror\u201d and Volodymyr Tymoshko, head of the Kharkiv regional police, said Moscow might have used a new type of guided bomb, which he described as the UMPB D-30. \u201cThis is something between a guided aerial bomb which they [the Russians] have used recently, and a missile. It\u2019s a flying bomb so to say.\u201d The regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said: \u201cIt seems that the Russians decided to test their modified bombs on the residents of the houses.\u201d After the attack on Kharkiv, Zelenskiy urged Ukraine\u2019s allies to speed up deliveries of warplanes and air defence systems. \u201cThere are no rational explanations for why Patriots, which are plentiful around the world, are still not covering the skies of Kharkiv and other cities.\u201d Russian has formed a \u201cDnipro River flotilla\u201d in occupied Kherson that is likely to be susceptible to attacks by Ukraine\u2019s uncrewed surface vehicles (USVs), or drone boats, according to an intelligence update from the UK Ministry of Defence. Vladimir Putin has reportedly told Russian military pilots that the supply of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine will not alter the situation on the battlefield. But they can carry nuclear weapons and Moscow would have to take account of that in its military planning, the Russian president was quoted as saying. Earlier on Wednesday, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the jets should arrive in Ukraine in the coming months. A Ukrainian spy chief has hinted at a secretive assassination campaign \u201cpossibly\u201d run by Ukraine\u2019s SBU spy agency to take out Ukrainian citizens collaborating with Russia. In a televised interview with Ukraine\u2019s national broadcaster ICTV, the head of the SBU, Vasyl Malyuk, said Ukrainian spies had targeted \u201cvery many\u201d people responsible for war crimes and attacks against Ukrainian citizens. \u201cOfficially, we will not admit to this. But at the same time I can offer some details.\u201d Once intelligence had been confirmed, the SBU was sanctioned to carry out the assassinations by civilian authorities, Malyuk said. One high-profile target was Ukraine-born, pro-Russia propagandist Vladlen Tatarsky. He was killed in 2023 when he was handed an explosive-rigged statuette in a St Petersburg cafe. Malyuk said he was targeted for his military service fighting against Ukraine and his calls for the elimination of Ukrainians. The SBU has detained two alleged agents of Russia\u2019s intelligence agency accused of passing the location of sensitive military targets to enemy forces. \u201cAs a result of a special operation, two [Russian] FSB agents were detained in Kyiv and Odesa,\u201d the SBU said in a statement. \u201cBoth criminals were detained red-handed while spying on potential targets for the occupiers.\u201d One of the suspects photographed a thermal power station, ostensibly to help Russia with its bombardment of Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Both were charged with collaboration and face life in prison. A Russian court has sentenced Lucy Shtein, a member of feminist group Pussy Riot and a former municipal deputy in Moscow, to six years in prison in absentia for anti-war social media posts, Reuters reported the court\u2019s press service as saying on Wednesday. Shtein, 27, in March 2022 posted on Twitter accusing Russian soldiers of \u201cbombing foreign cities and killing people\u201d. Shtein fled house arrest in Moscow to live in Iceland soon after the invasion, and reportedly has Icelandic citizenship. At least 19,855 people have been detained in Russia for expressing anti-war views since the full-scale invasion, according to OVD-Info, a monitoring group. Samsung has said it will stop supporting the Russian payment card Mir on its mobile payment service from 3 April \u2013 a result of anti-war sanctions. The US treasury has announced sanctions on Russia\u2019s national payment card system, the central bank-owned entity that operates Mir. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, will discuss support for Ukraine during talks in Paris next week with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the US state department has announced. After Paris, Blinken will head to Brussels for talks of Nato foreign ministers ahead of the alliance\u2019s 75th anniversary summit in Washington in July. Blinken will also hold a three-way meeting in Brussels with EU leaders and the Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, who wants to branch out from Armenia\u2019s alliance with Russia."

            "content": "Four suspects have appeared in court in Moscow charged over the terrorist attack on the Crocus City concert hall on Friday that left 137 people dead. The men were officially identified as citizens of Tajikistan, the Tass state news agency said, and were remanded in custody for two months at Sunday\u2019s hearing. The court released a video showing police officers bringing one of the suspects into the courtroom in handcuffs, as well as photographs of the same man sitting in a glass cage for defendants. One of the suspects was led blindfolded into the courtroom. When his blindfold was removed, a black eye was visible. Another suspect was brought into the courtroom in a wheelchair. The men, identified as Saidakrami Murodali Rachabalizoda, Dalerdzhon Barotovich Mirzoyev, Shamsidin Fariduni and Muhammadsobir Fayzov, face charges of a \u201cterror attack committed by a group of individuals resulting in a person\u2019s death\u201d, according to the Tass news agency. All four pleaded guilty. Earlier on Sunday, Islamic State had released new footage of the attack, corroborating the terror group\u2019s claim to have masterminded the slaughter even as Russia has sought to place the blame on Ukraine, which Kyiv denies. The incident near Moscow is the deadliest IS-claimed assault on European soil and the deadliest attack by any group in Russia since the 2004 Beslan siege. The footage, published by IS\u2019s news agency Amaq, showed gunmen filming themselves as they hunted victims in the lobby of the hall and fired from point-blank range, killing scores of people. At one point, one gunmen tells another to \u201ckill them and have no mercy\u201d. Vladimir Putin said 11 people had been detained, including the four gunmen. Russia\u2019s investigative committee released a video earlier yesterday showing the suspects being led, blindfolded, into its headquarters. Russia observed a nationwide day of mourning on Sunday for the worst terror attack on the country\u2019s soil in two decades, as the official number of wounded rose to 154. Russian authorities have said they expect the death toll to rise with at least one dozen victims still in critical condition. Thousands of people brought flowers and other tributes to the Crocus City Hall in Krasnogorsk, outside Moscow, as local emergency workers say they are still continuing to search for anyone who may be left wounded or dead inside the severely damaged entertainment complex. Putin has not yet visited the site of the shooting. The Kremlin published footage showing the president lighting a candle at a church at his residence outside Moscow on Sunday evening to honour those who died. Foreign embassies in Moscow have also voiced their solidarity with the victims of the terrorist attack. Flags were lowered to half-mast at the embassies of the US, the UK and the Netherlands amid high tensions over the war in Ukraine. The Russian leader also claimed, without evidence, that Ukraine had \u201cprepared a window\u201d for the terrorists to cross the border from Russia into Ukraine. Kyiv has vociferously denied any links to the attack and has indicated that it believes Moscow is preparing a pretext to escalate the conflict. The US has said it received intelligence that the terror group acted alone. \u201cIsis bears sole responsibility for this attack. There was no Ukrainian involvement whatsoever,\u201d the national security council spokesperson, Adrienne Watson, said in a statement. Russian officials and state media have largely ignored IS\u2019s claims to be behind the attacks. Meduza, an independent Russian-language website, has reported that Russian state-funded and pro-government media had been instructed by the Putin administration to emphasise possible \u201ctraces\u201d of Ukrainian involvement in the attack, according to two state media employees. Olga Skabeyeva, a prominent state television host, claimed on Telegram that Ukrainian military intelligence had recruited assailants \u201cwho would look like Isis. But this is no Isis\u201d. Putin did not name the Islamist terror group during his public statements on the attack, while directly accusing the \u201cUkrainian side\u201d of involvement. IS also released a photograph of the purported gunmen before the attack. Researchers have noted that their clothing matches that worn by some of the attackers. On Sunday, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, disregarded the US intelligence reports that IS was behind the attacks. \u201cI wish they could have solved the assassination of their own President Kennedy so quickly,\u201d she wrote on Telegram. \u201cBut no, for more than 60 years they have not been able to find out who killed him after all. Or maybe that was Isis too?\u201d \u201cUntil the investigation into the terrorist attack at Crocus City Hall is completed, any phrase from Washington exonerating Kyiv should be considered as evidence,\u201d she added. \u201cAfter all, the financing of terrorist activities of the Kyiv organised criminal group by the American liberal democrats and participation in the corrupt schemes of the Biden family have been going on for many years.\u201d Fresh details have emerged of how the gunmen stormed the concert hall and began firing into crowds of people, then set fire to the building and fled the scene, leading to a fevered manhunt for the terrorists. The Russian investigative committee said those killed in the concert hall died of gunshot wounds and \u201cpoisoning\u201d related to the fire. The gunmen appear to have planned the attack carefully, setting fires by an emergency stairwell in order to herd people toward a killing zone in the middle of the lobby. The men were caught in the southern Bryansk region, where authorities said they disabled their vehicle, and then apprehended several of the suspects as they fled into a nearby forest. New videos have been published showing Russian security forces interrogating the men, at least one of whom spoke Tajik during an interrogation. Tajikistan\u2019s foreign ministry initially denied that the suspects were citizens of the country. In a phone call on Sunday, Putin and the Tajikistan leader, Emomali Rahmon, \u201cnoted that security services and relevant agencies of Russia and Tajikistan are working closely in countering terrorism, and this work will be intensified\u201d. Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) has previously been reported to have recruited radicalised nationals from central Asia, including Tajikistan. Some of the videos of the interrogations suggest that the men were tortured by Russian security services. One of the clips, circulated by Russian bloggers, appears to show members of the security forces cutting off the ear of a man who is later interrogated over the attack and then stuffing it into his mouth. Another appears to show security forces beating a suspect with their rifle butts and kicking him as he lies in the snow. Russian independent media noted that the officer who apparently cut off the ear of the suspect was wearing patches that indicated his support for neo-Nazi groups and appeared to have contact with the far-right Rusich paramilitary group, which is active in Ukraine. The patches included a black sun and a symbol resembling the Totenkopf \u2013 or death\u2019s head \u2013 worn by several Nazi divisions. Experts have described Friday\u2019s attack as a failure of the country\u2019s sprawling security services, which have been distracted by the war in Ukraine and a relentless crackdown on political opposition at home. \u201cThe FSB obviously had their priorities wrong. They had their main resources on Ukraine and on the domestic opposition,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, an expert on the Russian security services. \u201cWhat is striking is the catastrophic incompetence of our security services,\u201d Ivan Zhdanov, the former head of late opposition leader Alexei Navalny\u2019s anti-corruption foundation, told AFP. Andrei Soldatov, a leading Russian researcher, wrote that the FSB had become \u201cvery efficient and innovative at repression \u2026 But these are not the qualities that help to prevent attacks happening, and time and again the FSB has failed as an intelligence collection agency because other things are needed: information-sharing capabilities between agencies, both domestic and foreign, and trust between those agencies and within those agencies.\u201d Meanwhile, Jeremy Hunt said that the UK should \u201cabsolutely\u201d be concerned about the threat that IS poses to the country after the terror attack in Moscow. \u201cWe are very lucky in this country that we have incredibly impressive intelligence agencies, who have been successful in stopping, in foiling a lot of terrorist threats over recent years,\u201d the British chancellor told Sky News. \u201cBut we have to remain vigilant. And if it is Islamic State, they are utterly indiscriminate in what they do. They\u2019re prepared to murder in the most horrific way.\u201d"

            "content": "US marriages have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, with more than 2m such unions in 2022 \u2013 while the divorce rate continued to fall, according to the federal government. The total of almost 2.1m \u201cI do\u2019s\u201d in 2022 marks a 4% increase from the year before. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the data on Friday, but it has not released marriage data for last year. In 2020, the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, there were only 1.7m US weddings \u2013 the lowest number recorded since 1963. The pandemic threw many marriage plans into disarray, as communities ordered people to stay at home and banned large gatherings to limit the spread of Covid, which has killed more than a million Americans and millions more around the world. US marriages then rose in 2021, but not to pre-pandemic levels. They ticked up again in 2022 and surpassed 2019 marriage statistics by a small margin. New York, the District of Columbia and Hawaii saw the largest increases in marriages from 2021 to 2022. Nevada, home to Las Vegas\u2019s quickie wedding chapels, continued to have the highest marriage rate in the nation, though it slightly decreased from 2021. The number and rate of US divorces in 2022 fell slightly, continuing a downward trend, the CDC said. Overall, marriages remain far less common than they once were in the US. According to data that goes back to 1900, weddings hit their height in 1946, when the marriage rate was 16.4 per 1,000 people. The rate was above 10 in the early 1980s before beginning a decades-long decline. In 2022, the marriage rate was 6.2 per 1,000 population. The Associated Press contributed reporting"

            "date": "2024-03-21T05:00:24Z",
            "content": "In March 2020, the pandemic closed in like a fog, ushering in a strange new vocabulary, alarming statistics and the fear of illness and death. In the days before the first national lockdown was ordered, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser suggested that a \u201cgood outcome\u201d would be keeping UK deaths below 20,000, a number that sounded improbably awful at the time, but which has been dwarfed by the 233,791 deaths recorded as of December 2023. The direct effects of the Covid-19 virus have been profound and continue to be felt, including by those with long Covid. But four years on, the UK is also reeling from the broader health impacts of the pandemic. Babies and children appear to have suffered developmental setbacks due to lengthy periods of isolation. Access to healthcare continues to be affected. Older people, who needed protecting most from Covid, were also uniquely vulnerable to the effects of physical inactivity. For some individuals, the pandemic prompted a rethink of priorities and provided new opportunities that paved the way for a healthier life. But as a nation, it delivered a body blow, from which experts say recovery will not be easy or automatic. Babies and preschool children Babies born in 2020 emerged into a different world from those born before or afterwards. Even after the newborns left socially distanced hospital wards, grandparents and friends were kept at arm\u2019s length (or farther), play groups and playgrounds were shut and interactions with other children were limited. \u201cSome of the babies were born quite isolated, they didn\u2019t see many people and most of the faces they saw would\u2019ve been masked,\u201d said Prof Monica Lakhanpaul, a researcher in child health at University College London and a consultant paediatrician. \u201cThey weren\u2019t able to engage with other children as much, which affects emotional, physical and social development.\u201d Official data shows national rates of child development are now lower among two-year-olds than they were in 2018-19, before the pandemic, with more than 80,000 children born in 2020-21 failing to reach one or more of the key measures of progress for their age group. \u201cWe have seen early years children who weren\u2019t physically moving as much. We\u2019re seeing children with speech delay because there was less human interaction,\u201d Lakhanpaul said. \u201cThe caveat is that those most affected are those who we were already concerned about.\u201d This is reflected in widening disparities between local authorities, with nearly 95% of children in Wokingham, Berkshire, meeting developmental targets compared with just 44% of those in Brent, north London. With many health visitor checkups done remotely, or postponed, fewer developmental delays were spotted. \u201cDevelopmental milestones are like building blocks. You need the bricks at the bottom to get to the next stage,\u201d said Lakhanpaul. \u201cIf everything is delayed, you can\u2019t integrate with society and do all the things you\u2019re meant to do with other children of that age.\u201d A central purpose of measuring milestones is to prevent, or limit, this onward cascade by targeting interventions effectively. Prof Adam Finn, a paediatric researcher at the University of Bristol, makes a comparison with growth delays during a lengthy childhood illness. \u201cOnce they\u2019re better, if you give them the food they need, they don\u2019t just start growing again, they catch up and then they go back to normal,\u201d he said. The same is true for some other aspects of development, he said, \u201cbut you have to do stuff to fix it; it won\u2019t just happen by itself\u201d. The concern is that those interventions are not happening \u2013 or not for everyone. \u201cSchools are already working at capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ones that most need it are the least well resourced. The wealthy schools and the wealthy people have already got that and spare.\u201d In February 2021, at the most intensive phase of the vaccine programme, Sir Simon Stevens, the then head of NHS England, said the country was facing a \u201cdual epidemic\u201d of coronavirus and disinformation, which needed to be fought with \u201cequal vigour\u201d. Some have blamed a lingering \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d for the declining uptake of childhood vaccines that is now threatening a resurgence of measles, polio and whooping cough (pertussis) in the UK. However, Finn, who is also a member of the government\u2019s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), argues the pandemic has merely exacerbated an ongoing decline, mostly driven by poverty, insecure housing and overstretched NHS services. \u201cThere\u2019s been a steady downward trend in coverage that was already going on before Covid and which has continued to go on since,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just down to anti-vaccine, mad internet stuff.\u201d \u201cThe real problem we\u2019ve got is around delivery,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is that vaccination enjoys majority support that politicians can only dream of \u2013 surveys show 95% support. There\u2019s not a big problem with people who don\u2019t like vaccines.\u201d With sufficient vaccine coverage, herd immunity protects everyone. But some areas, notably central London and the West Midlands, have slipped well below the critical threshold with potentially alarming health consequences that a national vaccine catchup campaign is now racing to avert. Without improved uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, London could be heading for a measles outbreak of between 40,000 and 160,0000 cases, which would lead to dozens of deaths and thousands of people being hospitalised, the UK Health Security Agency has estimated. A steep rise in cases of whooping cough \u2013 553 were confirmed in England in January, compared with 858 for the whole of 2023 \u2013 is also prompting concern. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing diseases that really haven\u2019t been around since the later half of the last century,\u201d Finn said. \u201cWe\u2019re now two generations on \u2013 nobody remembers them. There\u2019s this false impression that these illnesses don\u2019t need to be worried about.\u201d Primary school-age children With schools closed, sports clubs cancelled and playgrounds cordoned off, physical activity among primary school-age children plummeted during the first lockdown. Cooped up at home, many children were also eating more \u2013 and more unhealthily. Obesity rates increased steeply, by 45% in four- to-five-year-olds and by 21% in 10- to 11-year-olds during the first year of lockdowns. After the pandemic, obesity levels in the younger, reception-age children roughly returned to expected (still high) levels, but the proportion of children leaving primary school overweight, with obesity or severe obesity is now at a much higher level than before the pandemic. Almost one in four children aged 10 and 11 in England are living with obesity, according to a recent analysis of more than 1 million children. \u201cYounger children went back to buzzing around and having broadly similar quality diet,\u201d said Prof Keith Godfrey, of the University of Southampton and a co-author of the research. \u201cBut in the children leaving primary those poor health behaviours seem to have become embedded and there were persistent widening of disparities of advantaged and disadvantaged areas.\u201d The soaring cost of healthy food is likely to have compounded the problem, with children living in poorer areas twice as likely to be obese than those living in wealthier neighbourhoods. Without active interventions, the majority of teenagers who are overweight or living with obesity remain on this trajectory into adulthood, meaning that an additional 56,000 children are facing a heightened risk of type 2 diabetes, cancer and other serious illnesses. \u201cIt\u2019s among the biggest impacts of the pandemic,\u201d Godfrey said. \u201cObesity affects a child\u2019s ability to learn and consequently their economic opportunities. It affects their mental health. It affects their physical health, including asthma, susceptibility to diabetes, heart disease, osteoarthritis and a whole range of downstream health consequences. That is the sad and harsh reality.\u201d Teenagers and young people Teenage years are generally defined by friendships, school, hobbies and a growing sense of independence. The pandemic swept much of this away. \u201cThere\u2019s normally a process: you\u2019re looked after by your parents, you\u2019re observed by your parents and then you become independent,\u201d said Lakhanpaul. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing children who are more anxious about doing those normal risk-taking behaviours.\u201d Multiple studies show a population-level deterioration in young people\u2019s mental health, with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and there has been an unprecedented increase in non-attendance at school, with 28% of mainstream secondary school pupils classed as persistently absent (missing at least 10% of school days) in the last academic year. It would be wrong, though, to assume the mental health challenges faced by teenagers were freshly seeded by the pandemic. \u201cIt was amplifying and accelerating trends that were already evident,\u201d said Prof Craig Morgan, a professor of social epidemiology at King\u2019s College London. \u201cAnd it was the people who were already the most disadvantaged who suffered most.\u201d Prof Willem Kuyken, whose research found a rise in depression, and social, emotional and behavioural difficulties over the course of the pandemic, also identified factors that buffered young people against the toll of the pandemic, including a secure home environment and close friendships. Young people less likely to be shielded included those living in households affected by job loss, where parents were key workers, in overcrowded accommodation or with caring responsibilities for younger children. \u201cIf school is your safe place, the pandemic was awful,\u201d he said. In south London, Morgan\u2019s team asked dozens of teenagers to keep written or audio diaries of their experiences during the first year of the pandemic. \u201cWhat really came through was a real concern about exams and academic progress,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the pandemic wore on, things got worse.\u201d One teenager said school had become a \u201cprison of learning\u201d, with all the fun stripped away, while others complained of unrelenting workloads and pressure. Limited internet and computer access meant some children were acutely disadvantaged. \u201cThere were parallel concerns about climate change and all of this crystallised into entrenched distress,\u201d said Morgan. Recent figures from the Resolution Foundation showed a doubling in the number of 18- to 24-year-olds who were \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d due to health issues, including mental health, prompting a Daily Mail front page describing \u201cGeneration sicknote\u201d. More sympathetic coverage of the \u201cmental health crisis\u201d in young people tends to focus on undeniably overstretched mental health services. But Morgan questions whether this points to the correct primary policy prescription. \u201cThe fact that we now frame everything in terms of mental health means that all of these problems are subsumed under this single heading without any granularity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt places the problem within the child and that serves to obscure some of these wider, contextual factors. The narrative around mental health is blinding us a bit to what is driving it.\u201d At worst, this can lead to well-meaning interventions that are ineffective or can even serve to widen inequalities. A recent trial by Kuyken and others, for instance, found that mindfulness training in schools did not improve mental health \u2013 although there was some indication of benefits for pupils who were well at the outset and who were most engaged. \u201cIf you\u2019re not having breakfast and your parents are struggling, I\u2019m not sure how being \u2018in the moment\u2019 is going to touch that in terms of how you feel,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe need public health initiatives, such as free school meals and free internet access. You\u2019re never going to address a population-level public health problem by providing more counsellors.\u201d Adults Navigating healthcare systems tends to fall to adults in mid-life: for themselves, children and parents. The strain the pandemic placed on the NHS has made securing appointments, being referred to specialists, obtaining diagnoses and treatments an increasingly competitive pursuit that is driving inequalities. Some areas of medicine have been affected more than most. Gynaecology waiting lists increased by 60% between 2020 and 2022 \u2013 a bigger proportion than any other area of medicine. Despite the government launching a widely welcomed women\u2019s health strategy, there is concern that diagnostic waiting times for conditions such as endometriosis have deteriorated, with women in England now waiting an estimated nine years. Private healthcare has become a \u201cnew normal\u201d for sections of society, creating a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d system for dental care, cataract removal, hip replacements, cancer diagnosis and gynaecology scans. But even within the NHS, different people receive different care. Long Covid, which has a higher prevalence in people aged between 35 and 69, is a case in point. When the condition first emerged, doctors sometimes noted a stereotype among patients attending new specialist clinics: many were high achievers, thriving professionals, the kind of people who ran marathons at the weekend. Some speculated these people were pushing themselves too hard after being unwell. Prof Claire Steves, an ageing and health researcher at King\u2019s College London and a consultant geriatrician, has an alternative explanation. \u201cIn order to get through the system, you need to have loads of social advantages,\u201d she said. \u201cYou probably know about healthcare and are able to bash through the barriers.\u201d Studies have found that white, middle-class, more educated people are over-represented at long Covid clinics, but population-based surveys, where people are sampled randomly, show you are more likely to get long Covid if you live in a deprived area, and do not show a bias based on ethnicity. \u201cThere are really stark differences in access to care,\u201d said Steves. In 2020 and 2021, \u201cHow was your lockdown?\u201d became a familiar question: some took up new hobbies or got a dog; for others it was universally bleak. \u201cWe talk about \u2018the pandemic\u2019 but there were many different situations that people experienced,\u201d said Dr Dar\u00edo Moreno-Agostino, who researches population mental health at UCL and King\u2019s College London. His team has used longitudinal data, including cohorts born in 1970, 1958 and 1946, to look at how these people who have been tracked for decades fared. With the pandemic, all three generations reached or surpassed the worst mental health levels ever experienced in up to 40 years. \u201cOne of the things that we keep finding is that women were disproportionately impacted,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are quite stark differences by gender.\u201d For the past 20 years, women in the 1970 British Cohort Study had reported higher life satisfaction, on average, than men, but during the pandemic this difference disappeared. \u201cIt\u2019s talking about a historical advantage on life satisfaction being lost,\u201d said Moreno-Agostino. Older people Within weeks of the earliest reports emerging from China, it was clear that Covid posed a particular danger to older people. In the UK, a \u201cstay at home\u201d order was issued to people over 70 and pregnant women a week before the first national lockdown. Compliance in older age groups was high, and as stories emerged of care homes being ravaged by the virus, some were left afraid of leaving the house even to exercise. \u201cWe were quite shocked at how much people\u2019s physical activity changed over the pandemic, especially in older people,\u201d said Steves. The profoundly negative health impacts of inactivity is sometimes overlooked, with evidence that it can be at least equal to the effects of smoking, drinking and obesity. Spending a lot of time sitting increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes and some cancers. \u201cIt\u2019s not the case that because you\u2019re older you can\u2019t benefit from exercise \u2013 if anything you can probably benefit more,\u201d said Steves. Data analysed by Steves from TwinsUK, a registry of 14,000 identical and non-identical twins, showed a substantial decrease in physical activity among older adults, and those who had the lowest strength to begin with were most affected. Blood pressure rates, obesity rates and alcohol consumption all increased, too. This is worrying because when it comes to physical activity there is a threshold effect. A marathon runner in their 70s who reduces their activity for a few months will still be fully functional. But someone on the brink of being unable to live independently could tip into a more profound decline. Steves and colleagues are actively studying the extent to which activity levels have bounced back \u2013 and which factors predict recovery. But she is concerned that a \u201cwave of frailty\u201d will be seen in the older population. Across all age groups, the pandemic appears to have chipped away at health and the NHS treatment that people receive. The challenge of reversing these trends can appear overwhelming and insurmountable, but recognising the scale of a problem can also, in time, galvanise a proportionate response. \u201cThere are parallels with the Industrial Revolution, which was really bad for health inequalities,\u201d said Steves. \u201cBut that was followed by a period of philanthropy, government leadership and infrastructure changes. The pandemic does have a legacy that\u2019s important for health. So we need to also think about how this could be a major opportunity.\u201d"

            "title": "Chinese tourism to Australia still in the doldrums after pandemic travel bans",
            "date": "2024-03-03T14:00:05Z",
            "content": "In the two weeks either side of lunar new year, Mandy Ho, who manages a hot air balloon company in Melbourne, has many balls in the air. Most mornings before dawn, when weather permits, her colleagues fly Chinese tourists from the vineyards of the Yarra Valley over Melbourne\u2019s eastern suburbs to parkland on the city\u2019s fringe. Interpreters make sure nothing is lost in translation. Ho has spent weeks preparing tourists and arranging buses to collect them from hotels. She\u2019s already met some of them while running the company\u2019s Mandarin smartphone app, website and Chinese social media channels. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But this year, she\u2019s noticed a shift. Ho says Chinese tourist numbers are still down by about half when compared with pre-pandemic levels. It\u2019s a financial hit for the company, Global Ballooning, as the Chinese market brings in about 50% of its clients. \u201cI was expecting a full recovery this year as it\u2019s the first year they can travel overseas for Chinese new year,\u201d Ho says. \u201cBut it\u2019s been a much slower recovery than what we expected.\u201d Ho isn\u2019t the only tourism operator disappointed by the sluggish return of Chinese tourists. Tourism Australia figures show 102,000 Chinese holidaymakers visited Australia in September 2023. Four years earlier, the number was 688,000 in the same month. \u201cI think there\u2019s a few reasons for this,\u201d Ho says. \u201cThe economy in China isn\u2019t great and a lot of people are choosing to go to Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia because they\u2019re visa-free. This is the first year they\u2019ve been able to travel since the pandemic and they\u2019re preferring short-haul flights.\u201d Ho\u2019s analysis is supported by statistics from booking platform Trip.com, which has reported a 30% increase in Chinese tourism to south-east Asia in recent weeks, compared with 2019 levels. Trips to Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea have also increased. As Chinese tourists take their money elsewhere, Ho and other tourism providers have had to get creative. \u201cWe tried not to put all our eggs in the one basket,\u201d Ho says. \u201cWe diversified our market and this year we\u2019re seeing a lot people coming back from the United States, from Taiwan and Hong Kong, too.\u201d \u2018We\u2019re not hitting alarm bells just yet\u2019 Peter Shelley from the Australian Tourism Export Council, a peak body for tourism operators, says many of his members are also disappointed but are not panicking. \u201cIf we are honest, I think we were all hoping it would be a little bit more buoyant. It was never going to be 100%, we hoped it would be about 75%,\u201d Shelley says. \u201cAre we worried about it? I don\u2019t think anyone is hitting the alarm bells just yet. It\u2019s still early days, and maybe by the end of the year we\u2019ll be back to 2019 levels.\u201d Shelley says many Chinese consumers now realise Australia is an expensive country to visit and fly to. This month, there\u2019s about 170 scheduled flights between China and Australia. That\u2019s 86% of all flights during the same month in 2019. Tourism Australia, a government agency that promotes holiday making, knows what\u2019s at stake. In 2019, Chinese visitors spent $12.4m in Australia. The agency hopes tourism will return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year, despite Oxford Economics suggesting that may not happen until 2025-26. \u201c[While] travel with China reopened a year later than other markets, we are confident about its recovery as the market continues to steadily rebuild,\u201d a Tourism Australia spokesperson says. But some experts are concerned by anecdotal evidence this past fortnight. Dr Paul Stolk, a senior lecturer in tourism at Newcastle University, says this lunar new year was a litmus test on the health of the Chinese market. \u201cThis is the period of time where we should see a lot of activity,\u201d Stolk says. \u201cThis period we are in right now could be really telling in terms of whether we will see any bounce back and where it will occur, including capital cities and regional hotspots.\u201d \u2018We\u2019ve been back to normal\u2019 The Great Ocean Road \u2013 a long winding roadway that hugs the south-eastern Victorian coastline over steep cliffs \u2013 is usually filled with busloads of Chinese tourists. For years, signs by the side of the road have reminded Chinese tourists to drive in the left lane. Before the pandemic, some restaurants in coastal towns along this road printed menus in Mandarin. After years of lockdowns, many business owners hoped the Chinese tourists would rush back to the coastline and help them rebound. Liz Price, the general manager of Great Ocean Road Regional Tourism, acknowledges the Chinese tourism market has been slow to recover in the region. But she says recent weeks give some cause for optimism. \u201cWe have had some reports that the numbers have increased over the summer and there has been some growth in coaches day-tripping out of Melbourne,\u201d Price says. This may be due to the Australian government reissuing group visas for Chinese travellers in September. Dr Maneka Jayasinghe, a tourism expert at Charles Darwin University, says this should lead to an increase in tourists in coming months. Sally Cannon, who runs the Apollo Bay Bakery about two-and-a-half hours drive west of Melbourne, which claims to be the home of the scallop pie on the Great Ocean Road, is also optimistic. Unlike Ho, Cannon has noticed an increase in Chinese tourists over the last two weeks. So, too, have other business owners closer to Melbourne, in Lorne. Cannon says she\u2019s hopeful the numbers will continue to rise. \u201cPre-Covid, Chinese tourists were a big part of our business,\u201d Cannon says. \u201cOver the past few years, we\u2019ve managed to continue without them, but it\u2019s nice to see them return. \u201cThis has been the first year since Covid where it\u2019s felt we\u2019ve been back to normal. I just have this feeling it will continue.\u201d \u2018It was like a green light\u2019 Like many sections of the Australian economy, political tensions between Beijing and Canberra have had some impact on tourism. But analysts differ on the how significant the influence has been. Tom Parker, the chief executive of the Australia China Business Council, says tensions may have played a role in tourism numbers until prime minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s trip to Beijing in November \u2013 the first by an Australian leader in seven years. \u201cSymbolism is important in China,\u201d Parker says. \u201cThis trip certainly symbolised a lot within China, including that it was OK to engage with Australia again. It was like a green light. These things are never said directly, but the visit, at that leadership level, told a story.\u201d Shelley says the impact of geopolitical tensions would have been clearer if the borders had been open during the pandemic era. \u201cIf we were talking about this a few years ago, I think the impact would have been quite high,\u201d Shelley says. \u201cI must say, the current government has smoothed the waters but there could still be an undertone of tension.\u201d Ho believes the enduring appeal of the Australian landscape will always attract tourists from China, no matter the political climate. She just hopes they won\u2019t wait too long to return. \u201cI definitely think they will come back,\u201d Ho says. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much to offer. By the end of this year, I\u2019m sure the numbers will have increased.\u201d"

            "content": "\u2018Today is the first day of your new life on this pristine, lovely island. So, congratulations!\u201d says Tom Nook, the benevolent tanuki landlord, a few minutes into Animal Crossing: New Horizons. (Nook is often besmirched online, but you can\u2019t argue that he\u2019s extremely welcoming.) Many players read this comforting message at a destabilising and frightening time in the real world: Animal Crossing: New Horizons came out on Nintendo Switch on 20 March 2020, a few days before the UK entered its first Covid lockdown. This was fortuitous timing. When we were all stuck at home, the game let us plant our native fruits, tend to our flowers and see what the town shop had on offer, repaying our extensive loans (interest-free, thankfully) to Tom Nook as a way of escaping the chaos and daily death tolls. We opened the gates to our islands and welcomed friends and strangers into our pristine little worlds. As real life crumbled, we started anew with bespectacled cats, sheep in clown\u2019s coats and rhinos who looked like cakes. The game\u2019s sudden popularity caused Nintendo Switch sales to skyrocket among pandemic-induced shortages. New Horizons had sold 44.79 million units by December 2023 \u2013 nearly three-and-a-half times more than any other game in the Animal Crossing series, which has been running since 2001. It\u2019s the second best-selling Switch game to date, behind Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Player April tells me she and her partner, Matthew, amassed over 700 hours in the game, turning their island into a joint creative project. \u201cWe planned the specific themes and items we were going to use, how the neighbourhoods would look, and even the lore behind some of the places and characters,\u201d she says, adding that an in-game party organised by Matthew was one of the best birthdays she\u2019s ever had. \u201cI\u2019ve never identified as a gamer and it\u2019s the first game since being a pre-teen that I\u2019ve bought and played,\u201d Amy says. \u201cI could see the sense of community it was offering my friends when we couldn\u2019t do things in real life. We had date nights on there, star-gazing, visiting friends and taking photos with people I was very far removed from in reality.\u201d Many players, including Amy, still play now. She shares the game with her five-year-old niece: \u201cwe now play together and I can pass on what I already know and see the fun continue.\u201d She gets to explore Amy\u2019s island, filled with happy memories created over the past four years. John O\u2019Shea, creative director of the National Videogame Museum, in Sheffield, is massively proud of his team\u2019s work on the Animal Crossing Diaries, a digital exhibition aiming to document the impactful and memorable moments experienced by players during worldwide lockdowns. O\u2019Shea likens the project to the Science Museum Group collecting key \u201cartefacts\u201d of the Covid era, including the first vial of the vaccine used in a mass immunisation programme. \u201cIn the future, we\u2019ll be able to look at those and say that\u2019s representative of what the pandemic was like. But actually, I think that the Animal Crossing Diaries, as an archive of people\u2019s experiences, gives a fascinating insight into the psychology of that time,\u201d he says. The entries are deeply personal, and allow us to relive an aspect of the pandemic through someone else\u2019s eyes, from solo Pride festivals, to a 50th birthday party (fancy dress mandatory). In a familiar sentiment, one writer describes how playing helps them to \u201cforget about all the terrible stuff going on right now\u201d. Shivani\u2019s diary entry documents the creation of their island, Bollywood, \u201cto pay homage to my cultural upbringing\u201d. They found the game a creative outlet when India struggled through the pandemic. With travel bans, they hoped Bollywood would enable visiting players to learn about India\u2019s culture. Other players were inspired to take their Animal Crossing experiences beyond digital boundaries once lockdowns were finally over \u2013 such as May Naidoo, who set himself the goal of seeing the real-life counterparts of all 43 pieces of art in Animal Crossing\u2019s in-game museum. Naidoo documented his experience on TikTok, racking up over 1.8 million views on the video marking the challenge complete. \u201cCompleting it [the challenge] has widened my appreciation of art in general, and I\u2019ve been able to see iconic art in person and visit dream countries and cities for the first time,\u201d Naidoo says. \u201cI probably would have never visited some of these places if it wasn\u2019t for this goal. It definitely feels global and in the last few cities I visited, after previous videos have gained attention online, I was able to meet people and make friends in new cities, get invited and privately toured by some museums.\u201d Naidoo, like others volunteering their stories, feels thankful for the opportunities and experiences gained by playing the game during lockdowns and has taken it with him, long after the world opened up. Others find that talking about the memories stirs a desire to jump back in. In her book Playing With Reality: Gaming in a Pandemic, journalist Alex Humphreys reflects on the role that video games took on in our lives during Covid. Browsing the Diaries, Humphreys notes the blurred lines between realities: \u201csometimes the only way of knowing which world they\u2019re talking about is when you see the currency \u2018bells\u2019 referenced in the next sentence.\u201d For millions, Animal Crossing became far more than just a game. Animal Crossing Diaries is a digital exhibition organised by the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield"

            "date": "2024-03-24T07:00:43Z",
            "content": "There has been hysterical talk, of late, of \u201cno-go areas\u201d in London, districts out of bounds to one community or another. To anyone who moves about the city every day the characterisation is nonsense, an invention of political voices that feed on division. But there is, at the same time, a more private realm in which barriers between communities are being raised: that of storytelling. There is a strain in the culture that wants to put \u201ckeep out\u201d signs around the particular experiences of the capital\u2019s varied citizens; to make each community\u2019s tales and histories only theirs to tell. This is a rare novel, in that hostile landscape policed by cultural studies departments and the 3am stasi on social media, that is temperamentally unafraid of trespass. Andrew O\u2019Hagan goes where his story takes him, deep into the lives of all the communities who live around \u201cthe Cally\u201d, the main road that heads north from the capital\u2019s new centre, King\u2019s Cross. The result is a book \u2013 it\u2019s hard to resist the word Dickensian \u2013 that feels as near an authentic slice of contemporary London life as any packed tube carriage. He starts, where novels have often started, in the life of that newly endangered species, the white British male academic. Campbell Flynn is an art historian, a writer of bestsellers about the Dutch golden age. Flynn, a tenement Scot who now wears a cravat, has married into that landed caste with \u201cinvisible money\u201d after whom the Georgian squares of Islington are named. He and his wife have a townhouse in one of those squares \u2013 there\u2019s also a weekend place in Suffolk, where the neighbour stocks \u201can honesty larder\u201d of local produce at the roadside \u2013 but Flynn\u2019s hold on that life is precarious, both materially and psychologically. The novel\u2019s epigraph is from Robert Louis Stevenson: \u201cAfter a certain distance, every step we take in life we find the ice growing thinner below our feet\u2026\u201d The reader is invited to watch in sympathetic fascination as, over the course of more than 600 pages, Flynn slips below the ice. He does not go down without a struggle. He\u2019s clever enough to have sensed that cultural survival lies both in serious reinvention and the retention of a sense of humour: \u201cIf ambiguity was the spirit of the age, Campbell felt he had been a dutiful officer in that war\u2026 He\u2019d marched against Section 28, he\u2019d read every book on the fall of empire, was the proud father of a queer daughter, the first into pronoun therapy, yet his destiny, like everybody\u2019s, was to fall short, and he knew it would be better if he could see the funny side.\u201d When we meet him, as the capital is giving its head a wobble after the successive concussions of Brexit and lockdown, he is exploring different strategies for that personal renewal. For one thing, he has written, anonymously, a short polemic about the crisis in masculinity, \u201cWhy Men Weep in Their Cars\u201d. In his public life, meanwhile, he has befriended one of his students at University College, Milo Mangasha, who has grown up on the estates that rise above Flynn\u2019s own leafy Henry James world; Milo is both an after-hours computer hacker and a radical post-colonial theorist; he is still half-involved with his rap artist mates from school. Flynn wants, naively, to find the common purpose in their worlds; Milo sees an opportunity for show trial and re-education. This is no simple morality tale, however. In delineating Flynn\u2019s fall, the light of O\u2019Hagan\u2019s attention falls on each of his characters equally \u2013 this is a book that comes with a two-page cast list as a preface, to help you keep your bearings. Flynn writes of his beloved Vermeer that he was \u201cthe patron saint of individual merit\u2026 For thousands of years, privilege and power, determined by birth were the drivers of history. But with this mysterious woman, standing at a musical instrument or reading a letter in the common light of day, we find that it is merit and consciousness, the personal power of ordinary people, that rules the world.\u201d O\u2019Hagan\u2019s book examines what that platitude might actually mean for people like Flynn and employs that \u201ccommon light\u201d as his own authorial ambition, bringing to full life not only the man of letters, his titled friends and relatives, but the complex day to day of the people who work in the car wash or do shifts at sweatshop garment factories. Without too much strain, his plotting establishes a web of connection that convincingly takes in all of these worlds: the sitting tenant in Flynn\u2019s Islington basement, Mrs Voyles, bitter remnant of an Islington before gentrification; Cecylia Krupa, praying for a better England in her Polish church; and Zak Byre, the property developer\u2019s son, who divides his time between a \u00a37m flat and direct action for Extinction Rebellion. This being a novel of London, the thread is indebtedness. If you follow the money, O\u2019Hagan suggests, it inevitably leads from eye-watering mortgage to city fixer to money-laundering oligarch to Saudi real estate, with stops for drug dealers and people traffickers and bitcoin investors along the way. As a journalist, longtime editor-at-large of the London Review of Books, O\u2019Hagan has always been curious to discover the precise tone of new worlds and old. Alongside critical essays on Burns or Stevenson, he has written deeply researched investigations into cryptocurrency and Julian Assange and the dark web; his personal report on the Grenfell Tower fire excited outrage among those who wanted the security of seeing the tragedy only through their own off-the-peg preconceptions, by instead insisting on proper human complication and nuance. As a novelist, he has tended to write more closely from his own emotional life, from his debut, Our Fathers, set in the Ayrshire housing projects in which he grew up, to Mayflies, 2020\u2019s poignant fictionalised account of a teenage friendship. This book is a departure from that more personal focus, in that he brings into play all of his reporter\u2019s eye for detail and feel for critical ironies. The result is a tragicomedy of manners that has a pitch-perfect grasp of the icy snobberies of Garsington Opera and the patois of drill rappers; a frontline dispatch from the trenches of culture wars and a much-needed, vividly enjoyable broadside to them. \u2022 Caledonian Road by Andrew O\u2019Hagan is published by Faber (\u00a320).
