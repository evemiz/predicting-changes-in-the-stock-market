            "content": "Certain events happen during every presidential campaign. The parties crown their candidates. The candidates debate on live TV, with millions watching. Tens of millions head to the polls. And at some point in this process, Jamie Dimon will be tipped as the next treasury secretary. Sure enough, the veteran boss of JPMorgan Chase \u2013 Wall Street\u2019s de facto ambassador to the world \u2013 was, indeed, linked with the role this time around as the Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigns mulled their options in the final stretch of the 2024 presidential election. But as the world came to terms with his victory, and Trump started to piece together his administration, the president-elect made clear in a social media post that Dimon \u201cwill not be invited\u201d to join. The people who did get the invite underline why Dimon \u2013 one of the most prominent leaders in corporate America, and head of America\u2019s biggest bank \u2013 did not. Considering him for a post might be a time-honored tradition, but this is not business as usual. Trump values reputation, establishment and star power. But not as much as he values getting his way. Howard Lutnick, a longtime friend and co-chair of his transition team, remarked during the campaign that Trump \u201cpicked unfortunately\u201d last time around. Industrial giants and former military generals did not wholeheartedly embrace his agenda. Not this time. Trump has picked Lutnick, for starters \u2013 CEO of the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald \u2013 as his commerce secretary, tasked with delivering his policy on tariffs and trade. While Lutnick was reported to have directly lobbied to run the treasury, that job went to the financier Scott Bessent, after days of jostling and speculation. With both appointments, Trump is said to have been wary of appointing a candidate who did not ardently believe in the tariffs and tax strategy at the center of his economic plan for the US. Economists have warned that the introduction of steep tariffs could reignite inflation. Budget experts have warned that Trump\u2019s wider plans could add as much as $15tn to US debt over 10 years. The president-elect wants to keep such caution outside the tent \u2013 and has pulled together a band of staunch loyalists to drive through it. During Bessent\u2019s campaign for the treasury job, he loudly made the case for tariffs, dismissing economists\u2019 warnings as \u201cfundamentally incorrect\u201d in a column for Fox News. Not long after a line was very publicly drawn under the talk of Dimon as treasury secretary, the Wall Street titan appeared on stage at a summit in Lima, Peru. He wished Trump well, \u201cbut I just want to tell the president also: I haven\u2019t had a boss in 25 years, and I\u2019m not about ready to start\u201d. The boss preparing to return to the White House in January has made up his mind. He does not seem prepared to hire anyone who might try to change it \u2013 on the economy, or any other key facet of his agenda. Presidential administrations are rarely a broad church. Trump appears to be building a narrow pew."

            "title": "UK must pick between US economic model or EU\u2019s \u2018socialism\u2019, says Trump adviser",
            "date": "2024-11-16T12:01:03Z",
            "content": "A top adviser to the US president-elect, Donald Trump, has said the UK should align itself with the American \u201cfree enterprise\u201d economic model instead of the \u201cmore socialist\u201d European system, as speculation mounts over the terms of a potential transatlantic trade deal. Stephen Moore, a senior economic adviser to Trump, said if the UK moved towards the US model of \u201ceconomic freedom\u201d there would be more \u201cwillingness\u201d by the incoming administration to agree to a trade deal between the two countries. His comments come as Keir Starmer faces competing demands over future trade deals with Washington and Brussels. Some have told the prime minister to pick a side in trade talks between the US and EU while others have suggested he could strike deals with both major players. Speaking to BBC\u2019s Today programme, Moore said: \u201cThe UK really has to choose between the Europe economic model of more socialism and the US model, which is more based on a free enterprise system. I think the UK is kind of caught in the middle of these two forms of an economic model. I believe that Britain would be better off moving towards more of the American model of economic freedom. \u201cIf that were the case, I think it would spur the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to the free trade agreement with the UK. I think it would make sense for both Britain and the United States.\u201d Previous efforts to agree a UK-US trade deal have been scuppered by rows over agricultural standards, particularly fears over allowing chlorinated chicken or hormone-fed beef on to British supermarket shelves. Moore said: \u201cI think we have the best agriculture centres in the world. So I wouldn\u2019t see that as a problem from this side of the ocean, but I do understand that in Britain. I know the last time I was in London, that was a big issue with many of the British folks I talked to.\u201d Trump has proposed a blanket tariff of at least 10% on all imports, as well as further retaliatory tariffs against countries that place tariffs on US imports. Moore said the blanket tariff was a \u201cfairly popular position with many American voters\u201d but suggested some countries might be exempt. The prospect of tariffs has already hampered the UK government, which has staked its success on economic growth. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs cut its UK economic growth forecast for 2025 to 1.4% from 1.6%, citing potential higher US tariffs. \u201cI do think we have a special relationship with Britain and I think most Americans, I think Donald Trump, views Britain in a very different way, certainly from China or other countries that we view in a more adversarial way,\u201d he said. Referencing the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was passed under Trump to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, Moore said: \u201cWe have a US, Mexico and Canada trade deal. So, it\u2019s certainly possible that with this uniform tariff that he\u2019s talked about, that because of our special relationship with our North American neighbours, that we might exempt them. So your question is, might we exempt Britain? Maybe, I don\u2019t know the answer to that.\u201d On Tuesday, Peter Mandelson, who is tipped to become the new British ambassador in Washington, told the Times that the UK \u201cmust have our cake and eat it\u201d and forge trade ties with the EU and US. \u201cWe cannot come out of the largest export market, difficult enough as it is to trade freely there, having left the European Union. But we still trade. It\u2019s our biggest export market still. We can\u2019t leave that. \u201cAnd we have to mitigate the sort of barriers and risks that we\u2019ve taken on as a result of Brexit in the European market. And transatlantic trade and investment is huge for us.\u201d Andy Haldane, the former Bank of England chief economist, echoed a similar message, saying on Tuesday that the government could show the UK was \u201copen for business at a time when so much else of the world is looking inward \u2013 whether to the EU, or the US\u201d."

            "date": "2024-11-18T18:20:02Z",
            "content": "China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has heaped praise on Keir Starmer\u2019s economic policy, as the UK prime minister used their first meeting to raise concerns about sanctions on MPs and the treatment of the pro-democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai. During their conversation at the G20 summit in Rio, the first meeting between the UK and China\u2019s leaders in six years, Starmer said he would be keen to host a full bilateral meeting with Xi and the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, in Beijing or London as soon as possible, aimed at turning the page on frosty UK-China relations. In a marked change of tone from previous years, Xi said Starmer was \u201cfixing the foundations\u201d of the UK economy, echoing the prime minister\u2019s own slogan. He said the pair would \u201cbreak new ground\u201d in the relationship. But the prime minister also raised human rights concerns with the Chinese president about sanctions on British Conservative MPs and the deterioration of Lai, a British citizen and Hong Kong democracy activist. Starmer promised a \u201cstrong UK-China relationship\u201d and said the pair had agreed there should be no more \u201csurprises\u201d between the two countries. Chinese officials bundled British journalists out of the meeting when Starmer raised the plight of Lai, who is being held in Hong Kong. \u201cThe world has entered a new period marked by turbulence and transformation,\u201d Xi said in the meeting. \u201cThe new UK government is working to fix the foundations of the economy and rebuild Britain and has set the vision of Britain reconnected. And China is further deepening reform across the board to advance Chinese modernisation.\u201d Starmer said the pair had acknowledged they wanted \u201crelations to be consistent, durable, respectful and, as we have agreed, avoid surprises where possible\u201d. \u201cA strong UK-China relationship is important for both of our countries and for the broader international community,\u201d he said at the top of the meeting. \u201cThe UK will be a predictable, consistent, sovereign actor committed to the rule of law.\u201d He proposed a full bilateral meeting with Li in Beijing or London, and for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to meet her counterpart, He Lifeng, which is expected to happen in Beijing in January. \u201cI\u2019m keen that my chancellor should meet with Vice-Premier He for the upcoming economic financial dialogue early next year to explore more investment projects and a more level playing field to help our businesses,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased that my foreign secretary and foreign minister Wang met recently to discuss respective concerns including on human rights and parliamentary sanctions, Taiwan, the South China Sea and our shared interest in Hong Kong. We are concerned by reports of Jimmy Lai\u2019s deterioration.\u201d More than 100 senior politicians from 22 countries have called on China to release Lai before his trial that restarts in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Held in custody since December 2020, Lai faces a range of sedition and foreign collusion charges that include meeting politicians in the US. Signatories to the appeal include the chairs of a range of foreign affairs committees and prominent MPs from across Europe, Canada and Australia and the Balkans. The signatories point out that Lai is 77, a British citizen and was declared as being arbitrarily detained by a UN panel last week. In a statement, they claim he has been held inhumanely in solitary confinement in a maximum-security prison for four years, and call for his immediate release \u201cbefore it is too late\u201d. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, recently met Jimmy Lai\u2019s son Sebastian to promise to do all he could to secure his release. Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, said Starmer the UK\u2019s world standing risked \u201cbeing weakened\u201d if Starmer was not robust with China. \u201cWhile it is important to have a constructive diplomatic dialogue with China, the prime minister should have been stronger in raising our concerns over human rights, the repressive nature of the national security laws imposed on Hong Kong, and the security, safety and wellbeing of British nationals, like Jimmy Lai, who should be freed from custody,\u201d she said. The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who is also under sanctions from Beijing, condemned Starmer\u2019s attempt to resuscitate relations. \u201cPresident Xi has no regard for the UK and is trashing all the rules-based order around the world \u2013 from human rights to the WTO, China just ignores what it is told,\u201d he said. No British prime minister had met Xi since Theresa May visited Beijing in 2018 in the midst of a trade push during Brexit negotiations, though Boris Johnson spoke to the Chinese president during the pandemic. Since then, relations have significantly cooled because of cyber threats, a human rights crackdown in Hong Kong and the sanctions against MPs. Lammy visited China last month in the first signal that the new Labour government saw a renewal of better ties as a diplomatic priority."

            "title": "From higher tariffs to lower taxes, will Donald Trump\u2019s economic plan pay off?",
            "date": "2024-11-08T13:19:58Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s the economy, stupid. So said James Carville when he was advising Bill Clinton in his 1992 presidential campaign and the phrase is as true now as it was 32 years ago. Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris this week for the same reason he lost to Joe Biden in 2020: millions of Americans were unhappy about the economic record of the incumbent party. Two out of three voters this week thought the US economy was on the wrong track \u2013 and that spelled trouble for Harris. The question is whether they will feel any differently at the end of Trump\u2019s second term in the White House, when it ends in 2029. Looking at some of the policies proposed by the president-elect, it is by no means certain that they will. Trump is not a man to undersell himself and while campaigning said he had created during his first term the \u201cgreatest economy in the history of our country\u201d. While clearly hyperbole, Trump\u2019s record in the first three years of his presidency was impressive. The US economy grew strongly, inflation averaged about 2%, 6.7m jobs were created and the unemployment rate fell to 3.5%. Then, in the fourth year of his presidency the economy was hit by the Covid 19 pandemic. Lockdowns meant 20 million Americans lost their jobs and the unemployment rate shot up to 15%. A deep recession in 2020 pulled down the average growth rate to 2.3% across Trump\u2019s first term. So what is Trump proposing for the economy when he replaces Biden in January? 1. Lower taxes Trump loves cutting taxes, and reductions for business and individuals are priorities for his second term. While plans are sketchy he has promised to cut corporation tax for companies that make their products in the US, from 21% to 15%. This is part of the president-elect\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda, with one of the world\u2019s most competitive tax regimes designed to prevent US companies outsourcing production overseas and to persuade foreign manufacturers to move to the US. He wants to make permanent the income tax cuts made in 2017 but which are due to expire next year. With the US on course to run a 7% of GDP budget deficit this year, critics have said tax cuts worth up to $7.5tn over the next 10 years are unaffordable, given that the US national debt is already 122% of GDP. Trump says he has a way of paying for them. 2. Tariffs Trump says he will pay for the tax cuts by imposing tariffs on foreign goods entering the US and has floated the idea of a 60% to 100% levy on Chinese products and a 10%-20% levy on goods from the rest of the world. The Tax Foundation, a US thinktank, has estimated a 10% universal tariff would raise $2tn over 10 years, while a 20% tariff would raise $3.3tn \u2013 well short of what would be needed to fully offset the revenue losses of making the 2017 tax cuts permanent. The impact of the tariffs will be to raise prices in the shops and reduce the spending power of US consumers. Some estimates suggest the losses for the average US household could be between $2,500 and $3,900. Those who voted for Trump on the basis that he will deliver lower inflation and faster growth in living standards could be in for a shock. 3. Drilling and the environment The centrepiece of Joe Biden\u2019s industrial strategy was the Inflation Reduction Act, which was designed to stimulate green growth through a system of tax incentives and subsidies. Trump has criticised the act for being too expensive, and plans to ban offshore wind projects and give the go-ahead for the resumption of large-scale oil and gas drilling. While analysts expect longstanding tax credits for onshore wind to remain in place, America under Trump is not going to be in the vanguard of the fight to achieve net zero. Trump has summed up his energy policy in three words: \u201cDrill, baby, drill.\u201d 4. Interest rates, the dollar and the Federal Reserve The US economy is operating at close to capacity and unemployment is low. Tax cuts will increase demand, while higher tariffs will push up prices. Higher inflation will be the result and that will mean America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, will be more cautious about cutting interest rates. If US borrowing costs stay higher for longer, the US dollar will rise on the currency markets, offsetting some of the impact of tariffs by making imports cheaper. If his first term is any guide, Trump will put pressure on the Fed to cut rates. The US central bank reduced US borrowing costs by 0.25 points on Thursday but its chair, Jerome Powell, clearly expects trouble. Asked if he would step down if Trump asked him to go, and if he could be legally ordered to do so, Powell replied \u201cno\u201d and \u201cnot permitted under the law\u201d. 5. Migration and deregulation Trump says he will begin immediately the deportation of the estimated 11 million people living in the US without legal status, although he has given few details of how they would identify the individuals involved. He also plans to complete the project launched in his first term: the building of a wall along the border between the US and Mexico. If successful, these policies would reduce the supply of low-cost labour and push up business costs. Trump favours business deregulation, including dismantling the safeguards put in for artificial intelligence, ending the \u201cpersecution\u201d of the crypto industry, and making Elon Musk the head of a government efficiency commission with the task of cutting \u201cred tape\u201d. 6. What does it all add up to? Trump only has four years as president so will be in a hurry to move forward with his tax cuts, import tariffs, energy policy and deregulation. But the chances are that lower taxes will have a sugar rush effect, with their impact fading as dearer imports and higher interest rates slow the economy. The risks of it going wrong are high. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 November 20214. Figures from the Tax Foundation of the estimated income from 10% and 20% universal tariffs have been calculated over 10 years, not annually as an earlier version said."

            "title": "2 million at risk of starvation in Myanmar state amid \u2018total economic collapse\u2019",
            "date": "2024-11-07T06:13:06Z",
            "content": "Two million people in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state could face starvation within months because fierce conflict and trade blockades have led to a \u201ctotal economic collapse\u201d and the imminent risk of famine, a senior UN official has warned. Rakhine state, which borders Bangladesh in the west, is on the brink of disaster, as people\u2019s incomes crater, rice cultivation plummets, and military-imposed trade restrictions lead to severe food shortages and hyperinflation, according to forthcoming research from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which accuses the military of inflicting \u201ccollective punishment\u201d on civilians. Some people have resorted to eating rice bran, normally used as animal feed, to stave off hunger. Kanni Wignaraja, UN assistant secretary general and regional director for the UNDP told the Guardian the situation was unprecedented in Myanmar. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen this [before] \u2013 such a total \u2026 economic collapse. \u201cIf this projects into 2025, which seems very likely, then you\u2019re going to see close to 2 million people at starvation point,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of the households we surveyed are cutting rations now to a single meal a day \u2013 some even less.\u201d There has also been increased borrowing, she said, though even money lenders have little to loan. UNDP\u2019s research suggests that more than half of households in Rakhine, about 1.4 million people, will have seen their monthly income plunge from 66,600 kyat ($31.70) to about 46,620 kyat ($22.21) after the escalation in fighting late last year. This is barely enough to cover the cost of rice, without even factoring in other food items or expenses related to their rent or shelter, transport or health needs. Food prices soar ten-fold Myanmar has been gripped by a spiralling conflict and economic crisis since the military seized power in February 2021. The coup was met with determined resistance from the public, and many took up arms to fight for the return of democracy. Older, ethnic armed groups that have long sought greater autonomy have also fought against the junta, sometimes in coordination with newer groups. The conflict in Rakhine state, on Myanmar\u2019s border with Bangladesh, re-erupted late last year, and the state remains gripped by intense fighting between the military and the Arakan Army, an ethnic Rakhine group that wants an autonomous state. The UNDP report said restrictions put in place by the military were \u201cclearly aimed at isolating Rakhine from the rest of the country and exacting \u2018collective punishment\u2019 on an already vulnerable population\u201d. Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing has previously rejected the accusations, blaming instead the Arakan Army for \u201cdestroying the socio-economic life of residents, education and health sector\u201d. The interior ministry has been contacted for further comment. The situation is especially desperate for the 511,000 displaced people in Rakhine, including Rohingya, who rely on aid from humanitarian agencies and the community. Access was \u201cseverely limited\u201d for aid agencies, Wignaraja said, hampered by military-imposed bureaucratic hurdles, such as requirements for special permits, as well as the intensity of the conflict. Basic health programmes such as immunisation campaigns have stopped, HIV patients cannot access antiretroviral medicines. In July, more than three dozen children were confirmed to have died during a diarrhoea outbreak, according to the UNDP. The real number of deaths could be higher. Even paracetamol is essentially unobtainable because it is so expensive. A single blister \u2013 a strip of 12 capsules - is sold at between 6,000 to 7,000 kyat ($2.86-3.33). The conflict has brought the construction sector, a major source of employment, to a standstill, and driven hundreds of thousands of people from their homes. At the same time, the cost of essential foods such as rice and cooking oil has skyrocketed nearly ten-fold in the worst-hit areas, according to UNDP. It has predicted that only 97,000 tons of rice will be produced this year, enough to cover just 20% of the population\u2019s needs. This is down from 282,000 tons last year, which even then met only 60% of the need. The number of trade routes bringing supplies into Rakhine has fallen to two from 8-10 routes that existed prior to October 2023. Wignaraja said this fall was due to a mix of factors including military-imposed restrictions, the intensity of the conflict, the collapse in demand as incomes have disappeared and the growth in illegal economic activities. \u2018This is much larger than a famine\u2019 To avert the very worst scenario, UNDP has called for all restrictions to be lifted so commercial goods can flow in and out of Rakhine, including through Myanmar\u2019s borders with India and Bangladesh, and for unimpeded access for aid workers. Funding was needed to urgently to allow operations to expand, UNDP\u2019s report said. However, Wignaraja said the crisis in Myanmar had reached a point where day to day relief work could not do more than \u201cstave off hunger maybe till the next day\u201d. \u201cThis is also much larger than a famine. It\u2019s a political disaster and a collapse,\u201d she added. \u201cIt needs an all-out politically mediated settlement \u2013 which has to be the rest of the world coming together, [it] could be led by the immediate regional players and Asean [Association of Southeast Asian Nations], with the UN support.\u201d The lack of international attention given to Myanmar, she said, was \u201cvery, very troubling given the intensity of what\u2019s going on\u201d. The number of Rohingya taking dangerous boat journeys to try to reach Indonesia last month rose sharply compared with the same period last year. At least 395 Rohingya refugees, including 173 children, arrived in Indonesia by boat in October, compared with 49 recorded in the same month in 2023, according to UN figures cited by Save the Children. Wignaraja said the situation for Rohingya in Rakhine state was \u201cabsolutely desperate\u201d. \u201cEverything that the general population faces, you can extend that 10 times or more to the Rohingya population,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen people are desperate, they\u2019re going to try everything,\u201d said Wignaraja. \u201cOnce you put your children on a boat you know you have lost all other hope,\u201d she said."

            "content": "Global stock markets fell and bond prices have jumped after reports that Ukraine had fired a US-made long-range missile into Russia for the first time and Vladimir Putin approved changes to Moscow\u2019s nuclear doctrine. Investors dashed into safe-haven currencies such as the US dollar, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc on Tuesday, after the RBC-Ukraine news outlet reported that Kyiv had carried out its first strike on Russian territory using western-supplied missiles. Moscow said later that Ukraine had fired six US-made Atacms missiles at Russia\u2019s Bryansk region, after Joe Biden\u2019s decision last weekend to relax restrictions on their use. Senior US and Ukrainian officials confirmed that US-made Atacms missiles had been fired into Russian territory. Earlier on Tuesday, Putin signed a decree lowering the threshold for using nuclear weapons. The revised doctrine declares that a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack. Concerns that the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has passed its 1,000th day, was escalating hit stock markets in Europe. The Stoxx 600 share index dropped over 1% to its lowest since August. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index was down 0.5% in afternoon trading, towards the three-month low hit last week, at 8,070 points. New York opened in the red, with the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 large US companies dropping by 0.8%, and the broader S&amp;P 500 losing 0.4%. Wall Street\u2019s fear index, the Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s CBOE Volatility Index, jumped by almost 10%. Markets were \u201crattled\u201d that Ukraine had fired US-supplied long-range missiles into Russia, hurting the euro, said Fawad Razaqzada, a market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com. Razaqzada said: \u201cThe big worry here is how Russia is going to respond now. President Vladimir Putin\u2019s approval of an updated nuclear doctrine [broadens] the conditions under which Russia might deploy nuclear weapons, including in response to a large-scale conventional attack on its territory. \u201cUse of atomic weapons is unthinkable, but we are getting close to very dangerous territories.\u201d In the foreign exchange markets, the pound slipped by a third of a cent against the US dollar, to $1.265, while the euro lost 0.25% against the Swiss franc and the dollar. \u201cGeopolitical does not matter for financial markets until it does,\u201d said Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies. \u201cWhen US equipment is striking Russia and Russia mentions nuclear, you have to pay attention.\u201d UK, US and eurozone governments were also a popular safe-haven, which pushed down the yield, or interest rate, on the debt. Investors were also unsettled that two undersea cables in the Baltic have been mysteriously severed. The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said on Tuesday that sabotage was suspected. There are also signs that the market rally prompted by Donald Trump\u2019s election win two weeks ago has fizzled out, leading to a drop in share prices at the end of last week. Analysts have said that the president-elect\u2019s policies on trade tariffs and mass deportations of illegal immigrants would cause disruption to some industries and also push up prices."

Just Eat will now only be listed on the Amsterdam stock market, where the company is headquartered. The company said the London delisting resulted from restarting a review into where its shares should be listed. It cited the \u201cadministrative burden, complexity and costs associated with the disclosure and regulatory requirements of maintaining the LSE listing\u201d, low liquidity and the trading volumes of its shares on the London market. Europe\u2019s largest meal delivery company has been grappling with the end of the pandemic-fuelled boost to online food orders and tough competition from other delivery services. The decision to delist comes only weeks after Just Eat announced it was selling its US arm, Grubhub, at a considerable loss, only four years after buying the US app in a multibillion-dollar tie-up after the first Covid lockdowns. Giving the required 20 business days\u2019 notice of its delisting, Wednesday\u2019s announcement means the company\u2019s shares will trade for the last day in London just before Christmas, on 24 December. Given the festive stock market closure over the following two days, the delisting will take effect from 8am on 27 December. After that date it will be possible for investors to trade the company\u2019s shares only on Euronext Amsterdam. Just Eat said it did not expect the London delisting to have an effect on its shareholders who hold their shares in Amsterdam. Just Eat advised its investors who hold the company\u2019s shares in London to consult their own investment advisers and brokers on what to do about their shareholding, including how they could convert their holdings into shares that can be traded in Amsterdam. A spokesperson for Just Eat said the London delisting was part of its \u201cstrategy to accelerate growth\u201d as the company looked at \u201cenhancing efficiencies\u201d, and the UK continued to be a key market. They added: \u201cWith our network now covering 97% of the UK population, we remain committed to continuing our investment and cementing our leadership position in the country.\u201d Just Eat delisted from the US tech-focused Nasdaq exchange in 2022, blaming the \u201ccomplexity and costs\u201d associated with maintaining the listing. At the time, the company used very similar wording to Wednesday\u2019s announcement to describe its reasons for getting rid of its third stock market listing. It said the decision to delist from the Nasdaq would lead to \u201csubstantial cost saving\u201d and a reduction in compliance requirements. Just Eat\u2019s decision to leave London is yet another disappointment for the UK\u2019s blue-chip index, coming weeks after the buy now, pay later company Klarna filed for its much-anticipated flotation in the US instead of Britain. Claire Trachet, the chief executive of the business advisory firm Trachet, said Just Eat\u2019s comments about low trading volumes of its shares on the LSE were a worry. \u201cThe biggest concern lies in the comments about liquidity and volume, especially considering that 15-20 years ago, London was the leading destination for both,\u201d she said. \u201cFor Just Eat, ultimately it seems that the cost of dual listing on the LSE has not delivered the expected rewards and therefore didn\u2019t merit the added cost.\u201d A recent survey of FTSE 350 companies found that British boards are sceptical about the recovery of the LSE. More than half (53%) of business leaders surveyed told the report published by the Chartered Governance Institute UK &amp; Ireland that they expected the City to continue to experience net delistings over the next five years."

By mid-morning on the New York stock exchange, company shares had climbed as high as $11.67, more than double the day\u2019s opening price. Unusual Machines also said Trump Jr, the oldest son of the president-elect, was among its investors. A filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission listed Trump Jr as the second-biggest shareholder. In a press release that described Trump Jr as \u201ca globally recognized business leader\u201d and \u201cbest-selling author\u201d, Evans said he would \u201cbring a wealth of experience\u201d. Trump, typically referred to as Don Jr, has spent most of his adult life working for his father\u2019s company, the Trump Organization, on real estate and branding. But he has risen to political prominence since his sister Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, distanced themselves from Donald Trump following his defeat by Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election and incitement of the January 6 attack on Congress by Trump supporters who tried in vain to overturn his loss. This year, Trump Jr was widely held to have helped steer the Ohio senator, JD Vance, onto the Republican ticket which defeated the Democratic ticket of the vice-president, Kamala Harris, and her running mate and Minnesota governor, Tim Walz. On Wednesday, Trump Jr said: \u201cThe need for drones is obvious. It is also obvious that we must stop buying Chinese drones and Chinese drone parts. I love what Unusual Machines is doing to bring drone manufacturing jobs back to the USA.\u201d That was in line with statements from his father the president-elect, who has long said he will impose hefty tariffs on Chinese imports. Unusual Machines, however, says in its SEC filing it \u201chas been heavily dependent on Chinese imports for our products and operations\u201d. Referring to brands of drones and equipment, it said: \u201cA substantial majority of Rotor Riot\u2019s products are manufactured, directly and indirectly, using Chinese vendors. Fat Shark\u2019s primary contract manufacturer is Shenzhen Fat Shark Technology Ltd \u2026 which is located in Shenzhen, China.\u201d Unusual Machines did not immediately comment further."

            "date": "2024-11-27T18:03:29Z",
            "content": "Delistings from the London Stock Exchange (LSE) are routinely described as a \u201cblow\u201d, but some hits are painless. The departure of Just Eat Takeaway is one. The delivery firm\u2019s life in London will mainly be remembered for a horribly timed and hubristic acquisition that impoverished the poor old shareholders. The only charitable spin to put on the $7.3bn (\u00a35.8bn) purchase of Grubhub, a US business, in 2021 is that Just Eat\u2019s directors, led by Jitse Groen, the chief executive, must have been suffering a collective case of lockdown fever. Swayed by the boom in demand for takeaways during the Covid pandemic, they grabbed Grubhub at a takeover premium of 40%, even though no easy cost savings were available. Last week. Grubhub was sold for a mere $650m. At least the deal was an all-share transaction \u2013 the US firm\u2019s investors got 30% of the combined entity. If cash had changed hands, the damage to Just Eat\u2019s share price would have been even worse. As it was, the top to bottom fall was almost 90%. One can note that Just Eat\u2019s shareholders foolishly voted for the Grubhub deal by a big majority, but it was still a shocker. Those investors will have to trade their shares exclusively on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange after Christmas, but that is what they have been doing already, more or less. The London quote is merely a secondary listing and attracts only 2% of the trading volume on an average day. In those circumstances, it is understandable that the company wishes to avoid what it calls the \u201cadministrative burden, complexity and costs\u201d of a London listing. The main lesson here is just that secondary listings don\u2019t work unless the company is enormous. Liquidity naturally tends to gravitate to one venue. Just Eat, worth a middling \u00a32.6bn these days, had already ditched the US Nasdaq listing that was inherited with the Grubhub deal, so London is not being singled out for special punishment. The UK, as Just Eat was keen to emphasise, will still be one of the firm\u2019s big markets for delivering pizzas and other stuff (so there will be no relief from the irritating ads). But the corporate home has been Dutch ever since Groen\u2019s Takeaway.com acquired Just Eat in 2020 in a deal that was more like a merger. At the time, Just Eat, version one, was a FTSE 100 stock, but the Dutch deal effectively signalled the end of its UK identity. None of which is to deny that the LSE is suffering deep problems of lack of dynamism, especially in the sub-\u00a35bn category of company. There is a desperate need for exciting arrivals. But Just Eat\u2019s exit is not a case of a UK company running away in search of a higher share rating, which is the usual reason to worry. The decision flows instead from mundane and rational administrative considerations. There is no need for mourning on this occasion, especially given the share price performance since the Grubhub silliness."

            "date": "2024-11-26T18:21:20Z",
            "content": "London\u2019s historic Smithfield meat market is to close for good after the City of London Corporation voted to pull out of plans to relocate it and Billingsgate fish market to Dagenham. The corporation, which owns and operates the central London site of the centuries-old market, had earlier this month put on hold relocation plans to a new \u00a31bn site in Dagenham, east London, to review the \u201cfinancial sustainability\u201d of the planned move. The court of common council, the main decision-making body for the corporation, voted on Tuesday to pull out of running the sites. A market has existed around the Smithfield site for more than 800 years. The corporation was given the right to run it and other wholesale food markets in 1327 by Edward III. The current market site was built in the 1860s and opened in 1868. It was designed by the architect Horace Jones, who also designed Billingsgate when it was redeveloped in the 19th century. The UK\u2019s largest inland fish market was moved to its current site in Canary Wharf in 1982. The corporation said it will provide financial compensation to market traders, who will be able to continue their operations at the markets until at least 2028. Compensation could total more than \u00a3300m, according to the Times. The authority is said to want to turn the Smithfield site into a mixed-use cultural development alongside the London Museum, which is in the process of relocating to part of the Smithfield site where the poultry market was. There are proposals to transform the land of the current Billingsgate site for a mixed-use housing scheme. Announcing the decision, the corporation said it was \u201cactively supporting traders to identify suitable new sites\u201d and they can continue their operations at Smithfield and Billingsgate until at least 2028. It added that its decision reflects a \u201ccareful balance between respecting the history of Smithfield and Billingsgate markets and managing resources for this project responsibly\u201d. Project costs had risen owing to a number of external factors, including inflation and the increasing cost of construction that have made the move unaffordable, it said. Both Smithfield and Billingsgate markets are governed by acts of parliament, effectively fixing the markets to the existing sites and imposing certain rights, restrictions and obligations as to the use of the land. A bill, which will be deposited in parliament on Wednesday, is required to repeal that legislation, and enable the land of the existing sites to be used for other purposes. Chris Hayward, the corporation\u2019s policy chair, said it was \u201ca positive new chapter for Smithfield and Billingsgate markets\u201d and the decision \u201cempowers traders to build a sustainable future in premises that align with their long-term business goals\u201d. \u201cBy stepping back from direct market operations, we will help to create opportunities for these businesses to thrive independently. We\u2019ve worked closely with the traders and thank them for their input and understanding. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to making sure they have the financial support and guidance they need to transition seamlessly and successfully to new locations.\u201d The Times reported that three king\u2019s counsel barristers, who sit on the 100-strong court, had written to the corporation\u2019s \u201ctown clerk\u201d warning that the private vote could be \u201cunlawful\u201d because a study into the importance of the markets to London\u2019s food supply, demanded by the court this year, has not yet been produced. The corporation told the Times that its own lawyers were \u201csatisfied\u201d with the legality of the vote. Meanwhile, Henry Pollard, the chair of the markets committee, had written to his court colleagues warning that \u201cthe process here is wrong\u201d, criticising the lack of a food security report and warning that the additional compensation to the traders \u2013 \u201can unquantified amount [of] over \u00a3300m\u201d \u2013 could be a misuse of public funds, it was reported. Dominic Twomey, the leader of Barking and Dagenham council, said: \u201cWhile this is disappointing news, we understand the financial pressures that key investment projects are facing with soaring inflation in recent years. We are committed to continue working with the City of London Corporation to unlock the huge potential of the Dagenham dock site to bring new employment uses and high quality jobs for local people.\u201d The corporation \u2013 which is one of the country\u2019s wealthiest local authorities but has its own financial pressures \u2013 has reportedly already spent \u00a3308m on the markets move, including a \u00a3115m compensation payment to traders in Smithfield\u2019s poultry market which shut last year."

            "content": "Australians\u2019 wages have increased faster than inflation for a fourth quarter in a row, bringing some relief to households battling with cost-of-living pressures. The wage price index rose at an annual rate of 3.5% in the September quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. That result compared with a pace of 3.6% expected by economists and the 4.1% rate reported by the ABS for the June quarter. Annual headline consumer inflation was 2.8% for the July-September period. On a quarterly basis, the WPI was up 0.8%, compared with market expectations of a 0.9% increase and the June quarter\u2019s 0.8% advance. Quarterly CPI was just 0.2%. The easing in wage price increases was roughly matched across both the public and private sectors. Public sector employees saw their wages rise a seasonally adjusted 3.7%, the lowest annual rate since the September quarter of 2022. For the private sector, where about four in five people are employed, wages were up 3.5%, or matching the annual increase in the September quarter of 2023. The latest wage increase marks a year of rises after adjusting for inflation. While welcome, the gain will only partly claw back some of the retreat when prices took off much faster than wages in late 2022 into 2023. The Reserve Bank of Australia will home that real wage increases don\u2019t stoke inflation, meaning interest rates would have to stay high for longer. Prior to Wednesday\u2019s data, investors weren\u2019t fully pricing in a cut to the cash rate until July. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email National Australia Bank\u2019s monthly business survey, released on Tuesday, though, found that labour cost growth has continued to ease, dropping from a quarterly pace of 1.9% in the three months to September to 1.4% in the three months to October. The RBA will likely be content that wage increases are continuing to ebb, albeit at a slower pace than headline inflation. Employer-worker wage agreements tend to make wage increases a lagging indicator in the economy, particularly with the jobless rate close to the lowest in half a century. Stocks pared some of their losses in midday trading on Wednesday, in a modest sign investors were a bit more hopeful of a near-term interest rate cut. The Australian dollar was little changed, hovering a bit above 65.2 US cents. \u201cWage rises for many jobs can be directly or indirectly linked to the outcomes of the Fair Work Commission Annual Wage Review decision,\u201d said Michelle Marquardt, head of prices statistics at ABS. That decision resulted in a 3.75% wage increase 1 July 2024, or two percentage points lower than for the same quarter of 2023, Marquardt said. The ABS noted the proportion of jobs reporting a wage change was similar for the quarter \u2013 at about 45% \u2013 from the same period a year ago. The average size of hourly wage changes, though, was lower at 3.7% from 5.4% in the September quarter of 2023. Jim Chalmers welcomed the four quarters of real wage gains, with the treasurer describing the data as \u201cvery, very encouraging\u201d. \u201cReal wages growth is one of the things I focus most on,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cI read a lot of stuff over a period of time that said you couldn\u2019t have strong wages growth and have inflation moderating. We\u2019ve shown that\u2019s possible. We\u2019ve shown it\u2019s happening.\u201d \u201cThere is not a whiff of a wage-price spiral in our economy, and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said, adding \u201cwe\u2019ve got a lot of ground to make up\u201d. Catherine Birch, a senior ANZ economist, said wage growth had slowed across awards, enterprise bargaining agreements and individual arrangements. \u201cThis may give the RBA more confidence that wages growth is returning to a pace consistent with its inflation target band, in the face of continued weakness in productivity growth,\u201d Birch said. The ANZ continues to forecast the RBA\u2019s first rate reduction will land in February, although \u201cthe risks remain tilted towards a later start to cuts \u2026 given the slow pace of disinflation and labour market resilience\u201d. The ABS will release October labour market data on Thursday."

            "date": "2024-11-25T15:40:33Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump imposing massive US tariffs on Chinese imports could drag down global inflation by lowering the price of goods in other countries, a senior Bank of England policymaker has said. Swati Dhingra, an external member of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee, said Trump imposing a threatened 60% tariff on goods from China sold in the US could lead Chinese exporters to cut their prices elsewhere to ensure they maintained current trade volumes. \u201cIf there is the kind of big 60% type of tariff increase that\u2019s been proposed, that will have repercussions on to world prices, and mostly on the downward direction,\u201d she said. Speaking at a conference in London on Monday, the economist said there was heightened uncertainty about what policies the president-elect would carry through from the campaign trail. Trump warned before this month\u2019s election that he would slap tariffs of up to 60% on China and up to 20% on other US trade partners. However, Dhingra said the \u201ctextbook\u201d impact of the world\u2019s largest goods importer imposing such a large tariff on products from the world\u2019s biggest exporter would be for global goods prices to fall. Chinese firms would respond to tougher trade barriers by attempting to find buyers in alternative markets, which could lead them to lower their prices to sell similar volumes, including in the UK, she said. \u201cIt takes a massive amount of demand out of the world market. The way exporters, say in China, would respond to that would be to respond with prices, world prices, as they don\u2019t want to lose market share,\u201d she said. Economists have warned Trump imposing punitive import tariffs on US trading partners will drive up inflation in the world\u2019s largest economy, as the costs would be borne by US consumers. However, it would also affect the wider global economy. Dhingra said much would depend on the response to a burgeoning trade war, particularly if governments chose to retaliate with \u201ctit for tat\u201d tariffs on US imports, or with protectionist measures to prevent an influx of cheap Chinese goods reallocating away from the US market. \u201cThen we\u2019re in a completely different situation,\u201d she said. Drawing a comparison with Brexit, Dhingra said that leaving the EU had led to \u201cpermanently\u201d higher prices of products for British households. This had generated inflation as prices rose, before prices stabilised at a higher level. \u201cWe saw much higher price increases in the UK compared to everywhere else and those pressures have now come off much more quickly as well, for the reason they\u2019re not inflationary, they change the price levels, permanently,\u201d she said. Analysts have warned that the euro risks falling to parity with the US dollar for the first time since late 2022 if a new transatlantic trade war weakens the already struggling eurozone economy."

            "date": "2024-11-20T08:35:18Z",
            "content": "Any lingering hope that the Bank of England might deliver a pre-Christmas interest rate cut next month has evaporated, after official data showed inflation jumping to 2.3% in October. If it continues to rise in the coming months, Labour will be forced to defend itself against Tory claims that government policy is at least partly responsible. The CPI measure had been expected to creep up, after dipping to 1.7% in September, but 2.3% was stronger than predicted. September was the first time inflation had fallen below the Bank\u2019s 2% target since July 2021, and looks likely to be the last for a while. Not surprisingly, the Conservatives are keen to hammer home the message that any increase from now on is down to Labour. As the shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, put it in response to Wednesday\u2019s figures: \u201cLabour\u2019s budget will push up inflation and mortgage rates.\u201d It is a bold strategy from the party that gave us Liz Truss, as Labour will remind voters at every opportunity. Much of the explanation for last month\u2019s jump in inflation lies in energy prices, with Ofgem\u2019s quarterly price cap rising from October \u2013 in contrast with the same period last year, when utility bills were falling rapidly from the peak hit following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Electricity prices rose by 7.7% in October, the ONS said, having fallen by 7.5% last year. Gas prices increased by 11.7% in October, having fallen 7% last year. But there may be some truth in the coming months in the argument that the government has given inflation a (modest) boost. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has suggested Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget package could increase inflation by about 0.5%, including through stronger growth, resulting from higher-than-expected government spending. The Bank\u2019s governor, Andrew Bailey, has also made clear that he and his MPC colleagues would be closely monitoring how the policy changes were likely to affect the path of GDP and inflation. Retailers have said they expect to increase prices as they absorb the costs of rising employer national insurance contributions, the biggest money-raiser in the budget, which starts next April. Against that backdrop, economists now confidently expect the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) to wait until the new year before going further, after cutting rates to 4.75% earlier this month. Donald Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House is also giving policymakers pause: if he presses ahead with across-the-board tariffs, the short-term impact at least is likely to be inflationary. Responding to the inflation data on Wednesday, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, emphasised that the government knew there was still \u201cmore to do\u201d, pointing to measures including the significant increase in the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, due in April. The increase in CPI was not unexpected; but as the UK enters a cold snap, with energy bills on the rise, the government will be conscious that cash-strapped households are still feeling the pinch."

            "content": "A key measure of US inflation has risen for the first time since March, underlining its bumpy ride down to lower levels. The consumer price index (CPI), which measures price growth across a basket of goods, ticked up to an annual pace of 2.6% in October \u2013 from 2.4% in September, which had been the slowest rate in more than three years. Stripping out volatile food and energy costs, the closely watched \u201ccore\u201d inflation index held firm at 3.3%. The reading was in line with economists\u2019 expectations. Though inflation has fallen dramatically since peaking at a four-decade high in summer 2022, many Americans are still under pressure after years of price increases. Frustration over the cost of living appeared to play a major role in the election, with exit polls indicating that the majority of Republican voters were frustrated with the US economy and their financial situation. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump proffered tax cuts and tariffs as solutions, but questions have been raised about what such policies will actually mean for inflation. The president-elect has pledged to enact tariffs of at least 10% on all US imports, a policy that many economists say would probably lead to inflation going up as much as 5.1%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in four years in September, a key turning point in its battle to bring down inflation. It lowered rates again last week, to their lowest level since February 2023. At a press conference, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said the central bank \u201chas gained confidence that we\u2019re on a sustainable path down to 2%\u201d, its target for inflation, but added: \u201cThe job\u2019s not done.\u201d The Fed has been trying to carry out its \u201cdual mandate\u201d, managing price increases without triggering higher rates of unemployment. The labor market has slowed significantly over the last few months, with the US adding just 12,000 jobs in October. After hitting a low of 3.4% in February 2023, the unemployment rate in October was 4.1% \u2013 still a low rate, comparable with pre-pandemic levels. When asked whether the outcome of the election affects the Fed\u2019s decision on interest rates, Powell said officials \u201cdon\u2019t know what the timing and substance of any policy changes will be. We therefore don\u2019t know what the effects on the economy would be.\u201d"

            "content": "Having been fairly critical of my (almost) friend Rachel Reeves\u2019s approach to her first budget, I wish to put in a word of praise for certain aspects of it before, er, continuing to be critical. The emphasis on devoting more resources to the NHS is long overdue. The new health secretary, Wes Streeting, does no good for the morale of doctors, nurses and patients when he goes on about the NHS being \u201cbroken\u201d. In common with friends and family, I have recently had recourse to medical help, and we have been much impressed by what we have witnessed \u2013 not least by the good work of staff from overseas. The problem has been that, under austerity, from 2010 onwards, the NHS was afflicted by a severe shortage of funds. The former chair of a leading London hospital trust says that in 2010, after the Blair-Brown concentration of extra resources for the NHS, his hospital had no waiting list. But, as a senior NHS official told me at the time, in order to stand still the NHS needed real (that is, after-inflation) increases of about 4% a year. The Cameron government claimed that they were paying special attention to the NHS, but between 2010 and 2019 the annual increase was less than 1.5%. Another welcome aspect of the budget was the emphasis on investment, and easing the fiscal rules somewhat. However, this has not prevented a barrage of negative comment from thinktanks and certain sections of the press. And not without reason. By hoisting herself with her own petard \u2013 no increases in income tax, VAT or employee national insurance \u2013 the chancellor found herself resorting to some deeply unpopular taxes that have caused quite a furore, and whose revenue gains are far from certain. In particular, the increases in employer national insurance contributions has proved an own goal, with few people believing that, as it works through to prices, this is not in effect also a tax on \u201cworking people\u201d. Thus, having honoured a commitment not to raise the other taxes, Reeves is nevertheless open to the charge of breaking an election promise. But my strongest criticism is of the omission, once again, of what Neil Kinnock calls \u201cthe mammoth in the broom cupboard\u201d \u2013 Brexit, and the government\u2019s continued obsession with its \u201cred lines\u201d, which rule out applying to re-enter the customs union and single market. Moreover, reports from Brussels suggest it is not obvious from there that the UK is making much headway with \u201cresetting\u201d our trading relationship. Which brings us to the issue which is on so many lips: the prospect of the second Trump presidency, this time with precious few constitutional restraints. The previous UK government got nowhere with the fatuous idea that a special trading relationship with the US could make up for the damage caused by opting out of our EU trading privileges. Because Trump\u2019s observations about trade and tariffs are so wild and often inconsistent, it is difficult to know what this notoriously transactional man will settle on, but the omens do not look good. It is almost laughable that our government, having sensibly feared the prospect of a Trump victory, is now trying to comfort itself by resorting to that old cliche: the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. What Britain actually needs is the shelter of the EU, and, with their own burgeoning troubles, the EU countries need us. One of Keir Starmer\u2019s understandable obsessions is trying to overcome the criminal gangs that exploit would-be migrants to this country. But the prime minister reportedly said last week that Brexit had made cooperation on this issue with other countries difficult. Well, well, well. People are comparing the Trump vote to our own Brexit vote: the frustration or revenge of the \u201cleft behind\u201d in reaction to globalisation and the supposed arrogance of the elite. In fact, many voters who were wooed in the UK by the Brexit crowd now realise they were conned, and the \u201cleft behind\u201d Trump supporters are in for a nasty surprise when higher tariffs make their living costs even worse. The famous motto \u201cit\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d was double-edged in the US this time. The macroeconomic figures looked reasonable, but even though the pace of inflation slowed down, the previous surge in US prices was not reversed and the cost of living seems to have been a major factor in the election. But back to the UK. Reeves is constantly concerned by market reactions. Her budget was regarded as mildly inflationary, with an inevitable impact on the course of interest rates. But the UK is a small participant in world financial markets. With markets expecting Trump\u2019s tax cuts and tariff policy also to be inflationary, there could be adverse consequences for US interest rates, and repercussions here."

            "date": "2024-11-20T16:03:02Z",
            "content": "Senate Republicans must soon consider several of Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet picks whose nominations were met with intense criticism: Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, Matt Gaetz as attorney general, Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense and Robert F Kennedy Jr as secretary of health and human services. Each of those cabinet announcements landed with somewhat of a thud on Capitol Hill, raising questions about whether the nominees will be able to muster the majority-level support needed in the Senate to get confirmed. But the president-elect has proposed an archaic and in recent years little-used mechanism to get his nominees installed without Senate confirmation: recess appointments. \u201cAny Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner,\u201d Trump said earlier this month. \u201cWe need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\u201d If Trump pursues a strategy of recess appointments, it could severely curtail the Senate\u2019s power to serve as a check on the new president\u2019s nominations and allow controversial picks to move forward. Here\u2019s everything to know about recess appointments: What does the constitution say about Senate confirmation of presidential nominations? Article 2, section 2 of the US constitution states that the president \u201cshall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States\u201d. Hundreds of senior officials in the federal government, including all members of the president\u2019s cabinet, are subject to Senate approval, meaning they need the support of a majority of the 100-member upper chamber to be confirmed. How do recess appointments allow a president to circumvent the Senate confirmation process? Although the US constitution outlines how the Senate serves as a check on presidential nominations, it also provides an alternate route for installing officials who are usually subject to the confirmation process. Article 2, section 2 further states that the president \u201cshall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session\u201d. This allows the president to install nominees in posts that might otherwise go vacant while the Senate is out of session. If Trump were to utilize recess appointments at the start of his term, those appointees could stay in their posts until the end of the next Senate session, or until the end of 2026. Why do recess appointments exist? Recess appointments have been criticized as an anachronism dating back to the country\u2019s founding, when Congress was in session much less frequently than it is now and correspondence over an important vacancy in the federal government could take weeks. Today, when instant communication and air travel are the norm, the idea that the president may need to rely on recess appointments to fill key government posts appears absurd, sparking criticism of the practice in recent years. Have other recent presidents relied on recess appointments? According to the Congressional Research Service, Bill Clinton made 139 recess appointments, while George W Bush made 171 recess appointments. But Barack Obama only made 32 recess appointments, as the supreme court issued a critical ruling on the practice during his presidency. In its 2014 decision of NLRB v Noel Canning, the court ruled that several of Obama\u2019s recess appointments had violated the constitution because the Senate was not out of session long enough to merit those appointments. The court noted that a Senate recess of at least 10 days is required to allow for recess appointments. In recent years, particularly when the Senate and the White House have been controlled by opposing parties, Senate majority leaders have relied on pro forma sessions, in which no real congressional business is conducted, to limit recesses. For that reason, neither Trump nor Biden had any recess appointments. Would Senate Republicans allow Trump to use recess appointments for his cabinet nominees? That remains unclear, although the newly elected Senate majority leader, Republican John Thune of South Dakota, has suggested he is open to the idea. \u201cWe must act quickly and decisively to get the president\u2019s nominees in place as soon as possible, [and] all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWe cannot let Schumer and Senate [Democrats] block the will of the American people.\u201d That being said, Thune acknowledged that it might be difficult to recess the chamber if a substantial number of Republican senators oppose a particular nomination. \u201cYou have to have all Republicans vote to recess as well,\u201d Thune told Fox News last week. \u201cSo the same Republicans \u2026 that might have a problem voting for somebody under regular order probably also have a problem voting to put the Senate into recess.\u201d Another complication is the role of the House in the recess process, as the constitution stipulates that neither the House nor the Senate can adjourn for more than three days without the consent of the other chamber. But the House speaker, the Republican Mike Johnson, has suggested he is open to a recess. \u201cI believe in the principle of the president being able to choose his team,\u201d Johnson told Fox News on Sunday. \u201cIf this thing bogs down, it would be a great detriment to the country, to the American people.\u201d Senate Democrats could attempt to at least slow the recess appointment process by holding a vote-a-rama, a tedious and lengthy procedure that could force the chamber to stay in session, but such tactics are unlikely to change the final outcome when Republicans hold a 53-47 majority. If Republicans did clear the way for recess appointments, they could significantly damage one of the Senate\u2019s most important functions at a time when their party has just won a governing trifecta in Washington. Such a decision would only further underscore the iron grip Trump has over the Republican party."

            "date": "2024-11-02T10:00:12Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden promised a \u201crecovery for everybody\u201d as he prepared to take over an economy ravaged by the pandemic four years ago. Few predicted what would follow. One of two candidates \u2013 Kamala Harris, his vice-president, and Donald Trump, his predecessor \u2013 will succeed Biden in January. As millions prepare to elect the next US president, here is how the world\u2019s largest economy fared under Biden. Inflation The shock waves unleashed by Covid-19 were still rippling across the world when Biden took office in January 2021. In the US, and many other economies, they set the stage for an extraordinary rise in inflation. For months, the White House and Federal Reserve insisted the factors driving this surging price growth were \u201ctransitory\u201d. By the time the consumer price index peaked, reaching its highest level in a generation in June 2022, officials had changed their minds. The Fed embarked upon an aggressive campaign to tackle inflation in March 2022. Interest rates \u2013 cut to close to zero at the outset of the pandemic \u2013 were increased at 11 meetings, to a two-decade high. Suddenly the central fear looming over the US economy was not runaway inflation, but the specter of recession. As the Fed scrambled to cool activity in an attempt to tackle prices, warnings of a prolonged downturn cast a shadow. Jobs Such effects failed to materialize. The US economy remained remarkably resilient. Millions of jobs were created in the labor market. Non-farm payrolls, the key monthly measure used to take the temperature of the US economy, held firm. Unemployment slipped to lows not seen in half a century. About 399,000 jobs were added each month in 2022, on average \u2013 followed by about 225,000 each month in 2023. While growth has trended lower over the past year, and essentially flatlined in October amid disruptions wreaked by strikes and storms, hiring in September proved unexpectedly strong. The robust data sparked hope that policymakers would successfully guide the US economy to a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d, with price growth normalized and recession avoided. The Fed started to cut rates in September. When officials at the central bank make their next decision on Thursday, two days after the election, they are widely expected to cut rates further. Food prices While the US economy has remained remarkably resilient, many Americans have not been feeling it. The vibes have been off. Earlier this year, a clear majority of Americans wrongly believed the US was in an economic recession, according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. This gloom had only shifted slightly by the time pollsters reran the survey in September. Positive economic data releases \u2013 softening inflation, healthy recruitment levels, steady growth \u2013 are unlikely to move the needle when your bank balance continues to dwindle. The cumulative effect of years of inflation are still taking a toll. Falling inflation does not mean falling prices. The grocery store bills which rose so rapidly in 2021 and 2022 have not crashed back down to earth. For many Americans, the cost of living is much higher today than it was four years ago. Stock markets For Biden\u2019s predecessor, and potential successor, no barometer of US economic success was greater than Wall Street. Reassuring his Twitter (now X) followers that Covid-19 was \u201cvery much under control\u201d in the US in February 2020, Trump added: \u201cStock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d It has been looking even better under his successor. The S&amp;P 500 has rallied by more than half since Biden took office at the start of 2021, and all the major stock market indexes have hit new highs under his tenure."

            "date": "2024-11-07T12:14:32Z",
            "content": "Food sales at Sainsbury\u2019s have been boosted by a return to the office and fewer people dining out in restaurants, as the retailer warned of possible price rises as a result of having to pay \u00a3140m more next year in national insurance contributions [NICs]. The supermarket chain\u2019s pre-tax profits were \u00a3356m for the six months to mid-September, up 4.7% on the same period last year, driven by a 5% increase in sales in its grocery business. However, its chief executive, Simon Roberts, said prices were likely to increase after the rise in NICs in last week\u2019s budget. Sainsbury\u2019s said grocery sales were benefiting from changes in customer behaviour, as the return of consumers to the office had led to more people carrying out one large shop each week rather than more frequent visits with smaller purchases. Roberts said: \u201cThere is a big return to the big weekly shop, and we\u2019re winning those big weekly shops just at a time that more and more people are going back to the office more days a week and going back to that weekly shop.\u201d The supermarket chain has also benefited from shoppers opting to dine in for special occasions, rather than going out to restaurants. \u201cAnother key trend we\u2019re seeing is customers continuing to choose to eat more at home, as eating out has become more expensive, and they\u2019re recognising more and more the restaurant quality of our Taste the Difference ranges,\u201d Roberts said. In the first half of the year, Sainsbury\u2019s recorded an 18% increase in sales of its Taste the Difference range compared with the same period a year earlier. Despite the increased sales in the grocery business, Argos faced a \u201ctough first quarter\u201d, with sales down 5% on the same period last year. Roberts said the decision by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to increase employers\u2019 NICs by 1.2% to 15% from April would lead to price inflation. \u201cThis industry operates on very low margins, and there just isn\u2019t the capacity in the structure of the way the supermarket industry works to absorb these level of costs without some impacts on inflation. \u201cI think given the speed these costs are coming at, they will be inflationary. We\u2019ll do everything we can to mitigate that impact but there will be inflationary impacts, because our costs are going up.\u201d On Wednesday, Marks &amp; Spencer reported that it could face \u00a360m in extra costs from the NIC rise, and that the long-term impact of the budget policies on suppliers and customers was uncertain. Roberts was critical of the government\u2019s decision not to take action on business rates in the budget, despite it being included in its manifesto. Sainsbury\u2019s pays more than \u00a3500m in business rates each year, with 80% of its stores valued above the \u00a3500,000 threshold at which the levy kicks in. \u201cI think [changes to business rates] was a clear expectation that we saw in the manifesto, and we would strongly urge government to move more quickly on the reform of business rates for all retail stores,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIn fact, now on the outcome of last week, business rates next year will actually go up for us.\u201d In the budget Reeves also put forward plans to remove the agricultural property relief inheritance tax exemption from farms worth more than \u00a31m. The decision has sparked fury in the farming community, with the National Farmers\u2019 Union planning a major protest later this month in London to urge that the policy be reversed. Roberts called on the government to listen to the concerns of farmers, particularly as they faced increased production and labour costs, saying: \u201cGiven the concerns that farmers are raising, and the critical role they play in our country, I really urge the government to listen to them and try to find a solution.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s shares fell by nearly 2% in early trading on Thursday."

            "date": "2024-11-07T12:01:11Z",
            "content": "Mortgage borrowers have been put on notice that interest rates will take longer to come down after the Bank of England warned Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget would add to inflation while boosting economic growth. Giving its verdict on last week\u2019s budget as it announced a quarter-point cut in interest rates to 4.75% on Thursday, the central bank said the chancellor\u2019s plans would drive up inflation to a fresh peak next year. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted by a majority of eight to one to reduce rates for the second time this year to ease the pressure on households and businesses from high borrowing costs. However, it said Reeves\u2019s \u00a370bn of additional spending backed by higher taxes and borrowing would add about 0.5 percentage points to headline inflation by the middle of next year and 0.75% to gross domestic product (GDP). Updating its forecasts after taking budget measures into account, the Bank said it expected inflation would now peak at 2.75% by the middle of next year and then remain above the 2% target in 2026, until falling back in 2027 \u2013 a year longer than it had expected in its previous forecasts, published in August. The pound rose against the US dollar after the Bank\u2019s decision to cut rates, while financial markets reacted by betting that Threadneedle Street would cut interest rates fewer times and at a slower pace over the coming year. \u201cWhile cutting interest rates from 5% to 4.75% today, the Bank of England implied that the budget means rates will continue to fall only gradually,\u201d said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. He said rates were now on track to fall to about 3.5% by early 2026 rather than to 3%. Threadneedle Street said it expected the government\u2019s increasing of the rate of employer national insurance contributions (NICs) and the \u201cnational living wage\u201d risked adding to inflationary pressures if companies passed on the costs in the form of lower wage rises and higher prices in the shops. Other measures including raising the cap on bus fares and VAT on private schools could also push prices up. The development led one member of the MPC, the external economist Catherine Mann, to push for interest rates to be held at 5%. Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said the slower pace of rate cuts would have an impact for hard-pressed households. \u201cThe fact so few cuts are expected during 2025 will be a blow for anyone who was hoping for their mortgage to be less of a burden in the coming months,\u201d she said. The Bank of England\u2019s governor, Andrew Bailey, signalled that borrowing costs were still likely to come down in future, although cautioned against expectations for rapid action. \u201cWe need to make sure inflation stays close to target, so we can\u2019t cut interest rates too quickly or by too much. But if the economy evolves as we expect it\u2019s likely that interest rates will continue to fall gradually from here,\u201d he said. Inflation fell back to 1.7% in September \u2013 after peaking at 11.1% in October 2022 \u2013 but was already on track to return to above 2% after an increase in the Ofgem energy price cap for households in Great Britain in October. Reeves said the interest rate cut would be \u201cwelcome news\u201d for millions of families but that households were still facing a challenge after Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget. She said: \u201cToday\u2019s interest rate cut will be welcome news for millions of families, but I am under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing households after the previous government\u2019s mini-budget. \u201cThis government\u2019s first budget has set out how we are taking the long-term decisions to fix the foundations to deliver change by investing in the NHS and rebuilding Britain, while ensuring working people don\u2019t face higher taxes in their payslips.\u201d With expectations that Donald Trump\u2019s US election victory would also pave the way for renewed inflationary pressures in the world economy, Bailey said a \u201cgradual\u201d approach to cutting borrowing costs was required. He signalled the Bank would \u201cwait and see\u201d if Trump would impose sweeping import tariffs on America\u2019s trading partners \u2013 as threatened by the president-elect during the campaign \u2013 while saying it was too early to \u201cprejudge what might happen\u201d. However, he warned Britain was an open economy exposed to disruptions in global trade. \u201cWe do have to watch very carefully the fragmentation of the world economy \u2026 There are a lot of risks attached,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is greater uncertainty out there. First of all there is greater global uncertainty, without a doubt. The second thing to say is, of course there are domestic uncertainties. We need to obviously see how the budget measures pass through in terms of their economic effects.\u201d"

            "content": "BT has said it is facing \u00a3100m in extra costs as a result of the budget last week, as the telecoms company revealed another 2,000 jobs have gone under a long-term plan to cut costs. BT\u2019s chief executive, Allison Kirkby, revealed that changes to employers\u2019 national insurance contributions and increases in the minimum wage would add to its costs next year, with the company being forced to offset this through higher pricing and the use of AI to improve productivity. Kirkby, who took over at BT in February, told the Financial Times that the employers\u2019 NIC changes would account for about 70-75% of the cost increase, with the 6.7% rise in the national minimum wage accounting for the rest. She has joined bosses at Sainsbury\u2019s, Marks &amp; Spencer and Primark in highlighting the cost increases they face after Rachel Reeves\u2019s decision to increase employers\u2019 NIC by 1.2 percentage points to 15% from next April. The chancellor also cut the level at which employers start paying national insurance for workers from \u00a39,100 to \u00a35,000. Kirkby said: \u201cIt\u2019s a new inflationary pressure that we need to suffer in our business. We will be going harder and faster on the cost transformation and plans that we have already laid out.\u201d The comments came as BT reported a 10% drop in pre-tax profits to \u00a3967m for the six months to 30 September, while revenues fell 3% to \u00a310.1bn amid a \u201ccompetitive retail environment\u201d. It revised its outlook, with revenue expected to be down by 1% or 2% in 2024-25, compared with the increase of 1% that was forecast earlier in the year. It blamed this on trading outside the UK and reductions in sales of less profitable kits, as well as a weaker performance in the corporate and public sectors. The company kept its underlying earnings guidance unchanged, for about \u00a38.2bn. It revealed in its results that it had cut its workforce by 2,000, or 4%, taking its overall headcount to 118,000, and that this helped save the company \u00a3433m in annual costs. Last year BT revealed it was looking to slim down to between 75,000 and 90,000 workers by 2030 as it aimed to shave billions of pounds in costs. The company estimates that about 10,000 jobs in the long-term cuts will be replaced by artificial intelligence. In May, the group announced a further \u00a33bn in cuts over the coming years, as Kirkby expanded on plans to turn around the struggling company. She said at the time that BT had hit its initial target of \u00a33bn in savings a year before schedule, and that it would cut the same sum by 2029. Kirkby said that alongside widespread cost-cutting, the group was also investing heavily and ramping up its full-fibre rollout. \u201cOur nationwide full-fibre rollout has set new records, now reaching more than 16m premises, and we have further extended our industry-leading take-up rate to 35%.\u201d The group had also expanded its 5G network to cover 80% of the UK population. \u201cThe accelerated modernisation of our operations, combined with a focus on connecting the UK, puts us in a strong position,\u201d Kirkby added."

Control of the House remained unclear on Thursday, with Republicans closing in on the 218 seats required for a majority. Healthcare providers have reported unprecedented surges in demand for reproductive and gender-affirming medications in the wake of Trump\u2019s victory, even greater than the day after Roe v Wade fell. California\u2019s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, announced a special session of the state\u2019s legislature to ensure the attorney general\u2019s office and other state agencies have the funding they need. California has been setting up guardrails to protect its residents\u2019 rights under an adversarial federal government. Trump as president may give Israel a \u201cblank cheque\u201d for all-out war against Iran, a former CIA director and US defence secretary has predicted. Palestinians in Ramallah argue things cannot get any worse for them than it has been under Biden. Elon Musk has said Trump\u2019s podcast appearances made \u201ca big difference\u201d in the election, as the manosphere and so-called \u201cheterodoxy\u201d celebrate the result. Meanwhile, searches for the 4B movement have spiked on Google and TikTok as women discuss cutting off heterosexual dating with men. A Texas judge has ruled against Biden\u2019s programme offering a path to citizenship for certain immigrant spouses of US citizens, a blow that could keep the scheme blocked through the president\u2019s final months in office. Fear has risen in undocumented communities and families face being torn apart at the prospect of Trump\u2019s promised mass deportation programme. Americans see immigration as the most pressing issue for Trump to address, and a large majority believe he will order mass deportations of people living in the US illegally, a Reuters/Ipsos poll has found. The US Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. Its chair, Jerome Powell, said the election result would have no \u201cnear-term\u201d impact on rates and insisted he would not resign if Trump asked him to leave early, adding that firing a Fed governor was \u201cnot permitted under the law\u201d. The British government will ask its ambassador to Washington, Dame Karen Pierce, to stay in post as Trump takes power, ahead of a complex shuffle of UK security and diplomatic jobs in the new year. Sales have surged for dystopian books, with The Handmaid\u2019s Tale jumping more than 400 places on bestseller charts since Wednesday and On Tyranny by Timothy Snyder enjoying a similar rush.

            "date": "2024-11-04T09:00:08Z",
            "content": "Experts seem to agree the US economy has been on the upswing in 2024. A wave of new jobs, robust consumer spending, lower interest rates, falling inflation, impressive levels of business investment and record Wall Street highs have made the US economy \u201cthe envy of the world\u201d. But many Americans appear to feel very little of that. Jim White, 62, an aquaculture specialist from North Carolina, said he has \u201cgiven up [on] going out\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ll never own a home. A new car is unthinkable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economy is slowly making the rich richer. Everyone else is sinking.\u201d White is among dozens of people from all over the US who shared with the Guardian how they feel about the economy. While some expressed general optimism about stabilizing levels of inflation and reported doing well economically, scores said inflation continued to be financially crippling, with their incomes not even remotely keeping up with soaring costs for housing, food, childcare, insurance, healthcare, fuel, subscriptions and entertainment. Few seemed impressed by months of positive headlines about slowing inflation: \u201cIt\u2019s not as if prices have come down, they\u2019ve just stopped rising as obscenely as before,\u201d as one woman in her 70s from Arizona, who still works part-time, put it. \u201cAm I supposed to be happy about that?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s more manageable, but prices are still too high for our wages compared to pre-pandemic,\u201d said a 36-year-old woman from Salt Lake City who works as a research associate. Even those who felt the economy was doing very well complained of the exorbitantly high cost of living. The economy, 40-year-old Roxanne Oesch from Missouri said, felt \u201cremarkably strong\u201d. \u201cGood jobs are available, interest rates are down and will come down further, and inflation has flattened out. It seems like there is a lot of good news.\u201d But simultaneously, she added, \u201cmost people still cannot enjoy the same level of financial security they had pre-pandemic\u201d. Alongside various young people who expressed dismay about their economic outlook were dozens of pensioners and people surviving on social security, for whom the new lower interest rates are bad news. \u201cInterest on savings is dropping, [which is] challenging for retirees on fixed incomes,\u201d said retired 71-year-old Paul Ames from Bellport, New York. \u201cThe US is doing a lot better than other developed economies. Gas is still way cheaper than Europe,\u201d said Toni, a retired woman from north Florida, who was among various respondents who felt very positive about the economy because they held stock market investments that had been making healthy gains in recent months. \u201cThings are good. The stock market has done well this year. Inflation isn\u2019t having much impact.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d said 69-year-old Timothy Crowley, from Honolulu. \u201cInvestment income rising. This is the best economy on earth.\u201d Respondents from places including New York City, Miami and Milwaukee pointed to rising levels of homelessness in their communities and felt that the US economic trickle-down model was broken. Views on who was responsible for America\u2019s economic shortcomings were split: while some blamed the Biden administration for triggering soaring levels of inflation and rising asset prices through unprecedented interventions to keep the economy afloat during the pandemic, others blamed the previous Trump administration and the larger structural economic system propped up by Wall Street and the Republicans. Alex, a married father of two in his mid-30s from rural North Carolina, said he retrained as a welder during the pandemic, thanks to government financial assistance, but he quickly felt exploited in his new line of work. \u201cI welded in two factories, each making millions in profits every year, and never made it off of government assistance, including food stamps and Medicaid. I\u2019m back in school now and succumbing to the student loan vampires, to try and make it work,\u201d he said. Alex said he has turned his back on Republicans, partly because of his economic concerns. Recent eye-wateringly high levels of inflation \u201cwere 25-percent caused by circa 15 years of quantitative easing, and 75-percent [caused] by corporate greed. I have completely abandoned the Republican party because they just refuse to rein in these economic monsters\u201d. White, the aquaculture specialist from North Carolina, also said that he became a swing voter because of the economy. He will \u201cvote a straight blue ticket until they turn their backs on Trump and the religious authoritarians\u201d, White said. \u201cI\u2019m retiring this year and believe Trump\u2019s tax breaks for the rich have already endangered my social security. He\u2019s also a threat to my healthcare.\u201d Among the respondents who expressed high levels of hopelessness were various college-educated people with established professional careers, such as architects, lawyers, engineers and medics, who said they were worried about financial insecurity, had recently been priced out of their longstanding communities or had been unable to save for retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s horrific,\u201d said 34-year-old Julia, a marketing professional from Washington. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t cost this much for basic necessities. I can\u2019t do anything but work and go to the gym now,\u201d she said, a remark that was echoed by many. \u201cNo social life, no plans, no savings.\u201d \u201c\u2018The US economy\u2019 is not a meaningful or useful concept for most Americans,\u201d said Karena Youtz, 54, a bookkeeper from Idaho. \u201cInflation is horrible. Around 40% of people in Idaho were fully employed and still unable to afford the cost of living here in 2019. I have no idea what that figure is now, but it\u2019s probably much higher.\u201d Melissa, retired, from northern California, who is disabled, reported struggling to get by on her social security payments. \u201cEverything is too expensive, my rent keeps rising faster than my social security benefits and food prices are too high. Medical services in my rural area are far too few and far too substandard,\u201d Melissa said. \u201cThe economy is doing fine and dandy. It\u2019s the citizens of this country that are suffering.\u201d"

            "title": "US economy \u2018motoring along\u2019 with 2.8% growth; coffee prices hit near-50 year high \u2013 as it happened",
            "date": "2024-11-27T17:37:17Z",
            "content": "Time to recap\u2026 The US economy expanded at a solid pace in the third quarter of the year, new data has confirmed. US gross domestic product increased at a 2.8% annualized pace in July-September, the second estimate of the figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed today. Analysts said it showed America\u2019s economy was \u2018motoring\u2019 along. But policymakers fear that new tariffs imposed by Donald Trump could hit growth at home and abroad. Price pressures seem to be picking up a little in the US, with the PCE inflation measure rising to 2.3% in the year to October. Coffee prices are certainly rising \u2013 they have jumped to their highest level in almost 50 years today, with analysts blaming fears of supply shortages. There have been some jitters on the French stock market, on concerns that the Paris government could be brought down by a row over a belt-tightening draft budget. Elsewhere: Wholesale coffee prices have hit their highest level in around half a century today. World arabica coffee price benchmarks climbed to their highest since 1977 on the ICE exchange today, Reuters reports, at $3.21 per lb (\u00a32.53/lb). Reuters attributes the rally to farmers in Brazil still reluctant to sell, speculators piling in, and talk of panic buying amongst the trade. A coffee expert at one of the world\u2019s top agricultural trade houses explained: \u201cBrazil farmers are not interested in selling, the trade has no cash and can\u2019t sell or put on new hedges, and speculators will certainly not sell, so there are not many sellers.\u201d Analysts at Saxo Bank said coffee prices were rising due to \u201csustained worries about Brazil\u2019s 2025 output after trees were hurt by a long drought earlier this year\u201d. There are also concerns that next year\u2019s harvest could suffer from the long dry and hot period that affected arabica coffee crops earlier this year, analysts at Rabobank explained. Arabica is the high-end variety favored for specialty brews. The price of robusta coffee, used to price the cheaper coffee variety typically used in instant coffee blends, has risen by almost 5% today, to the highest since the start of October. The US central bank\u2019s favourite inflation measure has risen. The PCE price index rose by 2.3% in the year to October, up from 2.1% in September to match August\u2019s reading. Stripping out food and energy, and core PCE rose to 2.8% from 2.7%. The Federal Reserve favours PCE as a good measure of inflationary pressures in the US economy, so Fed policymakers may be concerned to see prices rising faster than its 2% inflation target. The increase in US GDP in the last quarter was due to increases in consumer spending, exports, federal government spending, and business investment. The BEA reports: The increase in consumer spending reflected increases in both goods and services. Within goods, the leading contributors to the increase were other nondurable goods (led by prescription drugs) and motor vehicles and parts (led by used light trucks). Within services, the leading contributor to the increase was health care (both outpatient services and hospitals). The increase in exports primarily reflected an increase in goods (led by capital goods, excluding automotive). The increase in federal government spending primarily reflected an increase in defense spending. The increase in business investment primarily reflected an increase in equipment (led by information processing equipment as well as transportation equipment). The increase in imports primarily reflected an increase in goods (led by capital goods, excluding automotive). There\u2019s a subdued start to trading on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average has gained 75 points, or 0.17%, to 44,935 points. There\u2019s more action among small company stocks, though, lifting the Russell 2000 index by 1%. The Russian rouble has lurched to its lowest level since the early days of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The rouble has plunged by over 7.3% today to 113 roubles to the dollar, its weakest level since mid-March 2022. The latest drop came just days after the US introduced sanctions against Gazprombank, Russia\u2019s third-largest bank, which played a key role in processing payments for the remaining Russian natural gas exports to Europe. My colleague Pjotr Sauer reports: Earlier rounds of sanctions had spared Russian gas because Europe\u2019s economy was so dependent on it, but it is now far less reliant on Russian supplies. The Gazprombank sanctions raise the prospect of a further decrease in gas revenues and foreign currency for Moscow. The rouble\u2019s weakening threatens to erode Russians\u2019 purchasing power by increasing the cost of imported goods and could further increase inflation. The country is already contending with runaway inflation, which could climb to 8.5% this year \u2013 twice the Central Bank\u2019s target. US unemployment claims remained low last week. There were 213,000 new initial claims for jobless support last week, a drop of 2,000 compared with the previous week. Today\u2019s US GDP report shows that disposable personal incomes kept rising in the last quarter, despite inflation taking a bite out of pay packets. The Bureau of Economic Activity says: Disposable personal income increased $122.9 billion, or 2.3 percent, in the third quarter, a downward revision of $43.1 billion from the previous estimate. Real disposable personal income increased 0.8 percent, a downward revision of 0.8 percentage point. Today\u2019s US GDP report looks to be good news for Donald Trump \u2013 suggesting he will take control of an economy in good shape. Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors, says: \u201cThe US economy is clearly motoring. The second reading of Q3 annualised US real GDP growth has come in at 2.8%, in line with expectations and following 3% growth delivered in Q2, and 1.6% seen in Q1. \u201cRising real wages, falling interest rates and likely falling taxes and deregulation are all factors that are usually good news for stocks, and markets are already performing strongly in factoring in the better than expected growth. \u201cUS GDP has defied expectations throughout 2024, having been helped along by numerous factors. Consumer confidence levels, which have been consistently dreadful and would have indicated otherwise, do not seem to have deterred spending. Instead, US consumers continued with purchases, if more selectively in lower income households, which has played a significant role in boosting the economy. \u201cWhile growth has proven unexpectedly strong this year, looking ahead, Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks combined with a set of economic policies that are substantially un-tested in modern developed world economies mean that the range of outcomes for 2025 is wide. Nonetheless, expectations for the US economy are now much higher than they were, reflected by stock market gains of around 30% year to date. \u201cWith an impending sugar high from Donald Trump on the horizon, the US economy should continue to grow at a similar rate. However, it will take some time for the true nature and impact of the president-elect\u2019s policies to materialise. As covered in the introduction, Bank of England deputy governor Clare Lombardelli have warned that the president-elect\u2019s proposed trade tariff would pose a risk to economic growth in countries including the UK. Orders for durable goods at US factories rose last month, but by less than expected. Orders for durable goods \u2013 tangible products that can be stored or inventoried and that have an average life of at least three years \u2013 increased by 0.2% in October, less than the 0.5% expected. That follows a 0.4% fall in September \u2013 possibly a sign that customers are getting orders in before new tariffs are imposed on imports? Excluding transportation equipment, new orders increased 0.1%. Excluding defense products, new orders increased 0.4%. A flurry of US economic data has just been released, as statistics bodies clear the decks ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday tomorrow. First of all, we have confirmation that the US economy grew faster than European rivals in the last quarter. US GDP is estimated to have risen by an annualised rate of 2.8% in July-September, the same as was estimated last month. That\u2019s the equivalent of 0.7% growth quarter-on-quarter, much faster than the UK\u2019s 0.1% growth, and the 0.4% recorded in the eurozone. On trade, the US trade deficit has narrowed \u2013 to $99.1bn in October, down $9.6bn from the $108.7bn deficit recorded in September. Imports fell faster than exports: Exports of goods for October were $168.7bn, $5.6bn less than September exports. Imports of goods for October were $267.8bn, $15.2bn less than September imports. New US tariffs could push up the cost of furniture at IKEA. The chief financial officer of the world\u2019s biggest furniture retailer has told Reuters that the proposed tariffs would make it harder for IKEA to keep prices low. Juvencio Maeztu explained that some 30% of IKEA products are sourced from Asian countries including China, with 70% coming from Europe, adding: \u201cFor us, trade barriers around the world, whether it is from one country or another country, are limiting the possibilities to make things more affordable for the many people. \u201cWe will keep working with governments and with our supply chain to try to mitigate the impact and to hope to secure affordability.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s threat of a 25% tariff on Canadian imports could push Canada into recession, fears Rogier Quaedvlieg, senior US Economist at ABN AMRO. Quaedvlieg told clients today: From the perspective of Canada and Mexico, the tariffs are a hard blow. Exports to the US account for 74 and 80% of all exports of Canada and Mexico, and 20 and 26% of total GDP. Tariffs in the first Trump administration led to a percentage decrease in real consumption of about half the magnitude of the tariff percentage. This very conservative estimate gives a GDP hit of 2.5 and 3.25% to Canada and Mexico, enough to push at least Canada into a recession. Second order effects on dependent industries would amplify the impact. The countries reacted with shock to the announcement of such a strong measure. Canada seemed to try and appease President Trump, while Mexico threatened retaliatory tariffs. China on the other hand reacted mildly, seeing their promised 60% tariff downgraded to a mere 10%, although there is nothing to suggest that this proposal would replace the universal tariff touted during the elections. Manufacturers across the US are bracing for disruption from Donald Trump\u2019s planned new tariffs \u2013 and warning their customers could be hit \u2013 my colleague Callum Jones reports: Donald Trump set the business and political world alight late on Monday. The incoming president said he would impose a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada and hit China with more levies on day one of his term. \u201cThis Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\u201d he wrote on Truth Social. Scott Harris has been here before. Eight years ago Catoctin Creek, the Virginia whiskey distillery he runs with his wife, Becky, was generating 11% of its sales in Europe \u2013 and expecting to more than double its business there the next year. Then the trade war kicked in. After Trump imposed steep tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, the European Union hit back with retaliatory duties, including 25% on American whiskey. \u201cThat 11% went to zero,\u201d recalled Harris. While that initial wave of tariffs was repealed, today Catoctin Creek has \u201cno meaningful business\u201d left in Europe, he said. \u201cA few thousand dollars, but nothing to speak of.\u201d Trump\u2019s return to power sets the stage for a new trade war. The president-elect campaigned on a pledge to impose sweeping tariffs in a bid to revitalize the US economy. Officials in key markets are already considering if, and how, they would retaliate. More here: Back in Paris, shares in French financial companies are continuing to fall \u2013 amid worries that PM Michel Barnier\u2019s government could be brought down by a row over a belt-tightening draft budget. Insurance group AXA are down 5%, with bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale losing 3.5%. Yesterday, Barnier warned that France could face fiscal calamity should lawmakers decide to topple his government over a budget dispute. He told French broadcaster TF1 that \u201cThere\u2019s likely to be a serious storm and serious turbulence on the financial markets\u201d if the government were to collapse. French bond prices are pretty flat, though. But with German bond price rising, the spread between Paris and Berlin\u2019s borrowing costs has widened to a 12-year high: Bob Savage of BNY says: The French markets today are back to worrying about the risk of another election. The coalition government is stuck with 2025 budget battles and cracks in support with the National Rally far-right pushing back. There are broader implications about political risks everywhere. First is that in 2024, the voters have kicked on incumbents -signaling frustration over cost of living and national interests. Second is that deficits built up from pandemic responses are now problematic as debt servicing and austerity plans clash against fragmented coalitions. Setting what is most important in the years to come is the role of political leaders \u2013 and the best way forward will be to lead with growth but spending more money will not work in the same way it did during 2020. The problems of current policy and future policies show up most clearly not in FX or Equities but in Bonds. The risk premium for French debt is an example and a lesson for other governments. Britain\u2019s financial regulator has fined the former chief supply chain officer of budget airline Wizz Air Holding over \u00a3125,000 for trading company shares when he wasn\u2019t allowed to. Andr\u00e1s Seb\u0151k breached City rules by trading Wizz Air shares in the restricted 30-day period leading up to the firm\u2019s financial results announcements, the FA says, and also didn\u2019t notify the FCA and Wizz Air of his personal trades within the required 3 business days. The trading took place between April 2019 and November 2020, when Seb\u0151k made 115 trades in Wizz Air shares, worth over \u00a34m in total. This is the first time the FCA has fined a person discharging managerial responsibility (PDMR) for trading company shares during closed periods, under Article 19(11) of the Market Abuse Regulations (MAR), it says. Pets at Home boss Lyssa McGowan has broken ranks on the implications of cost rises linked to the government\u2019s budget - saying they won\u2019t necessarily lead to price rises. McGowan said Pets at Home\u2019s bill from the changes to National Insurance and the minimum wage would mean \u00a318m in extra costs for the specialist retailer, but this was in line additional cost from the increase in the minimum wage last year, which the chain had been able to absorb through various efficiencies helped by new technology. \u201cWe absorbed that [\u00a318m] and kept costs flat,\u201d McGowan said, adding that the company had no plans to change its strategy because of the budget measures. \u201c\u00a318m, some of which was unexpected, is a lot of money but like all retailers we are looking at all avenues to ameliorate that. It is not a given at all that we will have to put up prices.\u201d She said she was feeling \u201cconfident and optimistic\u201d about the run up to Christmas despite a \u201csubdued consumer\u201d environment, as households were turning to Pets at Home\u2019s own-label pet food, for example, as a way to save money helping the business grow in a flat market. She said shoppers were still prepared to buy treats - with the group\u2019s premium pet advent calendars quickly selling out, for example - but were being careful in many other areas. Pet food has seen high levels of price inflation in recent years, and McGowan said prices had now flattened, but not come down. In addition a surge in the number of pets in the UK has now flattened out, with the number of pets stabilising, so that Pets at Home is signing up 15,000 kittens and puppies a year to its loyalty scheme, half the level during the height of the pandemic pet boom. Pets at Home\u2019s share price dived 13% this morning, as the retailer warned that the subdued consumer environment would continue into the spring, hitting annual profits. Analysts at Peel Hunt trimmed \u00a310m off their forecast, taking it down to \u00a3135m. Here\u2019s Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, on Aston Martin\u2019s cash call: Aston Martin might be known for its association with James Bond, but there\u2019s no secret agent in sight to pull it out of its latest scrape. Instead, it\u2019s gone cap in hand to investors to raise money by issuing new shares after posting another profit warning, just months after flagging difficulties in September. The company has hit another troublesome speed bump, with production slowed down by supply chain issues, affecting deliveries of its super-high end Valiant models. This is coming on top of a deceleration of demand in China, a crucial market for the luxury car maker.\u2019\u2019 Trump\u2019s tariffs will lead to higher prices in the shops, and weaker currencies for Canada, China and Mexico, explains Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank. Schmieding says Taken at face value, such tariffs could raise the level of US consumer prices by c1% within a year if we assume that producers and distributors can pass on roughly 70% of higher import prices to consumers at a time of buoyant domestic demand. However, a depreciation of the Canadian, Mexican and Chinese currencies relative to the US dollar will likely absorb a significant part of that impact, perhaps up to half as a back-of-the envelope guess. Trump\u2019s tariff statement is probably merely the opening salvo of a series of tariff threats. But interestingly, he has tied his announcement of extra tariffs on the top three exporters to the US to specific complaints about immigration and drug trafficking. That seems to open the door for negotiations. If the three countries do his bidding on immigration and drugs control to some extent, the tariffs may not be fully imposed or be partly rescinded again afterwards. The Chinese yuan, Mexican peso and Canadian dollar all fell yesterday, with the latter hitting a four-year low against the US dollar. Shares in luxury car market Aston Marton have hit a two-year low in London this morning, after it tapped its investors for more cash and cut its profit forecast. Aston, which has been hit by softening demand in China, has raised \u00a3111m by issuing new shares worth 100p each \u2013 a near-8% discount to last night\u2019s close of 107.9p. It also raised \u00a3100m through new debt, and plans to use its new funds to invest in \u201cfuture growth opportunities\u201d and on its electrification strategy. Aston also warned shareholders last night that it has suffered delays in the delivery of its ultra-exclusive luxury car, Valiant, which cos \u00a32m each. While deliveries are still on track to start before the end of 2024, Aston now only expects to deliver around half of the 38 Valiant models by the end of the year, havng previously expected to get the majority into customers\u2019 hands. This will reduce operating profits to \u00a3270m-\u00a3280m, down from \u00a3285m previously expected. This morning, Aston\u2019s shares have dropped as low as 98.1p, the weakest since October 2022, before recovering slightly to 102.4p (-5%). Lawrence Stroll, executive chairman of Aston Martin \u2013 who rescued the company in 2000 \u2013 insists it can deliver \u201clong-term value\u201d to shareholders, as it enters 2025 with \u201ca stronger and more resilient balance sheet\u201d. But, shares are down roughly 97% since its stock market float in 2018\u2026. The London stock market has suffered another blow this morning, with the news that food delivery company Just Eat Takeaway is to delist. Just Eat is also listed on the Amsterdam stock market, where the company is headquartered, and said the delisting resulted from restarting a review into where its shares should be listed. Citing the \u201cadministrative burden, complexity and costs associated with the disclosure and regulatory requirements of maintaining the LSE listing\u201d as its reasons for the decision, Just Eat said it was also because of low liquidity and trading volumes of its shares on the London market. The French stock exchange, the Cac 40, has dropped to its lowest level since the market wobble of early August. The Cac 40 is down 0.8% at a three-month low, led by bank stocks, and exporters such as Renault (-2.1%) and STMicroelectronics (-1.7%). Back in the UK, the competition watchdog has reported that loyalty card pricing at UK supermarkets is not always the cheapest option for consumers. In a new report, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has found that loyalty prices do offer \u201cgenuine savings\u201d; after analysing 50,000 loyalty-priced products, it found 92% offered savings on the usual price. Customers can make savings of up to 25% by buying loyalty priced products, according to the CMA. But it stressed that while they offer \u201clegitimate\u201d discounts, supermarket customers could still find cheaper alternative options by shopping around. George Lusty, interim executive director of consumer protection, explains: \u201cWe know many people don\u2019t trust loyalty card prices, which is why we did a deep dive to get to the bottom of whether supermarkets were treating shoppers fairly. \u201cAfter analysing tens of thousands of products, we found that almost all the loyalty prices reviewed offered genuine savings against the usual price \u2013 a fact we hope reassures shoppers throughout the UK. \u201cWhile these discounts are legitimate, our review has shown that loyalty prices aren\u2019t always the cheapest option, so shopping around is still key.\u201d US tariffs would also have an impact on American consumers. Economists at Deutsche Bank have calculated that if Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs were fully implemented, US core PCE inflation for 2025 could increase from 2.6% to 3.7%. Before Trump\u2019s victory the assumption was for 2.3% inflation in 2025. Share have rallied in China today, on hopes that Beijing may roll out new stimulus measures to protect its economy from Trump\u2019s tariffs. The CSI 300 index has rallied by 1.75%, while stocks in Shenzhen are up over 2%. Vis Nayar, chief investment officer at Eastspring Investments in Singapore, explains: \u201cWith the potential threat of tariff hikes in 2025, it\u2019s likely China\u2019s policymakers would come up with further stimulus packages to counter downward economic growth pressure from domestic cyclical weakness and increased external uncertainty. There remains plenty of scope for China to surprise the markets.\u201d Budget airline easyJet has swelled its profits, despite the turmoil in the Middle East hitting demand. EasyJet has reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a3602m for the year to 30 September, \u00a3170m than the previous year. This earnings surge was driven by strong demand over the summer; easyJet had made a loss of \u00a3350m in the six months to 31 March, as conflict in the Middle East led to flight cancellations, extra costs and revenues. Outgoing CEO Johan Lundgren, says: \u201cThis strong performance - resulting in a 34% increase in our annual profits - reflects the effectiveness and execution of our strategy as well as continued popularity of our flights and holidays. It also represents a significant step towards our goal of sustainably generating over \u00a31 billion annual profit before tax. Profits were also lifted by charges for cabin bags and \u201cleisure bundles\u201d; last week, easyJet was one of five airlines fined in Spain for charging passengers for hand luggage and seat reservations\u2026. Overnight, Donald Trump has picked a proteg\u00e9 of Robert Lighthizer, his trade representative in the first Trump administration, to lead trade policy in Trump 2.0. Jamieson Greer, an attorney, will serve as the next US trade representative, Trump announced ovenight, and will be tasked with reining in the trade deficit and opening up \u201cexport markets everywhere\u201d. Greer, 44, served as chief of staff to Lighthizer, who designed Trump\u2019s original tariffs on some $370bn worth of Chinese imports, and also renegotiated the North American free trade deal with Canada and Mexico. Lighthizer, an arch protectionist and sometime free-trade skeptic, blasted \u201cglobalists\u201d and other ideological free-traders in his recent book, \u201cNo Trade Is Free\u201d. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, says: Trump has made more picks for his cabinet, including the trade representative, Jamieson Greer. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the tariff tzar in Trump\u2019s first term as president, Robert Lighthizer, and he is seen as trade hawk. This suggests that tariffs will be at the heart of Trump\u2019s trade agenda. However, it is worth noting that as trade representative, Greer\u2019s office will be overshadowed by the US Treasury. The new Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, is moderate on tariffs, and has espoused free trade ideals in the past. This suggests that Trump\u2019s tariff talk may be more bark than bite, although Greer\u2019s appointment is a nod to the trade hawks in his team. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. A day after Donald Trump announced plans for fresh tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, policymakers around the world are digesting the consequences of \u201cTariff Man\u201d Trump returning to the White House. A deputy governor at the Bank of England, Clare Lombardelli, has warned that the president-elect\u2019s proposed trade tariff would pose a risk to economic growth in countries including the UK. Speaking to the Financial Times, Lombardelli explained that Trump\u2019s trade policies could hit growth in the short term, while long-term productivity also suffers from increased trade frictions. She says: \u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate on the specifics but we know barriers to trade are not a good thing, whether they are tariffs or regulatory or others. \u201cWhether you are an economic historian, an economic theorist or a data-driven economist, the impact is clear in terms of its direction. In terms of its size, that depends on the circumstances.\u201d Trump rattled the financial markets yesterday by announcing he would impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and an extra 10% on China, in a crackdown on immigration and drugs. Trade experts fear that Trump could spark a global trade war, if other countries retaliate with their own tariffs in response. Keith Rockwell, a former director at the World Trade Organization, explained: \u201cThe United States exports hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods to these countries. Anyone who expects that they will stand pat and not retaliate has not been paying attention.\u201d Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs are likely to push up inflation in the US, as importers will pass the higher costs onto consumers \u2013 and possibly add a bit more on top! But they could have a deflationary impact on other countries; China, for example, could reroute shipments to Europe rather than the US, cutting prices to support its sales. They also pose a political dilemma for the UK \u2013 should it try to align with the US, to avoid being hit by tariffs too, or try to get closer to the EU? Simon Sutcliffe, Customs &amp; Excise Duty Partner at accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg, says the US hasn\u2019t considered such a protectionist trade policy since the 1930s with the Smoot-Hawley Act \u2013 which ended up fuelling the Great Depression. Sutcliffe says Sir Keir Starmer faces a dilemma: One of the biggest stumbling blocks in the UK\u2019s trading relationship with the EU is the control and administration surrounding the movement of food products. Moving closer to the EU may allow development of a consistent and streamlined food policy which would reduce trade red tape and extra charges.\u201d \u201cHowever, aligning with the US would undermine that attempt, as the EU would be exceptionally resistant to allow US originating food products to \u2018seep\u2019 into its marketplace, resulting in the administrative burden on food movements being cemented in for longer.\u201d \u201cBut \u2018Refusing\u2019 the US may result in UK exporters being subject to US tariffs on their products. The US is the largest individual trading partner of the UK trading with roughly 30% of our total exports going to the US and the US exporting 10% of its goods to the UK, so any tariffs would have a big impact on UK trade.\u201d Also coming up today We\u2019ll get a full-body health check on the US economy today, with a flurry of economic data \u2013 from GDP to trade and jobless claims \u2013 being rushed out ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday tomorrow.

            "content": "Hurricanes and the enormous strike at Boeing were always going to be temporary factors in the US economy, but there are nevertheless signs of a \u201cslowing trend\u201d, according to economists. Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, said the data \u201cbolsters the case\u201d for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates at both its November and December meetings. After that, it depends on what happens on Tuesday... Tombs said: The muted rise in October payrolls is not merely due to strikes and the recent hurricanes. A further slowing in the trend looks likely given that hiring intentions of small businesses remain depressed, large businesses still face a rise in their borrowing costs as low-rate corporate bonds mature, and job openings in the health and education sector have fallen. August and September job gains were revised down by 112,000 jobs, and growth in job numbers slowed. Preston Caldwell, chief US economist at Morningstar, said: Even setting aside the October data, where the impact of temporary distortions is unknown, today\u2019s jobs report was a bit bearish. The data does point to an ongoing downtrend in job growth. [\u2026] There is nothing in the overall assemblage of labour market data to dissuade the Fed from cutting in next week\u2019s November meeting and to loosen policy further over the next year. The data overall points to a job market that has shed all of its post-pandemic tightness and excesses, and the data suggests enough downside risk to warrant nipping in the bud with monetary easing. In other business news today: The UK gilt market appeared to stablise after yields jumped on Thursday. HSBC chairman Mark Tucker gave his support to Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget. The UK manufacturing industry fell into contraction in October as companies paused investments ahead of the budget, according to the closely followed purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). Rating agencies gave their UK budget verdicts. Moody\u2019s said the UK government\u2019s increased borrowing will give an \u201cadditional challenge\u201d to the public finances, while S&amp;P Global said the UK government will be \u201cconstrained\u201d by its debt load. UK house price growth slowed in October ahead of Wednesday\u2019s budget, surprising economists who had expected faster increases, according to one of the key measures collected by a lender. Oil prices rose after reports that Iran is preparing an attack on Israel.

Please do join us next week as we strap in for the US election, and its fallout on financial markets. JJ The response from the business lobby to the UK budget was fairly negative, but criticism of the Labour government has not been universal. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has gained the backing of some senior bankers \u2013 perhaps cognisant that Labour is likely to be in power for at least five years. Mark Tucker, chairman of HSBC, said: This is a budget which lays the foundations for necessary investment within a framework of clear fiscal rules. The overall package strikes a balance between tax, spending and borrowing to finance public services, alongside a focus on delivering economic growth. Patrick Thomson, JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive of asset management in EMEA, said: The market reaction compared to the Truss mini-budget has been relatively muted and should count as a success considering the ambition of the Budget. It was helpful that there were few surprises, given that it was so well telegraphed ahead of time. Having raised taxes for much-needed investment in public infrastructure and services, the market will be waiting to see that the money is spent wisely in actually fixing any underlying problems in the economy to have long term impact. Ultimately, we all want to see how this translates into growth, and so the City will look to the forthcoming Mansion House speech for further detail on the proposed investments. British banks with big motor finance arms have had a dire week on stock markets since a court ruling that could cost them billions of pounds. The latest lender to join the procession of warnings was Secure Trust Bank. It had already said that it was looking at the ruling, but on Friday it worried the market further with a profit warning. Its share price is down by 17% today, adding to a dire run that has driven its valuation to its lowest since floating in 2012. The share price dropped from above \u00a38 a week ago to \u00a34.70 today. The bank said that it was taking longer than expected to recover money from people who had defaulted on loans, meaning that profit before tax would \u201cfall materially below market expectations by between \u00a310m and \u00a315m\u201d. David McCreadie, Secure Trust Bank\u2019s chief executive, said: We are disappointed that it will take longer than expected to recover value from the excess level of defaulted vehicle finance balances, and the recent court of appeal decisions have added additional uncertainty on the benefits to be realised in 2024. US stocks are all up by more than 1%, after weak jobs data appeared to remove any lingering chance of the Federal Reserve leaving interest rates on hold next week. The S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average indices are all up by more than 1% in morning trading in New York. What have we learned from the US jobs numbers? It\u2019s tricky to say. Lara Castleton, US head of portfolio construction and strategy at Janus Henderson Investors, said it was \u201can underwhelming and muddying jobs report just five days before an election\u201d. There was no clear signal because of the hurricanes. There will likely not be much influence from this report on the results of next week nor on the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision later in the month, which will likely be 25-basis-points cut amidst this backdrop. James Knightley, chief international economist for the US at ING, an investment bank, said the number was \u201cdepressed by strike action and hurricane disruption\u201d. Nonetheless, the trend in hiring is obviously slowing and with the inflation backdrop looking less threatening, the Federal Reserve clearly has scope to move policy closer to neutral. Given the inflation backdrop is less threatening and the Fed is putting more emphasis on jobs, today\u2019s report cements expectations for a 25bp Fed rate cut next week. We expect that to be followed up by another 25bp rate cut in December. Wall Street has opened higher. Share prices were likely helped by expectations of looser monetary policy from the Federal Reserve after surprisingly weak jobs numbers. Here are the opening snaps, via Reuters: S&amp;P 500 UP 23.42 POINTS, OR 0.41%, AT 5,728.87 NASDAQ UP 93.71 POINTS, OR 0.52%, AT 18,188.86 DOW JONES UP 199.46 POINTS, OR 0.48%, AT 41,962.92 Back in the UK, the RMT union has suspended tube strikes due to start today after what it called a \u201csignificantly improved offer\u201d from Transport for London. Engineering staff represented by RMT were due to stop work for 24 hours from 6pm today. However, the separate Aslef union has not called off its action. Train operators and managerial employees are due to strike on 7 and 12 November. An RMT spokesperson said: Following intense negotiations with London Underground management and a significantly improved offer, we have suspended the strikes scheduled to start this evening. London Underground have sensibly abandoned their proposed changes to pay structures which now means all our members will receive the same value in any pay award. Further discussions will take place next week regarding the pay offer but progress has been made which would not have been possible without the fortitude and industrial strength of our 10,000 members on London Underground. *This post has been updated to reflect the fact that Aslef has not called off its strike action. The jobs numbers prompted a rapid fall in the yield on US Treasury bonds. The yield on the 10-year benchmark dropped 10 basis points (0.1 percentage points) in the immediate aftermath of the data. Perceptions of a weaker US economy will make the Federal Reserve more likely to lower interest rates next week. That would boost the relative value of bonds. (Yields dropping means prices are rising.) It\u2019s something of a side issue given the context of the US election, but the drop in yields has also affected UK debt. The yield on 10-year gilts has dropped below 4.4% \u2013 wiping out all of Thursday\u2019s post-budget move. The US dollar has weakened after the shock drop in non-farm payrolls. The dollar is down by 0.3% against a trade-weighted basket of currencies after initially climbing over the course of today. The pound is now up 0.5% today against the greenback, while the euro is up 0.1%. You can see the immediate reaction on this chart showing the performance of the dollar basket today: Economics professor Justin Wolfers of University of Michigan says that the underlying trend is of slower growth in jobs, but not a signal of a disastrous economic situation. But the headline is nevertheless still a long way below any recent readings thanks to the strikes and hurricanes. The US unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1%, but it is the non-farm payrolls number that will take up all the attention. Only 12,000 jobs were added \u2013 which will surely be seized on by Donald Trump in the last few days of campaigning ahead of the presidential election. A miss in the forecasts of that magnitude \u2013 more than 100,000 jobs \u2013 is rare. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) added the important caveat that the jobs reading is the first since Hurricanes Helene and Milton hit the US. The BLS said: It is likely that payroll employment estimates in some industries were affected by the hurricanes; however, it is not possible to quantify the net effect on the over-the-month change in national employment, hours, or earnings estimates because the establishment survey is not designed to isolate effects from extreme weather events. There was no discernible effect on the national unemployment rate from the household survey. It also added that \u201cEmployment declined in manufacturing due to strike activity\u201d \u2013 a reference to the ongoing strike at Boeing in particular. The US economy added far fewer jobs than expected in October, in a shock reading that will raise questions about its momentum days before the presidential election. Only 12,000 jobs were added in the month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, far below economists expectations of 113,000, and the 254,000 in September. Tens of millions of Americans have already voted, but we will shortly receive the last big economic update before the US presidential election next Tuesday: non-farm payrolls. The jobs numbers are a key measure of the US economy, but this month they could be affected by the huge strike at Boeing and the effects of a hurricane hitting Florida. Whatever the noise, the figures will help to set the narrative for the next day or two as the election campaign enters its most frantic stage. Bob Savage, head of markets strategy and insights at BNY Mellon, a US investment bank, said: US October non-farm payrolls expected 110,000 after 254,000 with hurricane and strike noise. The unemployment rate expected steady at 4.1% and the average hourly earnings flat at 4% year-on-year. Reuters\u2019s poll of economists suggests that the reading will be 113,000, down from 254,000 in September. A quick check-in on gilt markets: the Labour government will have been eyeing developments nervously after some movement this week, but so far on Friday things have been fairly steady. The yield on the UK 10-year bond has dropped to 4.42%, down from a high of 4.51% during London trading hours and two basis points (0.02 percentage points) below yesterday\u2019s close. Yields move inversely to prices, so falling yields is a sign of investors buying bonds, after Thursday\u2019s selloff. The 30-year yield has also dropped by a basis point, while the short-term two-year gilt is down four basis points in today\u2019s trading. The pound is up by 0.2% against the US dollar, and 0.3% against the euro. Shreyas Gopal, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said that the budget should be net positive for the pound, because it will likely make the Bank of England more hawkish \u2013 more likely to keep interest rates higher for longer. Our economist\u2019s base case for next week is that the BoE now retains its language around cuts being \u201cgradual.\u201d Higher policy rates for longer, driven by a demand stimulus that lifts growth and inflation, ought to be positive for the pound in the current market environment. America\u2019s two oil giants reported combined profits of more than $13bn (\u00a310bn) for the third quarter as higher production volumes made up for weaker prices. ExxonMobil made $8.6bn, while Chevron made $4.5bn. Both beat analyst forecasts. ExxonMobil said it had produced the most oil for a quarter in over 40 years, at 3.2m barrels per day. Chevron said its oil output rose 7% compared with last year thanks to record production in the US, including the West Texas Permian Basin. Slower global economies have dragged down oil prices in recent months \u2013 despite the turmoil in the Middle East and Ukraine. That has hit oil company profits this year, but there is little sign of them slowing down. Both companies and their rivals have expanded production in the face of warnings from forecasters such as the International Energy Agency that exploration for new oil and gas wells must cease if the world is to hit climate targets to limit global heating to 2 degrees Celsius. Oil prices have risen by 2% after reports that Iran is preparing an attack on Israel. Futures prices for Brent crude oil, the North Sea benchmark, have risen by 1.9% to $74.22, while the North American equivalent, West Texas Intermediate, is up 2.1% to $70.73. US news website Axios reported that Iran was considering the strikes, citing Israeli officials. Investors have been watching the conflicts in the Middle East closely for anything that could mark the start of further escalation. So far Israel\u2019s wars against Hamas in Gaza and Lebanon have not directly affected oil production, for all the horrors of the losses of civilian lives. The UK manufacturing industry fell into contraction in October as companies paused investments ahead of the budget, according to the closely followed purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). The final reading for British manufacturing dropped to 49.9 points in October, according to S&amp;P Global, below the 50 index level that marks a contraction. The initial \u201cflash\u201d reading had been 50.3. It was the first time since April that manufacturing activity had contracted, S&amp;P said. Rob Dobson, director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: UK manufacturing started the final quarter of the year on an uncertain footing amid speculation on government policies ahead of the Budget, which was widely reported to have led to a wait-and-see approach on investment and spending. This domestic headwind, combined with an ongoing loss of export business, led to the first outright contraction in new work intakes since April. Output growth came close to stalling as a result. Another of the big three rating agencies has published its verdict on the UK budget: S&amp;P Global Ratings said that the UK\u2019s fiscal position is \u201cconstrained\u201d \u2013 but it also said that public investments \u2013 particularly in the health service \u2013 could create a \u201cmore business-friendly environment\u201d. The UK faces \u201celevated budgetary deficits and net general government debt level\u201d, S&amp;P said \u2013 although it did not raise its forecasts for budget deficits because it had already taken into account \u201clingering public spending pressures\u201d. Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019s new fiscal rules gained the unusual backing of the International Monetary Fund this week, because they allow for increased investment. However, S&amp;P said that the rules presented \u201cmixed messages\u201d because they allowed for greater spending, but also that they are more credible on cutting future deficits because they require debt to be government debt to falling within three years. (Previous rules had a five-year timeframe, which meant governments could up load notional tax rises in the future, knowing they were unlikely to have to deal with it themselves.) The key test of success for Reeves will be growing the economy, S&amp;P said: The front-loading of spending will mechanically boost growth in the short term, but it\u2019s too early to tell how much this will add to potential output in the long term. On the positive side, investments in infrastructure and planning reforms should create a more business-friendly environment; an improved health service should help bring people back to work as current inactivity remains mainly linked to people who are off sick; and education and childcare investments should improve workers\u2019 skills in the long term. Nonetheless, reaping those potential benefits will also depend on whether the spending is deployed in an effective way. S&amp;P underlined that Reeves and Starmer have gambled on higher spending generating increased growth. If that does not happen it could prove tricky for the UK: A hypothetical scenario in which public spending is permanently higher but the quality and accessibility of public services still doesn\u2019t improve enough, could further complicate policy trade-offs in the future. Conversely, a faster improvement in public services could yield greater dividends in terms of lower future pressures and positive growth repercussions. The UK government\u2019s increased borrowing will give an \u201cadditional challenge\u201d to the public finances, according to influential rating agency Moody\u2019s. UK gilt yields, effectively the price at which the government can borrow, rose to their highest level this year on Thursday afternoon as markets responded to Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget \u2013 the first by a Labour government in 14 years. Investors were responding particularly to the prospect of about \u00a328bn in extra borrowing. Moody\u2019s said that the budget would not do much to boost UK economic growth, and that there was only a limited buffer if the country faces further financial shocks, in a further sign of the wariness of financial markets towards the government\u2019s plans. In a note sent to investors, reported by the Financial Times, Moody\u2019s said: In our view, the increase in borrowing, which is in part supported by a new measure of debt under the fiscal framework, will pose an additional challenge for what are already difficult fiscal consolidation prospects. [\u2026] Furthermore, the extent to which new investment spending can raise growth potential will be limited unless structural constraints are durably addressed which will prove difficult. Moody\u2019s is one of the three major ratings agencies, alongside S&amp;P and Fitch. Their economists are not privy to any special information or insight on sovereign debt, but their assessments tend to be influential among bond investors Changes to stamp duty by Rachel Reeves in the budget mean we should expect a rush of UK property transactions in the new year until the end of March, according to Nationwide. That will probably be followed by a period with fewer transactions in the months afterwards. The chancellor\u2019s decision to remove the temporary increase to the nil rate for stamp duty next April could spark a rush to complete purchases before the changes. In September 2022, the government temporarily increased the nil rate of stamp duty, the amount before you have to start paying stamp duty on a purchase, for homebuyers, raising the nil rate for first-time buyers from \u00a3300,000 to \u00a3450,000, and for those buying an additional home from \u00a3125,000 to \u00a3250,000. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: The main impact of the stamp duty changes is likely to be on the timing of property transactions, as purchasers aim to ensure their house purchases complete before the tax change takes effect. This will lead to a jump in transactions in the first three months of 2025 (especially March), and a corresponding period of weakness in the following three to six months, as occurred in the wake of previous stamp duty changes. The biggest mover on the FTSE 100 this morning is Reckitt Benckiser, the maker of products ranging from Dettol to Strepsils. Reckitt\u2019s shares are up 10% after a US court ruling boosted its baby formula subsidiary, Mead Johnson. Here\u2019s the Reuters report on the ruling from last night: Abbott and Reckitt unit Mead Johnson are not responsible for a young boy\u2019s debilitating intestinal disease, a jury found on Thursday in a lawsuit accusing them of failing to warn of their premature baby formulas\u2019 risks, a victory for the two companies following large losses in similar trials. At the five-week trial in St. Louis, Missouri state court, lawyers for plaintiff Kaine Whitfield had urged jurors to award more than $6.2 billion. The lawsuit, brought on Kaine\u2019s behalf by his mother, Elizabeth Whitfield, alleged that the companies failed to warn that their specialized formulas used by newborn intensive care units in hospitals could cause necrotizing enterocolitis, a disease that almost exclusively affects premature infants and has an estimated mortality rate of more than 20%. The UK\u2019s chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, has said that the UK is seeing a normal market response to the budget, after the \u201cPTSD\u201d from the chaos following Liz Truss\u2019s 2022 \u201cmini-budget\u201d. Asked about the market response to the budget, the Jones told Sky News that \u201cmarkets always respond to budgets in the normal way\u201d. There\u2019s a lot of new information about the economy and the nation\u2019s finances presented to Parliament, and it\u2019s normal for markets to respond. I think we\u2019ve all got PTSD from Liz Truss and just let\u2019s compare the two different scenarios, because they\u2019re very, very different: So, under Liz Truss, as we saw, they sacked permanent secretary, they ignored the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. They announced \u00a345bn of unfunded tax cuts and said they were only just getting started. And then the market went mad and we all know what happened. Completely different in contrast to now. Stock markets across Europe have gained ground. The FTSE 100 in London is up by 0.4%. Here are the opening snaps from across the rest of Europe: EUROPE\u2019S STOXX 600 UP 0.1% GERMANY\u2019S DAX FLAT FRANCE\u2019S CAC 40 UP 0.2%; SPAIN\u2019S IBEX UP 0.1% EURO STOXX INDEX UP 0.1%; EURO ZONE BLUE CHIPS UP 0.1% As trading in London has opened, yields on the UK 10-year and the 30-year have risen by about four basis points (0.04 percentage points) apiece. But they still remain just below the high for the year hit on Thursday. That left the 10-year gilt at 4.477%, and the 30-year at 4.913%. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. UK house price growth slowed in October ahead of Wednesday\u2019s budget, surprising economists who had expected faster increases, according to one of the key measures collected by a lender. House prices grew by 0.1% in October, according to the Nationwide building society. That was less than the 0.3% rate that economists polled by Reuters. The annual rate of growth slowed from 3.2% in September to 2.4% in October, below the 2.8% expected by economists. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: Housing market activity has remained relatively resilient in recent months, with the number of mortgage approvals approaching the levels seen pre-pandemic, despite the significantly higher interest rate environment. UK debt yields revisit year high after budget UK bond yields once more touched their highest point this year on Friday, as investors continued to digest the implications of the first Labour budget in 14 years. The yield \u2013 effectively the UK government\u2019s borrowing cost \u2013 on the benchmark 10-year bond reached 4.526% in global trading on Friday, matching the level hit on Thursday in the aftermath of Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget statement as investors predicted a slower pace of interest rate cuts from the Bank of England. Since then it has fallen back slightly to 4.456%. Scrutiny of bond market movements has been particularly intense after the budget because of the large borrowing set out by Reeves, alongside major tax increases. However, while there has been a noticeable reaction in the market for UK government bonds, also known as gilts, it has not so far been comparable to the turmoil following the budget of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng in 2022. The below chart shows the UK 10-year gilt yield over the last three months: yields (which move inversely to prices) have risen appreciably, but the post-budget movements have not been dramatic.

            "content": "In John Harris\u2019s article (From Trump\u2019s victory, a simple, inescapable message: many people despise the left, 10 November) there is a nugget of text that best describes the abominable mess the \u201cleft\u201d (a catch-all descriptor which is in itself part of the problem) finds itself in, because it beautifully expresses both the problem and solution for those of a progressive bent in one fell swoop \u2013 albeit he delivers them in reverse. It came when Harris spoke of an agenda often \u201cexpressed with a judgmental arrogance, and based on behavioural codes \u2013 to do with microaggressions, or the correct use of pronouns ...\u201d. That rings true with many people who aren\u2019t that fussed with identity politics (or politics in general) and feel alienated by those who are. But then Harris continues with a clanger I could barely believe he put on paper: \u201c\u2026 that are very hard for people outside highly educated circles to navigate\u201d. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not intentional, but surely such a coda, in its implication, falls foul of the same jaundiced thinking: you are too dumb to understand what \u201cprogress\u201d is. On the contrary, it\u2019s not that people don\u2019t understand the need to be respectful to or tolerant of others who are different; outside of political extremes, I\u2019d say even socially conservative people have a code of \u201clive and let live\u201d. No, it\u2019s more that many people are tired of being told how backwards they are if they don\u2019t play along with the priggishness of signs, flags, symbols and linguistic rules. When the latter stance hardens into an ideology that brooks no dissent, the result at the ballot box will be somewhat inevitable \u2013 however ghastly it may be to some of us. The irony is that the growing solipsism at the heart of so much progressive politics seems to be occupying both the ivory tower and the bunker at the same time. Maybe leaving both those places is how to start the comeback. Colin Montgomery Edinburgh \u2022 John Harris recognises that there are many reasons why Trump won, but then reverts to a view of a progressive left despised by a reactionary right and a muddled middle. The last 50 years have seen extraordinary changes in society: changes in behavioural norms, in attitudes towards female equality, different ethnicities, sexual orientation, behaviour and religion. But societies are heterogeneous, and many people feel uncomfortable with some changes. Inequality of wealth and income is less accepted as fair, necessary or inevitable, with a growing gap between aspirations and achievement. The left underestimated the difficulty of creating widespread acceptance of the changes that they have introduced and campaign for, making it easy for those we call populists to call us the \u201cliberal elite\u201d and to gain votes for \u201ctraditional values\u201d. Societal problems are complex. Complex problems never have simple solutions, and most people have no time, desire or ability to wrestle with the complexities. Martyn Thomas Tunbridge Wells, Kent \u2022 John Harris has once again proved he is the smartest writer the Guardian has. The left has become elitist, snobbish and tone deaf to its old voting base in the working class. If you continue to campaign on feelings and \u201cvibes\u201d rather than promises kept and economic reality, you will keep losing. Keir Starmer won an election on promises and lost support instantly by breaking them. Dan Rainey Hull \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

            "date": "2024-11-07T02:29:07Z",
            "content": "Republicans have won a majority in the US Senate but control of the US House of Representatives remains unclear on Wednesday evening, with many of the most competitive races still uncalled. With Donald Trump having won the White House, the stakes for control of the House have grown, since it could serve as either the sole Democratic check on the upcoming Trump presidency, or as the final Republican win that delivers a united pro-Trump government. By Wednesday evening, Republicans were ahead 205-190, according to the Associated Press, after it called Democratic holds in New Jersey, Wisconsin and Texas, and victories for Republican incumbents in Michigan, Wisconsin and California. North Carolina Republicans had won three seats previously held by Democrats, while Democrats flipped seats in Alabama and New York. The US may have to wait days to learn who won the House, given that it took more than a week to make that call in 2022. All 435 members of the House faced re-election, with Republicans looking to expand their narrow majority after two chaotic years in power. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, was re-elected to a fifth term and announced in a letter on Wednesday afternoon that he will be running for re-election as speaker. The House majority leader, Steve Scalise, is running for his position again, too. Elise Stefanik, another loyal Trump ally and the highest-ranking woman among House Republicans, won a sixth term in New York. But control of the lower chamber appears to be a true toss-up, as Democrats only need to win five more seats than they did in 2022 to regain their majority. Johnson said he believed Republicans will keep a majority in the House, giving the party a \u201cunified government\u201d. \u201cThe mandate that has been delivered shows that a majority of Americans are eager for secure borders, lower costs, peace through strength and a return to common sense,\u201d Johnson said in his letter. Scalise outlined the priorities of the Trump administration\u2019s first 100 days, including measures to \u201csecure the border\u201d and ending the pause on LNG exports. \u201c(Trump) can begin to get our economy back on track by slashing certain regulations and making the administrative state more efficient,\u201d he said in a separate letter canvassing support. Scalise said House Republicans would \u201clock in\u201d tax cuts, \u201cunleash American energy\u201d, increasing energy exploration and production, and repealing unspecified Democrat policies introduced through the Inflation Reduction Act. The new administration would also \u201csurge resources\u201d to the southern border to build the \u201cTrump Border Wall\u201d, he added, while boosting border patrols to \u201cstop the flow of illegal immigration.\u201d Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader, argued meanwhile that the \u201cHouse remains very much in play\u201d. The path to victory for Democrats is in seats in Arizona, Oregon, Iowa and California, he said. \u201cThe party that will hold the majority in the House of Representatives in January 2025 has yet to be determined. We must count every vote,\u201d Jeffries said. In an election marked by Republicans\u2019 intense anti-transgender rhetoric, Delaware voters elected the first openly trans member of congress, Democrat Sarah McBride, 34. So far, both Democrats and Republicans have picked up seats due to redistricting, the process of adjusting district lines to keep up with population changes, with the Alabama Democrat Shomari Figures winning a district that had been changed to ensure fair representation for Black voters, while Republicans in North Carolina flipped three districts that had been reshaped by the Republican-controlled state legislature. Democrats also flipped two seats in New York state, with Democrat Josh Riley, an attorney, beating the incumbent Republican Marc Molinaro, and John Mannion, a Democratic state senator, defeating incumbent Republican Brandon Williams in upstate New York. Ten of the most hotly contested House races are in California, where Democrats need to flip at least one Republican seat in order to secure a majority, according to the Associated Press. Without control of the House, Trump, the winner of the presidential race, will face significant hurdles in implementing his legislative agenda. Election forecasts suggest either party could end up with a majority of just a few seats, which could re-create some of the problems of the 118th Congress. In 2022, the \u201cred wave\u201d that Republicans had promised failed to materialize, leaving the party with a House majority of just four seats at the start of 2023. That tight margin allowed a small group of hard-right Republicans to wreak havoc on the speakership race, forcing Kevin McCarthy to endure 15 rounds of voting before capturing the gavel. But just nine months later, McCarthy was ousted from the speaker\u2019s chair following a revolt staged by eight members of his own conference. McCarthy\u2019s removal kicked off weeks of chaos, with the House at a complete standstill until Johnson, then a relatively unknown lawmaker, was elected to lead the chamber. In recent months, Republicans have had to pitch themselves to voters for another two years in power after overseeing the most unproductive Congress in decades. Democrats have attempted to capitalize on Republicans\u2019 legislative record as they look to rebuild a majority in the House, warning voters about the dangers of continuing the \u201cdysfunction\u201d in Congress. \u201cYou\u2019ve all seen it from day one, with 15 rounds of speaker elections [and] threats of shutdowns,\u201d Representative Suzan DelBene, chair of House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, told Axios in August. \u201cThose are the things that drive people at home crazy.\u201d Regardless of who wins a House majority, the new Congress will immediately face a highly consequential task when members are seated in January: certifying the results of the presidential election. In 2020, Trump supporters infamously attacked the Capitol in an unsuccessful effort to disrupt the congressional certification of Joe Biden\u2019s victory, and lawmakers have sparked concern about the possibility of similar political violence after election day.

            "date": "2024-11-05T01:27:04Z",
            "content": "Much attention has been paid to the historic race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, but the results of down-ballot elections will determine whether the new president will actually be able to implement a legislative agenda next year. With Republicans defending a narrow majority in the House of Representatives, Democrats only need to flip a handful of seats to wrest back control of the lower chamber, and both parties are going all out to win. Here are 10 House races to watch this year: Arizona\u2019s first congressional district Republican incumbent David Schweikert is running for re-election in this toss-up district, which covers north-east Phoenix and Scottsdale. As one of 16 House Republicans representing districts that Joe Biden won in 2020, Schweikert is vulnerable, and Democrats have identified the seat as one of their top targets this year. After post-2020 redistricting moved the district to the left, physician Amish Shah won a crowded Democratic primary there in July. Given that Schweikert secured re-election by less than one point in 2022 and a recent Democratic internal poll showed the two candidates virtually tied, this race will be a hard-fought sprint to the finish line. California\u2019s 45th congressional district Republican congresswoman Michelle Steel has emerged victorious from some tough political battles in the past, as she won re-election by five points in 2022, but Democrats hope to bring an end to that winning streak this year. A recent poll showed Democrat Derek Tran with a narrow lead over Steel in this district, which covers parts of Orange and Los Angeles counties. The Cook Political Report gives Democrats a two-point advantage in the district, but Steel has proven adept at overcoming difficult odds. Iowa\u2019s third congressional district Freshman Republican Zach Nunn was previously favored to win re-election in this Des Moines area district that Trump narrowly carried in 2020. Nunn flipped the seat in 2020 after defeating incumbent Democrat Cindy Axne by less than one point. This time around, Harris is in a strong position to win the district, and Democrat Lanon Baccam\u2019s strong fundraising record has helped put the seat in play for his party. Maine\u2019s second congressional district Democratic incumbent Jared Golden is running for a fourth term in this perpetual swing district that Republicans have repeatedly tried and failed to flip. Golden defeated former Republican congressman Bruce Poliquin by six points in 2022, even though Trump carried the district by six points two years earlier, according to data compiled by Daily Kos. But this time around, Republicans believe they have a strong candidate in Austin Theriault, a state representative and former professional racecar driver who held a slight lead over Golden in a recent poll. Golden has proven politically resilient in this right-leaning district, so a loss could point to broader electoral problems for Democrats. Michigan\u2019s seventh congressional district Democratic congresswoman Elissa Slotkin\u2019s decision to run for Senate has created an opening in this bellwether district, which both parties have identified as a key target this year. Former Republican state senator Tom Barrett is running again after losing the 2022 election to Slotkin by six points, and he will face former Democratic state senator Curtis Hertel. The Cook Political Report has described the district as \u201cthe most competitive open seat in the country\u201d, so the results here could have much broader implications in the battle for the House. Nebraska\u2019s second congressional district This district will play a key role in both the presidential race and the battle for the House. Like Maine, Nebraska allocates a portion of its electoral votes based on congressional districts, and Harris is favored to win the electoral vote of the second district. With more attention on the second district because of the presidential race, Republican incumbent Don Bacon is facing some tough headwinds in his re-election bid. Bacon defeated Democrat Tony Vargas by just three points in 2022, and recent polls show Vargas opening up a small lead in this year\u2019s rematch. North Carolina\u2019s first congressional district Freshman Democratic congressman Don Davis is running for re-election in this north-eastern North Carolina district, which shifted to the right after the latest round of redistricting. Much to the relief of Republican strategists, Laurie Buckhout won the congressional nomination over Sandy Smith, a hard-right firebrand who lost to Davis by five points in 2022. Republicans are hopeful that Buckhout\u2019s impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as an army veteran and founder of her own consulting firm, combined with the more favorable district lines, will be enough to unseat Davis. But the incumbent held a six-point lead over his Republican challenger as of late September, one survey found. New York\u2019s 17th congressional district Mike Lawler made headlines when he defeated incumbent Sean Patrick Maloney, then the chair of House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, by less than one point in 2022. This year, Lawler will face off against former Democratic congressman Mondaire Jones in this Hudson valley district that went for Biden in 2020. Lawler did not get dealt the worst hand from New York\u2019s redistricting process; that distinction goes to fellow Republican freshman Brandon Williams, whose Syracuse-area seat went from Biden +7 to Biden +11, according to the Cook Political Report. All the same, Lawler will face stiff competition in a race that will be closely watched for broader electoral trends in November. If he cannot hold on to the seat, it could spell trouble for Republicans up and down the ballot. Pennsylvania\u2019s 10th congressional district This seat may be harder for Democrats to flip, as the Cook Political Report gives Republicans a five-point advantage in the district. The hard-right views of Republican incumbent Scott Perry, who allegedly played a \u201ccentral\u201d role in Trump\u2019s campaign to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, could allow Democrat Janelle Stelson to pull off an upset. Stelson, a former local news anchor, has focused her pitch on attacking Perry as a symbol of a dysfunctional Congress, and her message appears to be resonating with voters. One poll conducted in October showed Stelson leading by nine points, forcing Perry\u2019s allies to allocate more funding to the race. Virginia\u2019s seventh congressional district Democrat Eugene Vindman, who first attracted national attention for his role in Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial, is facing a tougher than expected fight in this Virginia district that covers some of the Washington exurbs. Democrats are looking to hold the seat, which was left open after congresswoman Abigail Spanberger chose to launch a gubernatorial campaign rather than seek re-election. Internal polls show Vindman running neck and neck with his opponent, Republican Derrick Anderson, despite the Democrat\u2019s hefty fundraising advantage. A loss in this bellwether district, which Biden won by seven points in 2020, could spell trouble for Democrats\u2019 hopes of retaking the House.

            "date": "2024-11-04T22:56:41Z",
            "content": "Residents of one of California\u2019s most conservative counties are bracing for a contentious election, as the community grapples with a thriving election denialism movement that has amplified conspiracy theories about voter fraud and made life increasingly difficult for election workers. In recent weeks, some residents of Shasta county, home to 180,000 people in the state\u2019s far north, have urged the county not to certify the election results while one official warned that if Donald Trump is \u201ccheated\u201d out of the election, there would be \u201ca price\u201d to pay. While the US\u2019s attention is on the swing states that will determine the outcome of the race between Kamala Harris and Trump, Shasta county offers a look at how the election denialism movement and extremist politics are affecting communities across the country. \u201cIt\u2019s already been a tense time in Shasta county for the last three to four years,\u201d said Nathan Blaze, a local activist and chef. \u201cIt\u2019s just getting more and more divided.\u201d In recent years, Shasta county has gained notoriety for its far-right politics and embrace of election conspiracy theories. The county in 2016 and 2020 favored Trump by large margins, and the region became a center of the election denialism movement that falsely claimed Trump did not lose the 2020 presidential race. Since then, a group of local activists who believe there is widespread voter fraud have been relentless in their efforts to uncover evidence of \u201ctampering\u201d and to remake the voting system. The group successfully lobbied officials, some of whom have also spread election misinformation, to throw out the county\u2019s voting machines and institute a hand-count system. Their efforts were promoted by leaders in the movement, such as Mike Lindell, but ultimately thwarted by a new state law preventing manual tallies in most elections. They have kept a close eye on election workers, showing up at the county office to observe the process, and creating an environment that workers say is hostile. Election workers are frequently interrogated about processes and procedures by people who will not be moved to trust in the voting system regardless of what workers say, and they have reported that observers sometimes film or record them. The elections office has taken additional security measures to protect its workers. But still roughly half of all staff have left in the past year, including one person who reported the office faced harassment from an elected official. Tanner Johnson, who worked in the office for more than a year, told a local publication, A News Cafe, that working in such difficult conditions took a toll on his mental health and that he feared the office could see violence. \u201cThere\u2019s just been a lot of saber rattling for the last couple of years, and it\u2019s just been ridiculous, with one pissing contest after another,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cBut eventually, someone\u2019s going to actually draw the saber. And I don\u2019t want to be there for that.\u201d At a rowdy and tense meeting of the county\u2019s governing body last week, the group of residents who have pushed misinformation about elections complained about what they described as a lack of transparency from the elections office and urged officials to \u201cput pressure\u201d on the head of the office. \u201cYou cannot certify the election next Tuesday, no matter what happens because of what\u2019s happening in that office,\u201d one man said. Some residents told the Guardian that things felt calmer than they had in past elections, but there remains an underlying current of discontent. Blaze said he planned to visit the elections office on Tuesday evening \u201cto observe the observers and film them so they don\u2019t try to get away with doing something bad\u201d. He and others have made a point of speaking out against the extremism that has come to define local politics, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been standing up to these people. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing a bully is more afraid of than someone who isn\u2019t [afraid].\u201d Read more of the Guardian\u2019s 2024 US election coverage: US election 2024 live updates: latest polls, results and news When do polls close?

Keep track of all the results and upcoming polls with our election tracker: January BHUTAN 30 November 2023 \u2013 9 January 2024: The tiny Himalayan kingdom elected the liberal former prime minister Tshering Tobgay and his People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) with a large majority. Tobgay has vowed to promote the investment needed to boost the country\u2019s $3bn economy and address the unemployment that is driving an increasing number of young Bhutanese abroad, mainly to Australia, in search of better opportunities. BANGLADESH 7 January: Prime minister Sheikh Hasina won a fifth term in office in an election that was overshadowed by a ruthless crackdown on the opposition and voter turnout of just 40%. In the months leading up to the election, tens of thousands of opposition leaders and rank and file party members were arrested en masse with at least nine dying in jail in the three months preceding the election. In August, Hasina was forced to resign and flee the country after mass student-led protests that began over a quota system they said disproportionately allocated government jobs to the descendants of freedom fighters from the 1971 independence war. TAIWAN 13 January: Taiwan elected Lai Ching-te as its next president, ushering in a historic third term in power for the pro-sovereignty Democratic Progressive party (DPP) and angering Beijing. Two days after the elections, China managed to reduce the number of Taiwan\u2019s formal diplomatic allies to just 12, and has also begun increasing its military threats, with warplanes frequently entering Taiwanese airspace. COMOROS 14 January: President Azali Assoumani won a fourth five-year term more than two decades after he first came to power in a coup. Though the country experienced three democratic transitions of power after he first stepped down in 2006, his return in elections in 2016 have since seen him erode democratic mechanisms. After January\u2019s vote opposition candidates alleged fraud and ballot-stuffing. TUVALU 26 January: Former attorney general and fisheries official Feleti Teo was elected as prime minister by MPs a month after general elections closely watched by Taiwan, China, the US and Australia amid a geopolitical tussle for influence in the Pacific. Tuvalu, with a population of about 11,200 spread across nine islands, is one of three remaining Pacific allies of Taiwan. Prior to the elections there had been calls for the new parliament to debate recognition of China and review a cooperation deal with Australia. But after his election Teo reaffirmed the country\u2019s \u201clong-term and lasting special relationship\u201d with Taiwan. FINLAND 28 January-11 February: Centre-right former prime minister Alexander Stubb won an election runoff against rival Pekka Haavisto in what was seen as the country\u2019s most high-stakes presidential election in a generation. It was the country\u2019s first poll since it joined Nato and took place amid escalating geopolitical drama on the border with Russia. February EL SALVADOR 4 February: President Nayib Bukele won a thumping victory after voters rewarded him for a fierce gang crackdown that has transformed security in what was once one of the world\u2019s most dangerous countries. But his second term was unconstitutional and his New Ideas party\u2019s sweep of parliamentary seats means Bukele will wield unprecedented power. Analysts also suggest that the suspension of civil liberties and imprisonment of more than 2% of the country\u2019s adult population \u2013 many without charge \u2013 is unsustainable. MALI Were scheduled for 4 February: The junta said in September it would postpone presidential elections set for February \u2013 which was already a two-year delay on what was agreed by interim authorities after the 2020 coup led by Colonel Assimi Go\u00efta. It appears the military plans to hang on to power indefinitely in the west African country, which has suffered an upsurge in terrorist violence since the military takeover. AZERBAIJAN 7 February: President Ilham Aliyev won his fifth term with over 90% of votes in elections observers said were neither free nor fair. He had called the poll early after recapturing the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia last year and launching a crackdown on independent journalists. HAITI Were due by 7 February 2024: Elections were supposed to happen in 2023 with an earlier agreement in place for power to have been transferred by 7 February 2024. But since the assassination of president Jovenel Mo\u00efse in 2021, Haiti has descended into crisis and there are no longer any elected officials. In the latest bout of violence, gang leaders launched attacks on key institutions and infrastructure in Port-au-Prince while prime minister Ariel Henry was in Kenya in February, seeking support for a UN-backed force to stabilise the country. Gang leader Jimmy Ch\u00e9rizier, a former elite police officer known as \u201cBarbecue\u201d called for Henry\u2019s ousting and said he would try to capture the country\u2019s police chief and government ministers. While abroad, Henry pledged to hold parliamentary elections by mid 2025 but it was unclear if and when he would be able to return. PAKISTAN 8 February: Despite opposition from the powerful military and a state-led crackdown, the PTI party of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan won the most votes in legislative elections. However after days of wrangling and political horse-trading a coalition including the rival Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PLM-N) and the Pakistan People\u2019s party (PPP) agreed to form the next government with Shehbaz Sharif as prime minister and ensure that that the PTI party could not take power. INDONESIA 14 February: Prabowo Subianto, a 72-year-old former general who was dismissed from the military amid allegations he was involved in kidnapping and torture in the 1990s, is on course to win the presidency in the world\u2019s third largest democracy with more than half of votes counted \u2013 as of early March there was still no final result. Prabowo has always denied wrongdoing but the results have provoked fear among rights activists that accountability for past atrocities will fade even further under his leadership, and that his future government will have little regard for human rights. BELARUS 25 February: There were no surprises in parliamentary elections denounced by the US as a sham, the first since presidential polls won by longtime dictator Alexander Lukashenko sparked widespread protests in 2020. He has since cracked down even harder on opposition figures, including his main challenger, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who is now in exile. But the elections saw the All-Belarusian People\u2019s Assembly become an official organ with immense powers, after a constitutional change made last year. According to one analyst, \u201cIt\u2019s a step on the path to a Belarus without its contested leader Alexander Lukashenko, even if it\u2019s impossible to say how long that path will be.\u201d After the election, Lukashenko said that parliament\u2019s role would continue to be expanded, but also announced that he would run for a seventh term in 2025. CAMBODIA 25 February: The ruling Cambodian People\u2019s party (CPP) claimed a landslide victory in Senate elections and set the stage for former prime minister Hun Sen to officially return to politics. Last year Hun Sen, who had ruled the country for almost four decades, handed power to his son, military general Hun Manet, just a month after parliamentary elections widely criticised as a sham. Party spokesperson Sok Eysan said Hun Sen had won a seat and confirmed the CPP would nominate the former leader as the president of the Senate \u2013 allowing him to act as head of state when the king is overseas \u2013 when it convenes in April. Human rights activists had warned ahead of the polls that the country, where opposition leaders have been jailed, was \u201ccontinuing on its descent into authoritarianism\u201d. March IRAN 1 March: Elections for parliament (Majlis) and the Assembly of Experts, the body which chooses the Supreme Leader, saw turnout of just 41%, the lowest since the 1979 Islamic revolution that swept the clerical rulers into power. The vote \u2013 the first since the massive protests sparked by the death of Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini in police custody in 2022 \u2013 was seen as a test of the clerical establishment\u2019s legitimacy amid mounting economic struggles and a lack of electoral options for a mostly young population chafing at political and social restrictions. With heavyweight moderates and conservatives staying out and reformists calling the election not free and unfair, the contest was essentially among hardliners and low-key conservatives, all proclaiming loyalty to revolutionary ideals. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei disqualified reformist former president Hassan Rouhani from running for the assembly. PORTUGAL 10 March: Portugal\u2019s centre-right Democratic Alliance ousted the Socialist government with the narrowest of victories in a snap election that saw a surge in support for the far-right Chega party. Under its leader, Lu\u00eds Montenegro, the alliance made up of the Social Democratic party (PSD) and two smaller conservative parties formed a minority government and was sworn in early April, but its stability is still a concern as it needs the support of either the Chega party or the centre-left PS to pass legislation. RUSSIA 15-17 March: Vladimir Putin claimed a landslide victory and a fifth term in presidential elections that were widely condemned as neither free nor fair by the west. The government said Putin won 87.28% of the vote and that turnout was the highest in history at 74% of the electorate \u2013 results that used to appear only in Russia\u2019s most despotic regions, such as Chechnya. There was no meaningful opposition; just a month before the election the country\u2019s most prominent opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, died in mysterious circumstances in prison in Siberia. The elections were also seen as an attempt to gain a mandate for Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine and voting took place in the four partially occupied regions of Ukraine \u2013 a message to locals that there is no alternative to Russian control. SLOVAKIA 23 March: Nationalist-left government candidate Peter Pellegrini won Slovakia\u2019s presidential election ahead of liberal, pro-western opposition candidate Ivan Kor\u010dok in a run-off poll. Pellegrini is a close ally of the pro-Moscow, populist prime minister Robert Fico. The vote was seen as a demonstration of how the country feels about Fico\u2019s comeback last year after being forced to resign amid mass protests in 2018. Pellegrini\u2019s victory cements Fico\u2019s grip on power by giving him and his allies control of major strategic posts. SENEGAL 24 March: Bassirou Diomaye Faye, a leftwing pan-Africanist, was sworn in as Senegal\u2019s youngest president after a stunning election victory. He swept to a first-round win just 10 days after being released from prison. Faye\u2019s election is being seen as a damning rejection of Macky Sall, the former president who was in power for 12 years. Faye is pledging radical reform with systemic change, greater sovereignty and calm after years of deadly turmoil, but faces major challenges in passing new laws as he lacks a majority in the national assembly. UKRAINE Was due by 31 March: Ukraine was due a presidential election by the spring \u2013 Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s five-year term is up. Under martial law, elections are suspended, but observers say a vote that acts as a safety valve to release internal tensions and popular discontents would be a worthwhile exercise \u2013 even if Putin tried to bomb it. NORTH KOREA Were expected by March: Elections to the hermit state\u2019s rubber-stamp National Assembly were expected to be held in March. However the month passed with no indication a poll was about to take place. Observers have suggested the delay may be down to a constitutional amendment the Kim Jong-un regime wants to make regarding relations with Seoul. Elections usually feature a 99.99% turnout, with 100% backing the ruling Workers\u2019 party. April KUWAIT 4 April: The official Kuna news agency said opposition candidates won 29 seats in the 50-member assembly, matching the outcome of last year\u2019s parliamentary elections. Kuwait bans political parties and candidates run as independents. Two hundred candidates competed, the lowest number in over five decades. The elections took place after new emir, Sheikh Mishal al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who took over from his late brother in December, dissolved parliament in February after a lawmaker reportedly insulted the ruler, the latest in a series of dissolutions. SOUTH KOREA 10 April: Liberal opposition parties scored a landslide victory in parliamentary elections, dealing a resounding blow to sitting President Yoon Suk-yeol and his conservative party but falling just short of a super majority. Support for the already unpopular Yoon had sunk further after a scandal over a Dior bag allegedly given to his wife. In the wake of the poll, senior ruling party politicians offered to resign to take responsibility for its heavy defeat, including the prime minister, Han Duk-soo. The Democratic party (DP) won 161 out of 254 directly contested seats, while the PPP won 90 seats. The Democratic party leader, Lee Jae-myung, said: \u201cWhen voters chose me, it was your judgment against the Yoon Suk-yeol administration.\u201d CROATIA 17 April: The ruling HDZ party won parliamentary elections but with fewer seats than before and without a majority in what was seen as a popularity test for prime minister Andrej Plenkovic. The conservative HDZ has dominated politics since Croatia\u2019s independence from a crumbling federal Yugoslavia in 1991 but has been scarred by multiple corruption scandals. Plenkovic secured a third term after agreeing a coalition with the far-right Homeland Movement (DP). The country is expected to hold a presidential election in December. SOLOMON ISLANDS 17 April: Two weeks after a parliamentary election failed to deliver a majority to any party, lawmakers chose ex-diplomat Jeremiah Manele as their new prime minister. Manele, who was foreign minister when Solomon Islands turned its back on Taiwan and established diplomatic relations with Beijing in 2019, has pledged to continue his country\u2019s embrace of China. While this stance may ring alarm bells in the US and Australia, which had voiced concern over a 2022 security pact that Solomon Islands signed with China, analysts say Manele is a less polarising figure than his predecessor, Manasseh Sogavare. INDIA 19 April \u2013 1 June: Narendra Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) lost its parliamentary majority, dealing an unexpected blow to the prime minister. Instead of the predicted landslide, voters pushed back against the strongman leader and his Hindu nationalist politics in swathes of the country. Nonetheless, together with the BJP\u2019s political allies, known as the national democratic alliance (NDA), its win amounts to about 292 seats, which is enough to form a majority government to rule for the next five years and return Modi to office for a third term. The results were a surprisingly sweet outcome for India\u2019s battered and bruised political opposition, particularly the BJP\u2019s main rival, Indian National Congress, which had been written off by many pundits and analysts prior to the polls as too weak and disorganised. MALDIVES 21 April: Voters backed President Mohamed Muizzu\u2019s tilt towards China and away from traditional benefactor India, with his party winning control of parliament in an election landslide. Muizzu\u2019s People\u2019s National Congress (PNC) won 66 of the first 86 seats declared, according to the Elections Commission of Maldives, already more than enough for a super-majority in the 93-member parliament. The vote was seen as a crucial test for Muizzu\u2019s plan to press ahead with closer economic cooperation with China, including building thousands of apartments on controversially reclaimed land. TOGO 29 April: Incumbent president Faure Gnassingbe\u2019s ruling Union for the Republic party (UNIR) won 108 of 113 seats in parliamentary elections, allowing him to extend his rule under a constitutional reform that has been denounced by the opposition. Under new rules approved by lawmakers in April, Gnassingbe will instead be able to take a new post as \u201cpresident of the council of ministers\u201d, a role similar to prime minister that is automatically assumed by the leader of the majority party under the new parliamentary system. The overall president \u2013 the head of state \u2013 will have a mostly ceremonial role and be elected by parliament. As president of the council of ministers, Gnassingbe, in power since 2005 after the death of his father, will be able to stay in power without term limits. May PANAMA 5 May: Former security minister Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino won presidential elections after standing in at short notice for former president Ricardo Martinelli, who was barred after being handed an 11-year sentence for money laundering in 2023. Martinelli played a key role in drumming up support for Mulino while holed up in the Nicaraguan embassy, where he has sought asylum. The pro-business, rightwing president will have to grapple with a slowed economy, historic levels of migration, a drought that is handicapping transit in the Panama Canal and the economic aftermath of mass anti-mining protests in 2023. CHAD 6 May: Chad\u2019s constitutional council confirmed junta chief Mahamat Idriss D\u00e9by as winner of the presidential election after dismissing challenges by two losing candidates \u2013 cementing a victory that extended his family\u2019s decades-long rule. D\u00e9by, who seized power the day rebels killed his father, President Idriss D\u00e9by, in 2021 and declared himself interim leader, won 61% of the vote, well ahead of second-placed candidate Succes Masra with 18.54%, the council said. The election was marred by opposition calls for a boycott and the shooting dead of one expected candidate in February. THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 19 May: The hugely popular incumbent, Luis Abinader, won almost 60% in the first round of a presidential election, voiding the need for a runoff. The 56-year-old centrist has benefited from a strong post-Covid recovery, his crusade against corruption and a hardline stance on migrants from neighbouring Haiti, with which he closed his country\u2019s border last year. However crime, cited in travel warnings by the US state department, ranks in polls as a major issue for citizens of the Dominican Republic. While the economy has soared, Abinader\u2019s critics say he has work to do in taming inflation and inequality that have left behind many citizens. LITHUANIA 12-26 May: Independent incumbent Gitanas Naus\u0117da won more than 70% of votes in a run-off presidential election against prime minister, Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117. The campaign was dominated by the war in Ukraine and fears over a potential attack on Lithuanian territory by neighbouring Russia; both candidates supported increasing defence spending to at least 3% of GDP. Lithuania will also hold parliamentary elections this year. MADAGASCAR 29 May: Legislative elections took place months after President Andry Rajoelina was re-elected in a vote marred by low turnout, an opposition boycott and accusations of fraud. Despite its wealth of resources, 75% of the population of the island nation off the south-east of Africa lives below the poverty line. Rajoelina\u2019s government has been accused of sliding towards dictatorship \u2013 it banned public protests last year and has cracked down on opposition. Results are expected to be announced between 8 and 18 June. SOUTH AFRICA 29 May: The African National Congress (ANC) party lost its majority for the first time in 30 years of full democracy, as voters punished the party of Nelson Mandela after years of corruption, leadership scandals, power cuts and high rates of crime and unemployment. However, it still emerged as the largest party, with 40% of the vote, and has now launched coalition talks. It has various options, including linking up with the new MK party of former president Jacob Zuma, although the MK party\u2019s leaders have said they will not work with the ANC while President Cyril Ramaphosa remains its leader. Other possibilities include a coalition with the pro-business Democratic Alliance (DA) or the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a Marxist-Leninist party led by the ousted ANC youth leader Julius Malema. June ICELAND 1 June: Halla T\u00f3masd\u00f3ttir won the presidential election with 34% of votes, beating former prime minister Katrin Jakobsd\u00f3ttir into second place. The role is largely ceremonial, acting as a guarantor of the constitution and national unity, although Icelandic presidents have in the past refused to sign unpopular legislation. T\u00f3masd\u00f3ttir, a 55-year-old entrepreneur and former head of the country\u2019s chamber of commerce who also ran unsuccessfully for the post eight years ago, will be sworn in on 1 August, taking over from former history professor Gu\u00f0ni Thorlacius J\u00f3hannesson. MEXICO 2 June: Claudia Sheinbaum won a landslide victory to become Mexico\u2019s first female president, and its first Jewish president. The leftwing climate scientist and former mayor of Mexico City was boosted by the popularity of her mentor and outgoing leader, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, whose social programmes she vowed to continue. But the poll was also the most violent in modern history, with more than 30 candidates killed and hundreds more dropping out as criminal groups vied to install friendly leaders; one of Sheinbaum\u2019s biggest tasks will be trying the stem the surge in gang-related violence in recent years. The new president will also face tense negotiations with the White House over the huge flows of US-bound migrants crossing Mexico. EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT 6-9 June: Parties on the populist right made stunning gains in European parliamentary elections across the 27-nation bloc; despite that, the pro-European centre appeared to have held. In France, Emmanuel Macron called snap legislative elections after the crushing defeat of his allies by Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally, while in Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s coalition had a bad night as the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) made significant gains. The far-right also won large shares of the vote in Italy, Austria, Hungary and the Netherlands. But the centre-right European People\u2019s party (EPP), which topped the polls in Spain and Poland, won the largest number of seats, and its lead candidate, Ursula von der Leyen,later secured a second term as European Commission president. Nevertheless, the narrowing overall majorities for mainstream pro-European parties could mean the blocking or slowing of laws on Europe\u2019s green deal and the taking of a harder line on other areas of EU sovereignty including migration, enlargement and support for Ukraine. BELGIUM 9 June: Prime minister Alexander De Croo resigned after his Flemish Liberals and Democrats party (Open VLD) suffered heavy defeats in parliamentary elections. A new government is likely to coalesce around the rightwing New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), which beat its arch-rival, the far-right Vlaams Belang, into second place in the key Dutch-speaking Flanders region. But the French-speaking liberal party, Mouvement Reformateur, was the biggest in Brussels and French-speaking Wallonia, setting the country on course for months of challenging coalition talks. Belgium is infamous for its lengthy coalition negotiations: after the last elections in 2019 it took more than 650 days before a government was formed. BULGARIA 9 June: The party of conservative former premier Boyko Borisov won the most votes in snap parliamentary elections \u2013 the sixth in three years \u2013 with almost 25%. But it is likely to continue to struggle to find partners to govern after massive anti-corruption protests in 2020 ended Borisov\u2019s almost decade-long rule, indicating that political instability in the EU\u2019s poorest country is unlikely to end. Reformist grouping PP-DB slumped to between 14 and 15% \u2013 down from the almost 25 percent they got in the last snap polls last year. The election was marked by apathy, with turnout the lowest for a national election since the end of communism, at around 30%. MAURITANIA 22 June: President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, whose party won a comfortable victory in parliamentary elections last year, won a second term with over 56% of the vote. His election in 2019 represented the first peaceful transfer of power in the West African country\u2019s history and he has overseen its relative stability in the increasingly violent Sahel region. However his main rival, anti-slavery activist Biram Dah Abeid, who won 22.14%, rejected the initial results, alleging irregularities. Prior to the election, the third place candidate, Hamadi Sidi El Mokhtar, had also said he would not accept the results if he suspected rigging. MONGOLIA 28 June: The ruling Mongolian People\u2019s party (MPP) emerged from elections with its parliamentary majority significantly diminished, after a campaign dominated by concern over endemic corruption and the high cost of living. In the new State Great Khural, the country\u2019s unicameral parliament, the MMP will hold 54% of the seats, compared to about 80% in 2020, a result analysts said was a rebuke of the party and its leadership. The elections were the first to take place since major changes were made to the system last year, increasing the number of seats in the chamber from 76 to 126 and reducing the number of electoral districts from 29 to 13. July UNITED KINGDOM 4 July: Labour leader Keir Starmer was swept to power in a landslide victory that marked an end to 14 years of Conservative rule, the last half of which was dominated by the economic and political fallout from Brexit and a rotating carousel of Tory prime ministers. However, Starmer\u2019s win was more down to the deep unpopularity of the Conservatives than to enthusiasm for him and his party; thanks to the UK\u2019s first-past-the-post system Labour won more than 60% of parliamentary seats on just 33.8% of the vote, just 1.7% percentage points more than it won in 2019. The Tories won 23.7% of votes \u2013 down a massive 19.9 percentage points, with many of their voters switching to smaller parties including the populist Reform party. Starmer now faces a groaning in-tray, with the country facing crises in multiple areas including migration, environment, prisons, the health service and housing. IRAN 28 June-5 July: The reformist Masoud Pezeshkian pulled off a stunning victory in the presidential runoff, reflecting deep dissatisfaction with the direction of the country in recent years and opening potential new avenues of cooperation with the west. Pezeshkian defeated the ultra-conservative Saeed Jalili on a turnout of 49.8% \u2013 a big increase on the record low turnout of 39% recorded in the first round. Pezeshkian has been an advocate of letting women choose whether to wear the hijab and ending internet restrictions that require the population to use VPN connections to avoid government censorship. But the former heart surgeon faces a minefield in trying to bring about change; Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, wields ultimate authority and under his rule the government has increasingly cracked down on dissent. FRANCE 30 June-7 July: A leftwing alliance won the most parliamentary seats in a surprise result that kept Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally \u2013 opinion polls had predicted it would win the most seats for the first time in French history \u2013 from taking power, but also meant no party gained an absolute majority. The country, which has no history of coalition governments and which in modern times has always had a dominant party in parliament, now faces a period of uncertainty. The results were a rebuke to President Emmanuel Macron, who called the snap elections after his centrist alliance was trounced by the far right in European Parliament elections in May; he now faces the three remaining years of his term with an even more fragmented parliament, weakening his own position domestically and abroad. RWANDA 15 July: There were no surprises in an election that saw President Paul Kagame, who has ruled with an increasingly iron fist since coming to power after the genocide in 1994, win 99.1% of the vote. The 66-year-old has been credited with bringing unity, stability and development to the small, landlocked country. But critics have accused his administration of suppressing dissent and trampling on human rights. At least five opposition politicians and four government critics and journalists have died or disappeared in suspicious circumstances since the 2017 election, according to Human Rights Watch. Rwandan officials have denied any wrongdoing. VENEZUELA 28 July: Venezuelan authorities launched a fresh crackdown after tens of thousands of people took to the streets following the announcement that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had won re-election with 51% of the vote. Western countries including the US said the official results were not credible and recognised opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez \u2013 who replaced the popular Mar\u00eda Corina Machado on the ballot after she was banned from running \u2013 as the winner. Maduro, who took power in 2013 after the death of his mentor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, has presided over a spectacular economic collapse; despite owning the world\u2019s largest oil reserves Venezuela\u2019s economy shrank by 80% in the eight years to 2022. BURKINA FASO Were scheduled for July: Elections scheduled for this year have been postponed for five years by the junta that seized power from the democratically-elected government two years ago. Since then security in the country has rapidly worsened as the government cracks down on Islamist militants, with both sides accused of the mass killings of civilians. Observers suggest junta leader Capt. Ibrahim Traor\u00e9\u2019s refusal to stick to a 24-month transition timetable set out by Ecowas in July 2022 suggests he intends to cling on to power. SYRIA 15 July: President Bashar Assad\u2019s ruling Ba\u2019ath party won a majority of seats in the 250-seat parliament on a turnout of 38%, further cementing his grip on power. The elections, the fourth since anti-government protests descended into a bloody civil war 13 years ago and which were criticised by the west as neither free nor fair, were expected to pave the way for a further extension of Assad\u2019s term. August KIRIBATI 14-19 August: In October, Taneti Maamau was re-elected as president of Kiribati for a third term. Maamau had retained his seat by a landslide in August parliamentary elections that were dominated by concerns about the cost of living, rising sea levels and relations with China. The votes took place against the backdrop of a long-running judicial and constitutional crisis, with limited legal services available and no court of appeal. September ALGERIA 7 September: President Abdulmadjid Tebboune won 95% of the vote in an election marred by allegations of fraud \u2013 and unexpectedly challenged by the president himself. The military-backed incumbent faced only two candidates: Hassani Cherif, a moderate Islamist, and Youcef Aouchiche, a moderate secularist, both of whom lodged an appeal with the constitutional court after the results were announced. In a surprise move, Tebboune\u2019s campaign issued a joint statement with his opponents rebuking the country\u2019s election authority for \u201cinaccuracies, contradictions, ambiguities and inconsistencies\u201d, legitimising questions about his win and aligning him with popular anger that his challengers had drummed up. JORDAN 10 September: Boosted by anger over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, Jordan\u2019s moderate Islamist opposition made significant gains in parliamentary elections, winning around a fifth of seats. The Islamist Action Front (IAF) also benefited from a new electoral law that encourages a bigger role for political parties in parliament, though tribal and pro-government factions will continue to dominate the assembly. Turnout was low at just 32%, indicating the country\u2019s apathy towards them. The country\u2019s parliamentary system is structured so that urban areas \u2013 Islamist and Palestinian strongholds \u2013 have far fewer MPs per voter than the countryside, whereas sparsely populated tribal and provincial cities which form a bedrock of support for the kingdom\u2019s Hashemite monarchy send the majority of deputies to parliament. SRI LANKA 21 September: Marxist leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake won presidential elections, in what was viewed as a widespread rejection of the old political elite who are blamed for the country\u2019s severe economic woes. He defeated the incumbent and six-time former PM, Ranil Wickremesinghe, who took office in 2022 at the peak of the financial crisis that followed the government\u2019s first-ever foreign debt default and months of punishing food, fuel and medicine shortages. It will be the first time Dissanayake\u2019s hardcore leftist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party \u2013 which led two rebellions in the 1970s and 80s that left more than 80,000 people dead \u2013 has sat in the presidential office. AUSTRIA 29 September: The anti-Islam, Kremlin-friendly Freedom party (FP\u00d6) scored its strongest result since its founding after the second world war by former Nazi functionaries and SS officers, winning just over 29% of the vote. The outcome surpassed expectations and beat the ruling centre-right People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP) by nearly three percentage points. Other parties however ruled out working with the party to form a coalition government, meaning weeks after the election the shape of the next government was still to be decided. October TUNISIA 6 October: Tunisia\u2019s president, Kais Saied, secured a second five-year term with a landslide victory, though in an election with a historically low turnout of 11% and after a campaign in which other candidates were jailed or banned from running for office. Observers saw the poll as a closing chapter in Tunisia\u2019s short-lived experiment with democracy. The country had previously prided itself on being the birthplace of the Arab spring uprisings. LITHUANIA 13 October, second round on 27 October: Lithuania\u2019s opposition Social Democratic Party (SD) won two rounds of parliamentary elections, initial results showed, putting it on course to lead a centre-left coalition in the Baltic country and replace the current coalition of centre-right parties led by prime minister Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117. If successful in forming a government SD leader Vilija Blinkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 is expected to maintain the country\u2019s hawkish stance against Russia and its massive defence spending. MOZAMBIQUE 9 October: Daniel Chapo and the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, or Frelimo, was on course to win presidential and parliamentary elections according to early results, even as his challenger, the independent Ven\u00e2ncio Mondlane, said the polls had been marred by fraud. The authoritarian Frelimo has ruled the country since independence in 1975. Mondlane\u2019s lawyer and a senior opposition party official were shot dead by unknown gunmen in the capital, Maputo, in the days after initial results were announced and protests led by Mondlane were violently dispersed by police. Full results are not expected until 24 October. MOLDOVA 20 October, second round on 3 November: Pro-western incumbent president Maia Sandu won a second term in office, marking a significant boost for the country\u2019s EU aspirations and a clear rebuke to Moscow. Sandu has made EU membership a cornerstone of her programme, but her position had been weakened after a referendum asking Moldovans whether they supported EU integration was passed by only the tiniest of margins on 20 October, the same day as the first round of presidential elections, despite opinions polls having indicated widespread support. Sandu, who accused Moscow of plotting a coup against her in 2023, blamed an \u201cunprecedented assault on our country\u2019s freedom and democracy\u201d by \u201cforeign forces\u201d for the narrow result. GEORGIA 26 October: Georgian Dream, led by prime minister Irakli Kobakhidze, retained power in a pivotal election that was immediately disputed by the opposition. Georgia\u2019s pro-EU president, Salome Zourabichvili, declared that she did not recognise the election results and asserted that the country had fallen victim to a \u201cRussian special operation\u201d. On paper, the ruling party wants to move closer to the west and is pursuing EU and Nato membership, with support from its overwhelmingly pro-western population. In reality however, Georgians fear that Russia is already taking over their country by stealth aided by their own government. Press freedom has been eroded in recent years and civil society activists say Georgian Dream is answerable just to one man, its billionaire founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili. JAPAN 27 October: Japan\u2019s ruling coalition lost its parliamentary majority amid anger over a party funding scandal and a cost of living crisis. As a result, the Liberal Democratic party (LDP), which has ruled the country almost uninterrupted since the 1950s, or the main opposition Constitutional Democratic party (CDP) may be forced into power-sharing agreements with other parties to form a government. The result also raises questions about the future of the recently installed prime minister and LDP leader, Shigeru Ishiba, who called the election only days after taking office on 1 October, aiming to bolster his position and that of his scandal-hit party. URUGUAY 27 October first round, with a runoff on 24 November: Centre-left opposition candidate Yamandu Orsi was well ahead of his conservative rival, Alvaro Delgado after a first round of voting, but failed to reach 50%, meaning a runoff will take place. Observers, noting the civility of the race between the two moderates, have said the elections should reinforce the view that Uruguay is one of the strongest democracies in the world. President Luis Lacalle Pou, who is barred from running again by the constitution, leaves office with an unusually high approval rating of 50% and the country has avoided the trends of bitter division and democratic erosion taking hold in other Latin American countries. UZBEKISTAN 27 October: The Central Asian nation held its first legislative polls since President Shavkat Mirziyoyev \u2013 who won a third term last year in what monitors said was a poll \u201clacking genuine competition\u201d \u2013 signed into law a mixed majority and proportional electoral system. However there is little opposition in a country where the media are tightly controlled and the government cracks down on any form of dissent. All candidates running in the election were nominated by the country\u2019s five registered parties, none of which oppose Mirziyoyev. BOTSWANA 30 October: The opposition coalition Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) won a parliamentary majority in a historic election that saw the ruling Botswana Democratic party (BDP) booted from office for the first time since independence from Britain in 1966. The UDC leader, lawyer Duma Boko, was sworn in as president and promised to diversify the economy away from its dependence on the international diamond market. The southern African country is regarded as one of Africa\u2019s most stable democracies and outgoing president Mokgweetsi Masisi conceded defeat, saying: \u201cWe got it wrong big time.\u201d November UNITED STATES 5 November: Donald Trump was elected the 47th president of the United States in a stunning political resurrection that sent shockwaves through America and around the world. The Republican, who defeated Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, is the first convicted criminal to win the White House as well as the oldest person ever elected to the office. The victory followed a campaign that saw Trump narrowly survive an assassination attempt and Harris replace President Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket just months before the election amid concerns about his age and health. Trump\u2019s win sparked fear and foreboding among his opponents: among other things he has opposed aid to Ukraine and praised authoritarian strongmen, taken a strongly pro-Israel stance in his first term at the expense of the Palestinians and others in the region, promised to begin a programme of mass deportation of immigrants, called the climate crisis a \u201choax\u201d, backed gun rights advocates, called the media the \u201cenemy\u201d and in his first term appointed the supreme court judges who ultimately overturned abortion rights. PALAU 5 November: Palau\u2019s president Surangel Whipps Jr was returned for a second term, defeating his brother-in-law Tommy Remengesau. Ahead of the election, voters said they were mostly concerned about the economy and a cost of living crisis. But outside Palau, the election symbolised a growing geopolitical tussle for influence between Washington and Beijing that is playing out across the Pacific. Palau is important to the US military amid tensions with China and is among a dozen diplomatic allies of Taiwan. SOMALILAND 13 November: Presidential elections in Somalia\u2019s breakaway region have been postponed for two years and the opposition has accused President Muse Bihi Abdi of trying to hold on to power longer than his five-year term. But opposition parties in January approved changes made to electoral law meant to improve transparency and previous elections have seen transitions of power between parties. ROMANIA Presidential elections first round on 24 November, second round on 8 December; parliamentary elections on 1 December: Local, parliamentary and presidential ballots taking place at a similar time make 2024 a crunch electoral year as support for the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR) climbs steadily. Polls suggest the anti-establishment, pro-Russian party, which emerged from nowhere in 2020 to score 9%, could take 19% of the vote in the parliamentary election, level with the Liberal party (PNL) \u2013 potentially depriving the centre-right party and the Social Democrats (PSD, forecast to win 30%), who have governed in coalition for the past 10 years, of an absolute majority. A PSD candidate, Nato deputy secretary-general Mircea Geoan\u0103, currently leads the presidential race, but AUR leader George Simion is a contender. NAMIBIA 27 November: Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, the ruling Swapo party\u2019s candidate, could become the southern African nation\u2019s first female president should she win elections planned for November. Swapo has won every previous presidential election since independence from South Africa in 1990 but its share of the vote has been declining. SOUTH SUDAN Were due in late 2024: President Salva Kiir \u2013 in power since before Africa\u2019s youngest nation voted for independence in 2011 \u2013 has repeatedly postponed general elections and in September announced they would be delayed once again, until 2026, citing a lack of preparedness. The fledgling nation where a five-year civil war that broke out in 2013 cost an estimated 400,000 lives and where three-quarters of the population depends on aid, has also been further strained by the civil war in neighbouring Sudan. International guarantors of the country\u2019s peace process criticised Kiir\u2019s decision, saying it showed the government\u2019s failure to implement a 2018 peace agreement. IRELAND 29 November: Polls show prime minister Simon Harris \u2013 who took over from Leo Varadkar in April \u2013 and his centre-right party Fine Gael and coalition partner Fianna F\u00e1il on track to win a fourth term. Although the country is suffering a chronic housing crisis and has yet to emerge from a cost-of-living crisis triggered by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the slide in euro-region interest rates and a November budget of tax cuts and spending increases have laid the ground for an election benefiting the parties in power. They have also profited from the collapse in support for the leftwing Irish republican party Sinn F\u00e9in over its flip-flopping policy on migration and a string of scandals over child safeguarding. MAURITIUS 30 November: The ruling Militant Socialist Movement (MSM), which has led the government since 2009, will be seeking to retain its parliamentary majority in one of Africa\u2019s most stable democracies. Victory would grant prime minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth, who took over from his father in 2017, a new five-year term. ROMANIA Presidential elections first round on 24 November, second round on 8 December; parliamentary elections on 1 December: Local, parliamentary and presidential ballots taking place at a similar time make 2024 a crunch electoral year as support for the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR) climbs steadily. Polls suggest the anti-establishment, pro-Russian party, which emerged from nowhere in 2020 to score 9%, could take 19% of the vote in the parliamentary election, level with the Liberal party (PNL) \u2013 potentially depriving the centre-right party and the Social Democrats (PSD, forecast to win 30%), who have governed in coalition for the past 10 years, of an absolute majority. A PSD candidate, Nato deputy secretary-general Mircea Geoan\u0103, currently leads the presidential race, but AUR leader George Simion is a contender. ICELAND 30 November: Prime minister Bjarni Benediktsson called for snap elections after the collapse of the governing coalition in October. Benediktsson said his centre-right Independence Party and its partners, the centrist Progressive Party and the Left Green Movement had disagreed over issues including immigration, energy policy and the economy. The government has been under pressure this year as volcanic eruptions forced thousands to leave their homes, while the economy is already facing high inflation and soaring interest rates. December GHANA 7 December: The west African country is undergoing its worst economic crisis in a generation, a subject set to dominate the campaign ahead of the vote to succeed President Nana Akufo-Addo. Vice-president Mahamadu Bawumia, a 60-year-old economist, will run for the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP), facing off against former president John Mahama. But his presidential prospects may be threatened by his role as the face of economic policy throughout the presidency of Akufo-Addo. GUINEA-BISSAU Expected December: No firm date has yet been set for this year\u2019s presidential election and candidates have not yet been announced but analysts suggest it could be a rematch between 2019\u2019s close-run match-up between President Umaro Sissoco Embalo and leader of the opposition PAIGC party Domingos Sim\u00f5es Pereira. The poll will take place in an atmosphere of political uncertainty \u2013 Embalo dissolved parliament in December, accusing the government of \u201cpassivity\u201d in the face of an attempted coup. GUINEA Expected in December: After a junta seized power from the country\u2019s first democratically elected president in 2021, it is hoped this year\u2019s planned legislative and presidential elections will be a step back on the road to democracy. Junta leader Col. Mamady Doumbouya has announced a constitutional referendum to take place this year and agreed an election roadmap with regional body Ecowas, but has failed to provide much transparency or a timeline.

            "date": "2024-11-10T06:00:09Z",
            "content": "About 50,000 government officials, policymakers, investors and campaigners will gather in Azerbaijan this week in the hope of answering a trillion-dollar question: how much money should go each year to helping developing countries cope with climate-related costs? The aim of the UN\u2019s Cop29 climate talks in Baku, which is being called the \u201cclimate finance Cop\u201d, is to establish a new annual climate financing target to replace the current $100bn pledge, set in 2009, which expires at the end of this year. There is one clear consensus already: the existing climate finance available to developing countries is nowhere near enough to withstand worsening climate impacts. The ambition is too low, and in 15 years the annual target has been met in full only once, in 2022. Campaigners have called for the governments of wealthier countries to contribute to a new collective quantified goal (NCQG) on climate finance. Forecasts of how much this will be vary but are typically $500bn to $1tn a year, or less than 1% of global GDP. Some estimates are as high as $5tn. \u201cSetting a more ambitious goal will be essential to helping vulnerable countries adopt clean energy and other low-carbon solutions and build resilience to worsening climate impacts,\u201d said the World Resources Institute. But who should pay? To date, the financial contributions that enable developing countries to pursue low-carbon growth and greater climate resilience have come from countries defined by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as \u201chigh income\u201d. The list includes the UK, US, Japan and Germany. But in the 30 years since it was created, countries including China, India and South Korea have dramatically increased their economic might \u2013 and their carbon emissions. It is likely that the talks will include calls to expand the list of countries contributing to climate financing. But even then the sums involved are too large for government spending budgets alone, according to delegates from many wealthy nations. Instead, the talks aim to reform global climate lending to encourage more private capital to play a part. In an open letter last month, Stephanie Pfeifer, the head of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, said many global investors were beginning to explore ways to unlock and mobilise capital. \u201cAn ambitious finance goal that includes private capital can encourage greater ambition in developing countries\u2019 targets [for helping to limit global warming] by building confidence in accessible funding for both mitigation and adaptation, with the latter being historically underfunded,\u201d she said. This approach is not without its critics. Climate and humanitarian NGOs have warned that loans, even on favourable term, place the financial burden of the climate crisis on already indebted developing nations, which bear the lowest responsibility for the climate crisis but face the greatest risks. These groups have called for polluting companies to pay their fair share. \u201cClimate finance is not about charity or generosity but responsibility and justice,\u201d according to Debbie Hillier, a policy lead at the humanitarian NGO Mercy Corps. \u201cIt is based firmly on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities \u2013 those who contributed most to the climate crisis must bear the brunt of the solution.\u201d To this end, a new Climate Finance Action Fund (CFAF) will be under consideration. It aims to draw on voluntary contributions from fossil-fuel-producing countries and companies to support developing nations\u2019 climate projects. For polluters who would rather not pay, campaigners are calling for climate taxes. Billionaires and fossil fuel giants are in the crosshairs of environmental NGO 350.org, which plans to hold them accountable for their outsize impact on the planet in a new campaign. The group argues that funds generated through taxing the ultra-rich could be used both for domestic policies and programmes to lower carbon emissions, and for international climate finance to ensure \u201cthose most responsible for the climate crisis contribute to its solution\u201d. This approach is likely to prove popular with the public. Oxfam is scheduled to publish a report suggesting that the majority of the British public support higher taxes on private jets and superyachts to help tackle the climate crisis. The survey, by YouGov, is also expected to show strong public support for increasing taxes on the wealthiest UK individuals to fund action, and hiking taxes on businesses in sectors that produce the most emissions. The key to whatever form climate finance takes will be accountability \u2013 a meaningful climate finance target will mean nothing if the annual goal is never reached."

            "content": "The chair of the Climate Change Authority, Matt Kean, has declared Australia must take \u201cstrong and decisive action\u201d to address the climate crisis despite Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House, arguing the world needs cheap renewable energy and the country can provide it. Kean, a former News South Wales Liberal treasurer and energy minister, told Guardian Australia there were \u201cenormous opportunities and benefits\u201d in taking action to cut greenhouse gas emissions, no matter who was US president. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what Trump will do, but climate change waits for no one and will spare no one and no country. That\u2019s why we will continue to need to act - to take strong and decisive action to address this great challenge of our times,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world still needs cheap renewable energy, and the products that come with that, and Australia is in a very strong position to meet the world\u2019s needs, and in doing so create huge jobs and prosperity for our country that we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d Kean said past evidence, including in Trump\u2019s first term as president, showed states, territories and the private sector would continue to act. \u201cI have no doubt that will continue to be the case,\u201d he said. His comments contrasted with those from the Nationals MP Keith Pitt and Senate colleague Matt Canavan, who argued the federal Coalition should dump its commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 after Trump\u2019s re-election. \u201cWe need to consider our policies around net zero and their impact on the cost of living for every Australian and adopt policy that the Australian people can actually afford,\u201d Pitt told Guardian Australia on Thursday. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email He said Trump\u2019s decisive victory provided clear guidance on the best way forward on climate change and other issues. \u201cClearly president-elect Trump took bold positions on a number of policies and was successful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be in a contest with an Albanese government, which, in my view, went too far, too fast and at too high a cost to the people on their climate policies and, if we want there to be a contest at the next election, we will need to have a policy position that is sufficiently different.\u201d He said any decision on a policy rethink would be \u201cup to the shadow cabinet\u201d. But a spokesperson for the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, told Guardian Australia on Thursday that the policy on net zero stands. \u201cThere\u2019s no change in our position,\u201d the spokesperson said. Earlier on Thursday, the Coalition\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, emphasised the importance of sticking to the net zero objective. \u201cI want to see Australia stay committed to net zero by 2050,\u201d he told ABC Radio National. \u201cI don\u2019t anticipate any change in those commitments.\u201d Anthony Albanese also recommitted to the government\u2019s existing policies despite Trump\u2019s stated intention to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. \u201cEven if you were a climate sceptic and didn\u2019t believe any of the science and didn\u2019t notice that there were more floods and more bushfires and more cyclones \u2013 it would still be good policy because it will produce the cheapest form of energy, not the most expensive, which we know as nuclear,\u201d the prime minister said on Thursday. But he declined to commit to a 2035 emissions reduction target before the next federal election, saying the government was focused on 2030. The Climate Change Authority is preparing advice to the government on a 2035 emissions reduction target, but it will not be ready until next year. Initial advice from the authority found a 65-75% cut below 2005 levels would be \u201cambitious, but could be achievable\u201d. The government is not keen to reactivate the climate debate in Australia because the effects of climate change continue to generate anxiety in the community and Albanese is pushing a message of optimism about the future. Along with pressing the importance of pursuing net zero, Birmingham also talked up the Coalition\u2019s nuclear energy policy, saying it was taking \u201chard and difficult policy positions and decisions to be able to achieve that\u201d and \u201cmoving into a space in the policy debate nobody has been game to go into before\u201d. \u201cBut doing so because we see it as necessary if you are to be credible in achieving net zero whilst protecting Australia\u2019s industrial base in the future.\u201d Birmingham\u2019s comments came after Canavan took to the social media site X early on Thursday to condemn the net zero goal. \u201cThe re-election of Trump means that we can all say what we think again,\u201d he wrote. In a subsequent post he said Australians should \u201cstop whining\u201d about possible tariffs like \u201csome kind of hopeless basket case\u201d and \u201ctake charge of our own destiny for a change\u201d. \u201cWe should get out of the Paris climate agreement, dump net zero (which is dead anyway because of Trump) and unleash a New Age of Australian Energy Abundance,\u201d he posted. Canavan insisted Australia had all the natural resources to become \u201cthe richest country in the world\u201d without any other help and could also become a \u201cmanufacturing powerhouse\u201d. \u201cWe just need to dig up our coal, drill for our gas and use our uranium and we will have the cheapest energy prices in the world.\u201d The Climate Council chief executive, Amanda McKenzie, emphasised the need for Australia to stay the course on the clean energy transition. \u201cDuring his first presidency, Trump tried to withdraw the US from climate diplomacy, but state and local governments powered ahead,\u201d McKenzie said in a statement. \u201cCountries and US states know the Trump playbook \u2013 and they\u2019re determined to keep driving climate action forward.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-11T17:49:48Z",
            "content": "The US climate envoy John Podesta said the fight \u201cfor a cleaner, safer\u201d planet will not stop under a re-elected Donald Trump even if some progress is reversed, speaking at the Cop29 UN climate talks on Monday as they opened in Baku, Azerbaijan. \u201cAlthough under Donald Trump\u2019s leadership the US federal government placed climate-related actions on the back burner, efforts to prevent climate change remain a commitment in the US and will confidently continue,\u201d said Podesta, who is leading the Biden administration\u2019s delegation at the annual talks. Trump has pledged to deregulate the energy sector, allow the oil and gas industry to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d, and pull the US from the Paris climate agreement, which committed countries to taking steps to avoid the worst impacts of the crisis. Yet while Trump will try to reverse progress, \u201cthis is not the end of our fight for a cleaner, safer planet\u201d, Podesta said. Last week\u2019s re-election of Trump to the White House, which will see him inaugurated for a second term in January, has cast a shadow on the UN talks after the Republican defeated Kamala Harris. Harris had been expected to continue the climate policies of Joe Biden, who passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest down payment on the green transition seen in US history. Experts say Trump\u2019s second term could be even more destructive, as he will be aided by an amenably conservative judiciary and armed with detailed policy blueprints such as the Project 2025 document published by the rightwing Heritage Foundation. Trump\u2019s incoming administration is already reportedly drawing up executive orders to erase climate policies and open up protected land for ramped-up oil and gas production. \u201cWe have more liquid gold than any country in the world,\u201d the president-elect said on Wednesday. Staff at the US Environmental Protection Agency, which was targeted the last time Trump was president, are already bracing for a mass exodus. Swaths of work done by the EPA under Biden, such as pollution rules for cars and power plants, as well as efforts to protect vulnerable communities living near industrial activity, are set to be reversed. A June analysis warned that Trump\u2019s forthcoming rollbacks could add 4bn additional metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere by 2030 when compared with a continuation of Biden\u2019s policies. That \u201cwould be a death sentence to our planet\u201d, said Jamie Minden, the 21-year-old acting executive director of Zero Hour, the US-based youth-led climate non-profit, at a press conference about the election result in Baku on Monday. Trump\u2019s looming presidency could also place a damper on other countries\u2019 climate action plans, said Todd Stern, who was the US special envoy for climate change and the United States\u2019 chief negotiator at the 2015 Paris climate agreement \u2013 especially China, which is currently the top global contributor to planet-warming emissions. \u201cThe two biggest players in the ring are the US and China, and China is extremely aware of that. It has just got a guarantee that the US president won\u2019t be bringing up climate change with them for the next four years and that means something,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will make things easier on China and that can\u2019t help but have some impact.\u201d Yet \u201cthe fight is bigger than one election, one political cycle in one country,\u201d said Podesta. The UN climate conference in Baku represented a \u201ccritical opportunity to cement our progress\u201d, he said. At Cop29, activists are pushing the Biden administration to file a bold climate plan under the Paris climate agreement \u2013 known as a nationally determined contribution \u2013 and to make big pledges to support global climate finance efforts. And the president \u201cstill has critical opportunities to cement his climate legacy\u201d on the domestic level as well, said Allie Rosenbluth, co-manager of the climate NGO Oil Change International, including by rejecting pending permits for fossil fuel projects. At least $1tn is needed to help poor countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, shift to a low-carbon economy and adapt to the impacts of climate disasters. If the US fails to meaningfully contribute, other countries can also fill the climate finance gap left by the US, noted Teresa Anderson, the global climate justice lead at the climate non-profit ActionAid, at another Monday press conference. \u201cThis is a test for rich countries,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they believe in the climate emergency then they should be willing to pay more than their fair share, not less.\u201d The US senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a climate hawk who will arrive at Cop29 later this week, said Trump and other US Republicans were \u201caiming a torpedo\u201d at climate progress, but that the pressure to slash US emissions would stay strong. \u201cI\u2019m heading to Baku to reassure the international community that large swaths of the US remain committed to steering the planet away from climate catastrophe, a catastrophe that is already doing massive economic harm and driving up prices for insurance, food, and other goods and services,\u201d he wrote in an email. Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, noted that the Paris agreement had 195 signatories and \u201cwill not collapse in the face of a single election result\u201d. \u201cThe Paris agreement has survived one Trump presidency and it will survive another,\u201d she said."

            "content": "In Spain, more than 200 people have been killed after the deadliest floods in the country\u2019s modern history. Australia is heating faster than the global average, meaning more extreme heat events, longer fire seasons, increasingly intense heavy rain and sea level rise. And globally, this year is highly likely to be the hottest on record, beating the current title holder, 2023. For some, this escalating scientific evidence can be alarming. But the person in charge of Australia\u2019s response to the climate crisis says that is not a word he would choose. \u201cIf alarm implies concern, sure. But alarm implying surprise? No,\u201d says Chris Bowen, the country\u2019s climate change and energy minister. \u201cWe\u2019re living climate change. What we\u2019re now trying to do is avoid the worst of it,\u201d Bowen says. \u201cReport after report, temperature records tumbling, natural disasters increasingly unnatural \u2013 that\u2019s why we keep going. That\u2019s what drives me. It gets me out of bed every day. So perhaps alarmed is the wrong word. Disturbed, maybe. But, you know, not surprised.\u201d Bowen is speaking to Guardian Australia shortly before a US presidential election where polls indicate a 50-50 chance voters will elect a candidate who calls climate change a \u201choax\u201d and who would lead an administration intent on gutting clean energy and science programs and again pulling the US out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Six days after the US election, thousands of delegates from nearly 200 countries will land in the Russia-aligned petrostate of Azerbaijan for Cop29, an annual UN climate summit. Bowen will be at the centre of that meeting, having been invited to help lead negotiations on what is considered its most important work \u2013 setting a new finance goal to help the developing world. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads The Australian government is also likely to learn if it will co-host the Cop31 summit with Pacific countries in 2026, an event that would bring tens of thousands of people to the country and increase scrutiny on its role as the world\u2019s third biggest fossil fuel exporter. But for now, all eyes are on the US. What will a Trump win mean? Speaking in his ministerial office in the Sydney CBD, Bowen acknowledges the election result will be seismic, and will shape the fortnight-long talks starting in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku on 11 November. Asked for his view on what a Donald Trump victory would mean, he is cautious but clear: the Albanese government and the Biden administration have been \u201cclosely aligned in policy and personal terms\u201d and \u201cobviously, having a United States administration with a very forward leaning climate policy is a good thing\u201d. He also gives three reasons why he believes a second Trump administration would be unlikely to live up to the former president\u2019s anti-climate rhetoric on the climate crisis. \u201cFirstly, they are the United States. So the state functions are very important. And perhaps unlike 2016, where the result came as a surprise, if it is a Trump administration people are doing more preparation for it,\u201d he says. \u201cSecondly, it\u2019s hard to legislate in the United States, but it\u2019s also hard to un-legislate. So the Inflation Reduction Act [which includes an extraordinary US$370bn in clean energy support] is the law of the land and will remain the law of the land unless it gets repealed, which will be very difficult to do. And thirdly, the private sector can help. In the United States, regardless of federal mandates, they know [climate action] is good business. \u201cWill the dynamics of Cop be different depending on who\u2019s president? Of course they will. But does the rest of the world just walk away if the United States president is Donald Trump? No.\u201d Within climate activist circles, there is an expectation that if Kamala Harris wins, she may quickly set a 2035 emissions reduction target and other countries may follow. If Trump wins, many countries, including Australia, are likely to delay and recalibrate before setting their 2035 commitments, which are due next year. Bowen says Labor will set a target based on \u201cwhat we think we can achieve and what our contribution should be under the science\u201d \u2013 and what others are doing. Initial advice from the Climate Change Authority found a target of up to a 75% cut below 2005 levels would be \u201cambitious, but could be achievable\u201d. According to a recent UN Environment Programme analysis, current national commitments would lead to only a 2.6% emissions reduction below 2019 levels by 2030. It is far short of what countries have agreed is necessary: a 43% reduction over that timeframe and a 60% cut by 2035. Bowen says he understands \u201cto a degree\u201d why this big discrepancy makes people cynical, but argues the summits are important, not least because they send a signal to governments and investors marshalling trillions of dollars. He says there was genuine progress last year, including a non-binding agreement the world should transition away from fossil fuels and triple renewable energy by 2030. \u201cWhat\u2019s the alternative? Not bother, not talk to other countries, not have targets?\u201d he says. \u201cIs it perfect? No, but it\u2019s what we\u2019ve got. I\u2019d be surprised if people who are concerned about climate activism argue we should not be active participants in the global conversation.\u201d Bowen will arrive in Baku, an historic oil town on the shores of the Caspian Sea, wearing three hats. The most important role is co-charing with the Egyptian environment minister, Yasmine Fouad, negotiations to create a new finance goal \u2013 known in UN lingo as a new collective quantified goal on climate finance, or NCQG \u2013 to help developing countries fight and limit climate catastrophe. It is meant to replace a US$100bn a year goal that was set more than a decade ago and that it is agreed is woefully insufficient. Bowen says their ability to wrangle a consensus on the issue \u2013 covering how much is needed, who pays and what sort of public, private and multilateral bank finance should be counted \u2013 will largely determine if the summit is seen as a success or failure. \u201cI probably should manage expectations, but \u2026 this is the finance Cop,\u201d Bowen says. \u201cSo getting an NCQG right is the key element.\u201d He is also chair of the negotiating bloc known as the umbrella group, which includes the US, UK, Canada and Japan, and will be representing Australia as it seeks to finalise whether it will host Cop31. Australia is favoured to win, but Turkey is also in the running and the decision-making process is opaque. The bid has been mostly warmly received by clean energy and climate advocates and business groups, but some critics say Australia should not be rewarded with summit hosting rights while it is still allowing large new coal and gas developments. This is the conflict in the Australian government\u2019s climate position. At home, it has a program to underwrite enough renewable energy to generate 82% of the country\u2019s electricity by 2030 and has legislated policies to drive a shift to cleaner cars and that promises to start to deal with pollution at large industrial sites. It is also attempting to argue against a Coalition nuclear energy proposal that many experts say would in reality boost fossil fuel power over the next two decades. But it also has no plan to limit coal and gas developments for export. In September the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, approved the expansion of three thermal coalmines that could lead to more than 1.5bn tonnes of CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere. Asked if the government\u2019s mixed messages \u2013 action at home, but unlimited shipments of fossil fuels to burn overseas \u2013 undermines its credibility and risks making people disengage on climate, Bowen responds that the Greens\u2019 argument for no new coal and gas is a \u201cneat, politically effective slogan\u201d, but that \u201clife is nowhere near that simple\u201d. \u201cThe idea that we can just say we\u2019re going to stop approving new coal, which means we stop exporting coal in due course, that is not the way you get this job done,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a drug dealer\u2019s defence\u2019. Well, ok \u2026 But the reality is that other countries will continue to export coal, and we need to think about our place in the world. \u201cI agree with this entirely: the biggest impact [on climate] we can have is on our exports. Hence, the need to become a renewable energy superpower.\u201d He points to an ambitious $30bn-plus SunCable plan to export solar energy from the Northern Territory to Singapore via subsea cable. Bowen was in the city state last month for the announcement the project had received conditional approval. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look holistically,\u201d he says. \u201cYes, our exports are important, but replacing our current fossil fuel exports with renewable exports is the key to it. Not just focusing on the negative \u2013 that we should be stopping fossil fuel exports. \u201cWe should be replacing fossil exports with renewable energy. And that is a big task, which is going to take a little while.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-03T23:31:00Z",
            "content": "Support for nuclear power is likely to evaporate once Australians face a clear choice at the next election and realise the Coalition\u2019s policy would mean relying more on old coal plants and increased risk of blackouts, Chris Bowen says. The climate change and energy minister said that while some polling had suggested some voters were open to nuclear plants being allowed in Australia surveys had also consistently found they preferred renewable energy. \u201cEvery bit of research I\u2019ve seen, public and private, says that when shown details and given a choice between nuclear and other forms of energy, nuclear fares very, very badly,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at the popularity of different forms of energy, it\u2019s solar, wind, gas, daylight, coal, nuclear, in that order, every single time.\u201d The Coalition has named seven sites where it says it would eventually replace coal-fired power plants with nuclear plants but not how much this would cost. Multiple energy analysts argue nuclear energy would be more expensive than other options and a nuclear industry would not be possible in Australia until after 2040. The bulk of the country\u2019s coal plants are scheduled to close in the 2030s. The opposition has suggested it would limit the rollout of large-scale renewable energy \u2013 it has criticised Labor\u2019s goal of 82% renewable energy by 2030 \u2013 and bridge the gap by keeping ageing coal plants running longer and using more gas-fired power. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email It has not yet said what type of gas plants this means. With nuclear banned, gas is the most expensive form of electricity in the national electricity market and it use is largely restricted to \u201cpeaking\u201d power turned on only when needed. It provided less than 3% of electricity in the national grid over the past month. The chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, Claire Savage, told a parliamentary inquiry she did not believe that nuclear plants could be built in enough time to cover the closure of coal-fired power plants. More than a quarter of the coal power capacity in the national grid was offline on the day she gave evidence due to planned and unplanned outages. Polling on nuclear energy in Australia has produced varied results. A Lowy Institute poll in June found 61% strongly or somewhat supported its use alongside other sources of energy. A Guardian Essential poll was roughly split between people who considered it \u201can attempt to extend the life of gas and limit investment in large-scale renewables\u201d and those who said it was \u201cserious, and should be considered as a part of the nation\u2019s energy future\u201d. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Bowen said some Australians were open to nuclear energy but he was not concerned as there was a difference between people being open to it and agreeing to it. \u201cWhen you say to people, whether it\u2019s in a formal market research setting or a punter in the street setting, \u2018I don\u2019t object to nuclear, morally \u2026 but I object to it because it\u2019s so expensive, but probably even more importantly, because it takes so long, and we don\u2019t have time if we\u2019re going to wait the 20 to 30 years it would take, and that means more coal in the system and coal in the system longer, and even the Liberals aren\u2019t proposing to build new coal-fired power stations so they\u2019re just going to rely on these old ones longer, and that\u2019s blackouts\u2019 \u2013 then the support or openness evaporates.\u201d The Coalition\u2019s climate change and energy spokesperson, Ted O\u2019Brien, has promised more details of the opposition\u2019s proposal before the end of the year. He has rejected claims there would be a risk of an electricity shortage under its plan and said government and clean energy industry analysis of how much it would cost were inaccurate as they were not based on its full policy."

            "content": "North Korea\u2019s UN envoy has said Pyongyang will accelerate a buildup of its nuclear weapons programme just days after it test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time this year at a moment of rising tensions with the west. Kim Song, North Korea\u2019s ambassador to the UN, said during a security council meeting on Monday that Pyongyang would accelerate the programme to \u201ccounter any threat presented by hostile nuclear weapons states\u201d. Early on Tuesday, South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the North had fired several short-range ballistic missiles toward the sea east of the Korean Peninsula. Japan\u2019s coast guard said the projectile wsa believed to be a ballistic missile, and broadcaster NHK reported it appeared to have landed outside Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone in the ocean. The security council meeting was convened to address Pyongyang\u2019s testing of an intercontinental ballistic missile on Thursday meant to demonstrate North Korea\u2019s growing prowess at developing missiles that could deliver more powerful nuclear warheads potentially to the mainland US. The US and Ukraine have warned that North Korea has nearly 8,000 soldiers stationed in the Kursk region of Russia who could go into combat in Ukraine in the coming days, and both countries have warned that those troops will become legitimate military targets if they take part in fighting. \u201cThe nuclear threat of United States against [North Korea] has already reached critical point in terms of its scale and danger,\u201d Kim said. \u201cDue to reckless moves of the United States, the potential situation is approaching the brink of war.\u201d During the meeting, the US accused China and Russia of \u201cshamelessly\u201d protecting Pyongyang at the UN from \u201ccloser scrutiny of its sanctions-violating activities\u201d, and said Pyongyang had been \u201cemboldened to continue advancing its unlawful ballistic missile, nuclear and WMD programmes\u201d. North Korea is believed to be seeking Russian missile and space technology as part of a deal to provide troops in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. But US officials have not said what they believe Vladimir Putin has provided to North Korea in exchange. \u201cRussia and China have shamelessly protected Pyongyang from any reprisal, or even condemnation of its actions,\u201d said Robert Wood, the deputy US ambassador to the UN. Putin greeted North Korea\u2019s foreign minister in a surprise meeting in the Kremlin after the US warnings about North Korean soldiers approaching Ukraine. Footage was broadcast showing Putin meeting Choe Son Hui, the North Korean envoy, with whom he shook hands for a full minute. The meeting took place on Russia\u2019s National Unity Day, a national holiday, and Choe said he brought \u201csincere, warm, comradely greetings\u201d from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. The meeting was not previously scheduled and may have been prompted by the warnings by the west about the North Korean troops preparing to fight. The US and South Korea announced a new memorandum of understanding to develop cooperation on civil nuclear energy, strengthening their \u201cadministration of export controls on civil nuclear technology\u201d, the US Department of Energy said in a statement. The department claimed that the announcement would help combat the climate crisis and protect critical supply chains, while \u201ccreating billions of dollars worth of new economic opportunities\u201d."

            "content": "Campaigners battling to save a much-loved community club in Manchester have declared victory after successfully removing the threat of eviction. The Carlton Club, in Whalley Range, is in a sprawling white building and is regarded as an important cultural asset for that part of the city. It is a community hub which is seen as much more than a place to meet friends and neighbours for a drink and a catch-up. Depending on when you go, it might have live music, arts events, yoga, gardening, fitness sessions, a book club, quizzes, backgammon, philosophy group meetings and more. The club opened in 1913, originally as a private gentlemen\u2019s club. In recent years, a community interest company (CIC) has run a startlingly busy and popular social calendar. Supporters say the CIC has transformed the club which, a decade ago, had 70 or 80 members, hardly any of them young. Today it has more than 1,000 members, spanning generations. The problem has been that the CIC does not own the building, which is called Rowan Lodge. The owner is the Carlton Social and Bowling Club Building Company Ltd, which was set up when the club opened in 1913. Its stated purpose is to provide a building for the club. Both the Carlton Social and Bowling Club CIC (the operators) and the Carlton Social and Bowling Club Building Company (the building owners) are run by local people. Earlier this year, the building company served an eviction notice on the CIC, saying it intended to run a new business from the premises. That prompted a vocal and well-supported Save Our Club campaign, which included the raising of \u00a338,000. Justin Anderson, the acting chair of the CIC, said the club was an irreplaceable community asset and they could not allow it to be destroyed. Three months on from launching the campaign, Anderson said they had succeeded in bringing about a boardroom shake-up of the building company, which meant the eviction notice had been stopped. \u201cIt\u2019s happened quickly and it\u2019s a lot to take in,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything we have done is lawful and in accordance with the building company\u2019s own articles. We have written to Companies House to inform them of our actions, which we believe are the start to righting historic wrongs and will ultimately put the club\u2019s ownership back where it should be \u2013 in the hands of the members.\u201d Anderson said it was \u201ca really exciting moment \u2026 and we can look forward to the future with confidence\u201d. The campaign had been supported by Sacha Lord, the night-time economy adviser to the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham. Lord said the club was one of the most \u201cperfect examples\u201d of how to serve the community. \u201cIt has a diverse offering that stems past being just a pub, just a club,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the beating heart of Whalley Range.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-26T17:32:30Z",
            "content": "Justin Trudeau has called an emergency meeting with provincial premiers across Canada after the US president-elect, Donald Trump, threatened a 25% tariff on the United States\u2019 northern neighbour. Trump posted on social media that he would \u201csign all necessary documents\u201d to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% tariff on all goods products coming into the United States, adding the levy would remain in place until \u201csuch time as drugs, in particular fentanyl, and all illegal aliens stop this invasion of our country!\u201d The Canadian prime minister said on Tuesday he had held a \u201cgood\u201d conversation with Trump shortly after the social media post, working to tamp down fears of an immense economic hit to Canada. He did not say if Canada would impose retaliatory tariffs, as it did during a previous round of trade hostilities during Trump\u2019s first presidency. \u201cWe talked about how the intense and effective connections between our two countries flow back and forth,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe talked about some of the challenges that we can work on together.\u201d Given the United States, Canada and Mexico renegotiated a trade pact in 2018 and have deeply intertwined supply chains, a levy of 25% would prove devastating to Canada\u2019s economy. The United States remains Canada\u2019s biggest trading partner, with nearly C$600bn in goods exported to the US last year. Canadian ministers reacted with measured skepticism over the key claims made by Trump on immigration and drug trafficking. While a small but growing number of migrants are using Canada as a way into the US, far more people enter through Mexico. Canada\u2019s immigration minister, Marc Miller, likened the 23,000 interceptions by US officials at the northern border last year to a \u201csignificant weekend at the Mexico border\u201d, where 1,530,523 \u201cencounters\u201d were recorded last year. When it comes to the movement of fentanyl across the continent, so little enters the US through its northern border that the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) does not even mention Canada in a report from 2020, instead citing Mexico, China and India. \u201cThe amount of fentanyl that crosses the US-Canadian border is basically homeopathic!\u201d wrote Toronto-based journalist John Michael McGrath on X, critiquing people who \u201csanewash\u201d Trump\u2019s demands. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a serious demand! You don\u2019t have to be stupid in public!\u201d But the rightwing premier of the oil-rich province of Alberta said Trump had valid concerns over illegal activities at the shared border. \u201cWe are calling on the federal government to work with the incoming administration to resolve these issues immediately, thereby avoiding any unnecessary tariffs on Canadian exports to the US,\u201d Danielle Smith said in a social media post. \u201cThe vast majority of Alberta\u2019s energy exports to the US are delivered through secure and safe pipelines which do not in any way contribute to these illegal activities at the border,\u201d said Smith, whose relations with Trudeau are icy. For Trudeau, the tariff saga is likely to revive bitter memories of the trade feud with the US during Trump\u2019s first term, when Canadian officials worked to minimize damage to the prized relationship with the US. At one point, Trump said he was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d with the negotiations, singling out Canada\u2019s chief negotiator, the then foreign minister Chrystia Freeland, who now serves as finance minister and deputy prime minister. The threat of Trump\u2019s tariffs pushed Canada\u2019s main stock exchange down on Tuesday and Candace Laing, the head of Canada\u2019s chamber of commerce, warned that \u201cbeing America\u2019s \u2018nice neighbour\u2019 won\u2019t get us anywhere\u201d in a sign of the potential shift in relations between the longtime allies. \u201cTo [Trump], it\u2019s about winners and losers \u2013 with Canada on the losing end,\u201d said Laing in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cCanada\u2019s signature approach needs to evolve: we must be prepared to take a couple of punches if we\u2019re going to stake out our position. It\u2019s time to trade \u2018sorry\u2019 for \u2018sorry, not sorry.\u2019\u201d Trevor Tombe, an economist who authored a report on the consequences of US tariffs on Canada\u2019s economy, warned a recession was likely if Trump followed through on the 25% tax. Canada\u2019s premiers have also warned a trade war would cause immense damage to their respective economies. Trudeau said provincial leaders will meet on Wednesday in an emergency meeting, calling for a \u201cTeam Canada\u201d approach. The Ontario premier, Doug Ford, who oversees Canada\u2019s largest provincial economy, called Trump\u2019s threats \u201cunfair\u201d and said it was \u201cinsulting\u201d to compare Canada to Mexico when it came to immigration and potent drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s like a family member stabbing you right in the heart,\u201d Ford told reporters Tuesday. He also warned that if the president makes good on his promise, Canada might have little choice: \u201cWe have to retaliate.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-24T14:58:36Z",
            "content": "Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, will meet his European counterparts in Geneva on Friday after the collapse of a deal last week under which Iran would have limited its uranium enrichment to 60% purity, just below the threshold to make nuclear weapons. The offer was regarded by Iran as a first step to rebuilding confidence between it and the west over what it insists is its civilian nuclear programme. There are growing fears that wider tensions in the Middle East could result in Tehran redoubling efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon and trying to declare it necessary for its national self-defence. The talks on Friday, for which the European side has low expectations, will end a two-year hiatus in which there have been no direct detailed talks on the lapsed nuclear deal. Representatives from the EU, France, Germany and the UK will attend, butChina, Russia and the US \u2013 the other original signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal \u2013 will not. It appears Iran is placing a greater store by the meeting than the European side. Late last week the EU, UK and US rejected an Iranian offer to cap enrichment at 60% purity, instead forcing through a motion at a regular meeting of the board of the UN nuclear inspectorate, the IAEA, that again censured Iran for failing to cooperate with the inspectorate in line with its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The motion required IAEA officials to prepare a comprehensive report within three months on Tehran\u2019s compliance with its obligations under the nuclear deal over the past five years. This report is regarded as the first step to a motion at the UN requiring the retention of all UN sanctions on Iran when the 2015 nuclear deal expires next October. The IAEA backed the censure motion by 19 votes to three, with 12 abstentions. Iran admits it has been steadily withdrawing its cooperation from the IAEA inspectorate since the 2018 decision by Donald Trump to pull the US out of the agreement. Iran had signed up to the original deal in 2015 monitoring its nuclear programme in return for the west lifting economic sanctions. On Saturday Iran responded to the IAEA censure motion by saying it was pressing ahead with its nuclear programme at a faster pace. The speaker of its parliament, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, confirmed on Sunday that Iran had activated new and advanced centrifuges in response to the IAEA vote. Iran said it would fire up about 5,000 new generation centrifuges and increase the enrichment capacity. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, accused European powers of trying to politicise the IAEA and its director general, Rafael Grossi, who had travelled to Iran before the board meeting. Araghchi suggested the diplomatic path with Europe had not reached a dead end, saying talks towards a revival of the nuclear deal could resume. He said a complete restoration of the 2015 deal was not on the cards, and instead he provided an outline pointing to a future agreement. Iran has previously voiced disappointment that Europe has not broken with the US and pressed ahead with lifting economic sanctions. It seems unlikely that even an outline deal could be reached before Trump\u2019s inauguration, even though substantial progress was made in talks between Europe and Iran in Vienna in 2022. Iranian cooperation with Russia in Ukraine, and its support for the so-called axis of resistance across the Middle East, also damages the efforts of any European diplomat that argues the nuclear file can be kept separate from Iran\u2019s wider destabilising behaviour. In a joint statement on Saturday, the UK France, Germany and the US welcomed the passage of the IAEA motion, adding that it noted with serious concern Iran\u2019s announcement that instead of responding to the resolution with cooperation, it planned further expansion of its nuclear programme \u201cin ways that have no credible peaceful rationale\u201d."

            "content": "Proposed cuts to England\u2019s most beautiful landscapes pose an \u201cexistential threat\u201d, the managers of the National Landscapes Association have warned. These 46 regions, including the Chilterns, the Cotswolds, the Wye Valley and the north Pennines, used to be known as areas of outstanding natural beauty but were renamed this year as \u201cnational landscapes\u201d. They cover 15% of England, including 20% of the coastline. However, those who run the parks have said the environment secretary, Steve Reed, has given no assurances about the budget for the national landscapes. The day-to-day spending budget of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) will be cut by 2% in the financial year 2025-26. It is understood this will be spread across departments, and the national landscapes teams have been told to expect a 12% cut. Sarah Gibson, the manager of the Tamar Valley national landscape, said: \u201cWe are being told we have to prepare for budget cuts. Funding for national landscapes is woefully inadequate. We are under significant pressure from degrading nature, development and decreasing funding. But we are charged with providing nature recovery.\u201d She said in an impossible situation, the valley was facing a 20% reduction in core services as a result of proposed budget cuts. This month, the national park chiefs warned that their areas were at risk of becoming \u201cpaper parks\u201d with no visitor centres or rangers, as Defra considered cutting budgets to unsustainable levels. National landscapes are even more at risk than national parks as they cover almost double the area and experience significantly higher levels of pressure from farming and development. The value of the landscape is equal in law and yet they receive 16% of the core funding of national parks and have experienced financial cuts of more than 40% since 2010. Gibson said: \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to accept these places can just carry on unprotected. It\u2019s really important to the communities that we look after these places. At the Tamar Valley we have 17 special species that we are safeguarding and doing more work to protect like the greater horseshoe bat, salmon, dormouse, marsh fritillary butterfly.\u201d John Watkins, the chief executive of the National Landscapes Association, said: \u201cGovernment has high expectations of National Landscapes as the backbone of nature recovery to meet its international commitments and legal targets. But the situation has never been more dire.\u201d The fragile ecosystems in these areas include degraded peatland, eroding coastlines and ancient woodlands, all of which require management and restoration as well as protection from overgrazing and development. National landscapes are at \u201ccrisis point\u201d, Watkins said, adding further cuts will mean reductions to core teams so there will not be sufficient staff to apply for external funding and nature restoration efforts will grind to a halt. Many landscapes\u2019 teams are in single figures, meaning cuts of this scale are existential. Watkins said: \u201cTwenty-five years ago, the New Labour government was advised by the Countryside Commission to increase funding for national landscapes to \u00a319m [\u00a335m in today\u2019s money], but they didn\u2019t heed that advice. Twenty-five years later, we are in the same situation with a new Labour government, but with the threat of further cuts in the face of a nature and climate crisis. We are calling on the government to truly invest in nature.\u201d The national landscapes managers are asking for a recommitment to current funding of \u00a335m a year for national landscapes partnerships. This includes funding for a scheme called farming in protected landscapes, which is under threat and crucial to these areas that are often overgrazed. This scheme offers help to farmers to transition to more nature-friendly ways of farming. They are also asking for additional investment of \u00a311m a year to rebuild national landscapes\u2019 capacity and position the association to help deliver the legally binding environment act targets that require the government to halt the decline of nature by 2030. A Defra spokesperson said: \u201cOur national landscapes, alongside national parks, play an important role and we will empower these special places to become greener, wilder and more accessible. We are currently considering the best approach and will work closely with the National Landscapes Association on this.\u201d"

The Swapo party could also be forced to contest a second round in the presidential election for the first time since the sparsely populated southern African country became independent from South Africa in 1990. High unemployment and younger generations with no memory of Swapo\u2019s fight against South Africa\u2019s apartheid regime have eroded the party\u2019s support, drawing parallels to elections earlier this year in neighbours South Africa, where the African National Congress lost its majority, and Botswana, where the party that had ruled since 1966 was trounced. However, Namibia\u2019s opposition is fragmented, with analysts noting that young people would very likely have to turn out in large numbers to counter Swapo\u2019s support base in the country\u2019s rural but densely-populated north. \u201cDespite the fact that Swapo has been a party in decline, if the 2019 elections are anything to go by, I think they will still remain a dominant party,\u201d said Rui Tyitende, a lecturer at the University of Namibia. \u201cBut if young people [under 35], who comprise 42% of the electorate, show up at the polls, I think there will be a [presidential election] runoff, because they will not vote for Swapo. They are disillusioned.\u201d In 2019, Hage Geingob, who died in February, won the presidency for a second term with 56% of the vote \u2013 a steep drop from the 87% he had secured in 2014. Swapo secured 65% of the parliamentary vote. Panduleni Itula came second in 2019 as an independent presidential candidate, with 29% of the vote. He is running again, against the country\u2019s vice-president, the former foreign minister Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah. Nandi-Ndaitwah, who would be Namibia\u2019s first female president if she wins Wednesday\u2019s vote, needs more than 50% to avoid a second round vote. \u201cShe comes across as a stateswoman, a seasoned diplomat, very knowledgeable in terms of public policy, and also \u2026 not tainted by corruption,\u201d the political analyst Rakkel Andreas said of the 72-year-old Swapo candidate. Itula, a former Swapo member who returned to Namibia in 2013 after studying and working as a dentist in the UK for more than three decades, is running for a new party, the Independent Patriots for Change (IPC). \u201cWhat Itula represents is change, hope for change,\u201d said Andreas, pointing to high unemployment levels \u2013 in 2023, 19.4% of Namibians were out of work, according to the World Bank, rising to 40% of 18- to 35-year-olds. Without opinion polls, the outcome of the election in the country of 3 million people is hard to predict, said Graham Hopwood, the executive director of the Institute for Public Policy Research, a Namibian thinktank. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that this is going to be the closest election since independence,\u201d he said. \u201cMy personal view is Swapo has been the dominant party since 1990 and will still be a dominant party after this election, but we\u2019re just not sure how dominant it will be.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-14T01:25:48Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s unemployment rate held steady last month as employers kept hiring at almost the pace of a swelling population. The jobless rate in October was 4.1% for a third consecutive month, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. The result was in line with economists\u2019 forecasts and matched a similar outcome for September. The economy added 9,700 full-time jobs and 6,200 part-time roles, making a net change of 15,900 positions. Economists had tipped employers would add a net 25,000 jobs in October. A slight drop in the participation rate from a record 67.2%, seasonally adjusted, reported for September to 67.1% last month helped to explain the unchanged jobless rate. The overall labour market remained relatively tight even as the number of unemployed rose 8,000, bringing the tally to 623,500, or 67,000 more than a year ago. The jobless rate, while up from the June 2023 low of 3.5%, remains well below the pre-Covid pandemic low of 5.2%, the ABS said. The data prompted NAB, one of the big four banks, to push back the timing of when it expects the Reserve Bank of Australia to start cutting interest rates from February to May. \u201cThere is a real risk that policy rates stay on hold even deeper into 2025 should the labour market remain tight and services inflation remain elevated,\u201d said Tapas Strickland, NAB head of markets economics. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The Reserve Bank has a dual mandate to keep inflation within its 2-3% target range but also to ensure the economy is as close to full employment as possible. The labour market has been surprisingly strong for most of 2024. Demand for labour has helped nudge real wages higher but has also left inflation in the service sector in particular more elevated than the RBA would prefer before it starts to cut its cash rate. Prior to Thursday\u2019s jobs data, investors were not fully pricing in an RBA interest rate cut until next August. The initial market reaction was modest, with the Australian dollar hovering just below 65 US cents and stocks holding on to their gains for the morning of about 0.5%. Still, there are signs of emerging weakness in the labour market, much as the central bank expects. The RBA\u2019s latest forecast has unemployment creeping up to 4.3% by year\u2019s end. BDO Economics partner Anders Magnusson said the strength of the labour market may make the RBA jobless estimate \u201can overestimate\u201d. \u201cThe RBA won\u2019t be pleased as a weakening to 4.2% [for October] would have indicated that the cash rate was adequately restrictive,\u201d Magnusson said. \u201cUnlike other advanced economies, Australia continues to maintain a strong labour market.\u201d Bjorn Jarvis, ABS head of labour statistics, said although employment grew in October, the 0.1% increase was the slowest growth in recent months. \u201cThis was lower than each of the previous six months, when employment rose by an average of 0.3% per month.\u201d The employment-to-population ratio remained at the historical high of 64.4%, he said. Sean Langcake, the head of macroeconomic forecasting for Oxford Economics Australia, said the \u201cvery strong run of growth in employment [had belied] the generally weak state of the economy\u201d and the labour market remained \u201cin a tight position\u201d. \u201cWe expect the market will slacken as we move into 2025, but the timing and magnitude of this easing remains highly uncertain,\u201d he said, noting that forward indicators for labour demand remained resilient. The ACT\u2019s jobless rate in October was the lowest of all states and territories, at 3.1%, down from 3.4% in September. The Northern Territory, with an October jobless rate now at 4.6%, up from 4.2%, was at the other end of the scale. New South Wales and Victoria, which together account for about half the economy and jobs, both saw the jobless rate tick a bit higher to 4% and 4.5%, respectively. Queensland saw its unemployment rate ease to 3.9% from 4.1% in September. Western Australia went the other way, with a notable jump to 4% from 3.6%. Elsewhere, South Australia\u2019s jobless rate also eased 0.1 percentage points to 4.2%, while Tasmania\u2019s rose by a similar margin to 4.1%."

            "content": "Grocery price inflation in the UK picked up in October, while supermarket sales hit their highest level so far this year, as shoppers started their Christmas shopping early, buying mince pies and Christmas cake. Grocery prices rose by 2.3% year-on-year, up from 2% in September \u201cbut still within typical levels,\u201d according to retail analysts Kantar. The rate has been below 3% every month since the early summer. The UK\u2019s jobs market has shown further signs of cooling after a rise in unemployment in September while pay growth slowed, as business leaders warned the budget could hit hiring demand and lead to higher prices. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the rate of unemployment rose to 4.3% in the three months to September, up from 4% the previous quarter, amid broader signs of a slowdown in the jobs market. While the ONS warned its jobs market figures should be treated with caution amid data collection issues, separate figures showed the number of employees on company payrolls fell by 9,000 over the quarter and vacancies fell for a 28th consecutive month to the lowest level since May 2021. Our other main stories today: Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Bye! \u2013 JK In a boost to UK life sciences, the Swiss drugmaker Sandoz has just opened a \u00a310m device development lab in Cambridge to work on pen injectors, autoinjectors, on-body devices, inhalers, nasal and ophthalmic sprays. The company, which specialises in generic drugs (cheap copies of drugs that have come off patent) and is the largest generic drugmaker in the world, employs 45 scientists at the site and is in the process of hiring 15 more by early next year, with more recruitment planned later in 2025. Its UK headquarters is in Camberley in Surrey, where around 170 people. The firm is also opening a \u00a3100m factory in Slovenia and is pursuing investments in Austria. Richard Saynor, the Sandoz chief executive, and Baroness Gillian Merron, health minister responsible for life sciences and innovation, have opened the device development centre in Cambridge. Merron said Biosimilar medicines and generic medicines deliver huge cost savings to the NHS and taxpayer, freeing up funds for frontline patient care. The Sandoz expansion is a vote of confidence in the UK\u2019s world-leading life sciences sector, boosting economic growth, delivering a raft of new, affordable treatments and improving the resilience of our supply chains. I\u2019ve just been on a media call with AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot. AstraZeneca\u2019s China president Leon Wang, who was detained last month by Chinese authorities, is in touch with a lawyer but the company has \u201cvery little information\u201d about the investigation, according to the drugmaker\u2019s chief executive. He spoke after the company released third-quarter results. \u201cWe are in the early stage and we don\u2019t have all the detailed information that will enable us to draw conclusions as it relates to what happened,\u201d said Soriot. \u201cIn fact we have very little information\u201d about Wang\u2019s case and the company has not been approached by the Chinese government about it, he added. Asked about oversight of its operations in China, Soriot said the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker had 18,000 employees in China. You really cannot police 18,000 people from headquarters. The company later clarified that it has just over 16,000 employees in China. Shell has won its appeal against a landmark climate judgment by a Dutch court, which in 2021 ordered the fossil fuel company to sharply reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. A court of appeal ruled on Tuesday that, while Shell does have a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to cut its emissions as a big oil company, this would not be achieved by imposing a specific legal goal. Shell had appealed against a lower court ruling in 2021 that it must cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels. It was the first such ruling against a company in the world. Shell\u2019s chief executive, Wael Sawan, welcomed the appeal decision, saying it was \u201cthe right one for the global energy transition, the Netherlands and our company\u201d. The oil cartel Opec has cut its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2024 and also lowered its projection for next year \u2013 its fourth consecutive downgrade. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said in its monthly report that world oil demand will rise by 1.82m barrels per day (bpd) this year, down from growth of 1.93m bpd it forecast last month. There is a wide range of forecasts for the strength of demand growth in 2024, partly due to differences over demand from China and the pace of the world\u2019s switch to cleaner fuels. Opec is still at the top end of industry estimates after the revision. The oil cartel also cut its global demand growth estimate for next year to 1.54m bpd, from 1.64 million bpd. The UK can strike a US trade deal with Donald Trump while also rebuilding EU relations after Brexit to cement its status as a \u201cbeacon of stability\u201d in an increasingly volatile world, a leading economist has said. Andy Haldane, the former Bank of England chief economist, said Keir Starmer\u2019s government could show the UK was \u201copen for business at a time when so much else of the world is looking inward \u2013 whether to the EU, or the US, it could really pay dividends\u201d. After Trump\u2019s election victory the prime minister has faced competing demands urging him to pick a side in trade talks with Washington and Brussels, just as he had begun a push to mend fences with Europe.However, Haldane suggested the UK government could have both with a trade policy straddling the Atlantic. \u201cI hope the government is in a position to really pat its head and rub its tummy at the moment,\u201d he told the Guardian. Of course we should pursue energetically an improved deal with the EU, although that won\u2019t be straightforward. The new government committed to that and should keep on committing to that. That should not, though, preclude \u2013 and does not preclude, as difficult as it will be \u2013 seeking out a free trade arrangement with the US under a new Trump presidency. Metro Bank has been fined nearly \u00a317m by the UK\u2019s financial watchdog for failings in its money-laundering controls over four years. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued the \u00a316.7m penalty after finding failures in monitoring 60m transactions over a four-year period that risked a \u201cgap being left in the defence against the criminal use of the financial system\u201d. Problems persisted despite being raised by junior employees three years before they were completely resolved, the regulator said. Metro said it accepted the FCA\u2019s findings and had since resolved the monitoring system failings and enhanced its processes. The challenger bank, which has 76 branches and 2.7 million customers, launched in the UK in 2010 as the first high street bank to open in more than 100 years. From June 2016, Metro automated the monitoring of customer transactions for potential financial crime. Shares in the Irish support services firm DCC jumped after the company laid out plans for a break-up of the business to focus on its energy division. DCC, which is headquartered in Dublin but listed on the FTSE 100 in London, hopes to capitalise on opportunities in energy transition such as biofuels, and announced plans to sell its healthcare division by 2025 and evaluate strategic options for its technology arm over the next two years. The shares soared by 17% and are now trading 13.3% higher. Donal Murphy, the chief executive, said: We are announcing decisive actions today to simplify our group, pursue our largest growth and returns opportunity and unlock substantial shareholder value, from positions of strength. This aligns with our philosophy of disciplined capital allocation. In the energy sector we are building a unique, multi-energy, sustainable business focused on supporting our customers with their energy transition. Our strategy will deliver strong profit growth, high returns and a significant reduction in our customers carbon emissions. Our healthcare and technology divisions have a long and successful heritage in DCC. They are high-quality businesses, led by strong, entrepreneurial management teams. Our actions are designed to ensure that these businesses and our people have the best opportunity to grow and progress. The finance boss of Vodafone has assured customers that they will not experience price rises as a result of its proposed merger with Three, which could be completed next year. Speaking to journalists after it published its half year results, Margherita Della Valle, chief financial officer at the telecoms company, said its pricing strategy would not change after the merger. The comments come after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said last week that the deal could be pro-competitive if the pair pledged to continue the roll-out of 5G and put in place some short-term price commitments. Della Valle said that the companies had made a decision to freeze all packages under 20 gigabytes for the next three years, if the deal goes ahead. She said: The merger is pro-competitive because we create a third scale operator that can compete with the big two (BT/EE and Virgin Media O2) already in the market. Going forward, there will be more competition because there will be a third scale network capable of competing with these two. The competition watchdog will now make its final decision on whether the merger can go ahead on 7 December, with the two companies expecting to complete the merger in early 2025 if given the green light. The enlarged group would serve about 27 million customers. Della Valle also said the merger would create between 8,000 and 12,000 jobs in the UK, with some of this offset by job cuts due to synergies of roles after the merger. The comments came as the London-listed company saw revenues hit \u20ac15.1bn (\u00a312.5bn) for the first half of the year, up 1.7% on last year\u2019s figure. This came despite revenues falling in Germany, its biggest market. AstraZeneca\u2019s chief executive has said that the drugmaker is taking investigations by Chinese authorities into its business in the country \u201cvery seriously\u201d and will \u201cfully co-operate\u201d with them. Authorities are thought to be investigating the importation of two AstraZeneca cancer treatments into China. Pascal Soriot\u2019s remarks came as Britain\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical company lifted its 2024 revenue and profit forecasts, and announced it was spending $3.5bn on research &amp; development and manufacturing of cancer and other drugs in the United States, in its biggest investment in at least a decade. The company\u2019s share price has fallen over the past fortnight, since it announced that its China president, Leon Wang, who was executive vice president for internatinal market, was standing back because he is under investigation by Chinese authorities. Alongside Wang, two former and two current executives have also been detained over allegations of illegally importing oncology medicines. AstraZeneca\u2019s China business is now being run by Michael Lai, the general manager. Chinese authorities are understood to be investigating the importation of AstraZeneca\u2019s cancer drug Imjudo, which has not been approved for sale in China, as well as shipments of Enhertu between Hong Kong and China. Enhertu is another cancer treatment that was first licensed in Hong Kong and then in China. The investigations concern the five individuals, and not the company itself. Soriot said: We take the matters in China very seriously. If requested we will fully cooperate with the authorities. We remain committed to delivering innovative life-changing medicines to patients in China. There has been a wider crackdown by Beijing on drugmakers and hospitals in recent years as part of an anti-corruption campaign, aimed at bringing rising medical spending under control. AstraZeneca reported a 21% rise in revenues to $13.6bn between July and September, catapulting pre-tax profit 24% higher to $1.8bn, stripping out currency moves. Here is our full story the UK job market: The UK\u2019s jobs market has shown further signs of cooling after a rise in unemployment in September while pay growth slowed. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the rate of unemployment rose to 4.3% in the three months to September, up from 4% the previous quarter. While the ONS warned its jobs market figures should be treated with caution amid data collection issues, there were broader signs of a slowdown from separate figures showing the number of employees on company payrolls fell by 9,000 over the quarter. Vacancies also fell for a 28th consecutive month to the lowest level since May 2021. The government has come under pressure from businesses after outlining tax increases in the budget, including a rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) that bosses have said could lead to job cuts. And here\u2019s some instant analysis from our outgoing economics editor Larry Elliott: For the past few years only cursory attention has been paid to the unemployment figures because the jobless rate has been low and there have been plenty of unfilled vacancies for those seeking work. But, thanks to a slowing economy and decisions made by Rachel Reeves in last month\u2019s budget, that could be about to change. For the next few months every release on the state of the labour market will be scrutinised to see what impact two announcements made by Reeves last month are having on jobs. Inevitably, the chancellor\u2019s decision to increase the national minimum wage by 6.7% and increase employer national insurance contributions will have some effect but it will take months to assess how big those effects will be. Grocery price inflation in the UK picked up in October, while supermarket sales hit their highest level so far this year, as shoppers started their Christmas shopping early, buying mince pies and Christmas cake. Grocery prices rose by 2.3% year-on-year, up from 2% in September \u201cbut still within typical levels,\u201d according to retail analysts Kantar. The rate has been below 3% every month since the early summer. Promotional activity by the grocers is helping to keep prices down. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: Spending on deals has been going up consistently for the past 18 months and it now makes up 28.6% of all sales. Offers are helping to lift branded sales especially. The growth gap between brands and own-label is the biggest it\u2019s been since February 2021, sitting at 4.9% and 2.7% apiece. Take-home sales at the big supermarket chains and other grocers increased by 2.3% over the four weeks to 3 November to reach \u00a311.6bn, making this the biggest sales month of the year so far. Christmas came early, with 14.4% of households picking up mince pies in October while 648,000 shoppers have already bought a Christmas cake. Halloween also boosted sales. McKevitt said: Many of us got into the spooky spirit last month, as 3.2m households bought at least one pumpkin. Confectionery spending also got a boost to \u00a3525m in October as sales of chocolates and sweets both went up, climbing by 13% and 7% each. Trips to the supermarket hit a four-year high at 480m, the highest since before the pandemic. Ocado topped the growth table, boosting its sales by 9.5% over the 12 weeks to 3 November, while the two largest supermarkets in Britain \u2013 Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 also outperformed the wider market. Asda continued to struggle, with sales down 5.5% while the Co-op\u2019s sales fell by 2.1%. Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, said: 2.8 million people \u2013 a near record number are locked out of work due to poor health. This is bad for people, bad for businesses and it\u2019s holding our economy back. That\u2019s why our Get Britain Working plan will bring forward the biggest reforms to employment support in a generation, backed by an additional \u00a3240m of investment. And while it\u2019s encouraging to see real pay growth this month, more needs to be done to improve living standards too. So, from April next year over three million of the lowest paid workers will benefit from our increase to the National Living Wage, delivering a \u00a31,400 a year pay rise for a full-time worker. Responding to the news that unemployment has risen to 4.3%, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said: Any rise in unemployment is concerning and many will be worried about the impact of the upcoming National Insurance hike on British jobs. Small businesses have been clobbered by years of Conservative economic vandalism and the government\u2019s jobs tax could now make it even harder to hire new staff and give out pay rises. Jobs and salaries could be in for yet another hit and that\u2019s just not fair. The new government should be supporting our small businesses, not placing more financial pressures on them. Ministers must change course, starting by exempting GPs and social care providers from the National Insurance hike. The job market figures come after the government set out tax increases in the budget, including a rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) which business leaders say could hit hiring and pay increases. Paul Daley at Capital Economics added: Even though the rise in pay growth in September will probably be followed by a bigger gain in October, as the new public sector pay deals start, the easing in private sector regular pay suggests that the Bank of England will continue to cut interest rates gradually. We continue to think the Bank will skip the December meeting and cut rates at the following February meeting. Public sector pay will probably jump again in October as the 5-6% pay deals agreed in recent months start to take effect\u2026 Most important for the Bank, was that private sector earnings excluding bonuses was stable at 4.8% in September. That left it exactly in line with the rate the Bank forecast last week. Gora Suri, an economist at PwC UK, said: The labour market continues to loosen, with vacancies dropping further, though still slightly above pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate also ticked up slightly to 4.3%. But wage growth is proving to be a little more persistent. Annual growth in employee\u2019s total earnings is up to 4.3%, reflecting the civil service one-off payments made in the summer. Despite a loosening labour market, nominal pay growth remains in excess of the circa 3% level that is considered to be consistent with the Bank\u2019s 2% inflation target. Real pay continues to grow given that inflationary pressures have fallen back at a faster pace than wage growth. Looking ahead, businesses are likely to face increasing cost pressures. Almost simultaneously, they have been hit with a trifecta of policy changes which raise their costs - an increase in employer NICs, a rise in the National Living Wage and the Employment Rights Bill. If businesses pass some of this onto workers, this could weigh on pay growth in the short to medium term. Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s said last week that the NIC rise would cost them \u00a3100m and \u00a3140m respectively as they warned they could pass these costs on in the form of higher prices, while Tesco faces a \u00a31bn increase in its national insurance bill this parliament. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Unemployment in the UK has gone up, while regular wage growth slowed to the lowest rate in more than two years, according to official figures. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% between July and September, up from 4% in the June to August quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics, which warned that the job market figures should be treated with caution due to data collection issues. Pay excluding bonuses climbed by 4.8% year-on-year, the lowest since June 2022. Including bonuses, wage growth picked up to 4.3% from 3.8%, although this was affected by one-off payments made to the civil service last summer. Liz McKeown, the ONS\u2019s director of economic statistics, said: Growth in pay excluding bonuses eased again this month to its lowest rate in over two years. Pay growth including bonuses increased, but for recent periods these figures have been affected by last year\u2019s one-off payments made to public sector workers. Job vacancies have fallen again, as they have been doing for more than two years now. However, the total still remains a little above where it was before the pandemic. The number of job vacancies fell to its lowest level since May 2021, down by by 35,000 on the quarter to 831,000 between August and October. The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.2806, the lowest since mid-August, after the figures were released. Paul Daley, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: Overall, there is little here to suggest the Bank of England needs to worry that the loosening in the labour market and the easing in underlying wage growth are coming to an end. Asian shares tumbled amid disappointment over Beijing\u2019s latest economic stimulus package, and as investors worried about president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policies. Meanwhile, bitcoin jumped to a new high of more than $89,000. The Shanghai market lost 1.3% while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng slid by 3%. The price of bitcoin, the world\u2019s best-known cryptocurrency, has more than doubled from $37,000 a year ago, as markets are expecting lighter regulation of crypto currencies under a Trump administration. Bitcoin touched $89,982 and is now trading around $89,300. The Agenda 11am GMT: Eurozone/Germany ZEW economic sentiment index"

The government has come under pressure from businesses after outlining tax increases in the budget, including a rise in the national minimum wage and employer national insurance contributions (NICs) that bosses have said could lead to job cuts. Trade groups said the latest figures showed the jobs market was slowing as companies braced for higher costs. \u201cMany firms are telling us they are being forced to raise prices, put recruitment and investment plans on hold and look for ways to reduce their costs,\u201d said Jane Gratton, the deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce. \u201cThere is a limit to how much additional cost they can absorb.\u201d Matthew Percival, of the CBI lobby group, said: \u201cThese figures come against a backdrop of rising concern about spiralling employment costs which are set to increase after last month\u2019s NICs rise, the employment rights bill and the latest increase in the national living wage.\u201d Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s last week said the tax rise would cost them \u00a3100m and \u00a3140m respectively as they said they could pass these costs on in the form of higher prices, while Tesco faces a \u00a31bn increase in its national insurance bill this parliament. However, other economists have said Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget could represent a downpayment to fix public services that would help grow the available pool of labour by supporting more people to find a job. Andy Haldane, the former chief economist at the Bank of England, told the Guardian the \u201cfixation on the extra taxes\u201d was unhealthy. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways. If you want to build the right business environment you require investment in [public services]\u2026 and that requires us to pay for those things,\u201d he said. According to the latest snapshot long-term youth unemployment remains at the highest level since the start of the Covid pandemic, while more than 9 million people are economically inactive, meaning they are neither in a job or looking for work. Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, said the government was prioritising supporting people to find work through a \u00a3240m investment plan, before a white paper on the issue expected within weeks. She added: \u201c2.8 million people \u2013 a near record number \u2013 are locked out of work due to poor health. This is bad for people, bad for businesses and it\u2019s holding our economy back. Highlighting a further slowdown in the jobs market, annual growth in employees\u2019 average regular earnings, excluding bonuses, in Great Britain eased to 4.8% in the three months to September, down from 4.9% in the three months to August. Economists said the figures were in line with Bank of England forecasts, and could encourage the central bank to maintain its path of interest rate cuts after reducing the cost of borrowing last week. However, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Huw Pill, said the latest figures showed that inflationary pressures remained too high for comfort. \u201cPay growth remains quite sticky at elevated levels and levels that \u2013 given the outlook for productivity growth in the UK \u2013 are hard to reconcile with the UK inflation target,\u201d Pill said at a conference organised by the Swiss bank UBS. The rate of pay growth remains significantly above inflation, which dropped to 1.7% in September, helping households to rebuild their finances after the biggest hit to living standards in decades. Pay growth including bonuses also rose from 3.8% to 4.3%, although this was largely due to one-off civil service payments."

            "date": "2024-11-08T06:00:03Z",
            "content": "Artificial intelligence could displace between 1m and 3m private sector jobs in the UK, though the ultimate rise in unemployment will be in the low hundreds of thousands as growth in the technology also creates new roles, according to Tony Blair\u2019s thinktank. Between 60,000 and 275,000 jobs will be displaced every year over a couple of decades at the peak of the disruption, estimates from the Tony Blair Institute (TBI) suggest. It described the figure as \u201crelatively modest\u201d given the average number of job losses in the UK has run at about 450,000 a year over the past decade. More than 33 million people are employed in the UK. AI, a technology that can be loosely defined as computer systems performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, has shot up the political agenda after the emergence of the ChatGPT chatbot and other breakthroughs in the field. TBI added that it did not expect the scale of the displacement to be reflected in long-term job losses. It predicted total losses to be in the low hundreds of thousands at its peak at the end of the next decade as AI creates new demand for workers and pulls them back into the economy. \u201cOur best guess is that AI\u2019s peak, impact on unemployment is likely to be in the low hundreds of thousands and for the effect to unwind over time,\u201d said the report, titled the Impact of AI on the Labour Market. \u201cA common lesson is that AI is likely to increase the dynamism of the labour market by prompting more workers to leave existing jobs and start new ones.\u201d Such a process will require an \u201cupgrade\u201d to the UK\u2019s labour market infrastructure, TBI said, which could include an early warning system flagging how a worker\u2019s job could be affected by AI. The report estimated that deployment of AI could raise GDP \u2013 a measure of economic growth \u2013 by up to 1% over the next five years, rising to up to 6% by 2035. Unemployment, meanwhile, could rise by 180,000 by 2030. Currently, there are about 1.4 million unemployed people in the UK. However, TBI, which has described AI as a \u201csubstantial policy challenge\u201d, said all of these scenarios are dependent on factors such as what tools emerge over the next decade, investment decisions made by private firms and government policies that accelerate or delay implementation. The thinktank said AI would \u201ccertainly\u201d replace some jobs but could create more by boosting workers\u2019 productivty, which would increase economic growth and create more job openings. It could also follow the pattern of previous technological breakthroughs by creating products and sectors that require workers to perform new tasks and roles. TBI indicated that administrative and secretarial jobs will be the most exposed to the technology, followed by sales and customer service, and banking and finance. Those jobs will produce the greatest time savings from deploying AI, the report said. TBI said most of the efficiencies are likely to come from products that perform cognitive tasks \u2013 such as chatbots \u2013 rather than AI-enabled hardware such as robots that carry out physical work. Thus sectors that involve complex manual work such as construction are likely to be less exposed, it said. However, jobs involving routine cognitive tasks such as secretarial work are more likely to be affected as well as industries that generate large amounts of data, such as banking and finance, which can train AI models more easily. TBI said it expected unemployment to rise initially as some companies take advantage of time savings from AI \u2013 the report estimates almost a quarter of the time private sector workers spend on their jobs could be saved \u2013 by letting staff go."

But she fails to question the basic premise of the remembrance industry \u2013 namely that the military in particular, and even more particularly \u201cour\u201d military, deserve more consideration than do other victims of war. For a very long time now, most victims in most wars have been civilians. The military \u2013 on all sides \u2013 are not unique in their suffering; but they are unique in being the ones causing the suffering. A sincere mourning of the dead of past conflicts has to include a commitment to renounce any future warfare. When pacifists say \u201cNever again\u201d, we mean it. The hypocrisy of senior politicians\u2019 and military chiefs\u2019 crocodile tears at the Cenotaph on Sunday, when they\u2019ll be back in their offices the next day planning the next war, is sickening. I will attend the PPU\u2019s alternative (anti-militarist) remembrance ceremony at noon on Sunday, in London\u2019s Tavistock Square. Albert Beale King\u2019s Cross, London \u2022 Quakers have been wearing white poppies as a symbol of remembrance and peace since they were first produced in 1933. Today, some Quakers wear a white poppy, some red, some both and some none. The red poppy fever that Samira Shackle identifies highlights a dangerous trend of narrow nationalism, where one group of people, fanned by tabloid newspapers, seeks to define what makes us British. There were 16,000 British conscientious objectors to the first world war, and more than 65,000 in the second (mapped on a new Quaker database). Not all soldiers fight on the battlefield \u2013 there is no one way to belong. Britons who dissent are still British. The carpet of red poppies hides another trend: the militarisation of our society, where our instinct is to arm for war, rather than building for peace. True peace comes only with true human security; our security cannot be isolated from the security of others. At this time of conflict, it\u2019s ever more important to do the painstaking work of building peace. That way when we pin our poppies, of whatever colour, to our lapels and say \u201cNever again\u201d, these are more than just empty words. Paul Parker Recording clerk, Quakers in Britain \u2022 The question of whether poppy mania has gone too far has become an annual debate. The answer is: probably, as not wearing one might be a sackable offence in the various TV newsrooms. See also the endless last posts at football matches. These should be reserved for Armistice Day, not trotted out ad nauseam like I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday. Sanctimonious humbug aside, I\u2019m allergic to the colour red. So I wear a white poppy. Max Bell Thame, Oxfordshire \u2022 I used to wear a white poppy for peace \u2013 alongside a red poppy, so that I didn\u2019t get assaulted for wearing the white one! Brian Penney Heysham, Lancashire \u2022 Will our Friends of Israel MPs still insist on wearing poppies if they realise the poppy is Palestine\u2019s national flower? It represents Palestine\u2019s collective memory of loss, suffering and resilience and an unbreakable bond with the land. Mary Adams London \u2022 In The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club by Dorothy L Sayers, Lord Peter Whimsey is able to date the murder of Gen Fentiman to 10 November and not, as first thought, Armistice Day, as the general was not wearing a poppy, which, of course, he would have been on 11 November. If, in 1921, a patriotic soldier who had fought in the Great War wore his poppy on, and only on, 11 November, perhaps our public figures could do the same a hundred years later without being bullied and shamed.

            "title": "Israel\u2019s ceasefire with Lebanon makes peace in Gaza ever less likely",
            "date": "2024-11-27T18:51:27Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden has revived diplomatic efforts to achieve a truce in Gaza with the hope of building on momentum generated by the newly agreed ceasefire in Lebanon. There are doubts, however, that such momentum exists outside the Biden administration, which is anxious to use its last few weeks to salvage scraps of diplomatic honour after the bloody past 14 months in the Middle East. The national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Wednesday that the president had ordered his envoys to contact Turkey, Qatar, Egypt \u201cand other actors in the region\u201d to restart regional talks on Gaza, 18 days after Qatar publicly withdrew from its mediating role on the grounds that neither Israel nor Hamas were serious about reaching an agreement. There is no evidence that either side has changed their positions as a result of the Lebanon deal. On the contrary, the ceasefire in Lebanon arguably makes it less likely that an agreement can be struck in Gaza \u2013 where the estimated death toll has now passed 44,000 \u2013 for domestic political reasons in Israel. The hard right hawks who resisted a truce on the northern border are likely to double down on their insistence of \u201ctotal victory\u201d in Gaza. On Tuesday, an Israeli airstrike killed at least 13 Palestinians and wounded dozens among families who had been sheltering in a school in Gaza City, and seven more were killed by the bombing of a nearby house in the same district. For now, Gaza\u2019s agony seems doomed to continue. Hamas said on Wednesday it was ready for a deal based on terms previously agreed, which it listed as an Israeli withdrawal, the return of displaced people to northern Gaza and an exchange of Palestinian detainees for Hamas-held Israeli hostages. Benjamin Netanyahu has previously blocked progress towards a hostages-for-peace deal with his insistence that Israeli forces maintain control over the \u201cPhiladelphi Corridor\u201d, a buffer zone inside the Gaza-Egyptian border. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) meanwhile appear focused on emptying northern Gaza of its Palestinian population, amid growing suspicions that Netanyahu\u2019s hard-right government intends to occupy the territory permanently. The Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said earlier this week that Israel should occupy the Gaza Strip and halve its Palestinian population through the \u201cencouragement of voluntary emigration\u201d. \u201cWe can and must conquer the Gaza Strip. We should not be afraid of that word,\u201d Smotrich said at an event on Monday night. At about the same time, the agriculture minister, Avi Dichter, was telling a group of foreign correspondents that the coalition remained focused on a \u201cdecisive victory\u201d in Gaza. \u201cAre we at the beginning of the end? Definitely not. We still have a lot to do,\u201d Dichter said, according to Reuters. That is the key difference between a ceasefire in Lebanon and one in Gaza: the Israeli far right represented in the governing coalition has annexationist plans for Gaza, which it does not have in Lebanon. The security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, criticised the Lebanese ceasefire, but the right was not prepared to bring down the coalition over it. It has, however, credibly threatened to topple Netanyahu if there is a ceasefire deal with Hamas. The prime minister has every reason to believe his coalition partners on this. He has promised them \u201ctotal victory\u201d and having reached a compromise in Lebanon against their wishes, he has even less leeway in Gaza. It would be hard to keep the current coalition together in the face of television pictures of released Palestinian detainees flashing victory signs, or of Mohammed Sinwar (brother of Yahya, the late Hamas leader) emerging from the Gaza rubble celebrating the group\u2019s survival. For the remaining leadership of Hamas, the ability to demonstrate proof of life, showing that the movement has survived 14 months of a war Hamas started, is a bottom line in any ceasefire talks. They have nothing else to lose. Netanyahu has, meanwhile, become increasingly reliant on his status as a wartime leader to keep prosecutions on various corruption charges at bay. His legal team has requested a delay in his appearance on the defendant\u2019s stand scheduled for next Monday, on the grounds that he is too busy leading the war effort. Netanyahu faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust across three separate cases, and needs to stay in office to have the best chance of staying out of jail. A continuing state of war is his best argument against early elections before this Knesset\u2019s term ends in October 2026, and without a war in Lebanon, he depends even more on continuing war in Gaza. At the same time, the truce in the north frees up soldiers and munitions for use in the already devastated coastal strip. There are two developments on the horizon that could break this remorseless logic. One is the prospect of a bigger war. The first justification Netanyahu presented for the Lebanon ceasefire was \u201cto focus on the Iranian threat\u201d, but he refused to clarify what that meant. Netanyahu has made clear over his many years in office that he sees Iran\u2019s nuclear programme as an existential threat to Israel, and he wants his legacy to be that of the leader who neutralised this threat. That would spark a conflict that would obviate the need for the Gaza war to provide his martial credentials and his alibi for skipping court dates. The second critical development is the looming restoration of Donald Trump, who has made it clear to Netanyahu that he wants the fighting to be over by the time he returns to the Oval Office on 20 January. That demand puts Netanyahu in a potential dilemma, forced to choose between his most important patron on the world stage and his coalition partners. It is a dilemma that Netanyahu will try to escape in the weeks to come. One way out for him could be to step up the merciless barrage on Gaza to appease the far right, so that the peace he offers Trump is the silence of the cemetery."

            "date": "2024-11-28T19:33:01Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s plan to tap the retired US lieutenant general Keith Kellogg as US envoy to Ukraine and Russia has triggered renewed interest in a policy document he co-authored that proposes ending the war by withdrawing weapons from Ukraine if it doesn\u2019t enter peace talks \u2013 and giving even more weapons to Ukraine if Russia doesn\u2019t do the same. Trump is said to have responded favorably to the plan \u2013 America First, Russia &amp; Ukraine \u2013 which was presented to him in April and was written by Kellogg and the former CIA analyst Fred Fleitz, who both served as chiefs of staff in Trump\u2019s national security council from 2017 to 2021. The document proposes halting further US weapons deliveries to Kyiv if it does not enter peace talks with Moscow, while simultaneously warning Moscow that, should it refuse to negotiate, US support for Ukraine would increase. It blames \u201cunserious and incoherent\u201d US foreign policy under Joe Biden for the three-year conflict, including what it describes as a \u201cprecipitous\u201d US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the supposed antagonization of US allies including Israel and Saudi Arabia, and a policy to China described as \u201cweak and confusing\u201d. The paper further accuses the Biden administration of putting \u201cthe idealistic agendas of the global elite ahead of a working relationship with Russia\u201d \u2013 a \u201chostile policy\u201d that it claims \u201cmade it an enemy of the US, drove Russia into the arms of China and led to the development of a new Russia-China-Iran-North Korea axis\u201d. Kellogg and Fleitz criticize what they said was a decision to scold Vladimir Putin and threaten \u201cunprecedented\u201d sanctions as it prepared to invade Ukraine, \u201cinstead of using negotiations to de-escalate tensions\u201d. \u201cAn America First approach could have prevented the invasion,\u201d they write. Trump\u2019s vice-president-elect, the Ohio senator JD Vance, has aired comparable views, arguing in effect that US support for Ukraine is a drain on resources necessary to counter Washington\u2019s principal security threat with China. The selection of Kellogg comes as the Biden administration pushes to complete more weapons transfers to Ukraine before the president\u2019s term ends. A decision to approve the use of US-made Atacms missiles on targets inside Russia was met by Russia\u2019s use of a powerful intermediate range missile, Oreshnik, on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. In an interview with Fox News, Kellogg said Biden\u2019s decision to approve Ukrainian strikes inside Russia has given Trump \u201cmore leverage\u201d. \u201cIt gives president Trump more ability to pivot from that,\u201d he said. On Tuesday, Moscow responded to a New York Times report that unidentified western officials had suggested Biden could give Ukraine nuclear weapons before he steps down. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said discussions in the West about arming Ukraine with nuclear weapons was \u201cabsolutely irresponsible\u201d. But the Kellogg-Fleitz plan, though lacking in details, appears to mirror the counsel of Gen Mark A Milley, Biden\u2019s former chief military adviser who argued that since neither Russia nor Ukraine could win the conflict, a negotiated settlement was the sole route to peace. Under the plan, Moscow would also be coaxed to the table with the promise of Nato membership for Ukraine being delayed or abandoned. \u201cWe tell the Ukrainians, \u2018You\u2019ve got to come to the table, and if you don\u2019t come to the table, support from the United States will dry up,\u2019\u201d Kellogg told Reuters in June. \u201cAnd you tell Putin, \u2018He\u2019s got to come to the table and if you don\u2019t come to the table, then we\u2019ll give Ukrainians everything they need to kill you in the field.\u2019\u201d In that interview, Fleitz said Ukraine would not need to formally cede territory to Russia, but would come to recognize that it would not be able to regain effective control of all its territory. \u201cOur concern is that this has become a war of attrition that\u2019s going to kill a whole generation of young men,\u201d Fleitz said, adding that a lasting peace in Ukraine would require additional security guarantees, including \u201carming Ukraine to the teeth\u201d. But in the policy paper the pair acknowledged that it would be hard for Ukraine to accept a peace deal \u201cthat does not give them back all of their territory or, at least for now, hold Russia responsible for the carnage it inflicted on Ukraine\u201d. Asking whether he endorses Kellogg\u2019s position paper, the president-elect told NBC News: \u201cI\u2019m the only one who can get the war stopped. It should have never started in the first place.\u201d Trump said that European nations should contribute more aid, a position echoed by Vance at the Republican national convention in July. \u201cWe will make sure our allies share in the burden of securing world peace,\u201d he said. \u201cNo more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer.\u201d Trump chose Kellogg, an 80-year-old retired army lieutenant general, to be his top adviser on defense issues. He served as national security adviser to Vice-president Mike Pence, was chief of staff of the national security council, and then stepped in as an acting security adviser for Trump after Michael Flynn resigned. During the Vietnam war he served in the 101st airborne division, also known as the Screaming Eagles, and after the first Iraq war he was named commander of special operations command Europe (SOCEUR). He retired in 2003 as a lieutenant general. During the January 6 Capitol riot, Kellogg demanded that the Secret Service not evacuate Pence from the building, which would have prevented the vice-president from certifying Biden\u2019s electoral victory. \u201cLeave him where he\u2019s at. He\u2019s got a job to do. I know you guys too well. You\u2019ll fly him to Alaska if you have a chance. Don\u2019t do it,\u201d he reportedly said. After naming Kellogg as envoy to Ukraine and Russia, Trump said Kellogg \u201cwas with me right from the beginning\u201d!"

            "content": "A senior adviser to Donald Trump said that the incoming US administration\u2019s priority for Ukraine will be achieving peace rather than helping it regain territory captured by Russia in the almost three years of the war. In an interview with the BBC, broadcast on Saturday, Bryan Lanza, who has been a political adviser to Trump since his 2016 presidential campaign, began to elaborate on the strong signals the now president-elect had been sending to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on the campaign trail. Lanza said: \u201cWhen Zelenskyy says we will only stop this fighting, there will only be peace, once Crimea is returned, we\u2019ve got news for President Zelenskyy: Crimea is gone.\u201d A spokesperson for Trump\u2019s presidential transition effort said later on Saturday that Lanza had not been speaking on behalf of the president-elect. Trump\u2019s transition effort is currently vetting personnel and drafting the policies that Trump could adopt during his second term. \u201cBryan Lanza was a contractor for the campaign. He does not work for President Trump and does not speak for him,\u201d said the spokesperson, who declined to be named. During the election campaign, Trump said he would find a solution to end the war \u201cwithin a day\u201d, but did not explain how he would do so. Russia is open to hearing Donald Trump\u2019s proposals on ending the war, an official said on Saturday. Sergei Ryabkov, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, said Moscow and Washington were \u201cexchanging signals\u201d on Ukraine via \u201cclosed channels\u201d, according to the AP. He did not specify whether the communication was with the current administration or Trump and members of his incoming administration. Russia\u2019s readiness depends on whether Trump\u2019s proposals are \u201cideas on how to move forward in the area of settlement, and not in the area of further pumping the Kyiv regime with all kinds of aid\u201d, Ryabkov said on Saturday in an interview with Russian state news agency Interfax. In Kyiv, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, told reporters that Ukraine is ready to work with the Trump administration. The comments came as Russia advanced across the eastern Ukrainian battlefield at the quickest rate since its February 2022 invasion of its neighbor, while also attacking cities including the capital, Kyiv, with munitions carried by drones. In 2022, Russia built on the assault it made on the south-eastern Ukrainian Crimean peninsula that juts into the Black Sea \u2013 which it launched in 2014 \u2013 and now holds control there. Lanza had also said: \u201cAnd if that is your priority, of getting Crimea back and having American soldiers fight to get Crimea back, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d Read more of the Guardian\u2019s 2024 US election coverage Trump wins the presidency \u2013 how did it happen? With Trump re-elected, this is what\u2019s at stake Abortion ballot measure results by state Zelenskyy came to the United Nations general assembly gathering in New York and to the White House in September touting what seemed like a last-ditch \u201cvictory plan\u201d that involved winning permission to use long-range US weapons to fire deep into Russia. But he was rebuffed, with the US and its Nato allies wary, as they have been since 2022, of the conflict escalating into a war between Russia and the west. Lanza added: \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to say to Ukraine is, you know, what do you see? What do you see as a realistic vision for peace? It\u2019s not a vision for winning, but it\u2019s a vision for peace. And let\u2019s start having the honest conversation.\u201d There are fears that Trump\u2019s boasts that he would very quickly end the war in Ukraine mean no more than essentially forcing Ukraine to give up by withdrawing support, handing the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, victory and further emboldening him. Following Trump\u2019s latest election victory, Zelenskyy congratulated him, saying: \u201cI recall our great meeting with President Trump back in September, when we discussed in detail the Ukraine-US strategic partnership, the victory plan, and ways to put an end to Russian aggression against Ukraine.\u201d On Wednesday, Axios reported that Trump and Zelenskyy had had a call with each other. The call, which Zelenskyy described as \u201cexcellent\u201d, also featured a surprise appearance from staunch Trump ally Elon Musk, who initially provided Starlink satellites to Ukraine for free in 2022. In 2023, Musk\u2019s SpaceX prevented the satellite from controlling Ukraine\u2019s surveillance drones, triggering outrage among Ukrainian officials. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly attacked Zelenskyy, accusing him of making \u201cnasty aspersions toward your favorite president, me\u201d. Trump added: \u201cWe continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refuses to make a deal: Zelenskyy.\u2019\u201d In September, Zelenskyy gave an interview to the New Yorker in which he cast doubt on Trump\u2019s ability to end the war while describing JD Vance as \u201ctoo radical\u201d. A few weeks later, Trump called Zelenskyy \u201cone of the greatest salesmen I\u2019ve ever met\u201d, telling a conservative podcast: \u201cEvery time he comes in, we give him $100bn. Who else got that kind of money in history? There\u2019s never been. And that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want to help him, because I feel very badly for those people. But he should never have let that war start. That war is a loser.\u201d Trump was impeached in 2019 during his first term for essentially trying to extort Zelenskyy over weapons supplies. He was acquitted by the US Senate."

            "content": "Rafael Nadal says he is at peace as the Spaniard prepares to end his legendary career at the Davis Cup finals in M\u00e1laga this week. \u201cAt the end, I achieved the most important thing for me, because this day arrived and I am in peace that I gave all that I had,\u201d said Nadal. \u201cI played and I practised since I was seven. I started at three but at that age, I started to work more and more with passion, with love, and with the determination to be as good as possible. \u201cI am not the kind of guy that I will say: \u2018No, I would not change things,\u2019 because for me it looks arrogant. Of course I would change things, but one thing has been so important for me [is that] I\u2019m going to leave this professional tour with the calm and personal satisfaction that I give my best in almost every single moment.\u201d This has been a sobering final season for the 22-time grand slam champion. Having returned from hip surgery in January, Nadal\u2019s hopes of a successful comeback did not materialise, and last month he announced his decision to retire. Nadal said he is not mentally burned out but his physical limitations have forced him to finish his career. \u201cIf I have to explain the struggle I have had with my body throughout my career, it is not an explanation that will last five minutes,\u201d Nadal said, laughing. \u201cI have had several episodes in my career that have complicated my activity, but I have overcome them. The last injury in Australia forced me to have hip surgery and they had to remove part of my iliopsoas [muscle]. This has not allowed me to compete how I have done for most of my career. \u201cAll these problems that I have had during my career have found a solution [or] they have given me windows of being able to play without limitations. Then they came back to me, and that is why I have had so many breaks in my career. I simply feel that I cannot carry out my activity normally and without limitations on a continuous basis. \u201cI no longer have windows that allow me to train or compete at 100%. And that is one [injury], but apart from that I have all the others that have not gone away and that are also limiting me. In other words, it is a cocktail that makes me, as many other athletes, have to stop. I see it as something logical for someone who has been working the way I have worked since I was seven or eight years old.\u201d M\u00e1laga city council has not taken the task of seeing off Spain\u2019s greatest athlete lightly. Across the road from the Palacio de Deportes, the tournament venue, the city\u2019s athletics stadium is adorned with a huge 2,600m2 banner reading \u201cGRACIAS, RAFA\u201d alongside an image of the 38-year-old. Such is the fanfare and attention around his retirement, the press conference room at the Palacio de Deportes could not accommodate the large audience, leading the ITF to schedule Spain\u2019s pre-tournament press event at a convention room in the player\u2019s hotel, 12 miles away in Fuengirola. The rest of the Spanish team \u2013 Carlos Alcaraz, Marcel Granollers, Pedro Mart\u00ednez and Roberto Bautista Agut \u2013 mostly watched in silence as the vast majority of questions were directed at Nadal. \u201cI am not here to retire. I\u2019m here to try to help the team,\u201d said Nadal. \u201cThen it\u2019s of course going to be my last week on the professional tour, but at the end, we are here in a team competition. The most important thing is to try to help the team and to stay all focused on what we have to do, that is play tennis and do it very well, no?\u201d The question remains what form Nadal\u2019s participation in his final tournament will take. The Spanish captain, David Ferrer, will select the team for Tuesday\u2019s quarter-final against the Netherlands. Based on recent results, it seems likely that Alcaraz and Bautista Agut will play singles while Nadal, who has not played competitively since the Olympics, could team up with Granollers in doubles. As he discussed his playing prospects, Nadal also noted that he is unsure whether Roger Federer, his old rival, will make an appearance in M\u00e1laga to support him in the final moments of his glittering career. \u201cMy big farewell would be the joy of winning with everyone,\u201d said Nadal. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I will respond or not. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll play a match or not. I\u2019ve played very little recently. As for Roger\u2019s presence, I don\u2019t know if Federer will come here. He\u2019ll try, but he has a very busy schedule.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-22T09:00:08Z",
            "content": "This deeply personal, essayistic film by Elizabeth Sankey impressively manages to be very moving but never mawkish, raw but also surgically precise. It is quite free-ranging in its scope, but is essentially about how witches and their history overlaps with postpartum depression on the one hand and psychosis on the other, all told through the filter of Sankey\u2019s own experience. Looking straight into the camera, she explains how she was engulfed by anxiety and depression after the birth of her son in 2020 during the Covid pandemic; after several trips to A&amp;E and crisis moments, she ended up in a special psychiatric ward for mothers and children. Sankey says she made it through thanks to therapy and support from other patients, which she likens to the formation of covens in witchcraft lore. The resulting film records not just her story but that of friends and professionals, from people who started support groups to the actor Sophia di Martino (from TV\u2019s Loki), and even a female doctor specialising in perinatal care who struggled to persuade other doctors that she wasn\u2019t delusional, and really was a medical professional, when she started experiencing the very symptoms she\u2019d treated in others for years. The Kafkaesque echo chamber of paranoia and patriarchal oppression is deftly illustrated by the mosaic of footage Sankey edits together, tiny snippets excerpted from all manner of films about witches, new mothers and women enduring mental health crises. Cuts are culled from witch-themed films such as H\u00e4xan (1922), Witchfinder General (1968), Rosemary\u2019s Baby (1968) and The Witch (2015); Sankey also weaves in bits from Girl, Interrupted (1999), The Snake Pit (1948) and Jane Eyre (1943) that touch on the themes of mental health. All in all, this is a powerful example of a bricolage-like editing technique that relies heavily on exploiting the copyright laws around fair use to create a prismatic, provocative style of cinema that\u2019s very 21st century. \u2022 Witches is on Mubi from 22 November."

            "content": "Certain events happen during every presidential campaign. The parties crown their candidates. The candidates debate on live TV, with millions watching. Tens of millions head to the polls. And at some point in this process, Jamie Dimon will be tipped as the next treasury secretary. Sure enough, the veteran boss of JPMorgan Chase \u2013 Wall Street\u2019s de facto ambassador to the world \u2013 was, indeed, linked with the role this time around as the Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigns mulled their options in the final stretch of the 2024 presidential election. But as the world came to terms with his victory, and Trump started to piece together his administration, the president-elect made clear in a social media post that Dimon \u201cwill not be invited\u201d to join. The people who did get the invite underline why Dimon \u2013 one of the most prominent leaders in corporate America, and head of America\u2019s biggest bank \u2013 did not. Considering him for a post might be a time-honored tradition, but this is not business as usual. Trump values reputation, establishment and star power. But not as much as he values getting his way. Howard Lutnick, a longtime friend and co-chair of his transition team, remarked during the campaign that Trump \u201cpicked unfortunately\u201d last time around. Industrial giants and former military generals did not wholeheartedly embrace his agenda. Not this time. Trump has picked Lutnick, for starters \u2013 CEO of the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald \u2013 as his commerce secretary, tasked with delivering his policy on tariffs and trade. While Lutnick was reported to have directly lobbied to run the treasury, that job went to the financier Scott Bessent, after days of jostling and speculation. With both appointments, Trump is said to have been wary of appointing a candidate who did not ardently believe in the tariffs and tax strategy at the center of his economic plan for the US. Economists have warned that the introduction of steep tariffs could reignite inflation. Budget experts have warned that Trump\u2019s wider plans could add as much as $15tn to US debt over 10 years. The president-elect wants to keep such caution outside the tent \u2013 and has pulled together a band of staunch loyalists to drive through it. During Bessent\u2019s campaign for the treasury job, he loudly made the case for tariffs, dismissing economists\u2019 warnings as \u201cfundamentally incorrect\u201d in a column for Fox News. Not long after a line was very publicly drawn under the talk of Dimon as treasury secretary, the Wall Street titan appeared on stage at a summit in Lima, Peru. He wished Trump well, \u201cbut I just want to tell the president also: I haven\u2019t had a boss in 25 years, and I\u2019m not about ready to start\u201d. The boss preparing to return to the White House in January has made up his mind. He does not seem prepared to hire anyone who might try to change it \u2013 on the economy, or any other key facet of his agenda. Presidential administrations are rarely a broad church. Trump appears to be building a narrow pew."

            "date": "2024-11-16T12:01:03Z",
            "content": "A top adviser to the US president-elect, Donald Trump, has said the UK should align itself with the American \u201cfree enterprise\u201d economic model instead of the \u201cmore socialist\u201d European system, as speculation mounts over the terms of a potential transatlantic trade deal. Stephen Moore, a senior economic adviser to Trump, said if the UK moved towards the US model of \u201ceconomic freedom\u201d there would be more \u201cwillingness\u201d by the incoming administration to agree to a trade deal between the two countries. His comments come as Keir Starmer faces competing demands over future trade deals with Washington and Brussels. Some have told the prime minister to pick a side in trade talks between the US and EU while others have suggested he could strike deals with both major players. Speaking to BBC\u2019s Today programme, Moore said: \u201cThe UK really has to choose between the Europe economic model of more socialism and the US model, which is more based on a free enterprise system. I think the UK is kind of caught in the middle of these two forms of an economic model. I believe that Britain would be better off moving towards more of the American model of economic freedom. \u201cIf that were the case, I think it would spur the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to the free trade agreement with the UK. I think it would make sense for both Britain and the United States.\u201d Previous efforts to agree a UK-US trade deal have been scuppered by rows over agricultural standards, particularly fears over allowing chlorinated chicken or hormone-fed beef on to British supermarket shelves. Moore said: \u201cI think we have the best agriculture centres in the world. So I wouldn\u2019t see that as a problem from this side of the ocean, but I do understand that in Britain. I know the last time I was in London, that was a big issue with many of the British folks I talked to.\u201d Trump has proposed a blanket tariff of at least 10% on all imports, as well as further retaliatory tariffs against countries that place tariffs on US imports. Moore said the blanket tariff was a \u201cfairly popular position with many American voters\u201d but suggested some countries might be exempt. The prospect of tariffs has already hampered the UK government, which has staked its success on economic growth. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs cut its UK economic growth forecast for 2025 to 1.4% from 1.6%, citing potential higher US tariffs. \u201cI do think we have a special relationship with Britain and I think most Americans, I think Donald Trump, views Britain in a very different way, certainly from China or other countries that we view in a more adversarial way,\u201d he said. Referencing the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was passed under Trump to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, Moore said: \u201cWe have a US, Mexico and Canada trade deal. So, it\u2019s certainly possible that with this uniform tariff that he\u2019s talked about, that because of our special relationship with our North American neighbours, that we might exempt them. So your question is, might we exempt Britain? Maybe, I don\u2019t know the answer to that.\u201d On Tuesday, Peter Mandelson, who is tipped to become the new British ambassador in Washington, told the Times that the UK \u201cmust have our cake and eat it\u201d and forge trade ties with the EU and US. \u201cWe cannot come out of the largest export market, difficult enough as it is to trade freely there, having left the European Union. But we still trade. It\u2019s our biggest export market still. We can\u2019t leave that. \u201cAnd we have to mitigate the sort of barriers and risks that we\u2019ve taken on as a result of Brexit in the European market. And transatlantic trade and investment is huge for us.\u201d Andy Haldane, the former Bank of England chief economist, echoed a similar message, saying on Tuesday that the government could show the UK was \u201copen for business at a time when so much else of the world is looking inward \u2013 whether to the EU, or the US\u201d."

            "date": "2024-11-18T18:20:02Z",
            "content": "China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has heaped praise on Keir Starmer\u2019s economic policy, as the UK prime minister used their first meeting to raise concerns about sanctions on MPs and the treatment of the pro-democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai. During their conversation at the G20 summit in Rio, the first meeting between the UK and China\u2019s leaders in six years, Starmer said he would be keen to host a full bilateral meeting with Xi and the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, in Beijing or London as soon as possible, aimed at turning the page on frosty UK-China relations. In a marked change of tone from previous years, Xi said Starmer was \u201cfixing the foundations\u201d of the UK economy, echoing the prime minister\u2019s own slogan. He said the pair would \u201cbreak new ground\u201d in the relationship. But the prime minister also raised human rights concerns with the Chinese president about sanctions on British Conservative MPs and the deterioration of Lai, a British citizen and Hong Kong democracy activist. Starmer promised a \u201cstrong UK-China relationship\u201d and said the pair had agreed there should be no more \u201csurprises\u201d between the two countries. Chinese officials bundled British journalists out of the meeting when Starmer raised the plight of Lai, who is being held in Hong Kong. \u201cThe world has entered a new period marked by turbulence and transformation,\u201d Xi said in the meeting. \u201cThe new UK government is working to fix the foundations of the economy and rebuild Britain and has set the vision of Britain reconnected. And China is further deepening reform across the board to advance Chinese modernisation.\u201d Starmer said the pair had acknowledged they wanted \u201crelations to be consistent, durable, respectful and, as we have agreed, avoid surprises where possible\u201d. \u201cA strong UK-China relationship is important for both of our countries and for the broader international community,\u201d he said at the top of the meeting. \u201cThe UK will be a predictable, consistent, sovereign actor committed to the rule of law.\u201d He proposed a full bilateral meeting with Li in Beijing or London, and for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to meet her counterpart, He Lifeng, which is expected to happen in Beijing in January. \u201cI\u2019m keen that my chancellor should meet with Vice-Premier He for the upcoming economic financial dialogue early next year to explore more investment projects and a more level playing field to help our businesses,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased that my foreign secretary and foreign minister Wang met recently to discuss respective concerns including on human rights and parliamentary sanctions, Taiwan, the South China Sea and our shared interest in Hong Kong. We are concerned by reports of Jimmy Lai\u2019s deterioration.\u201d More than 100 senior politicians from 22 countries have called on China to release Lai before his trial that restarts in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Held in custody since December 2020, Lai faces a range of sedition and foreign collusion charges that include meeting politicians in the US. Signatories to the appeal include the chairs of a range of foreign affairs committees and prominent MPs from across Europe, Canada and Australia and the Balkans. The signatories point out that Lai is 77, a British citizen and was declared as being arbitrarily detained by a UN panel last week. In a statement, they claim he has been held inhumanely in solitary confinement in a maximum-security prison for four years, and call for his immediate release \u201cbefore it is too late\u201d. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, recently met Jimmy Lai\u2019s son Sebastian to promise to do all he could to secure his release. Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, said Starmer the UK\u2019s world standing risked \u201cbeing weakened\u201d if Starmer was not robust with China. \u201cWhile it is important to have a constructive diplomatic dialogue with China, the prime minister should have been stronger in raising our concerns over human rights, the repressive nature of the national security laws imposed on Hong Kong, and the security, safety and wellbeing of British nationals, like Jimmy Lai, who should be freed from custody,\u201d she said. The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who is also under sanctions from Beijing, condemned Starmer\u2019s attempt to resuscitate relations. \u201cPresident Xi has no regard for the UK and is trashing all the rules-based order around the world \u2013 from human rights to the WTO, China just ignores what it is told,\u201d he said. No British prime minister had met Xi since Theresa May visited Beijing in 2018 in the midst of a trade push during Brexit negotiations, though Boris Johnson spoke to the Chinese president during the pandemic. Since then, relations have significantly cooled because of cyber threats, a human rights crackdown in Hong Kong and the sanctions against MPs. Lammy visited China last month in the first signal that the new Labour government saw a renewal of better ties as a diplomatic priority."

            "title": "From higher tariffs to lower taxes, will Donald Trump\u2019s economic plan pay off?",
            "date": "2024-11-08T13:19:58Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s the economy, stupid. So said James Carville when he was advising Bill Clinton in his 1992 presidential campaign and the phrase is as true now as it was 32 years ago. Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris this week for the same reason he lost to Joe Biden in 2020: millions of Americans were unhappy about the economic record of the incumbent party. Two out of three voters this week thought the US economy was on the wrong track \u2013 and that spelled trouble for Harris. The question is whether they will feel any differently at the end of Trump\u2019s second term in the White House, when it ends in 2029. Looking at some of the policies proposed by the president-elect, it is by no means certain that they will. Trump is not a man to undersell himself and while campaigning said he had created during his first term the \u201cgreatest economy in the history of our country\u201d. While clearly hyperbole, Trump\u2019s record in the first three years of his presidency was impressive. The US economy grew strongly, inflation averaged about 2%, 6.7m jobs were created and the unemployment rate fell to 3.5%. Then, in the fourth year of his presidency the economy was hit by the Covid 19 pandemic. Lockdowns meant 20 million Americans lost their jobs and the unemployment rate shot up to 15%. A deep recession in 2020 pulled down the average growth rate to 2.3% across Trump\u2019s first term. So what is Trump proposing for the economy when he replaces Biden in January? 1. Lower taxes Trump loves cutting taxes, and reductions for business and individuals are priorities for his second term. While plans are sketchy he has promised to cut corporation tax for companies that make their products in the US, from 21% to 15%. This is part of the president-elect\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda, with one of the world\u2019s most competitive tax regimes designed to prevent US companies outsourcing production overseas and to persuade foreign manufacturers to move to the US. He wants to make permanent the income tax cuts made in 2017 but which are due to expire next year. With the US on course to run a 7% of GDP budget deficit this year, critics have said tax cuts worth up to $7.5tn over the next 10 years are unaffordable, given that the US national debt is already 122% of GDP. Trump says he has a way of paying for them. 2. Tariffs Trump says he will pay for the tax cuts by imposing tariffs on foreign goods entering the US and has floated the idea of a 60% to 100% levy on Chinese products and a 10%-20% levy on goods from the rest of the world. The Tax Foundation, a US thinktank, has estimated a 10% universal tariff would raise $2tn over 10 years, while a 20% tariff would raise $3.3tn \u2013 well short of what would be needed to fully offset the revenue losses of making the 2017 tax cuts permanent. The impact of the tariffs will be to raise prices in the shops and reduce the spending power of US consumers. Some estimates suggest the losses for the average US household could be between $2,500 and $3,900. Those who voted for Trump on the basis that he will deliver lower inflation and faster growth in living standards could be in for a shock. 3. Drilling and the environment The centrepiece of Joe Biden\u2019s industrial strategy was the Inflation Reduction Act, which was designed to stimulate green growth through a system of tax incentives and subsidies. Trump has criticised the act for being too expensive, and plans to ban offshore wind projects and give the go-ahead for the resumption of large-scale oil and gas drilling. While analysts expect longstanding tax credits for onshore wind to remain in place, America under Trump is not going to be in the vanguard of the fight to achieve net zero. Trump has summed up his energy policy in three words: \u201cDrill, baby, drill.\u201d 4. Interest rates, the dollar and the Federal Reserve The US economy is operating at close to capacity and unemployment is low. Tax cuts will increase demand, while higher tariffs will push up prices. Higher inflation will be the result and that will mean America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, will be more cautious about cutting interest rates. If US borrowing costs stay higher for longer, the US dollar will rise on the currency markets, offsetting some of the impact of tariffs by making imports cheaper. If his first term is any guide, Trump will put pressure on the Fed to cut rates. The US central bank reduced US borrowing costs by 0.25 points on Thursday but its chair, Jerome Powell, clearly expects trouble. Asked if he would step down if Trump asked him to go, and if he could be legally ordered to do so, Powell replied \u201cno\u201d and \u201cnot permitted under the law\u201d. 5. Migration and deregulation Trump says he will begin immediately the deportation of the estimated 11 million people living in the US without legal status, although he has given few details of how they would identify the individuals involved. He also plans to complete the project launched in his first term: the building of a wall along the border between the US and Mexico. If successful, these policies would reduce the supply of low-cost labour and push up business costs. Trump favours business deregulation, including dismantling the safeguards put in for artificial intelligence, ending the \u201cpersecution\u201d of the crypto industry, and making Elon Musk the head of a government efficiency commission with the task of cutting \u201cred tape\u201d. 6. What does it all add up to? Trump only has four years as president so will be in a hurry to move forward with his tax cuts, import tariffs, energy policy and deregulation. But the chances are that lower taxes will have a sugar rush effect, with their impact fading as dearer imports and higher interest rates slow the economy. The risks of it going wrong are high. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 November 20214. Figures from the Tax Foundation of the estimated income from 10% and 20% universal tariffs have been calculated over 10 years, not annually as an earlier version said."

            "content": "Anyone who has enjoyed Henry Porter\u2019s excellent series of Paul Samson spy thriller novels will be pleased to hear that he has a new protagonist, Alice \u201cSlim\u201d Parsons, who is every bit as dynamic and charismatic as Samson. She takes central stage in this superbly twist-laden novel, and swiftly establishes herself as a heroine for the ages. There\u2019s plenty of sly wit on display as Parsons, a former deep cover MI5 agent \u2013 whom we are introduced to semi-reluctantly saving her mother\u2019s life \u2013 is dealing with the aftermath of a close-quarters, near-fatal struggle in a private jet somewhere over the Balkans, in which we learn that she isn\u2019t someone to be messed with. The age-old trope of a burnt-out spook who has attempted to leave the security services, only to be lured back for one last job that will have a significant personal and professional impact on them, was a cliche even when John le Carr\u00e9 wrote The Spy Who Came in from the Cold in the early 60s, so it is to Porter\u2019s credit that he takes potentially hackneyed material and makes it fresh, fun and gripping. Much of the book\u2019s success lies in its innovation and wit. Slim finds herself working with an association that has a mysterious relationship with the former Bletchley Park code breakers, allowing the author to look at matters of national intelligence past and present with a realistic, though never wholly cynical, gaze. This is a lengthy book, and some readers may find that the action occasionally drags. Yet the third act, in which Slim confronts nemeses old and new, is especially thrilling stuff, and I defy any reader to reach the bleak but cathartic conclusion and not want to dive into another adventure with the redoubtable heroine. Porter has been compared to Mick Herron and Gerald Seymour, and it\u2019s easy to see why, but The Enigma Girl is the work of a wholly individual and readable talent. \u2022 The Enigma Girl by Henry Porter is published by Quercus (\u00a322).

            "date": "2024-11-27T15:55:32Z",
            "content": "Rupert Goold, as director, has made the Almeida the most consistently exciting theatre in London over the last decade. Next year he will take over the Old Vic and the portents look promising. At the Almeida, Goold\u2019s programming has combined respect for new writing with a highly imaginative approach to the classics. Although a fine director himself, Goold has nurtured younger talents with no sign of professional jealousy: Robert Icke, whose Oedipus is now in the West End, and Rebecca Frecknall, who will join Goold at the Old Vic, are two beneficiaries of his enlightened encouragement. I first became aware of Goold\u2019s gifts, as director and head of a theatre, when he ran the Royal &amp; Derngate, Northampton, from 2002 to 2005. Even though I wasn\u2019t crazy about his Hamlet, set in a world of Paris existentialism, it managed to attract a star presence in Jane Birkin to play Gertrude. Goold\u2019s Othello, in which Ron Cephas Jones\u2019s hero became a second world war general and Finbar Lynch\u2019s Iago a closeted homosexual, was, however, instantly striking. Over the next few years, whether running the Headlong company or working as a freelance, Goold proved himself, along with Stephen Daldry, to be a director whose work you wouldn\u2019t want to miss. In the productions he did at Chichester and Stratford-upon-Avon, Goold showed that he was an audacious innovator who had a high regard for actors \u2013 he is, indeed, married to one in Kate Fleetwood \u2013 and a reverence for living writers. With Patrick Stewart in the lead, he did a trio of memorable Shakespeare productions: a Tempest set in an Arctic wasteland; a Macbeth that invoked the brutality of Soviet tyranny; and a Las Vegas-based Merchant of Venice in which Stewart\u2019s multimillionaire Shylock was confronted by Susannah Fielding\u2019s gameshow host Portia. But Goold\u2019s exuberant theatricality worked equally well in his 2009 production of Lucy Prebble\u2019s Enron: the collapse of the Texas energy company was made visible by the creation of ever-smaller boxes to symbolise the way mounting debts were funnelled into fantasy companies. Thus capitalism was wittily shown to be a con trick and an illusion. The big question, when he took over the Almeida in 2013, was whether Goold could harness his talents into running a theatre which had already acquired an international reputation under Ian McDiarmid and Jonathan Kent. In fact, he did so with great success. He kicked off with a gaudy musical version of American Psycho but quickly showed his sensitivity to the writer\u2019s intentions. His production of Mike Bartlett\u2019s King Charles III, which posited the idea of a young Prince Harry falling in love with a republican outsider, was a model of dignified restraint. Goold showed a similar respect, if more free invention, in his productions of James Graham\u2019s Ink, David Farr\u2019s The Hunt (based on a Thomas Vinterberg movie) and Peter Morgan\u2019s Patriots, which dealt brilliantly with the rise and fall of a Russian oligarch. But Goold has also ensured that the Almeida is a place open to experiment and re-imagined versions of the classics. I am not an uncritical admirer of Icke, but his productions of Hamlet with Andrew Scott and The Doctor with Juliet Stevenson were bold, inventive and popular successes that, like much of the Almeida\u2019s work, enjoyed commercial transfers. Frecknall has also made her mark with outstanding productions of Summer and Smoke and A Streetcar Named Desire that stripped Tennessee Williams\u2019s plays of physical realism while retaining their essential poetry. More recently, Eline Arbo\u2019s production of Annie Ernaux\u2019s The Years, which showed a Frenchwoman\u2019s life portrayed by five actors, garnered critical superlatives and, like much of the Almeida\u2019s work, will move to the West End. With the help of Denise Wood as executive director \u2013 also scheduled to leave next year \u2013 Goold has ensured the Almeida is artistically rich and financially stable. Although he was passed over for the top job at the National \u2013 despite his recent success there with Dear England \u2013 he should, if his past record is anything to go by, make waves on the Waterloo Road and give his monolithic neighbour on the South Bank a good run for its money."

            "date": "2024-11-19T05:30:28Z",
            "content": "The human cost of the global sanitation crisis is devastating: more than 1,000 children under five die every day [pdf] from diseases linked to dirty water and poor sanitation, while the educational gender gap deepens as menstruating girls often miss classes due to a lack of products as well as toilets and privacy at schools. While many of us have the privilege of not having to give it too much thought, the reality is that hygiene is the foundation of how individuals, communities and whole societies function. Inadequate sanitation and hygiene is multifaceted, costing billions for local communities and economies, while crippling opportunities for growth and development across entire regions. \u2018People must be at the core of the solution\u2019 When a small team of engineers including Daigo Ishiyama arrived at a remote village in rural Bangladesh in 2012, these were among some of the challenges they were hoping to solve. How could Ishiyama and his colleagues use their expertise in water and housing products to address the sanitation needs of disadvantaged consumers in one of the most densely populated countries in the world? \u201cThe existing facilities we came across were wholly inadequate. Open-pit-style latrines that remained exposed to the air at all times meant that not only was the smell free to travel but flies could enter and exit the pit, carrying a host of diseases with them,\u201d says Ishiyama, who now leads innovation at Sato, a social business and brand of Lixil, a multinational Japanese company that specialises in housing technologies and owns brands such as American Standard and Grohe. The engineers designed a simple yet innovative concept: the Sato pan, the first product in the Sato portfolio. It\u2019s a plastic pan with a trapdoor that\u2019s fitted over a latrine hole, creating a seal between the pit and the open air to keep out insects and odours. This seal prevents the spread of disease and improves latrine safety, since the trapdoor helps prevent insects, harmful gas, or snakes and rodents coming up the toilet from the pit. \u201cWhether innovating for those at the base of the economic pyramid or those right at the top, there\u2019s one principle we always follow at Lixil: if we\u2019re innovating for people, people must be at the core of the solution,\u201d says Ishiyama. The core concept around which the pan is based is the unique counterweighted trapdoor itself, which is designed to remain closed until the additional force of water and waste are excreted into the pan, using less than one litre per flush; 80% less than conventional toilet pans. The toilets are made from polypropylene, which is comparatively cheaper than ceramic and offers \u201csanitation for a lifetime\u201d; the trapdoor mechanism has been tested to last the equivalent of decades of use by a five-member household. Sufia Begum, a Sato consumer who lives in Bangladesh, exemplifies the importance of these solutions. After losing one of her five sons to diarrhoea, she started using the Sato pan \u201cfor the sake of her remaining sons and grandchildren\u201d. \u201cBefore, we had many insects and odours, but I don\u2019t think such things will happen any more,\u201d Begum says. \u201cSince purchasing it, we have been able to live healthily, and I want others to use it and live healthily too.\u201d Developing a social business The concept was an instant hit among Bangladeshis, who appreciated the simplicity of the product and its immediate benefits and affordability. In its first year, more than 800,000 Sato toilets were installed; the signature blue pan could be found in some of the greener, most remote corners of the country. When Jin Montesano, Lixil\u2019s chief people officer, joined Lixil in 2014, she took on the task of turning Sato into a social business within Lixil. Today, she sits on the board of directors at Lixil. \u201cTo truly have an impact at a global scale, we knew we had to be more ambitious,\u201d she says. \u201cTo do that, we took the Sato from a nice idea to establishing it as its own business unit and applying a commercial approach.\u201d Sato started collaborating with local manufacturers and NGOs to bolster regional production and distribution capacities, amplifying the reach and impact of its products. In 2019, Sato demonstrated profitability in Bangladesh [pdf] \u2013 a huge milestone and proof that the model worked. To date, the company has established manufacturing capabilities in eight countries across Asia and Africa and has shipped approximately 8.6m units of Sato products to 45 countries. \u201cSo far, our products have improved the lives of more than 68 million people around the world,\u201d says Montesano. Stimulating local economies A critical component of Sato\u2019s business model is partnering with local businesses for manufacturing, distribution, and installation. \u201cWe work with our partners to provide opportunities for masons and entrepreneurs to grow their business and local economy under our make-sell-use business model,\u201d Montesano says. \u201cThis allows them to drive impact in their own communities, while unlocking immeasurable health, social and economic value.\u201d Since launching in 2013 with just a single product, Sato has expanded its portfolio to a wide range of toilet and hand hygiene solutions applicable in a range of situations. The Sato Slab, for instance, is an easy-to-transport platform designed to facilitate the rapid construction of strong, sturdy toilets and to which Sato toilets and connection systems can be mounted in various combinations for direct or off-set pit applications. Sato\u2019s products come in varieties that suit customers\u2019 requirements and preferences, depending on the country, location and individual needs. \u201cWe recognise the importance of accessibility and launched the Sato Stool to improve the experience of children, elderly people, pregnant women, and those with disabilities,\u201d Montesano says. Sato\u2019s success is not just down to its solutions being affordable and effective, but due to its passion of building markets that tackle the barriers facing local communities. In Africa, for example, Sato has partnered with Financial Inclusion Improves Sanitation and Health (Finish) Mondial, the NGO that works globally on safely managed sanitation, using microfinance solutions, among others, to reach out to more people, reduce costs and ensure proper waste disposal with preferably safe reuse. Finish Mondial has an extensive network across Africa and the ability to reach and engage potential customers in rural communities. In Kenya, more than 100 sanitation entrepreneurs have received loans worth $60,000 (\u00a347,000) to stock Sato products. By providing small loans to those without access to traditional banking services, Sato and Finish Mondial are enabling people to set up one-stop shops and mini rural hardware stores \u2013 creating a ripple effect that can transform whole communities. Combining the strengths of microfinance and innovative sanitation solutions means they are not only improving health outcomes in Africa, but fostering economic empowerment among rural populations. Making a splash with Unicef While its innovative capabilities are commendable, Sato maintains its focus and strategy on the long term. \u201cTo unlock real change, we know we have to work with other stakeholders and leverage each other\u2019s expertise to drive sustainable impact,\u201d says Montesano. In 2018, the company joined forces with Unicef, the United Nations agency for children, to launch Make A Splash!, a bold, shared-value partnership that combines Lixil\u2019s global expertise in toilet design and innovation with Unicef\u2019s aim to bring clean water and sanitation to the world\u2019s children and accelerate progress towards the sustainable development goal on adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all. This shared-value partnership is demonstrating how, by working together, the private sector and Unicef can strengthen systems to create sustainable sanitation and hygiene economies. Most household sanitation improvements around the world are the result of people buying a toilet of their choice from a supplier, but some communities still face barriers to do this, such as a lack of affordable products, an absence of skilled labourers to install toilets, and family cashflow constraints. The Lixil-Unicef partnership has a multifaceted approach to help families invest in better sanitation and help protect children and the most vulnerable. This includes training labourers to install toilets, supporting government health workers to boost community awareness on safe sanitation practices, increasing the availability of affordable products on the market and enabling opportunities for affordable finance. Starting out in Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania, the initiative has expanded to Nigeria, India and Indonesia \u2013 reaching more than 12.7 million people in just five years. Now extended until 2027, Lixil and Unicef hope their continued collaboration will create new opportunities to further expand safe sanitation and hygiene access across Asia and Africa. But despite their encouraging progress and contribution towards improved sanitation, large disparities in access remain \u2013 about 3.5 billion people are still living without safe toilets that protect human and environmental health. \u201cThe world is currently not on track to achieve universal access to basic water, sanitation and hygiene by 2030,\u201d warns Montesano. \u201cThere is a lot of work to be done. Next year marks our ambition of improving the lives of 100 million people through our sanitation and hygiene initiatives. We are committed to achieving this goal and we know we can make it happen,\u201d she says.

            "date": "2024-11-15T09:00:22Z",
            "content": "Spiralling out from a palette of Lithuanian folk forms, this album feels like a sharp, cold and bright autumn morning, bracingly new. Once a three-piece, Merope is now a duo comprising Lithuanian singer Indr\u0117 Jurgelevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117, who plays the kankl\u0117s (a Baltic chordophone with which she makes sounds that phosphoresce like frost or flash like streaking meteors) and Belgian multi-instrumentalist Bert Cools. They bring in a stellar supporting cast for their fifth album, including zither master Laraaji and jazz guitarist Bill Frisell, plus innovative composers Shahzad Ismaily and Toma Gouband. Ve\u0307jula begins with Koumu Lil, about a newborn foal taking to its feet before heading across the fields. Fragments of Jurgelevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117\u2019s vocals burst in, like sunlight through clouds, over glimmering arpeggios on zithers and synthesisers, suggesting the momentary magic and fragility of early life. Just as beautiful is the more traditional Namopi, featuring both Laraaji and Ismaily. Its lovely violin melody emerges from an undertow of chimed strings and Moog shimmers, and carries you along in its bowed movements. The most avant garde track, Aglala, based on a folk song about a spruce tree, writhes and rages as if it\u2019s in the grip of a continental storm. Simpler, stripped-down tracks work even better, such as Lithuanian lullaby Lop\u0161ine\u0307, sung in a deep, earthy register by Jurgelevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117, in what is essentially a duet with Frisell\u2019s unshowy, sensitive guitar. On Vija, the kankl\u0117s builds a repetitive jig, suggesting commonalities with other folk dances across Europe. Its title, meaning \u201cwind\u201d or \u201cbreeze\u201d, Ve\u0307jula ends with the traditional Lithuanian winter song, Rana, set against field recordings of the weather. It\u2019s about a dove being encouraged to fly to the sea, drink water, and listen. In these thunderous times, dwell in these waters, your ears open, for succour. Also out this month On Kathryn Tickell\u2019s Return to Kielderside (Resilient Records), the Northumbrian smallpipes player reworks her teenage debut album (1984\u2019s On Kielder Side) with old friends and recent collaborators. It\u2019s hearty, often moving stuff, especially when you hear curlews surround her on Sycamore Gap. Tira-Tira by Duo Falak (Topot) is an engrossing collaboration between Tajik percussionist Shohin Qurbon and Russian guitarist Denis Sorokin, exploring Falak music, which originated in the Pamir mountains in pre-Islamic times. Usually performed by a solo musician accompanied by a dutar or rubab (an Iranian or Afghan lute), it\u2019s transposed thrillingly to an electro-acoustic guitar and the Uzbek doira drums, ranging from twitchy free jazz-like improvisation to raucous, string-hammered noise. Sudanese Gwana folk music is also showcased intimately on Maalem Houssam Guinia\u2019s Dead of Night (Hive Mind), a seven-track live session by the singer and guembri lute player. Recorded into the early hours, his deep, enveloping voice and percussive playing are gorgeous throughout."

            "content": "A leading human rights organization has described a sponsorship deal between Concacaf and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF) as sportswashing, criticizing the host confederation for 2026 World Cup as complicit in covering up the murder of journalists as well as the repression of women and human rights activists. Concacaf, the confederation that includes nations from North and Central America and the Caribbean, announced its partnership with the Saudi sovereign wealth fund in August claiming Saudi Arabia\u2019s investment will \u201cincrease the number of youth tournaments and community programs it manages in its region\u201d. Concacaf\u2019s president, Victor Montagliani, said at the time of the announcement that \u201cwe are very pleased to announce this new strategic partnership which will support the confederation in developing all levels of football across our region \u2026 Interest in [football] is growing rapidly in our confederation.\u201d The 2026 World Cup will be co-hosted by Concacaf members the United States, Canada and Mexico. The deal between Concacaf and PIF, however, has drawn criticism from a leading non-governmental organization that claims Concacaf has ignored Fifa\u2019s statutory human rights requirements in approving the deal. \u201cConcacaf is going to be hosting the largest ever 48-team World Cup,\u201d said Minky Worden, director of global Initiatives for Human Rights Watch. \u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund is credibly implicated in egregious human rights abuses and one of the world\u2019s most loved sports events should not in any way be associated with horrific repression in Saudi Arabia. \u201cThe sponsorship of Concacaf serves to sportswash and to cover up and launder these human rights abuses by Saudi Arabia that include repression of women, murder of journalists, and include the repression of human rights defenders. The investment in Concacaf serves to launder the abuses by the Saudi Public Investment Fund and that is not acceptable.\u201d Under Fifa\u2019s human rights policy, organizations commit \u201cto identify, address, evaluate and communicate the risks of involvement with adverse human rights impacts\u201d. In 2016 Fifa adopted the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights that calls for \u201cadditional steps to protect against human rights abuses by business enterprises that are owned or controlled by the State, or that receive substantial support and services from State agencies.\u201d Fifa, however, does not appear to follow its own guidelines on these issues and is even set to award hosting rights for the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia in the next few weeks. \u201cFifa has taken a very cavalier approach to this and not honored the agreement with human rights groups to raise the bar for human rights,\u201d said Worden. \u201c[2026] was supposed to be the first World Cup that was covered by the human rights policy. The human rights strategy looks beautiful on paper but has not been honored in practice.\u201d In January, US senators Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, and Republican Ron Johnson wrote to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund with concerns about PIF\u2019s business dealings in the United States \u2013 based mostly in real estate, technology, and sports \u2013 and its attempts to block subpoenas issued to four American businesses providing consulting services to the Saudis: Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey &amp; Company, M Klein &amp; Company and Teneo. The US Senate\u2019s permanent subcommittee on investigations is charged with investigating which foreign powers may be using commerce within the United States as a tool of foreign influence. At a 2023 public hearing into a proposed PGA Tour agreement with PIF, Blumenthal said: \u201cToday\u2019s hearing is about much more than the game of golf. It is about how a brutal, repressive regime can buy influence \u2013 indeed even take over \u2013 a cherished American institution simply to cleanse its public image.\u201d Concacaf\u2019s deal with PIF comes after another agreement by the confederation with Aramco, the national oil company of Saudi Arabia. In February this year Aramco was announced as the \u201cOfficial Energy Partner\u201d for all of Concacaf\u2019s national team and club competitions. The Saudi influence was strengthened in August when it was announced that Air Riyadh would be the \u201cOfficial Airline Partner\u201d of Concacaf in a multi-year deal. The airline is owned by PIF and will make its first scheduled flights in 2025 promising to fly 100 routes worldwide by 2030. The airline is a shirt sponsor of La Liga side Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. PIF is the majority owner of Premier League club Newcastle United and also owns four Saudi Pro League teams, including Al Nassr whose star player is Cristiano Ronaldo. It has significant interests in golf and tennis and is a partner of the ATP and WTA. Concacaf, which is headquartered in Miami, did not respond to a request for an interview with Montagliani and declined to respond to questions that included clarification on the dollar value of its agreement with PIF and whether Concacaf completed due diligence to ensure compliance with both Fifa\u2019s human rights policy and its own code of conduct. In response to the invitation and requests from the Guardian, Concacaf said in a statement issued by a spokesperson: \u201cWe believe in engaging positively with partners from across the world to support our mission of developing all levels of football to benefit our 41 member federations and their communities. In that context, we have entered into a sponsorship agreement with PIF and Riyadh Air that will see their brands receive global visibility through our tournaments. \u201cAdditionally, our partnership includes working together to create and deliver a grassroots football program that will benefit young people in Central America and the Caribbean. \u201cThe PIF and Riyadh Air have an established track record of sponsorships in a range of global sports, including high profile football clubs, international tennis organizations. and motor sport. Their sponsorship of Concacaf tournaments will support us in continuing to grow the game across our region.\u201d PIF did not respond to a request for an interview or comment. \u201cBusinesses including sports bodies like Concacaf have a responsibility to respect human rights across all of their operations,\u201d said Worden. \u201cThat is the expectation that Concacaf will adopt specific policies and do due diligence that will identify risks that will contribute to human rights harms. \u201cThese harms include the reputational benefits that Concacaf is giving to PIF to cover up human rights abuses. According to Fifa\u2019s statutory human rights requirements Concacaf is required to do and make public due diligence about its sponsors. PIF has a very black record in relation to human rights. That is very problematic.\u201d"

            "content": "The Urdaibai Bird Center has been cutely styled like an international airport terminal, with multilingual boards marked Arrivals and Departures, and a raised observation platform resembling an air traffic control tower. Through a roof-mounted telescope I watch various avian species landing or taking off from little floating archipelagos on the adjoining lagoon. I am not a birder so I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re called, though I do recognise the (grey) heron by its pterodactyl flight profile. Rowan Hardman, the centre\u2019s environmental educator, points out lapwings, greenshanks, bank swallows. Her favourites are the spoonbills: \u201cThey\u2019re big, white and dramatic, but also calm and static, always sleeping or preening. They reflect how this marsh has become a peaceful haven for them.\u201d This quiet corner of northern Spain, at the coastal edge of the Basque Country, is now a regular stopover on southward migration routes from the UK and Scandinavia to sub-Saharan Africa (then back again come spring). \u201cWe\u2019ve got the Bay of Biscay to one side, the Pyrenees to the other,\u201d says Hardman, a Briton from Portsmouth who relocated here 30 years ago. \u201cSo the birds are funnelled into this flight corridor between them, and we\u2019re part of a chain of habitats along the way, like service stations.\u201d Since opening at a former cannery in 2012, this facility has been a success story in reclaiming and rewilding a previously dried-out, chewed-up agricultural tract. A different order of development is now planned just across the wetland, so close you can see it through the telescope, where a shuttered shipyard will soon be repurposed as one of two new rural annexes of the Guggenheim museum \u2013 that gleaming showcase for modern art in nearby Bilbao. On the train from Bilbao, I passed through towns and villages strung with banners opposing the project, though Hardman can\u2019t comment beyond the bird centre\u2019s official line: \u201cWe are not anti-Guggenheim, we are pro-preservation of the marsh.\u201d The primary remits are research and outreach. A nifty, kid-friendly interactive museum on the ground floor maps migration patterns and relays seasonal birdsongs through a geodesic echo chamber. There\u2019s a small hotel on the upper level, too, with six simple double rooms, a breakfast buffet area and a private birdwatching lounge. Its appeal to \u201ctwitchers\u201d is obvious. One entry in the guestbook reads: \u201cI\u2019ve never spotted so many species without taking my slippers off.\u201d However, Hardman says the serious hobbyists tend to go their own way, with their own gear, seeking out the rarest sightings. A majority who come to sleep on this site are less specialised, more all embracing, \u201cbasically, nature lovers\u201d. Long intervals during my own visit are spent thoroughly distracted on a low sofa at the back window, which is roughly the size and aspect ratio of a cinema screen. The birds seem almost incidental to the picture, as the light and weather make their slow transitions. Waves of mist roll down the deep green mountains soon after dawn; gold sunbeams flare off white wingtips at roosting time; an autumn moon shines over the flat black pools near midnight. All seems eternal out there, though I\u2019m also told of old Franco-era plans to remake the surrounding Urdaibai estuary as a northern Costa del Sol, with leisure marinas and high-rise hotels along the banks and beaches. Residents petitioned the Basque government, and eventually secured Unesco protection as a biosphere reserve in 1984. In the 40 years since, that status has drawn a less invasive sort of tourism: hikers, cyclists and kayakers exploring a tideland of cliffs, capes, holm oak forests and fertile floodplains. When the Cantabrian Sea swells in autumn, surfers come to ride one especially long wave that breaks over the river-mouth sand bar outside Mundaka harbour. The food alone is reason to visit, and the neighbouring port of Bermeo has been declared \u201cTuna World Capital\u201d by a local business alliance dedicated to sustainable fishing. I feel obliged to try some at Rola, house restaurant of the Hotel Nafarrola, recently opened by two Bermeo-born siblings at a former dairy farm on the mountain above town. \u201c\u2018Sustainability\u2019 can mean many things these days,\u201d says Josu Goikoetxea Larrauri, while I eat an immaculate tuna tartare prepared by his brother Gaizka, a chef who trained at San Sebasti\u00e1n\u2019s fine dining institution Zuberoa. \u201cTo us it means fish from this harbour, meat from this valley, txakoli from small bodegas close to us.\u201d That signature Basque white wine fills much of the cellar they built outside, and the field out front will soon be a small vineyard. In the garden, we catch uninvited goats stealing precious Hondarrabi Zuri grapes already planted. They will not leave quietly, and Josu calls the farmer to come and drag them home. The bells round their necks sound loud and clear across these slopes, as indeed do occasional peals from medieval chapel bells on surrounding peaks and promontories. Next morning, I climb the 241 stone steps to the ninth-century hermitage at San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, overtaking a few exhausted nuns on the steep, narrow coastal causeway. In midsummer, pilgrims ascend to ring the bell three times, conferring blessings on the brave souls who work these waters. Cristina Krug is one of those, a local anthropologist turned river guide who drives me back up the estuary on her motor launch, a decommissioned naval patrol boat she bought online and had painted in friendlier colours. Born and educated in Bilbao, Krug moved here to marry a cargo ship crewman \u2013 and has since heard all the abiding myths of ancient mariners. The clanging bells of early Christians are said to have scared off the lamiak, an indigenous subspecies of mermaid from native folklore, who drowned or saved sailors according to their whims. \u201cBasque language and culture are so much older than in other parts of Spain, and even Europe,\u201d says Krug, navigating us around sandbanks and salt meadows. \u201cI don\u2019t think Catholicism ever fully took hold here.\u201d She tells me about bone picks and shells excavated from the nearby Santimami\u00f1e caves, just north of Guernica, where early mollusc farmers moved into the former home of Palaeolithic ancestors who painted aurochs on the walls. To Krug, it seems that a somewhat pagan spirit prevails in this watery place and its people. Fishing is in deep decline now, she says. More jobs and revenues are needed, and are promised by the new Guggenheim outpost, along with assurances of minimal environmental impact. Anecdotally speaking, Krug says residents are dubious: \u201cWe know better how delicate this ecosystem is. But nobody asked us.\u201d For now, peace prevails at the bird centre. On the path across the marsh I sit down inside a wooden hide and lose the twilight hours checking birds I see against their pictures on the wall. It bothers me, as I get older, that I don\u2019t know the names for all the beautiful things of this world. But here they are in Latin, English, Spanish and ancient Basque. The coot is kopetazuria in that language. The teal is zertzeta arrunta. The mighty osprey is arrano arrantzalea, though one solitary male is known to the team as Muxar. He\u2019s never been banded or tracked, but Muxar has returned for the last seven autumns, and become so comfortable that he spends the winter here, never flying any farther south. The distances are so vast, the hazards so great \u2013 who would not stay right here if they could? Local rail network Euskotren operates trains from Bilbao to Forua, the closest stop to Urdaibai Bird Center. Doubles at the onsite hotel from \u00a380pp (two-night minimum stay) via booking.com. Dinner at Rola is reserved for guests of the Hotel Nafarrola but open to the public for lunch by reservation. Cristina Krug operates estuary tours from \u00a316pp an hour"

As the Cop29 summit in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku begins its second week, representatives from Vanuatu and Tuvalu have called on Australia to stop approving new fossil fuel developments, including a proposal to extend the life of Woodside\u2019s North West Shelf gas facility until 2070. Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu\u2019s special envoy for climate change, said Australia was \u201cnot acting in good faith\u201d when it stood alongside Pacific leaders on the global stage and promoted its climate credentials while continuing to approve coal and gas projects. \u201cAs the world\u2019s third largest fossil fuel exporter, the Australian government is exporting climate destruction overseas, including to Pacific nations like Vanuatu, who experience the most devastating impacts of the climate crisis, despite contributing the least,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is climate injustice.\u201d Regenvanu urged Australia to do more to address accelerating climate impacts and back up an agreement at the Cop28 summit in Dubai last year that the world needed to transition away from fossil fuels. Maina Talia, Tuvalu\u2019s climate change minister, said pursuing efforts to limit global heating to an average 1.5C \u2013 a headline goal of the landmark 2015 Paris climate deal \u2013 was \u201cnot just a number\u201d but a \u201clifeline for Pacific communities facing rising seas, accelerating extreme weather disasters and the erosion of our cultures\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cWe will continue to keep industrialised countries accountable for their actions,\u201d he said. \u201cOur future lies solely in their hands.\u201d Australia\u2019s climate change minister, Chris Bowen, arrived in Baku on Saturday for the ministerial section of the fortnight-long talks. He is co-leading what is considered the most important stream of negotiations, which aim to develop a new global climate finance goal to help developing countries. Analysis from a group of respected economists has found it should be US$1tn a year by 2030. Bowen is also lobbying for Australia to co-host the Cop31 climate summit in 2026 in partnership with Pacific countries. Australia is competing with Turkey to host the event. Bowen detoured to the Turkish capital of Ankara en route to Azerbaijan for meetings to try to reach agreement in the consensus-based decision-making process on where the summit will be held. Turkey later said it planned to continue with its campaign. Pacific leaders are largely supporting the Australia bid for what has been described as \u201cthe Pacific Cop\u201d, and have argued it should focus on lifting commitments to cut emissions and support the most vulnerable in the region. Their comments, including by the leaders of Tonga and Palau last week, have highlighted the renewed pressure that will come on Australia to act on fossil fuel exports if it is successful. Speaking in Azerbaijan, Talia said a partnership between Australia and Pacific nations to co-host Cop31 would be \u201can exciting opportunity to accelerate ambitious climate action in our region\u201d but \u201ca commitment to end new fossil fuels must lie at the heart of this\u201d. \u201cThat means no new coal and gas, and a fair, fast phase-out of all fossil fuels,\u201d Talia said. Activists say emissions from the gas processed at the plant on the Burrup Hub, in WA\u2019s north, could result in up to 6bn tonnes of emissions once it was exported and burned overseas. The Australian government also approved an expansion of three thermal coalmines that could lead to more than 1bn tonnes of emissions when the fuel is burned. Bowen told Guardian Australia he agreed the biggest impact Australia could have on the climate was to replace fossil fuel exports with renewable energy exports, and argued the country was aiming to become a \u201crenewable energy superpower\u201d, but said it was a big task that would take time. He said cutting off fossil fuel supply before there were replacements and while others still exported coal and gas was \u201cnot the way you get this job done\u201d. On Friday, the Australia government said it was committing $125m to improving energy security and power grid transition in the Pacific. Bowen said: \u201cEach step we take to fight climate change is a step back from the brink, and Australia is dedicated to working with our Pacific neighbours to make sure our next steps are the right ones.\u201d An assessment of Australia\u2019s climate performance by Climate Action Tracker last week rated the country\u2019s commitments as \u201cinsufficient\u201d to live up to what it should be doing to play its part in responding to the climate crisis. It found Australia\u2019s finance commitments were \u201ccritically insufficient\u201d. The analysis said Australia had introduced several measures aimed at stimulating investment in renewable energy and clean industries but also doubled down on fossil fuels. Bill Hare, from Climate Action Tracker, said emissions within the country from fossil fuels were \u201cflatlining\u201d, but this had been masked by changes in government estimates of emissions from forests. Shiva Gounden, from Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said Australia would \u201cbe judged by its actions, not its words\u201d. \u201cTo be a true partner of the Pacific, we ask the government to genuinely respond to Pacific needs. This means a fair share of contributions to the Loss and Damage fund, ending fossil fuel approvals and subsidies, and accelerating much-needed climate finance,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2024-11-26T18:21:20Z",
            "content": "London\u2019s historic Smithfield meat market is to close for good after the City of London Corporation voted to pull out of plans to relocate it and Billingsgate fish market to Dagenham. The corporation, which owns and operates the central London site of the centuries-old market, had earlier this month put on hold relocation plans to a new \u00a31bn site in Dagenham, east London, to review the \u201cfinancial sustainability\u201d of the planned move. The court of common council, the main decision-making body for the corporation, voted on Tuesday to pull out of running the sites. A market has existed around the Smithfield site for more than 800 years. The corporation was given the right to run it and other wholesale food markets in 1327 by Edward III. The current market site was built in the 1860s and opened in 1868. It was designed by the architect Horace Jones, who also designed Billingsgate when it was redeveloped in the 19th century. The UK\u2019s largest inland fish market was moved to its current site in Canary Wharf in 1982. The corporation said it will provide financial compensation to market traders, who will be able to continue their operations at the markets until at least 2028. Compensation could total more than \u00a3300m, according to the Times. The authority is said to want to turn the Smithfield site into a mixed-use cultural development alongside the London Museum, which is in the process of relocating to part of the Smithfield site where the poultry market was. There are proposals to transform the land of the current Billingsgate site for a mixed-use housing scheme. Announcing the decision, the corporation said it was \u201cactively supporting traders to identify suitable new sites\u201d and they can continue their operations at Smithfield and Billingsgate until at least 2028. It added that its decision reflects a \u201ccareful balance between respecting the history of Smithfield and Billingsgate markets and managing resources for this project responsibly\u201d. Project costs had risen owing to a number of external factors, including inflation and the increasing cost of construction that have made the move unaffordable, it said. Both Smithfield and Billingsgate markets are governed by acts of parliament, effectively fixing the markets to the existing sites and imposing certain rights, restrictions and obligations as to the use of the land. A bill, which will be deposited in parliament on Wednesday, is required to repeal that legislation, and enable the land of the existing sites to be used for other purposes. Chris Hayward, the corporation\u2019s policy chair, said it was \u201ca positive new chapter for Smithfield and Billingsgate markets\u201d and the decision \u201cempowers traders to build a sustainable future in premises that align with their long-term business goals\u201d. \u201cBy stepping back from direct market operations, we will help to create opportunities for these businesses to thrive independently. We\u2019ve worked closely with the traders and thank them for their input and understanding. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to making sure they have the financial support and guidance they need to transition seamlessly and successfully to new locations.\u201d The Times reported that three king\u2019s counsel barristers, who sit on the 100-strong court, had written to the corporation\u2019s \u201ctown clerk\u201d warning that the private vote could be \u201cunlawful\u201d because a study into the importance of the markets to London\u2019s food supply, demanded by the court this year, has not yet been produced. The corporation told the Times that its own lawyers were \u201csatisfied\u201d with the legality of the vote. Meanwhile, Henry Pollard, the chair of the markets committee, had written to his court colleagues warning that \u201cthe process here is wrong\u201d, criticising the lack of a food security report and warning that the additional compensation to the traders \u2013 \u201can unquantified amount [of] over \u00a3300m\u201d \u2013 could be a misuse of public funds, it was reported. Dominic Twomey, the leader of Barking and Dagenham council, said: \u201cWhile this is disappointing news, we understand the financial pressures that key investment projects are facing with soaring inflation in recent years. We are committed to continue working with the City of London Corporation to unlock the huge potential of the Dagenham dock site to bring new employment uses and high quality jobs for local people.\u201d The corporation \u2013 which is one of the country\u2019s wealthiest local authorities but has its own financial pressures \u2013 has reportedly already spent \u00a3308m on the markets move, including a \u00a3115m compensation payment to traders in Smithfield\u2019s poultry market which shut last year."

            "date": "2024-11-28T18:34:57Z",
            "content": "Prepare for the dance. Aviva is a big grown-up FTSE 100 insurer with a respected chief executive who doesn\u2019t launch takeover offers on a whim; Amanda Blanc will have a strategy to go the distance. Direct Line, on the other hand, is a troubled FTSE 250 insurer with a new-ish chief executive, Adam Winslow, whose turnaround plan has not been applauded wildly by the stock market. Aviva\u2019s 250p-a-share, or \u00a33.3bn, offer for Direct Line therefore looks to be the opening shot in a negotiation. The target\u2019s board spouted the standard form of words \u2013 \u201chighly opportunistic\u201d and a \u201csubstantial\u201d undervaluation \u2013 but will also know there will be a price at which it will be obliged by its own shareholders to roll over and talk terms. This tussle looks to be about where that price lies. Within a 270p-290p range, one suspects. Aviva starts as a heavy favourite to prevail. Direct Line\u2019s robust rejection of 250p was still justified. Since the group said no as recently as February to a 233p offer from the Belgian insurer Ageas, any other response would have been odd. But a fellow UK insurer such as Aviva is clearly a more formidable predator when, as with Ageas, the offer comes in a mix of cash and shares, and the bidder\u2019s promise of \u201cmaterial\u201d post-takeover cost savings is greater. As many as a third of Direct Line\u2019s shareholders may already have a slice of Aviva, so should be comfortable with the idea of owning a bit more. Aviva\u2019s timing also looks sound. Winslow, an ex-Aviva executive as it happens, had to be given a chance to pitch his self-help plan, which he did in the summer. But, if the share price is still stuck in the 150p-180p range \u2013 having been 300p-ish before the profit warnings of 2022 and 2023 \u2013 the market is saying it expects any recovery to be a long haul. In those circumstances, the accusation of opportunism carries no sting. Viewed the other way around, Direct Line\u2019s shareholders are being offered the opportunity to take tomorrow\u2019s value today. A near-60% takeover premium (before any improvement in terms) ain\u2019t bad in an insurance market where recovery takes time because you cannot rewrite the premiums on the policies overnight. One open question is whether the Competition and Markets Authority will have a look. Possibly. In home insurance, the combo could emerge as the biggest player; in motor, market shares move around, but this may be a case of the third- and fourth-largest operators getting together. But does that amount to a meaningful reduction in competitive forces? Possibly not. Direct Line\u2019s share price surged 41% to 224p, suggesting the market is confident there\u2019s more bidding action to come. Aviva\u2019s fell 2%, sufficiently small to encourage Blanc to think she hasn\u2019t frightened her own shareholders and can afford to add a few pennies to get the deal done. Nobody is sentimental about insurers, even those such as Direct Line that were pioneers in their day. Prediction: it will all be over by Christmas."

            "date": "2024-11-11T23:13:14Z",
            "content": "Israel\u2019s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said on Monday that \u201ccertain progress\u201d had been made on ceasefire talks in Lebanon, where Israel has been engaged in fighting Hezbollah for more than 13 months. \u201cWe will be ready to be there if we know, first of all, that Hezbollah is not on our border, is north of the Litani River, and that Hezbollah will not be able to arm with new weapons systems,\u201d Saar said. He added that diplomatic efforts were taking place through US mediation, but that the lack of an enforcement mechanism in any future deal remained a stumbling block. Israel\u2019s stated objective in its ground invasion of south Lebanon was to enable the return of residents of north Israel, of whom tens of thousands have been displaced since Hezbollah began firing rockets \u201cin solidarity\u201d with Hamas on 8 October 2023. Israel has said that Hezbollah would need to retreat north of the Litani, 18 miles from its northern border, to ensure the security of north Israel. Diplomatic efforts were not only confined to US channels, as Israel\u2019s army radio reported that Israel\u2019s minister of strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, visited Russia last week to discuss ways to reach a ceasefire in Lebanon. Saar said Russia could play a role in a ceasefire agreement by helping ensure that arms do not flow to Hezbollah via Syria, where Russian troops are present. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, also met a number of Arab leaders, including Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II and the crown prince of Kuwait, at the Arab-Islamic Summit in Riyadh on Monday. Despite the reported progress on a ceasefire deal, Hezbollah has said that it had not seen any actual proposal come across its desk, nor does it expect to anytime soon. Mohammad Afif, the head of Hezbollah\u2019s media office, said at a press conference on Monday: \u201cThere is great movement between Washington and Moscow and Tehran and a number of capitals. \u201cI believe that we are still in the phase of testing the waters and presenting initial ideas and proactive discussions, but so far there is nothing actual yet.\u201d Any ceasefire in Lebanon would have to be approved by Hezbollah, and presumably its patron, Iran. Hezbollah\u2019s secretary general, Naim Qassem, has said the group is ready for a ceasefire with Israel and that it has backed away from its previous demand that a ceasefire in Gaza come before it stops fighting. Despite apparent movement on a ceasefire deal, Israel\u2019s military announced on Sunday that it was expanding its ground assault in southern Lebanon. The head of Israel\u2019s military, Herzi Halevi, approved the expansion of the ground operation in southern Lebanon, which could involve thousands of more permanent and reserve soldiers, Israel\u2019s state broadcaster, Kan, reported. Israel\u2019s defence minister, Israel Katz, said on Sunday that Israel had defeated Hezbollah and that further gains could be made in Lebanon. \u201cNow it is our job to continue to put pressure in order to bring about the fruits of that victory,\u201d Katz said. He added that he hoped Lebanon would join other countries in normalising relations with Israel. Israel said that its ground invasion of southern Lebanon, which it launched on 30 September, would be \u201climited and targeted\u201d and was aimed at dismantling Hezbollah infrastructure in the area. Wide swathes of the border area in southern Lebanon have been flattened since then, with dozens of border villages partly or completely destroyed by Israel. Hezbollah has been reportedly fighting against advancing Israeli troops, with Afif, its media office head, claiming on Monday that Israel has not been able to \u201coccupy one single village\u201d in 45 days of fighting. The extent of Israel\u2019s progress in southern Lebanon is unclear, but Israeli troops and tanks have been photographed as far as two miles inside southern Lebanon. More than 3,190 people have been killed and more than 14,000 wounded by Israel in Lebanon since fighting began a year ago, the vast majority in the last two months."

            "date": "2024-11-18T18:00:14Z",
            "content": "It was mission accomplished for England, after their 3-1 T20 series win against West Indies capped off a \u201cperfect\u201d white-ball tour of the Caribbean, according to the interim head coach, Marcus Trescothick. On a trip where several young players were given opportunities, with four given debuts, Trescothick believes England successfully struck the balance between winning and learning after three weeks that have left the side in a better place than the one that arrived. Trescothick, whose time as the temporary coach came to an end after the final match of the series with Brendon McCullum assuming the white-ball role from January, said that results on the pitch have been \u201cbrilliant\u201d after England secured their first away T20 series win in more than two years. \u201cIf you look at the end result,\u201d said Trescothick, \u201cwe\u2019ve won one of the two series and we\u2019ve won various games in both series that we\u2019ve played and we\u2019ve seen more players. So you sit back and you look at it on paper and go \u2013 perfect. \u201cOf course, the balance is that you always want to win. But I think if we\u2019d have had one objective on this trip, more than anything else that was to see the players we\u2019ve seen and see whether they\u2019re going to be good enough next week, next month, next year, or for three years\u2019 time.\u201d Trescothick singled out Jacob Bethell and Saqib Mahmood for \u201csuperb\u201d performances, with the former England opening batter backing the 21-year-old Bethell to emulate Harry Brook\u2019s success across all formats. Bethell impressed across the entire tour of the Caribbean, making three half-centuries in seven innings and confirming England\u2019s suspicions that they have a player of real talent on their hands. So much so that despite a meagre red-ball record, with zero centuries in 20 first-class appearances, Bethell has been selected for England\u2019s upcoming Test trip to New Zealand, where he is expected to be the reserve batter. \u201cAll the attributes are there,\u201d Trescothick said of whether Bethell could make the switch from white ball to red. \u201cIf you had markers to be able to go, right, you need to do this, this and this, he\u2019d be knocking on the door for that. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why he can\u2019t break through and succeed, because he\u2019s flourished in both formats that we\u2019ve seen in the recent period of time. You could almost see him being the next youngster after Harry Brook, the real exciting one coming through for the next journey this group will take.\u201d The series saw the return of Jos Buttler to the England setup after four months out with a calf injury. Upon arriving in the Caribbean, Buttler admitted that he had feared for his captaincy after consecutive disappointing World Cups and how he hoped this next period of his career would be the most \u201crewarding\u201d. Batting at No 3 to allow Phil Salt and Will Jacks to open, Buttler was soon back to his best, making 83 off 45 balls in the second T20, and was creative in his captaincy throughout, often employing highly attacking fields and positioning himself at short-leg in several matches. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been an easy time being captain of the team for a period of time,\u201d said Trescothick. \u201cWe know the results and it\u2019s been challenging. And that always makes it tough, of course it does. \u201cYou can sort of see it falling back into place for him almost, a little bit where it\u2019s hopefully some more enjoyable times coming forward with the growth of the team, but also with other players coming back in and a bit more settled structure with the coaching as well.\u201d The final makeup of England\u2019s coaching staff across red and white-ball teams is expected to be made during the New Zealand Test tour, where Trescothick will resume his previous role of assisting with the Test batters. Elsewhere, Buttler has said that Ben Stokes and Joe Root are not guaranteed to return to England\u2019s white-ball setup, with the Champions Trophy only two months away. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly,\u201d Buttler said of whether the pair will be back in February. \u201cIt\u2019s conversations for the next few weeks with the guys in charge. The guys here have played really well. Some of the young players have done themselves no harm at all. There are people who aren\u2019t here who will have aspirations to be in the white-ball side as well. It\u2019s really exciting. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for them individually but I hope they have white-ball aspirations. They\u2019re two great players.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-20T17:33:49Z",
            "content": "The US envoy Amos Hochstein has said there is \u201cpositive progress\u201d towards a ceasefire in Lebanon after talks in Beirut aimed at ending 13 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Hochstein has met Lebanese officials over the past two days after Hezbollah indicated it had agreed to the text of a US ceasefire proposal, although with some comments. He said on Tuesday that the gaps between Hezbollah and Israel had \u201cnarrowed\u201d, raising optimism about a deal between the two parties. Hochstein will meet Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, on Thursday. Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah started on 8 October 2023 after Hezbollah launched rockets at northern Israel \u201cin solidarity\u201d with Hamas\u2019s attack the day before. The two sides engaged in low-grade, tit-for-tat fighting until late September, when Israel launched an intense aerial campaign across Lebanon and a ground incursion in the south. Since then, almost all of Hezbollah\u2019s senior leadership has been killed and the group has faced continual losses on and off the battlefield. The fighting in Lebanon over the past year has killed 3,544 people, displaced 1.2 million, and destroyed swathes of south Lebanon. The World Bank said the conflict had so far cost Lebanon $8.5bn. Over the past week, Lebanese, Israeli and US officials have said that a ceasefire was increasingly possible \u2013 though the details of what that would entail are not yet clear. Central to ceasefire negotiations is the presence of Hezbollah in Lebanon\u2019s south and its sway over the country in general, the politics of which it has dominated for the past decade. Israel has said it wants Hezbollah to be pushed back beyond the Litani River, 20 miles away from its border, as a form of security guarantee for people in northern Israel, tens of thousands of whom have been displaced by Hezbollah rocket fire over the past year. It had previously also said it wanted the power to unilaterally enforce a ceasefire agreement, which would give it de facto permission to carry out airstrikes in Lebanon at will. The Lebanese speaker of the house, Nabih Berri, said last Tuesday that \u201cno sane person\u201d would agree to such a condition. Israel and western mediators have pointed to an increased presence of the army in south Lebanon as a way of ensuring Hezbollah did not build up its arsenal along the border, as it did after the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. Hezbollah has not objected to this proposal publicly. In a speech shortly after the conclusion of Hochstein\u2019s visit, Naim Qassem, Hezbollah\u2019s secretary general, said the group was working on \u201ctwo tracks, the field and the negotiations\u201d, and would not stop fighting until a ceasefire was signed. He said Hezbollah would not accept any truce that allowed Israel to enter Lebanon \u201cwhenever it wants\u201d. In the days leading up to Hochstein\u2019s visit, Israel escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking central Beirut three times in 24 hours after a break of more than a month. Hezbollah, in turn, launched missiles at Tel Aviv and attacked five military bases in Haifa. Initially, Hezbollah said that its purpose in attacking Israel was to force a ceasefire in Gaza \u2013 and refused to enter into negotiations before that was achieved. However, the killing of its senior leadership and thousands of its members, in addition to the continual progress Israeli forces have made in south Lebanon, has led the group to abandon a Gaza ceasefire as a prerequisite for negotiations. On Wednesday, Qassem said: \u201cOur second battle after the battle to support Gaza began two months ago \u2026 which is to repel the comprehensive aggression against Lebanon.\u201d As diplomatic efforts to end hostilities in Lebanon intensified, the US vetoed a UN security council vote on Wednesday demanding an \u201cimmediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire\u201d in Gaza because it did not explicitly link a truce to the release of hostages. Members of the council voted 14-1 in favour of the resolution, but it was not adopted owing to the US\u2019s stance, which as a permanent member of the council can veto resolutions. A US official told Reuters that the resolution had been \u201ccynically\u201d designed by Russia and China to provoke a US veto after new language the US said it would support was rejected. Negotiations aimed at a lasting ceasefire in Gaza and the release of approximately 100 Israeli hostages, who are still being held by Hamas after being captured in the group\u2019s attack on Israel last October, have repeatedly failed. Qatar announced earlier this month that it was quitting its mediation role until Israel and Hamas show \u201cwillingness and seriousness\u201d in the talks. Israeli forces killed at least 48 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, including a rescue worker, health officials said. An Israeli strike killed the rescue worker as the civil defence was responding to an airstrike in the Sabra area of Gaza City. Israeli also struck a school-turned shelter in the centre of Gaza, killing three and injuring 20. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strikes. Israel launched a new ground and aerial offensive on northern Gaza in early October that it said was necessary to tackle regrouped Hamas cells. Sweeping evacuation orders for the 400,000 people the UN estimated remained there, the blockage of aid and food deliveries and the targeting of civilian infrastructure such as hospitals have led rights groups to accuse Israel of the war crime of seeking to forcibly displace the remaining population. Israel has denied that it is systematically removing Palestinians from the area or using food as a weapon, both illegal under international law. Almost 44,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began 13 months ago, according to the health ministry in Gaza."

            "content": "World leaders have promised to try to stop the planet heating by more than 1.5C (2.7F). But current policies put the temperature rise on track for 2.7C, a report has found. The expected level of global heating by the end of the century has not changed since 2021, with \u201cminimal progress\u201d made this year, according to the Climate Action Tracker project. The consortium\u2019s estimate has not shifted since the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow three years ago. \u201cWe have clearly failed to bend the curve,\u201d said the lead author of the analysis, Sofia Gonzales-Zu\u00f1iga, from Climate Analytics. The expected level of warming is slightly lower when considering government pledges and targets, at 2.1C, but has also not changed since 2021. Warming in the most optimistic scenario rose slightly from 1.8C last year to 1.9C this year, the report found. Changes in average global temperatures that sound small can lead to massive human suffering. Last month, a study found half of the 68,000 heat deaths in Europe in 2022 were the result of the 1.3C of global heating the world has seen so far. At the higher temperatures that are projected for the end of the century, the risk of irreversible and catastrophic extremes is also set to soar. The findings were released as climate negotiators converge on the Cop29 summit in Azerbaijan for fraught negotiations over greenhouse gas pollution and the money needed to deal with it. The flatlining of progress comes despite the world seeing breakneck change in the rollout of clean technologies that can replace coal, oil and gas. The report found fossil fuel subsidies have also hit all-time highs, and funding for such projects quadrupled between 2021 and 2022. Prof Niklas H\u00f6hne, a climate scientist at the NewClimate Institute in Germany, said it was \u201cnot a paradox\u201d to see rising emissions while renewables boomed. \u201cIn recent years, fossil fuels have won the race against renewables, leading to increasing emissions,\u201d he said. Still, he added, \u201crenewables surprise us each year\u201d with faster growth than expected. He said they would soon crowd out fossil fuels. \u201cIt allows a much faster decline in emissions than we thought only three years ago.\u201d Climate scientists say every fraction of a degree matters for the health of people and the planet. The researchers warned their median warming estimate of 2.7C by 2100 had a wide enough margin of error that it could translate into far hotter temperatures than scientists were expecting. \u201cThere is a 33% chance of our projection being 3C or higher, and a 10% chance of being 3.6C or higher,\u201d said Gonzales-Zuniga. The latter would be \u201cabsolutely catastrophic\u201d, she added. A handful of world leaders at Cop29 expressed frustration at the slow pace of progress after 28 UN climate summits. \u201cWhat on earth are we doing in this gathering?\u201d the Albanian prime minister, Edi Rama, asked his fellow heads of state on Wednesday. \u201cWhat does it mean for the future of the world if the biggest polluters continue as usual?\u201d Others pointed to progress made despite the shortcomings. \u201cMeetings like these are often perceived as talking shops,\u201d said the Belgium prime minister, Alexander De Croo. \u201cAnd yes, these strenuous negotiations are far from perfect. But if you compare climate policy now to a decade ago, we are in a different world.\u201d"

            "content": "Dean Huijsen revived an old tradition here. When was the last time you saw a footballer not just swap shirts with his opponent but immediately put it on too? As the final whistle went, the Bournemouth defender who was born in Amsterdam but represents Spain where he was raised, made straight for Samuel Iling-Junior who, like him, had played at Juventus. He moved like a young man on a mission, which it turned out he was. They embraced and when Huijsen finally walked off he was wearing white, a No 14 on the back. It had been that kind of night, a familiarity and a sort of mutual admiration about the place, something of themselves seen in each other. Something shared, and not just, as it turned out, the scoreline. At the end, ball boys holding camera phones had run on seeking out Jobe Bellingham, who had played over an hour on his U21 debut, while players from each side made their way towards familiar faces, of which there were many. This was a friendly that was, well, friendly. For Mateo Joseph especially. When he was a kid and summer tournaments came round, there would be two flags hung on the balcony at his home in Santander: one England, one Spain. He had played for England at the U20 World Cup; five of his opponents here were former teammates, staff all people he knew. And it was not just him: under the stand a big group gathered, more shirts exchanged; some time later, they were still there, talking. About everything really, not only football, and not just because the actual match had finished 0-0. These are the European Champions at U21 and senior level; in 2023 England had beaten Spain in the final, in 2024 Spain had beaten England. Here they met for the first time since Berlin, the first at U21 level since that final in Batumi, Georgia. This time it was set up as preparation for the Euros in the summer, another chance to learn from each other, so maybe it didn\u2019t matter. And maybe that helped too. That night, a Curtis Jones goal won it along with a late, late penalty save from James Trafford. It had been tense, there had been confrontations. This week there was even talk of revenge in Spain but it wasn\u2019t personal and ultimately it lacked any edge: of the men there then, only the Spain coach Santi Denia was left. Everyone else had moved on; mostly, they had moved upwards. And that is the point. This could be seen not as a story in its own right, but as part of a process. They had chosen quite the venue for it: the 9,500-capacity Municipal de La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n, home of Real Balomp\u00e9dica Linense, where Jack Harper is top scorer, is as near to Britain as it is possible to get. La L\u00ednea \u2013 the Line \u2013 is the frontier town, separated from Gibraltar by the airport runway where no Spanish flights land. The rock rises over the stands on one side. On the other, the straits, tankards going by, wind whipping in, waves crashing. On the pitch, this time there was nothing to separate the two countries on either side of that runway. Well, there was: the crossbar, for a start. In the last minute, Hugo Bueno had rattled that, but there had been no winner, not this time. Only Spain were ever likely to be. \u201cI\u2019m happy but not entirely because the shot didn\u2019t go in,\u201d Joseph said afterwards. \u201cA couple of times it went right through the area which was annoying. We were closer than them.\u201d He was not wrong: the approach play was occasionally superb from wide positions and he was the intended beneficiary, close often. Three sort-of chances came from a combined seven or eight yards, but each time the opportunity, and the ball, was just out of reach. James Beadle made one superb low save and later even than Bueno\u2019s shot, Pablo Torre headed just wide, which seemed to sum things up. Spain had taken 17 shots to England\u2019s six. None of those taken by Ben Futcher\u2019s side were on target. Which is not to say that Lee Carsley is coming back to something barren, far from it. Not least because he knows there are other players who are likely to return if only, he will hope, temporarily. Noni Madueke, Morgan Rogers, Lewis Hall, Curtis Jones, Anthony Gordon, Rico Lewis, Morgan Gibbs-White have all worked with him at this level and, now, senior level too. Injury played a part but it is not chance: it is a plan, a commitment. Carsley had said that England could learn from Spain. Which is why they were here of course, why this friendly was worthwhile, but it went deeper: this is more about the process, the continuity, that line that connects U21s and seniors, represented by the coaches as well as the players. And that is already underway, even if Carsley\u2019s decision to step down might suggest that it is broken. Spain, the country that do this best, see much that is good in their opponents too. \u201cFrom my point of view, the English are working very well \u2013 very, very well,\u201d Denia insisted here. \u201cThey have won at U17, U21 level. They are giving chances to young players. In this current England senior squad, they have five or six players who were part of this U21 team. That\u2019s like what we do: invest, gives coaches the tools. These are two teams that historically play very well \u2013 with different identities but England have very, very good quality too \u2013 and in my opinion the English FA works wonderfully.\u201d If England wanted to come to play Spain, the feeling here in the shadow of the rock was mutual. They\u2019re not so different; as they departed here, they were even wearing the same shirts."

            "date": "2024-11-12T05:00:48Z",
            "content": "Britain has a \u201chuge opportunity\u201d to get ahead of other countries in the race for green investment after the election of Donald Trump as US president, Keir Starmer has said, as he arrives in Azerbaijan for the Cop29 summit. Trump\u2019s election victory last week has cast doubt on global efforts to tackle climate change, which the president-elect has called a \u201choax\u201d. But as the most senior world leader attending the summit in Baku, Starmer said the global political turmoil could benefit the UK economy. Asked about Trump\u2019s position on the climate crisis, Starmer said: \u201cThe climate challenge is something that we have got to rise to and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve repeatedly said we\u2019ve got to show leadership. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s more than just an obligation, it\u2019s a huge opportunity. The UK has a huge opportunity to get ahead here when it comes to renewables \u2013 that\u2019s why I\u2019m encouraging as much investment as I can when it comes to carbon capture, when it comes to hydrogen, when it comes to offshore wind.\u201d He added: \u201cThere\u2019s a global race on now to be the global leader on this. I want us to be in the race and I want us to win the race.\u201d Starmer arrived in Baku on Monday evening as one of only two G7 leaders to attend the summit, alongside Italy\u2019s Georgia Meloni. Several other developed countries have been engulfed by political uncertainty, including Germany, where the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is facing a confidence vote, and France, where president Emmanuel Macron lost a parliamentary election earlier this year. This year\u2019s climate conference has also been overshadowed by last week\u2019s US presidential election result, given that Trump has promised to pull the country out of the Paris climate agreement for a second time. During the campaign, the incoming president called climate change \u201ca big hoax\u201d, and condemned Biden\u2019s package of green subsidies as the \u201cgreen new scam\u201d. British government officials believe that if Trump begins to unwind the Biden-era incentives it could drive international investors to other countries, with the UK hoping to capture much of that money. As part of that effort, ministers announced on Monday evening they would give offshore wind developers an extra \u00a327m for every GW of capacity they create to help build up the supply chain. The money will be paid on top of the subsidies developers already get as part of the government\u2019s auction process. The government is also launching a new financial instrument to be launched on the London Stock Exchange, allowing international investors a fast and easy way to put money into the UK green industry. Starmer told reporters on Monday: \u201cLook where investors are putting their money \u2013 they are choosing to put it into renewables because they know that\u2019s where the next big opportunity is.\u201d The prime minister stopped in Paris on his way to Baku, where he spent the morning at a Remembrance Day event alongside the French president, Emmanuel Macron. He told reporters afterwards that he had used a bilateral meeting with Macron to discuss Ukraine\u2019s fight against the Russian invasion, which European leaders fear Trump will no longer be willing to fund. Donald Trump Jr, his son, posted a picture of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, over the weekend with the caption: \u201cPOV: You\u2019re 38 Days from losing your allowance\u201d. Starmer said after his meeting in Paris: \u201cI\u2019ve always said that we support Ukraine for as long as it takes, and we\u2019re stood by that.\u201d He would not say however whether the pair had discussed trying again to persuade the outgoing president, Joe Biden, to allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles against Russian territory \u2013 one of Zelenskyy\u2019s key demands. When he arrives in Baku, Starmer will spend much of his time talking about climate finance, with this year\u2019s Cop being badged as an opportunity to talk about private investment into green industries. \u201cNow is the time for the private sector to start paying their fair share in relation to these commitments,\u201d the prime minister said, as he promised to hit Boris Johnson\u2019s target of spending \u00a311.6bn on international climate finance between 2020-21 and 2025-26. On Tuesday, he will announce how much the government plans to cut carbon emissions by 2035. The Climate Change Committee has recommended the UK cut its emissions by 81% from their 1990 levels, though the country is already behind a separate target of cutting them 68% by 2030. Starmer\u2019s trip to Baku is one of several foreign visits he is making over the autumn, with the prime minister expected to have spent 22 days out of 77 outside the country since the start of September. The prime minister defended his foreign travel on Monday, saying it helped further his two main priorities: the economy and immigration. Those priorities present a narrower vision of his government\u2019s ambitions than the five missions he set out before the election. But they are also the two main reasons voters in the US say they voted for Trump."

            "content": "Although it has been argued that under-threes should not have any screen time at all, research has found that digital tech can offer \u201crich opportunities\u201d for young children\u2019s development. A two-year study, Toddlers, Tech and Talk, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and led by researchers from Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU), working with Lancaster, Queen\u2019s Belfast, Strathclyde and Swansea universities, looked at children\u2019s interactions with everything from Amazon Alexa to Ring doorbells, in diverse communities across the UK, to find out how tech was influencing 0- to three-year-olds\u2019 early talk and literacy. It examined how children use technology with parents or by themselves, whether taking photos and videos, using learning apps and playing games, listening and singing to songs, talking about favourite characters, or chatting on video calls. The researchers found that children were not only interacting with smart devices and appliances when very young, but also that digital tech could have benefits for language development and other skills. \u201cThe evidence generated through this study suggests that young children\u2019s digital activity often involves sensory exploration through touch, vision, hearing, movement and embodied cognition,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn short, very young children are often feeling, thinking and moving when they engage with digital media, which is integrated seamlessly in many homes as part of everyday life. \u201cAlthough parents recognise the many benefits of tech for children\u2019s development, they balance this with concern that too much tech is detrimental to their child.\u201d The report described how video calls created \u201crich opportunities\u201d in multilingual households for children to learn words and phrases from across languages, and about the cultures of relatives overseas. \u201cThrough these digitally mediated conversations, very young children \u2026 develop the capacity to switch seamlessly between languages,\u201d promoting \u201ccognitive growth\u201d and \u201cforging loving relationships\u201d with relatives, the report said. The study, which surveyed 1,400 parents in the UK, including 40 case studies in family homes, with 20 education professionals interviewed, also looked at families\u2019 TV habits, and found \u201cseveral parents mentioned that their child had learned specific words and phrases when watching certain programmes intently\u201d. It added that for some parents, watching TV or listening to music together \u201coffer opportunities for parents and children to forge and cherish shared experiences, which sediment over time into strong affective bonds\u201d. The report said that even in homes where the TV was on in the background all day, \u201ceach young case study child appeared to occupy themselves with a wide range of play and learning activities in the same room \u2026 and paid very little attention to the TV\u201d, with a 25-month-old girl in whose home CBeebies was on, whenever at home, showing \u201chighly developed skills with a wide range of traditional play resources both with and without her mother\u2019s help\u201d. \u201cMany parents\u201d reported their child aged under three had learned signing online, the report said, with one child trying to use signing to tell Google Home what they wanted, before gradually learning that \u201csmart home devices respond to very clearly enunciated words\u201d. At the same time, children too young to have \u201cclear diction\u201d were learning through observation to manipulate smart devices in other ways, such as tapping, the report said. Researchers hope their findings will be used to inform policy and good practice, with parents agreeing there was a need for greater protection of children\u2019s privacy and security. Rosie Flewitt,professor of early childhood communication at MMU, said: \u201cParents are highly aware of opportunities and tensions around their children\u2019s use of digital technology. They balance beneficial opportunities for their children to communicate with others, play and learn, with concerns over possible damaging effects of overuse.\u201d"

            "content": "Andy Haldane is right to argue for more investment in the social infrastructure of the arts (Labour should \u2018invest big\u2019 in arts and culture projects, says top economist, 27 October), but a new generation of flagship venues in UK cities isn\u2019t necessarily the answer. Of the many factors surrounding this issue, three are most important. First, community-led venues are often at the heart of local places, programming vibrant work that reflects the lives of people living outside cities and where inequalities, including rural poverty, also exist. Second, financially stretched local councils carry the responsibility of maintaining many of the UK\u2019s existing network of cultural buildings, all of which need substantial ongoing investment and repair. Third, the evidence of agglomerated economic benefits from large urban cultural regeneration schemes isn\u2019t conclusive. Creating the social and physical infrastructure that can broaden access to the arts, including programmes that reflect socially and culturally diverse communities across the UK, is a systemic policy issue. When it comes to more capital investment in new buildings, joined-up thinking about how it will integrate with existing infrastructure and be financially sustainable is needed.

            "content": "Leading British actors including Mark Rylance, Olivia Colman, and Benedict Cumberbatch have called on the chancellor to increase investment in clean energy by reforming pensions. Members of the performing arts union Equity have written an open letter to Rachel Reeves before her Mansion House speech on Thursday asking her to make \u201csmart, strategic reforms\u201d that could unlock \u00a31.2tn from the pensions sector for growing clean energy and infrastructure in the UK. Other notable signatories include Stephen Fry, Jodie Whittaker, Paapa Essiedu, Alex Lawther, Freddie Fox, Ritu Arya, Will Attenborough, Leila Mimmack and Tom Burke. The letter celebrates Equity moving its \u00a3130m pension scheme to a fund with extensive fossil fuel exclusions. \u201cThis progress isn\u2019t just good for our planets and our pockets \u2013 it\u2019s hugely popular, too,\u201d the signatories say. \u201cResearch, by Make My Money Matter, shows that just one in five people in the UK believe their retirement savings should invest in fossil fuel developers. By contrast, two-thirds of all British pension holders want their scheme to invest in clean energy. \u201cThe appetite is clearly there to put our money into companies offering solutions to the climate and nature crises we face. Now we need to harness the extraordinary, untapped potential of our pensions to build a safer world.\u201d Reeves is expected on Thursday to propose an overhaul of the UK\u2019s pension funds in order to unlock billions of pounds of investment. The letter encourages the Labour government to follow through on a key manifesto pledge of requiring financial institutions to adopt science-based plans for limiting global heating. Equity says this means pension funds, banks and insurers could no longer do business with companies expanding fossil fuels. The letter also asks the government to update fiduciary duty law, so that acting in savers\u2019 \u201cbest interests\u201d means taking the impacts of climate change and damage to nature into account. Rylance said: \u201cWhen we change, the whole world changes. Divesting from businesses and practices which are not harmonious with life on Earth is, I believe, an essential step for all of us to consider.\u201d \u201cPensions are a powerful driver in society. I do not want this time of enormous challenge for all life on our planet to become a story of force, dictatorship, fear and war. Let us change the story by changing ourselves as a union of artists and choosing life over profit.\u201d Equity\u2019s move marks the culmination of a campaign first launched in 2017 by Attenborough and Mimmack to ensure union members\u2019 savings were aligned to sustainability, which was backed by a number of British film and television stars including David Harewood and Maxine Peake. Equity said an estimated \u00a388bn of UK pension savers\u2019 money was invested in fossil fuel companies \u2013 about \u00a33,000 for each pension holder. It said the union\u2019s new default fund would not invest in companies involved in thermal coal, or those making more than 10% of their revenue from oil and gas. The process of moving artists\u2019 money away from fossil fuels took several years because funds that exclude oil, gas and coal have in the past been considered higher risk, it added. Attenborough and Mimmack said they were \u201cnow looking to our political leaders to back us up\u201d. Equity\u2019s general secretary, Paul W Fleming, said: \u201cEquity\u2019s members have power because they act together as a collective. The climate crisis is a problem built by capitalism, and capitalism alone won\u2019t fix it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why we need unions like Equity doing all they can to push for change, whether in negotiations with producers over Green Riders, or leveraging our members\u2019 pension investments against fossil fuel extraction. We can push the bosses who made this crisis to play their part in the green Industrial Revolution we need.\u201d"

The former Chelsea and Manchester United midfielder, who now plays for Western Sydney Wanderers in Australia\u2019s A-League, is the first active player to become a partner in a US franchise. San Diego will be part of the Western Conference from 2025. The award of an expansion slot was announced in May 2023, with San Diego chosen ahead of Las Vegas, whose bid was backed by the owners of Aston Villa. The 2025 launch came too late for Mata to be involved as a player, with the Spanish midfielder, who had been released by Vissel Kobe in January, eventually joining Sydney as a free agent in September. Now he has become a part owner with a small shareholding while he continues as a professional, unlike David Beckham, whose ownership of Inter Miami had been written into his contract with MLS when he joined LA Galaxy, but was not announced until he had retired. San Diego are owned by the British-Egyptian billionaire and former Conservative Party donor and treasurer Mohamed Mansour and by a Californian Native American tribe, the Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation. They paid a reported $500m (\u00a3395m) for the expansion slot. Mansour, who served as a transport minister in the Hosni Mubarak government, was given a knighthood by Rishi Sunak in March having previously donated \u00a35m to the Tory party. In 2021, the Mansour Group bought the Right to Dream football academy in a $120m takeover, which is where the relationship with Mata originates. Right to Dream, founded in Accra in 1999 by the former Manchester United scout Tom Vernon, had been one of the organisations that became part of Mata\u2019s Common Goal charity. Vernon is a founding partner of San Diego. Right to Dream, a non-profit organisation, also owns FC Nordsjaelland in Denmark and FC Masar in Egypt. In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Mata said: \u201cJoining San Diego FC as a partner is an exciting opportunity to help build something truly special in a city and league that are experiencing incredible growth. The commitment of both this Club and Right to Dream to community impact, excellence, and a vision for long-term success aligns perfectly with my own values. I look forward to contributing my experience and passion for the game and working alongside everyone here to build a Club that inspires both on and off the pitch.\u201d"

Speaking at the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) leaders summit, which assembles 21 of the world\u2019s largest economies, Albanese told a press conference that Apec leaders consistently \u201cspoke about the importance of free and fair trade between our economies to lift up the living standards of people throughout this region\u201d. Albanese met the Indonesian president, Prabowo Subianto, and Peruvian president, Dina Boluarte, on the sidelines of the summit in Lima as he attempted to promote and bolster Australia\u2019s trade interests ahead of Trump\u2019s return. Albanese also said he had a \u201cfriendly\u201d private discussion with the US president, Joe Biden, at the meeting who he said was \u201cin good form\u201d, while Albanese confirmed he did not speak to China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cI met with the Apec Business Advisory Council representatives, speaking about inclusive trade and investment, \u201d Albanese said. Asked about work to lift trade tariffs with China, Albanese said: \u201cI\u2019m not a commentator \u2026 but what I\u2019ve done with China is work in the way that we said we would before the election.\u201d \u201cWhether it\u2019s coal, barley, wine, other products, including seafood and others, people are in employment in Australia today because of our trade,\u201d he said. The Australian Institute of International Affairs\u2019 chief executive, Bryce Wakefield, said \u201cthe election of Donald Trump has overshadowed everything\u201d at the forum. \u201c[Biden] is sort of a mega lame-duck president because not only is he going out of office, but the president following him, it\u2019s clear that his policies are going to be starkly different to Biden\u2019s,\u201d Wakefield said. Trump has flagged tariffs on imports to the US of between 10 and 20%, and up to 60% on Chinese goods. That has led nations to pivot their trade priorities, including potential shifts towards China but also among the middle nations in the region. \u201cYou can predict a lot more coordination between mid-sized economies as they attempt to diversify their relations away from the United States during such a fraught period,\u201d Wakefield said. Despite that, Australian trade might benefit should the incoming president scrap his predecessor\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which encourages green energy investment in the US. \u201cA lot of that investment may now be redirected towards countries with resources that are crucial to the green economy, and Australia is one of those countries with important resources like lithium that are used in batteries.\u201d Australia would be pushing to liberalise trade through measures such as digitising trade documents to increase efficiency, promoting its green agricultural products and building on trade cooperation, former trade minister and Australian Apec Study Centre director Craig Emerson said. \u201cWe are great champions of free and open trade, and it gives Australia an opportunity to reaffirm that,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Australia\u2019s acting prime minister and minister for defence, Richard Marles, will host Japan\u2019s minister of defence, Gen Nakatani, and US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, for the 14th trilateral defence ministers\u2019 meeting on Sunday in Darwin.

New polling data by YouGov found that 53% of respondents think a permanent display about Britain\u2019s role in the trade of enslaved African people would be appropriate, while two-thirds believe the British Museum has a role in educating the public about the UK\u2019s history in the slave trade. When asked whether they agreed with the statement: \u201cAs a society, public education about the reality of the British empire is important in order for us to understand Britain\u2019s multicultural society today\u201d, 72% of respondents said they did. The online polling was co-commissioned by the Good Law Project and the World Reimagined, an art education programme best known for its globe sculptures created by artists including Yinka Shonibare that appeared in several UK cities and addressed legacies of slavery. They believe that the ongoing renovation of the museum\u2019s sites, which has been billed as \u201ca complete holistic transformation, top to bottom, inside out, buildings, collection, visual identity\u201d by its new director Nicholas Cullinan, should include a permanent exhibit focusing on Britain\u2019s role in the transatlantic slave trade. The World Reimagined co-founder Michelle Gayle, who has previously backed calls for more black history to be taught in schools, said a permanent exhibition would be a chance for the UK to truly look its past in the eye. She said: \u201cthe British Museum\u2019s ambitious redevelopment is a chance to present history accurately and inclusively. George Osborne calls it the most significant transformation in the museum\u2019s history \u2013 will it still downplay such a vital part of our shared history? \u201cThe YouGov poll shows the British public hopes not. Let\u2019s seize this moment to showcase how Britain truly was, how it is, and how it aspires to be \u2013 a nation unafraid to confront its history and honour the contributions of all.\u201d Cullinan recently said in an interview with the Financial Times that he believes there needs to be a focus on \u201ccoexistence and cultural exchange\u201d amid the institution\u2019s reported \u00a31bn \u201cmasterplan\u201d overhaul. The British Museum has recently engaged with its own collection\u2019s connections with colonialism and the slave trade. A temporary exhibition by the British-Guyanese artist Hew Locke placed his own works alongside those plundered by Britain when it was a colonial power, and was described as \u201cinescapably, deeply shocking\u201d by the Guardian. In 2020, the British Museum moved a bust of Hans Sloane, the naturalist whose artefacts helped form the British Museum\u2019s original collection, into a new case where it could explain his links to slavery. Sloane\u2019s wealth came from the profits of his wife\u2019s Jamaican plantations, and he invested in the South Sea Company, which traded with enslaved Africans. A British Museum spokesperson said it was \u201copen and transparent\u201d about the origins of the collection and \u201cactively encourages debate on issues related to it\u201d. They said: \u201cOur current exhibition created by the contemporary artist Hew Locke looks fully and critically at the issue of the transatlantic slave trade, and the Enlightenment Gallery has a permanent dedicated display. We also have a Collecting and Empire trail, which explores how the collection was shaped by this period of history. \u201cWe recognise our role in educating visitors on all aspects of human history and evolving displays, so we are providing our visitors with the best possible experience.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-26T16:49:43Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose steep tariffs on goods imported into the US has set the stage for a bitter global trade war, according to trade experts and economists, with consumers and companies warned to brace for steep costs. The president-elect announced on Monday night that he intended to hit Canada, Mexico and China with tariffs on all their exports to the US \u2013 until they reduce migration and the flow of drugs into the country. As officials in the three countries scrambled to respond, Keith Rockwell, a former director at the World Trade Organization, predicted that Trump\u2019s move could spark a trade war. \u201cThe United States exports hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods to these countries,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who expects that they will stand pat and not retaliate has not been paying attention.\u201d China promptly suggested that both sides would lose from an escalation in economic tensions. \u201cNo one will win a trade war or a tariff war,\u201d Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson at the Chinese embassy in Washington, wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s deputy prime minister, and Dominic LeBlanc, its public safety minister, touted the country\u2019s \u201cbalanced and mutually beneficial\u201d economic ties with the US. Hours after Trump issued the announcements on Truth Social, his social media platform, economists at ING released research that estimated his broader campaign proposals on trade \u2013 including a universal tariff of between 10% and 20% on all goods imported from overseas, and a 60% tariff on all goods from China \u2013 could cost each US consumer up to $2,400 each year. \u201cThis potential increase in consumer costs and inflation could have widespread economic implications, particularly in an economy where consumer spending accounts for 70% of all activity,\u201d James Knightley of ING said. It is unclear whether Trump, who has described \u201ctariff\u201d as \u201cthe most beautiful word in the dictionary\u201d, will follow through on this plan. Tariffs \u2013 levies paid for by the company importing foreign goods \u2013 are not popular with voters, even Trump\u2019s voters. A Harris poll conducted for the Guardian found 69% of people believe they will increase the prices they pay. And while he threatened universal tariffs while campaigning for the White House, this proposal \u2013 a 25% duty on all goods from Mexico and Canada, and a 10% duty on China, on top of existing duties \u2013 is more targeted. \u201cTrump\u2019s statements clearly herald the dawn of a new era of US trade protectionism that will sweep many US trading partners into its ambit,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, former head of the IMF\u2019s China division. \u201cSuch tariffs will have a disruptive effect on US as well as international trade, as countries around the world jockey to soften the blow of US tariffs on their own economies and try to find ways to evade the tariffs.\u201d On the campaign trail, Trump and his allies claimed such measures would help strengthen the US economy and \u201cmake America wealthy again\u201d. Many economists took a different view, warning that sweeping tariffs would increase the price of goods for US consumers, and risk prompting other nations to retaliate, hitting US businesses exporting goods to the world. But in his announcements on Tuesday, Trump did not focus on the economic benefits has claimed tariffs would bring. Instead, he blamed Mexico and Canada for \u201cridiculous Open Borders\u201d he alleged were prompting an immigration crisis, and China for \u201cthe massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl\u201d arriving in the US \u2013 and pledged to impose tariffs on these countries until they addressed his concerns. \u201cTrump apparently sees tariffs as a tool with broad uses in tackling a variety of malign external factors that have adverse effects on the US economy, society and national security,\u201d noted Prasad, now a professor of trade policy at Cornell University. The billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who endorsed Trump, wrote on X that the president-elect \u201cis going to use tariffs as a weapon to achieve economic and political outcomes which are in the best interest of America\u201d, in a bid to deliver on his \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy strategy. Making such announcements on social media \u201cis a great way for Trump to effect foreign policy changes even before he takes office\u201d, Ackman claimed. As Trump builds out his broader trade strategy, Rockwell, formerly of the WTO, said a 10% universal tariff would me \u201cmore manageable\u201d than 20%. \u201cBut if you raise it 20%, that creates a different dynamic,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see much, much less demand for these products coming in. \u201cThere will also be, without any doubt, retaliation,\u201d he added. European officials \u201chave got their list drawn up\u201d, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most closely guarded secret in Brussels, but it\u2019s drawn up.\u201d Countries will hit back with tariffs on \u201cpolitical pinch points\u201d, Rockwell predicted. Under the last Trump administration, the European Union targeted US exports including Harley-Davidson bikes, Levi\u2019s jeans and Kentucky bourbon."

            "date": "2024-11-16T19:10:21Z",
            "content": "The former head of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has said that the UK should side with the European Union over trade and economic policies rather than a Donald Trump-led US, as fears grow over a possible global trade war. Pascal Lamy, who was head of the WTO from 2005 to 2013, said it was clear that the UK\u2019s interests lay in staying close to the EU on trade, rather than allying with Trump, not least because it does three times more trade with Europe than the US. His comments came after a key Trump supporter, Stephen Moore, said on Friday that the UK should reject the EU\u2019s \u201csocialist model\u201d if it wanted to have any realistic chance of doing a free trade deal with the US under Trump and, as a result, avoid the 20% tariffs on exports that the president-elect has promised. In an interview with the Observer, Lamy said: \u201cIt\u2019s an old question with a new relevance given Brexit and given Trump. In my view the UK is a European country. Its socio- economic model is much closer to the EU social model and not the very hard, brutal version of capitalism of Trump and [Elon] Musk. \u201cWe can expect that Trump plus Musk will go even more in this direction. If Trump departs from supporting Ukraine, I have absolutely no doubt that the UK will remain on the European side. \u201cIn trade matters, you have to look at the numbers. The trade relationship between the UK and Europe is three times larger than between the UK and US. \u201cThis is a very structural inter-dependence which will hardly change unless \u2013 which I don\u2019t think is a realistic assumption \u2013 the UK will decide to leave the EU norms of standards, to move to the US one. I don\u2019t believe that will happen. \u201cMy answer is that the option to unite politically, economically and socially with the US and not with Europe makes absolutely no sense. I believe that, for the UK\u2019s interests and values, the European option remains the dominant one.\u201d Ivan Rogers, the former British ambassador to the EU, said it was clear that after Trump\u2019s re-election the UK would have to choose between the US and EU. \u201cAny free trade agreement that Trump and his team could ever propose to the UK would have to contain major proposals on US access to the UK agricultural market and on veterinary standards. It would not pass Congress without them. If the UK signed on the dotted line, that\u2019s the end of the Starmer proposed veterinary deal with the EU. You can\u2019t have both: you have to choose.\u201d Their remarks come as Keir Starmer heads to Brazil on Sunday for a meeting of the G20 where issues of global security and economic growth are set to dominate. The prime minister is expected to hold talks with President Xi of China, on whose country Trump is proposing to slap huge 60% import tariffs. Trade experts expect that the US will demand that the EU and UK follow suit, which both will strongly resist for their own trade reasons. The UK is seeking to increase trade with Beijing while also stepping up efforts to find greater ways to access the EU single market. Last week, the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, made clear that leaving the EU had \u201cweighed\u201d on the domestic economy. A government source said that developing a trade strategy in the new world order was now the top priority. \u201cIt has gone from being very important to being number one in the one tray [following Trump\u2019s re-election].\u201d However, Jo\u00e3o Vale de Almeida, the former EU ambassador to London, said he believed there was common \u201cterritory for agreement\u201d which would involve minimal pragmatic deals between the EU and the UK, and the US and the UK. \u201cWe know that Trump will try to divide European member states and divide the UK and EU. This is already what [Nigel] Farage is trying to do. But I think we can walk and chew gum at the same. \u201cGiven that a fully fledged trade deal with the US is not possible because agricultural issues will get in the way, and an EU deal is limited by UK red lines, any deals will have to be limited. So there may be a way through.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-10T17:23:14Z",
            "content": "Ukraine has carried out its biggest drone strike on Moscow since Vladimir Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022, Russian media said on Sunday, as the Kremlin launched its own record air attack over Ukraine. Three airports in the Russian capital were temporarily closed and flights were diverted. At least one person was injured. Russia said its air defences shot down 70 drones, nearly half of them in the skies above Moscow and the rest in western Russia. The general staff of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces said it successfully targeted an ammunition dump near the Russian city of Bryansk. Video showed multiple explosions coming from warehouses on the military site. Fires could be seen burning in the night sky. Other footage posted on Russian Telegram channels recorded drones buzzing above urban areas including suburbs of multistorey buildings and a lorry park. Ukrainian commentators said the strike on Moscow was in response to a massive Russian drone barrage directed at Kyiv on Thursday, soon after Donald Trump was elected as US president. On Saturday and Sunday, Moscow sent over another wave of 145 drones, the largest number yet. There was damage to the Black Sea port of Odesa. Ukrainian officials said 62 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were downed and others lost en route. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said it had thwarted a \u201cterrorist attack\u201d on its territory using \u201cairplane-type drones\u201d. At least 36 planes were diverted, the country\u2019s air transport agency said. Both sides have developed innovative and increasingly sophisticated UAV programmes. Ukraine has established its own drone command and has improved the range of its systems, with attacks hundreds of kilometres into Russia. It has hit weapons storage units, oil processing facilities and enemy airstrips near the Arctic Circle, as well as naval vessels in the Caspian Sea. Russia has begun using drones steered by fibre-optic cables in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops control a salient around the Russian town of Sudzha. The new drones cannot be jammed with regular electronic countermeasures. The air attacks happened as Russia reportedly massed 50,000 soldiers to launch a major assault aimed at recapturing Ukrainian-held territory in Kursk oblast. The force, which includes North Korean reinforcements, is likely to attack in the coming days, according to a US assessment cited on Sunday by the New York Times. Pyongyang has sent 11,000 troops to take part in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week. Russia has seized a dozen or so villages and has shrunk the area controlled by Ukraine. But despite carrying out numerous attacks \u2013 using guided bombs, kamikaze drones, and infantry groups \u2013 it has been unable to dislodge dug-in Ukrainian combat units. Trump\u2019s victory has fuelled speculation that Russia\u2019s 10-year-old war against its smaller neighbour may be coming to a close. Zelenskyy spoke to Trump last week and also chatted to Elon Musk, after Trump passed the phone to the billionaire. The president-elect famously boasted he could fix the war in Ukraine in \u201c24 hours\u201d. Vladimir Putin has indicated he is ready to listen to what Trump has to say, with a pre-condition that the US cease military assistance to Ukraine before bilateral relations can be improved. Zelenskyy is ready to fly to the US this week and hold substantive talks with Trump, sources in Kyiv indicated. Their most recent phone call was \u201cvery positive\u201d, they added. The two met last month in Trump Tower when Zelenskyy flew to New York for the UN general assembly meeting. Trump\u2019s aides have previously sketched the outlines of a Russia-friendly \u201cpeace plan\u201d. It would involve current frontlines being frozen, with the de facto loss by Ukraine of Crimea and much of the east of the country, plus a veto or a long-term pause on Kyiv\u2019s Nato application. What Trump will actually propose in office remains unclear. Musk\u2019s views on Ukraine are wildly contradictory. He has provided Ukraine with Starlink satellite internet, which is used extensively on the frontline and is a crucial tool for Ukraine\u2019s military. Zelenskyy thanked Musk for Starlink during their conversation. At the same time, Musk has echoed Kremlin talking points, calling for Crimea to be made part of Russia and for Ukraine to remain neutral. He has held secret talks with Putin, the Wall Street Journal recently reported. There was no sign of panic on Moscow\u2019s boulevards after the drone attack, agencies reported on Sunday. Muscovites walked their dogs, and the bells of the onion-domed Russian Orthodox churches rang out across the capital."

Junior doctors were incensed by the fact that their pay relative to others had stagnated. They work as hard as anyone and this erosion of their pay was generally felt to be unfair, so their industrial action attracted widespread public support. Farmers equally feel unfairly singled out over inheritance tax, especially when, in the same week, Rachel Reeves eased the rules on bankers\u2019 bonuses. Nobody likes paying tax, but most reasonable people can see that it is necessary to fund public services. The way to sell taxes to the public is by developing a fairer tax system and being honest about the implications of any changes. If sliding scales were used (ie gradual increases) instead of tax bands, I think it would help. This should apply to income tax, inheritance tax and council tax. John Harradence Colwall Green, Herefordshire \u2022 Rafael Behr\u2019s column is a reminder that good government depends on aligning three elements: policy, communications and reality. It\u2019s a knack we seem to have lost. Brexit was an example of a skilful communications campaign that hasn\u2019t delivered in reality because the policy wasn\u2019t thought through. The hard reality of Covid broke all three legs of the stool. And now with the winter allowance and farm inheritance tax, the government is struggling to get the right balance. Both have legitimate goals, but neither appears fully thought through, particularly on thresholds. As Behr underlines, both suffer from a wider issue \u2013 people aren\u2019t convinced of the link between means (higher taxes) and ends (making infrastructure fit for purpose).

            "content": "The Harry Potter actor Rupert Grint has been ordered to pay \u00a31.8m in taxes after a legal dispute with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Grint, best known for playing Ron Weasley in the film franchise, was told to pay the figure in 2019 when HMRC questioned one of his tax returns. HMRC disputed \u00a34.5m in income he received during the 2011-12 tax year, claiming it should have been taxed as regular income rather than as a capital asset. The 36-year-old actor, who was the sole shareholder of a company managing his business affairs, claimed the payment was related to residual income and bonuses from the Potter films. Grint\u2019s lawyers argued he should only have to pay capital gains tax, which would have been at a rate of 10%. However, HMRC said the money should be taxed as income, subject to a higher tax rate of 52%. Judge Harriet Morgan ruled in favour of HMRC, dismissing Grint\u2019s appeal, and said the money \u201cderived substantially the whole of its value from the activities of Mr Grint\u201d, which was \u201cotherwise realised\u201d as income. It is not the first time the actor\u2019s tax affairs have been subject to court proceedings. Grint also lost a separate court case in 2016 involving a \u00a31m tax refund. A tax tribunal judge rejected the actor\u2019s appeal against an HMRC block on him using a change in accounting dates to shield his earnings from the higher 50% tax rate. The actor was calculated to have earned about \u00a324m from the Potter franchise. Judge Barbara Mosedale described how Grint had followed advice from tax advisers Clay &amp; Associates to change his accounting date so that 20 months of income would be taxed in 2009-10. The judge said Grint wished to bring forward to the earlier year liability for payments on eight months\u2019 worth of income otherwise due in the tax year 2010-11 \u2013 the year the top rate of tax rose from 40% to 50%. Mosedale said if the date change had been accepted it would have led to a 10% saving on income \u2013 about \u00a31m, according to Grint\u2019s accountants. Grint appeared in all eight of the Harry Potter films between 2001 and 2011, and has since appeared in the films Into the White and Knock at the Cabin, as well as working in TV and theatre. Grint has been approached for comment."

            "content": "Rachel Reeves has committed not to increase taxes at Labour\u2019s next budget and said the government would need to \u201clive within the means\u201d of her spending plans if public services came under mounting pressure. After announcing the biggest package of tax rises in three decades in last week\u2019s budget, the chancellor dismissed suggestions that she would need to find additional money by the spring to repair battered public services. Asked whether more funding would be required for \u201cunprotected\u201d government departments at next spring\u2019s budget and spending review \u2013 including for local councils, courts and prisons \u2013 she insisted enough was now earmarked for the next five years. \u201cWe\u2019ve now set the envelope for spending for this parliament,\u201d she told MPs on the Commons Treasury select committee. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be coming back with more tax increases, or indeed more borrowing. We now need to live within the means we\u2019ve set ourselves in the budget and those allocations of spending totals,\u201d she said. The chancellor admitted over the weekend that she had been wrong to say before the election that no major tax rises would be needed, and promised there was no need to increase taxes further after last week\u2019s budget raised \u00a340bn. Her response to the committee form her toughest comments yet on Labour\u2019s future plans for the economy, in terms likely to signal that tight budget settlements await certain government departments in the spending review. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said last week that an extra \u00a39bn in tax increases could be needed to avoid a fresh period of austerity for some Whitehall departments. Reeves also came under pressure after a rise in government borrowing costs in financial markets, as some City investors reacted to the prospect of higher levels of government debt and fewer Bank of England interest rate cuts. The chancellor said last week\u2019s budget included plans for day-to-day spending to grow at an average of 2% a year in real terms between 2023-2024 and 2029-2030, which she described as a significant increase. Defending her plans under questioning from MPs on the committee, Reeves said Labour\u2019s first budget in almost 15 years was a unique moment to \u201cdraw a line in the sand\u201d with the previous government and reset the public finances. \u201cIn terms of whether we\u2019ll be doing something similar in the future? No. This was a budget to reset,\u201d she said. \u201cIt means our public finances are now on a firm footing and the trajectory of public spending is much more honest, so we\u2019re never going to need to do a budget like this again. \u201cThis was a once in a parliament reset so that we start on the right foot. And also to give businesses, families and markets confidence that we now do have our public finances on a firm footing.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-08T13:19:58Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s the economy, stupid. So said James Carville when he was advising Bill Clinton in his 1992 presidential campaign and the phrase is as true now as it was 32 years ago. Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris this week for the same reason he lost to Joe Biden in 2020: millions of Americans were unhappy about the economic record of the incumbent party. Two out of three voters this week thought the US economy was on the wrong track \u2013 and that spelled trouble for Harris. The question is whether they will feel any differently at the end of Trump\u2019s second term in the White House, when it ends in 2029. Looking at some of the policies proposed by the president-elect, it is by no means certain that they will. Trump is not a man to undersell himself and while campaigning said he had created during his first term the \u201cgreatest economy in the history of our country\u201d. While clearly hyperbole, Trump\u2019s record in the first three years of his presidency was impressive. The US economy grew strongly, inflation averaged about 2%, 6.7m jobs were created and the unemployment rate fell to 3.5%. Then, in the fourth year of his presidency the economy was hit by the Covid 19 pandemic. Lockdowns meant 20 million Americans lost their jobs and the unemployment rate shot up to 15%. A deep recession in 2020 pulled down the average growth rate to 2.3% across Trump\u2019s first term. So what is Trump proposing for the economy when he replaces Biden in January? 1. Lower taxes Trump loves cutting taxes, and reductions for business and individuals are priorities for his second term. While plans are sketchy he has promised to cut corporation tax for companies that make their products in the US, from 21% to 15%. This is part of the president-elect\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda, with one of the world\u2019s most competitive tax regimes designed to prevent US companies outsourcing production overseas and to persuade foreign manufacturers to move to the US. He wants to make permanent the income tax cuts made in 2017 but which are due to expire next year. With the US on course to run a 7% of GDP budget deficit this year, critics have said tax cuts worth up to $7.5tn over the next 10 years are unaffordable, given that the US national debt is already 122% of GDP. Trump says he has a way of paying for them. 2. Tariffs Trump says he will pay for the tax cuts by imposing tariffs on foreign goods entering the US and has floated the idea of a 60% to 100% levy on Chinese products and a 10%-20% levy on goods from the rest of the world. The Tax Foundation, a US thinktank, has estimated a 10% universal tariff would raise $2tn over 10 years, while a 20% tariff would raise $3.3tn \u2013 well short of what would be needed to fully offset the revenue losses of making the 2017 tax cuts permanent. The impact of the tariffs will be to raise prices in the shops and reduce the spending power of US consumers. Some estimates suggest the losses for the average US household could be between $2,500 and $3,900. Those who voted for Trump on the basis that he will deliver lower inflation and faster growth in living standards could be in for a shock. 3. Drilling and the environment The centrepiece of Joe Biden\u2019s industrial strategy was the Inflation Reduction Act, which was designed to stimulate green growth through a system of tax incentives and subsidies. Trump has criticised the act for being too expensive, and plans to ban offshore wind projects and give the go-ahead for the resumption of large-scale oil and gas drilling. While analysts expect longstanding tax credits for onshore wind to remain in place, America under Trump is not going to be in the vanguard of the fight to achieve net zero. Trump has summed up his energy policy in three words: \u201cDrill, baby, drill.\u201d 4. Interest rates, the dollar and the Federal Reserve The US economy is operating at close to capacity and unemployment is low. Tax cuts will increase demand, while higher tariffs will push up prices. Higher inflation will be the result and that will mean America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, will be more cautious about cutting interest rates. If US borrowing costs stay higher for longer, the US dollar will rise on the currency markets, offsetting some of the impact of tariffs by making imports cheaper. If his first term is any guide, Trump will put pressure on the Fed to cut rates. The US central bank reduced US borrowing costs by 0.25 points on Thursday but its chair, Jerome Powell, clearly expects trouble. Asked if he would step down if Trump asked him to go, and if he could be legally ordered to do so, Powell replied \u201cno\u201d and \u201cnot permitted under the law\u201d. 5. Migration and deregulation Trump says he will begin immediately the deportation of the estimated 11 million people living in the US without legal status, although he has given few details of how they would identify the individuals involved. He also plans to complete the project launched in his first term: the building of a wall along the border between the US and Mexico. If successful, these policies would reduce the supply of low-cost labour and push up business costs. Trump favours business deregulation, including dismantling the safeguards put in for artificial intelligence, ending the \u201cpersecution\u201d of the crypto industry, and making Elon Musk the head of a government efficiency commission with the task of cutting \u201cred tape\u201d. 6. What does it all add up to? Trump only has four years as president so will be in a hurry to move forward with his tax cuts, import tariffs, energy policy and deregulation. But the chances are that lower taxes will have a sugar rush effect, with their impact fading as dearer imports and higher interest rates slow the economy. The risks of it going wrong are high. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 November 20214. Figures from the Tax Foundation of the estimated income from 10% and 20% universal tariffs have been calculated over 10 years, not annually as an earlier version said."

            "date": "2024-11-25T05:00:34Z",
            "content": "Felicity Nelson remembers her 17-day detention last September vividly. The 34-year-old Ghanaian activist was one of 53 people arrested at a road junction in Accra after demonstrating alongside hundreds of other youths against illegal mining. In detention, the group found a 54th person in their midst who had not been at the protest but was apprehended after visiting Oliver Barker-Vormawor, the protest\u2019s organiser in hospital. Nelson, who is asthmatic, was denied access to inhalers in her cell, which she said reminded her of slave dungeons used during the transatlantic human trade. \u201cNo light, no air, just holes in the ceiling for ventilation,\u201d said the activist, who relied on food brought by her family and friends while she was being held. The west African state, led by Nana Akufo-Addo, a human rights lawyer, has long been seen as a beacon of democracy. However, activists and rights groups say civil freedoms are being eroded by authorities reluctant to tackle illegal mining, a practice that began before independence when the former British colony was still named the Gold Coast. The illegal mining is known as \u201cgalamsey\u201d, a pidgin contraction of the phrase \u201cgather them and sell\u201d, in reference to the way in which artisans gather alluvial deposits dispersed by large-scale activity of mining corporations. The practice exploded in two phases: first after a 1989 law formalised artisanal mining and then as unemployment rates rose because of a weakening economy in recent years. Today, galamsey accounts for more than a third of the annual gold output from Ghana, the world\u2019s sixth largest gold producer. More than 1 million people are employed in the informal mining sector across 14 of its 16 regions, costing the state an estimated annual $2bn (\u00a31.58bn) in missed tax revenues. \u2018No longer a blessing but a curse\u2019 These days, deep craters and huge piles of sand \u2013 evidence of illegal mining sites \u2013 flank miles of roads in the countryside, while ads for galamsey gold appear on TikTok. The mining has had a negative impact on the cocoa industry, Ghana\u2019s other major export commodity, because farmlands have been uprooted by galamseyers. \u201cWe are putting all our eggs in one basket \u2026 we are losing our cocoa,\u201d said Father Joseph Kwame Blay, a researcher and priest in Jema, a big cocoa community in central Ghana that outlawed galamsey and instituted vigilantes to keep diggers out. \u201cIt\u2019s not just poverty, it\u2019s shortsightedness. People just want money immediately.\u201d Activists say most of Ghana\u2019s rivers have been muddied by soil washed off the gold, as well as mercury and detergent used in the washing process. The Ghana Water Company\u2019s capacity to supply clean water to some parts of the country has been reduced by 75%. Researchers from the University of Cape Coast say Ghana may have to import water by 2030. \u201cYou know the Offin [River]? It\u2019s now like Milo,\u201d one elder in the Dunkwa-on-Offin community said, referring to a popular west African chocolate beverage. \u201cGold is no longer a blessing but a curse.\u201d One teacher\u2019s union has linked galamsey to a rise in pupil absenteeism, as children leave school to either mine or sell food by mining sites \u2013 a bad omen in Ghana, where one in five children are already not in education. Even those in school are at risk: in March, two students fell into an abandoned pit in the Central region on their way home. Meanwhile, prospectors and sex workers continue to converge in Ghana from across west Africa, in search of fortunes. There has also been an influx of Chinese nationals, some of whom have recruited soldiers and policemen to guard their sites during mining operations. Last December, as an Accra court convicted a Chinese woman called Aisha Huang for illegal mining, the judge expressed regret that she could not hand out more than the then maximum five-year penalty to the defendant, who had previously been deported for the same crime. \u201cShe came back with a new personality, different name and date of birth and carried on her illegal activities with impunity,\u201d the judge said. The penalty has since been revised to 25 years\u2019 imprisonment. Ghana\u2019s \u2018Chinatown\u2019 The curious case of Wassa Akropong, a galamsey hotspot in western Ghana, offers a glimpse into the ecosystem: hundreds of Chinese people have established machinery stores, casinos, clinics, pubs and restaurants. Less than a kilometre from the town\u2019s police station is China Market, a mall with, among other things, gold trading shops and pedicure shops. Unsurprisingly, the town is now known as \u201cChinatown\u201d. Several local miners said the gold rush had been accelerated by a gamechanging Chinese technology: the Changfan, a multipurpose machine that allows exploration in the riverbeds. In August 2022, soldiers burned 838 Changfans. \u201cWe are pussyfooting around the issue,\u201d Nelson said after dozens more were destroyed in October, accusing the government of playing \u201cPR games\u201d rather than rooting out the issue. After winning his first four-year term, Akufo-Addo said he was prepared to \u201cput my presidency on the line\u201d to end galamsey. As he prepares to exit office, many say his government has failed to act because it is scared of losing votes in the forthcoming election in districts where the electorate are perpetrators. More than 2,000 artisanal mining licences were issued between 2017 and 2021 according to data from the Ghana Mining Repository, amounting to 95% of all licences handed out between 1989 and then. Some of the licences have been linked to ruling party members. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about such reports,\u201d said Haruna Mohammed, the party\u2019s deputy general secretary. \u201cThe firefighters are themselves the arsonists,\u201d said Awula Serwah, the Accra-based coordinator of Eco-Conscious Citizens, an environmental nonprofit. \u201cSome of this galamsey money is used for [funding] elections.\u201d \u201cEven those [Ghanaians] who have licences have a company and then they give the work to Chinese nationals or non-Ghanians,\u201d she added. The spotlight has also been beamed on local administrators including traditional rulers. As owners of customary land in Ghana, they have the power to allocate freely and have been accused of being willing collaborators in galamsey. In August, a prominent monarch stripped three of his chiefs of their titles for being complicit in the practice. \u201cThis is gold business, it\u2019s making the [chiefs and politicians] a lot of money,\u201d said Nelson. \u201cWe\u2019re talking thousands and thousands of dollars.\u201d Akufo-Addo\u2019s predecessor John Mahama, whose government expelled 45,000 Chinese nationals in 2013 after raiding galamsey sites, has said he would tackle the practice if he won the presidential election this December. The incumbent has accused his rival of politicising the issue, saying the latter once promised amnesty for perpetrators. The fight goes on Despite the complexity of challenges, more local people say they are determined to save their country. Patrick Danso, a teacher turned activist in Atronsu in western Ghana, says Chinese intermediaries tried to bribe him in August to stop his activism. The father of five says he refused as he has a responsibility to \u201csecure the future for his kids\u201d and protect his cocoa farm \u2013 \u201chis pension\u201d. In September, a civil society coalition including Serwah\u2019s Eco-Conscious Citizens sued the government regarding the legality of a 2022 law which allows mining in forest reserves, including globally significant biodiversity areas. Labour unions had called for a national strike in October to force a repeal of the law but the plan was shelved after Akufo-Addo promised to rescind the law and parliament began a debate about the process. Some say they are ready to protest again, even though 11 of those detained in September have been imprisoned. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to protect the future of your nation, it\u2019s a worthwhile cause,\u201d said Nelson, who still faces multiple charges in court including unlawful assembly. \u201cAnd Ghana is worth that sacrifice.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-25T09:42:43Z",
            "content": "Pakistan\u2019s capital was put under lockdown as the government shut down the internet, blocked highways and brought in thousands of police and paramilitaries in an attempt to prevent supporters of the former prime minister Imran Khan protesting in Islamabad. Khan, who has been in jail for more than a year facing hundreds of charges, had issued a \u201cfinal call\u201d for his supporters to descend on Islamabad to demand his release and protest against recent changes to the judiciary and constitution. The former prime minister has alleged his imprisonment is part of a political agenda by the military and the ruling government to keep him out of power. They have alleged there was widespread rigging in February\u2019s election, where his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party says it won the popular vote, and are now demanding free and fair polls take place. The lockdown of the city began on Friday as a convoy of tens of thousands of supporters of the PTI heeded Khan\u2019s call from inside prison and began to march towards Islamabad from regions across the country. The coalition government, led by the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, and his Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) party, has been accused of a draconian response to the PTI protest, which is due to reach the capital by late Monday or Tuesday. Roadblocks were put in place across the country to try to halt their progress while mobile internet and access to messaging services such as WhatsApp was blocked in areas of Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and tens of thousands of troops and police officers were deployed to restrict movement. The capital resembled a fortress of shipping containers, and the red zone, which includes all parliamentary buildings, was completely sealed off by barricades. According to PTI, Khan\u2019s supporters have been targeted with teargas and baton charges by police as they moved towards Islamabad and upwards of 5,000 PTI protesters and leaders, mainly coming from Khan\u2019s stronghold region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, have already been arrested en route. PTI supporters responded by throwing stones at police and setting alight their vehicles. Bishra Bibi, Khan\u2019s wife, who was recently released from prison, is among those taking part in the march. \u201cUntil Imran is with us, we will not end this march, I will stay there till my last breath, and all of you have to support me,\u201d said Bibi, as she addressed supporters on Monday. Shaikh Waqas Akram, the PTI information secretary, said more than 70,000 people were marching on the capital from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa alone and they intended to enclose Islamabad from three sides. \u201cThe police in Punjab and other places have fired rubber bullets, expired shells and stun grenades at us. They are trying to stop a peaceful protest for the release of Khan,\u201d Akram said. However, Akram said the PTI was \u201cfully prepared\u201d, and had brought trucks with large fans to disperse teargas and rubber bullets fired by police. The timing of when the marchers would reach Islamabad \u201cdepends on how fast we can overcome the hurdles in our way\u201d, he added, but said it could take another day at least. He claimed that the military had requested that members of the senior leadership meet with Khan in Rawalpindi\u2019s Adiala jail in an effort to get the former prime minister to call off the march. \u201cAll our demands are important but the only demand the government and establishment can fulfil immediately is to release all political prisoners including Khan,\u201d he said. Supporters and leadership of PTI have faced a sustained crackdown by the government for over a year, since Khan was arrested last August. Khan had governed until 2022, when his government was toppled after he fell out with the country\u2019s powerful army chief. In an interview with the Guardian this month, speaking from prison, Khan said he would be willing to negotiate again with the military, but senior army leaders said they had no interest in striking a deal with the former prime minister to ensure his release. Analysts said Khan\u2019s decision to call the march now was likely a final attempt to bring the military establishment to the negotiating table and try to ensure he would not face trial in a military, rather than civilian, court. The Sharif government described the PTI march as a \u201cwell-thought out conspiracy\u201d as it coincides with a state visit by the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, and vowed to arrest every PTI protester who tried to get into Islamabad. Ahsan Iqbal, the federal minister for planning, accused Khan of trying to circumvent the justice system by using force to demand his release from jail. \u201cHis release hinges on clearance from the courts. He will have to clear himself from the cases registered against him. Without this, the government cannot release him,\u201d said Iqbal."

            "date": "2024-11-28T12:00:25Z",
            "content": "Seven-year-old Valdenisa squealed with delight as she grasped the tape measure above her head. It was part of a game so that a doctor could measure the circumference of her head and check her withered legs. She was one of a dozen Indigenous Munduruku children being examined by a trio of child neurologists and geneticists earlier this month in Itaituba, in Brazil\u2019s Par\u00e1 state. Located on the Tapaj\u00f3s River, the town is known as the country\u2019s illegal gold capital, as it accounts for three-quarters of all the illicit gold produced in Brazil. Amid a surge in cases of children suffering from crippling physical and neurological symptoms, medics and Indigenous health specialists are asking if contamination caused by illegal gold mining is to blame and have drawn comparisons with the stark black-and-white images of Minamata \u2013 the Japanese town at the centre of the worst ever case of mercury poisoning, in the 1950s and 1960s. Miners use mercury, mostly contraband, as it is banned in Brazil, to extract gold. More than six out of 10 of Munduruku in three villages were found to have mercury levels above internationally recognised safe norms, and 15% of children had neurodevelopment problems, according to a groundbreaking study by universities, state institutions and civil society in 2020. The report\u2019s lead author, Paulo Basta, an investigator for Brazil\u2019s National School of Public Health (ENSP), part of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), noticed the \u201cincreasingly frequent birth of children with physical abnormalities, intellectual disability and rare neurological syndromes\u201d, over the past decade. Basta is conducting a long-term study that aims to measure the effects of prenatal exposure to mercury on the neurodevelopment of Indigenous children living in areas affected by gold mining. \u201cOur goal is to enrol 300 pregnant women and 300 newborns and to monitor the babies until they are two years old,\u201d he says. So far, 91 pregnant women are participating in the study, and 48 children have been born. The study began in March 2023 and will run until December 2026. Cleidiane Carvalho, a field nurse posted to one of the Munduruku communities in 2010, sounded the alarm when one of her patients in a mining-affected area gave birth to a disabled daughter. \u201cAs soon as I saw the child, I realised she had all the characteristics of a child from Minamata,\u201d she says by phone from Boa Vista, where she worked with the Yanomami, another Amazon people brutally affected by garimpo \u2013 as artisanal gold mining is known in Brazil. \u201cI had read about Minamata and made the connections.\u201d The mother says she was born in a community that has mining activities. \u201cEverything suggests that it was caused by [mercury] contamination. I became even more worried when the patient\u2019s second daughter was born with the same disfigurement,\u201d says Carvalho. *** Years later, Carvalho was promoted to regional coordinator of Indigenous health based in Itaituba, where she managed 28 health clinics and 400 employees in six municipalities. In 2017, she was shocked by the demand for wheelchairs in Munduruku villages, which was high and increasing every year. Alexo, 10, cannot walk. He clings on to his mother, wrapping his legs around her as they sit in the examination room with the medical experts. His father, Aldo Karo Munduruku, short with the wiry build of a man who works with his hands, gently lifts his son on to his feet. He takes a few tottering steps before needing to grasp the back of the bench. Alexo has microcephaly, an abnormally small head, and he can\u2019t walk or talk due to delayed physical and neurological development. \u201cI had this beautiful child, but I felt sad because he was a bit deficient,\u201d says Karo Munduruku. \u201cHe was never normal, you see. He didn\u2019t play like other children.\u201d After taking him for MRI scans and physical therapy in Santar\u00e9m, a day\u2019s journey from Sawr\u00e9 Muybu, the Indigenous territory where the family lives, they decided to use traditional medicine and noticed a slight improvement, he says. \u201cWe used the treatment from our culture, which has traditional remedies like bark, roots and leaves,\u201d Karo Munduruku says. \u201cHe started to sit up slowly, to have motor coordination, to move his hand, to talk to himself.\u201d As scientists try to unravel the mystery around the disproportionate number of disabled children, they have observed that all of the youngsters tested had unsafe levels of mercury in hair samples. However, poisoning does not explain everything. Claudio Gusm\u00e3o, coordinator of the paediatric movement disorders programme at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and one of the visiting experts in Itaituba, says the Munduruku are in a complex chain of circumstances involving mercury poisoning, poverty, poor healthcare and, possibly, a genetic disease. Gusm\u00e3o says the team has found some \u201cclearcut cases where there seems to be a genetic disorder\u201d. Mercury intoxication, he says, can explain \u201ca gamut of neurological problems\u201d, but poisoning would not necessarily be what caused them. Fernando Kok, a child neurologist from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and one of the group, says there is \u201cno evidence that mercury contamination can damage DNA\u201d. One theory suggests this might be a genetic disorder more commonly seen in isolated populations. Ganesh Mochida, the principal investigator at the division of genetics and genomics at Boston children\u2019s hospital in the US, says the group had detected an \u201cautosomal recessive condition\u201d in three children with microcephaly. *** As the health crisis rolls on, it has become the subject of a documentary called The New Minamata. During the medical examinations, the children\u2019s parents said they ate river fish every day, a source of methylmercury, the organic variety of the toxic metal that passes up the food chain. The 2020 study shows that estimated daily intakes of mercury from the fish were two to nine times higher than the limits permitted by the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization. \u201cIn other [Indigenous] territories, there aren\u2019t so many children affected by malformations of neurological illnesses,\u201d says Lucas Albertoni, technical advisor at the special secretariat for Indigenous health at Brazil\u2019s health ministry, adding that an estimated 60 children were affected in a population of about 20,000. Although there is no existing protocol for mercury contamination, the ministry has worked on a public health framework for Indigenous peoples to confront chronic poisoning in garimpo areas such as western Par\u00e1 state, Albertoni says. President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who took office last year, promised to confront the environmental criminals that activists alleged were emboldened by his far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. Garimpo rapidly expanded during Bolsonaro\u2019s government as he weakened regulations and encouraged the garimpeiros to venture into prohibited areas such as Indigenous reserves and national parks. Lula\u2019s campaign against illegal mining has had notable success: there was an 84% drop in gold production at mines in the Brazilian Amazon between January and July 2024 compared with the same period in 2022, according to a report by thinktank Instituto Escolhas. Par\u00e1 was listed in the study as the place with the most significant drop in gold extraction. But while business has slowed in Itaituba\u2019s gold shops, the culture of gold mining, which dates back five decades, stubbornly holds on."

            "content": "This picture was taken at a famous photographic studio in Lagos in 1979. The studio, Abi Morocco, was run by a husband-and-wife team, John and Funmilayo Abe, from the 1970s to 2006, and captured images of generations of Nigerians during decades in which the exponentially growing city became the unofficial street-style capital of Africa and the world. The picture is included in a new exhibition that traces the place of the staged portrait in that story \u2013 in the years before smartphones and Instagram rendered many high street studios obsolete. The exhibition is derived from an evolving project called Lagos Studio Archives that is the work of two artists and curators, Karl Ohiri and Riikka Kassinnen, which now involves the preservation of thousands of film negatives from that period. The project began when Ohiri, based in London, travelled to Owerri in southern Nigeria in 2015 to visit family. While he was there, he met a local portrait photographer and asked if he might look at his archive of images. The photographer told him that he had thrown out and destroyed all his negatives as they were taking up too much space. When Ohiri asked around other photographers, he often heard the same story. He raised funds from different foundations to create the archive project and preserve the negatives that remained. The Abi Morocco pictures are central to that project. The studio developed from a business begun by John Abe in the 1960s in which he travelled around Lagos on a bike advertising his portrait services. It took off when he met his wife, who had initially left school at primary level to follow her passion and vocation as a photographer. Together, for years, they documented in their subjects every shift in local style - which, as here, incorporated a range of traditional and pan-African influences, along with the occasional Hollywood inflection. John Abe died in June; Funmilayo retired in 2021, but continues to live near Lagos. \u2022 Abi Morocco Photos: Spirit of Lagos is at Autograph, London, until 22 March 2025"

            "date": "2024-11-19T13:00:49Z",
            "content": "If you\u2019re going to discuss the significance of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election win for the tech industry, then a podcast studio is as good a location as any. Harry Stebbings, the 28-year-old podcaster-turned-investor, is used to asking the questions around the studio table in London, having interviewed an array of tech founders, executives and venture capitalists since the first episode of his 20VC show in 2015. But on this occasion, a few days after the Trump victory, he\u2019s giving answers \u2013 on the significance of podcasting to the president-elect\u2019s media strategy and what the tech industry secretly thinks about a Republican White House return. Meeting Stebbings, you\u2019d think he could suit either world, having the sociable, can-do nature that makes him an obvious fit in both settings. He dropped out of a law degree at King\u2019s College London within months of starting it and launched his successful 20VC podcast series by conducting an interview with Silicon Valley investor Guy Kawasaki from the kitchen of his family home. Big names have followed, including OpenAI chief Sam Altman, Shein chair Donald Tang and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman. \u201cThe true benefit is you meet the world\u2019s most powerful founders, then you build relationships with them,\u201d he says. Nine years after that Kawasaki chat, Stebbings is a major venture capital player in Europe, having raised a third fund worth $400m for his venture capital firm \u2013 also called 20VC \u2013 with backing from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Josh Kushner, founder of OpenAI investor Thrive Capital. There were many losers from the US election result, but podcasting and tech were on the other list. Trump validated podcasting as a powerful alternative to the established media ecosystem by making well-listened-to appearances on shows like The Joe Rogan Experience, while the fortunes of tech billionaires soared in the wake of the poll, reflecting expectations of a benign tax and regulatory environment. Sections of the tech industry openly embraced Trump; Elon Musk was the most high-profile political and financial supporter, followed by powerful VC figures such as Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz and David Sacks. Peter Thiel, a staunch Silicon Valley libertarian, backed Trump but did not donate to his campaign. But, according to Stebbings, there were other, less vocal Trump supporters in US tech. He said he had had \u201cmany billionaire founders on the show\u201d who didn\u2019t say who they were going to vote for, but the minute they stopped recording, \u201cthey said they were [pro] Trump\u201d. In a recent post on X, he indicated that 90% of his guests were quietly pro-Trump \u2013 a message that was viewed 750,000 times including by X\u2019s owner, Musk, who replied: \u201cIn 2020, every independent voter I knew was voting for Biden. In 2024, every independent and many former Dems are voting for @realDonaldTrump.\u201d Musk wasn\u2019t one of the quiet ones, obviously, but Stebbings says the reason why others supported him was simple: from the tech industry\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s good for business. For instance, the likely departure of Lina Khan, the head of US competition watchdog the Federal Trade Commission, is raising hopes among tech execs that acquisitions by major tech groups will be back in vogue \u2013 providing an outlet for tech founders to cash in. \u201cWe finally might get some liquidity back into the venture ecosystem. That is a very significant and important part of our business \u2013 selling on,\u201d he says. Stebbings had also warned last month that tech entrepreneurs would leave the UK \u201cen masse\u201d if Rachel Reeves announced a significant increase in capital gains tax in the budget. In the end there was no vertiginous CGT hike, which means the reaction from tech founders has not been \u201cas bad as expected\u201d, says Stebbings, although he was no fan of Reeves\u2019s statement in general: \u201cThis is not an economy of growth.\u201d Stebbings, and others, have pointed to Trump\u2019s wholehearted embrace of podcast media as being a key factor in getting his message across to voters. Trump spoke to Rogan, Theo Von, Adin Ross and other right-leaning podcast stars, while Harris veered away. Nonetheless, she did lengthy interviews with popular podcasts including Call Her Daddy. \u201cPeople are totally not getting the power of the podcast,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is the first election where we\u2019ve seen the core reason why Trump won is because he understands the power of decentralised, grassroots media.\u201d Trump also capitalised on a section of the media environment that is overtly male. And that is another similarity between the podcast and VC worlds: gender. Last year, the House of Commons treasury committee flagged that less than 5% of total VC investment in the UK is in companies with female founders. And figures showed that less than 2% of VC funding went to black- and ethnic-minority-led businesses. It is a male-dominated investment environment that replicates itself in the companies it selects for funding; Stebbings says more female investors will close the gap. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough female investors who have decision-making power. I think the source of capital, a lot of the time, just dictates or determines the distribution of capital,\u201d he says, adding that it is the same issue with black- and ethnic-minority-led businesses. Stebbings is addressing this through one aspect of 20VC\u2019s investment strategy, where it gives funds to panels of tech executives who can keep the returns \u2013 although 20VC can also choose to invest alongside them. One of the panels is all-female and 25% ethnically diverse. \u201cThe way to get more female founders funded, rightly or wrongly, is to get more female investors,\u201d he says. Stebbings says his mother, Juliet, who has multiple sclerosis, \u201ctaught me, bluntly, there is nothing you cannot achieve if you truly set your mind to it\u201d. He and his mother, who has trained as a pilates instructor since her diagnosis, walk a marathon every weekend around London. \u201cWalking marathons and becoming a pilates instructor, it\u2019s super hard,\u201d he says, adding that he takes another piece of advice from his mother into investing and, when he\u2019s on the 20VC podcast, interviewing. \u201cMy mother always tells me: \u2018It\u2019s not what you say, it\u2019s not what you do. It\u2019s how you make people feel\u2019.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-30T17:00:32Z",
            "content": "We often hear how ministers should be more honest about the state of the economy. How they should signal their intentions and, before announcing a policy shift, have the guts and intellectual heft to debate the expected impact in public, such that when a section of the public dislikes the plan, at least they understand why it has been set in motion. It was a message Rachel Reeves absorbed and used as a defence for her first budget in October, only to come unstuck when she shocked businesses with a previously undiscussed change to the terms of employer national insurance contributions and an ill-considered last-minute grab at farmers\u2019 incomes via a rise in inheritance tax. Labour\u2019s response has rightly been to regroup and refocus on the nitty-gritty of its \u201cfive missions\u201d, and begin talking about street crime, the NHS, and what it means to create job opportunities, invest in green energy and promote economic growth. These issues need to be explained to the public, and can be \u2013 in town hall meetings, television debates or even royal commissions. But what is being left out of the conversation are the seismic developments in modern capitalism that are increasingly making us unhappy, unhealthy and belligerent in the way we debate politics. There is little discussion about how we are all paying 20% more for the stuff we buy, while share prices are higher and many of those who run the companies that made profits from the pandemic and since the start of the Ukraine war have won the battle to pocket the gains for themselves. It\u2019s just capitalism, folks. While we are starting to realise how the major US tech companies are capturing our minds \u2013 and fixing them on what we call a phone, but is really a new and different kind of drug \u2013 there is less discussion about how these companies defy Adam Smith\u2019s notion of competition. In Brussels, the EU Commission understands the monopolistic characteristics of tech firms and how their super-profits are generated. The Biden administration has also publicised how big companies rip off their customers, and has many enthusiastic lawyers on the government payroll itching to take Google et al to the regulatory cleaners. But they have had little time to join the debate and have run out of time to implement any policy changes. And while they had time, they didn\u2019t really engage with the public to show how the proliferation of beautiful gadgets and monthly payment plans has become the latest in a long line of profit maximisation strategies. The same can be said of US healthcare firms, the pharmaceutical industry and the food industry. They all have bloated marketing departments telling us that we should commit our salaries to buying their stuff, even though it costs them very little to produce once the initial investment is paid down. The academic and doctor Dr Chris van Tulleken\u2019s campaign against the food industry comes up against many of the same barriers. Politicians don\u2019t really understand the issues and, when they do, they think they could be seen as denigrating those on low incomes, who are the target of much food, pharmaceutical and financial advertising. Von Tulleken, in his campaign against ultra-processed foods, tries to see beyond this cliche to consider how food companies are using the same techniques as tech firms to lure customers in and then keep them hooked. UK politicians have another reason to ignore how individual industries are making off with so much cash, and that relates to the UK\u2019s reliance on some of the worst industries, food among them. The food industry is the biggest employer in the UK manufacturing sector, placing it above the motor vehicle and engineering sectors. After the financial crash in 2008, the City regulator considered telling banks and insurers that they would need to submit their products for testing ahead of their release to make sure they did no harm. There was an industry debate about the mismatch in information between customer and seller of financial products and how the deficit in understanding meant people bought things they didn\u2019t need that happened to generate sky-high profits for the banks. That debate appears to have died and Labour is now about to take off some of the shackles keeping the industry honest. The freedom to be ripped off is at the heart of liberal capitalism. Yet caveat emptor is a defence that relies on a degree of equality between the buyer and seller and what they know about the product in question. Labour will rightly focus on its five missions. But surely it can have the bandwidth to discuss the broader problems with capitalism. There is no point lauding companies that generate growth if all they are doing is stealing the disposable incomes of your citizens and pocketing it for their faraway shareholders."

            "date": "2024-11-06T06:00:04Z",
            "content": "Has Labour got a radical economic programme, on a par with 1945 or 1964? Has it stealthily snuck this past a hostile electorate? If you glanced at coverage of last week\u2019s \u201chistoric\u201d budget, you could be forgiven for thinking it had. At the election, the party promised minor increases in tax and spending, and now it is proposing major increases in borrowing, taxing and spending. But while this might seem like a screeching U-turn, it is nothing of the sort. Far from being radical, Labour\u2019s programme shows deep continuities with failed Tory ideas and policies that do not meet the requirements of the hour, let alone offer any hope for the sort of transformation Labour once provided. Public spending was planned to fall so catastrophically over the next few years that Labour had little choice but to increase it. Had they still been in power, the Tories would have been faced with the same necessity. That\u2019s because the scale of public spending in Britain is determined mainly by the need to provide a health service, pensions and benefits (the last on a bare-minimum level, by political choice). Imagine, for a moment, what might have happened if Labour hadn\u2019t committed to raising spending: we would have seen increasing NHS waiting lists, schools with fewer teachers, and public investment falling to only 1.7% of GDP. An already dysfunctional state would not see supposed productivity gains, but would instead cease functioning. There are political choices to be made about the economy, and Labour has so far made Tory choices. The government has cut the winter fuel allowance (effectively a cut to the universal state pension), maintained the cruel two-child limit, and raised the cost of many bus fares while continuing to cut taxes on motoring. And Starmer\u2019s Labour has not chosen to restore public services to where New Labour left them in 2010; tellingly, it will spend \u00a31.2bn on new prison places in 2025 and 2026, compared with \u00a31.4bn on school buildings. The bigger choices are in how to fund this spending. Faced with a collapsing Conservative party, Labour had a rare opportunity to create a fairer and more progressive tax system. But it ruled out increasing income tax, the major progressive tax, and barely exploited the redistributive opportunities offered by increasing capital gains and inheritance taxes. Employers and workers have been hit hard, while rentiers have been hit hardly at all. That is the main story from Labour\u2019s economic programme so far. Why else would it choose to raise employers\u2019 national insurance contributions, which is an indirect tax on working people and wages, unlike VAT or income tax? True, there is a possible positive reading of the NIC increase, together with the increased minimum wage, insofar as it rightly forces business to pay more for the cheapest labour. But Labour could have increased tax on business profits through corporation tax. It chose not to. In an article in the Financial Times, Keir Starmer gave a clear insight into how Labour views its economic programme. He stressed that the party was about growth, not tax and spend: it was the party of business, reform, modern supply-side policies, of world-leading innovation, entrepreneurship, risk-taking and artificial intelligence. And the key policy? Financial stability and getting rid of \u201coverweening regulators and a dysfunctional planning regime\u201d; \u201c[rooting] out the bureaucracy that stifles growth\u201d to attract foreign investment to this liberalised nirvana. Labour\u2019s overarching story is about making the country more attractive to foreign investors. Indeed, Labour\u2019s basic growth policy is much the same as the Tory policy of the last 40 years: liberalise, encourage foreign investment, support innovation, invest in some infrastructure and now make Brexit work. The national wealth fund, which \u201cwill mobilise billions of pounds of investment into the UK\u2019s world-leading and clean energy and growth industries\u201d, is a renamed and modestly expanded version of the Conservatives\u2019 UK Infrastructure Bank (UKIB). The UKIB plan for massive support for carbon capture and storage, which directly benefits oil and gas companies, was not only continued but trumpeted as a major feature of Labour\u2019s investment programme. Labour will also continue to subsidise North Sea oil and gas investment. The party hates Tories, but it seems to love Tory panaceas. There is a bigger history here that Labour is choosing to ignore. The party once offered an alternative political-economic policy that shaped modern Britain. It was never, contrary to Labour myth, a party just of welfare or of growth, much less of tax and spend. It was dedicated to transforming the economy and society, and of increasing equality. There is no going back to Labour\u2019s programmes of the years 1945-1974, which were adapted to a largely industrial economy already growing very fast. Things have changed, not least in that the UK economy is no longer a major player, and above all because we are in a new world in which we cannot drive economies by burning carbon. Today, our aim should not be growth, but rather more equality, more effective decarbonisation, better public health and more efficient use of all our resources. And the truth is that we don\u2019t need growth for more equality (we were more equal when we were poorer, for example in the 1970s), or for more efficiency (defined as the minimisation of inputs or costs), or efficacy (the effectiveness of an action). It should once again be a central claim of progressive politics that equality, efficacy and efficiency march together, rather than being in conflict. For example, more equality means better health and less health spending. In recent decades we have seen increasing inequality, decreasing efficacy and slowly increasing efficiency \u2013 a bad combination if ever there was one. We now need change rather than growth. Some things should grow, while others should shrink, such as oil production and aviation. We need innovation, but creative imitation more. We need some investments, but not those that will make us less equal and less decarbonised. We need state investment, but we need to stop corporate losers lobbying governments to invest in carbon capture and storage, HS2 and overpriced nuclear power. We do not need \u201cinvestable\u201d water services, but rather decent water supplies. We should stop thinking of business as being all about entrepreneurship and \u201cwealth creation\u201d, given that many are neither entrepreneurial nor creating shared wealth. If we want a more equal, more effective, more efficient and happier Britain, we can have it \u2013 even with no growth or lower GDP. But we need to want it, and to have a party that is committed to achieving this and fighting those who stand in its way. Most importantly, any form of national renewal needs new thinking, not doubling down on the failed nostrums of the last 40 years.

            "date": "2024-11-25T05:00:34Z",
            "content": "A singer with a Swedish disco band who performed at this year\u2019s Eurovision has told of the \u201cdehumanising\u201d and \u201cdistressing\u201d consequences of Brexit after her British husband\u2019s application to remain in Sweden was rejected. Tess Merkel Solomons, a singer with the band Alcazar, said it felt as if her husband, Kenny Solomons, an actor and entrepreneur, was being \u201cpunished\u201d because he was a British citizen in Sweden after Brexit. Their ordeal began three years ago when Solomons, who had been living in the country since 2012, learned from one of his British employees that he should have applied to remain in Sweden by the end of 2021. He quickly applied but was this rejected in August this year on the grounds that he was late. Merkel Solomons said she felt embarrassed to be Swedish and could not understand the approach of the authorities given that Solomons is a fully integrated member of society, a stepfather to her two children, paying taxes and a Swedish speaker. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely disgusting. The way this is being handled is beyond belief. It is almost as if they are discriminating, punishing British citizens,\u201d she said. \u201cKenny came here full of entrepreneurship, he works, he set up businesses, learned Swedish. He pays taxes, employs people. \u201cWe did not receive a single piece of mail to say \u2018please be aware you need to apply to stay in the country because of Brexit\u2019. Nothing from the Swedish government, nothing from the British embassy. \u201cIs the EU really saying to me you do not have any kind of protection after Brexit? Shouldn\u2019t they stand up for these people?\u201d The migration department, the equivalent of the UK\u2019s Home Office, said it could not comment on individual cases but said its data showed it was dealing with 452 late applications, with 45 approved in 2023. The late applications include applications from family members of some of the 12,000 people who applied on time, so the number of cases like Solomons\u2019 may be much smaller. Campaigners in the Facebook grassroots group Brits in Sweden say they have not found a single late applicant whose application has been accepted and there are still individuals discovering they should have applied. David Milstead, a British professor of physics in Stockholm and a voluntary campaigner in Brits in Sweden, has been raising concerns over Sweden\u2019s approach for two years, battling to get statistics or answers from the authorities. \u201cThere was no mass mailing of registered Brits by the Swedes, despite the fact that they know our addresses and many of us have digital inboxes for communications from government authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, the media outreach from the Swedish government was minimal. It was a lucky Brit in Sweden who encountered a message from the Swedish authorities. On top of this, after contacting the state authorities or reading their webpages, Brits often received conflicting information. What we\u2019re seeing is an avoidable mess that is ruining lives.\u201d Solomons, who has returned to the UK, says he cannot understand how Brexit could have caused so much damage to his family life. He had been a successful commercials actor and then an entrepreneur running seven restaurants and barber shops, continuously employing people in Stockholm including through the pandemic. He said: \u201cI had 38 staff, my own employees. My priority was to try to save the company through Covid. That was my priority to save my company and to save people\u2019s jobs and I had zero idea that Brexit meant I had to apply to remain in the country again. My main priority was to make sure others were OK \u2013 that I got from my mother, who always said put others first. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until another Brit, that I employed, said \u2018you should have sent in a piece of paper last week\u2019 that I knew I had to do it. So I spent two years trying to save my company and employees all through Covid and at the end, sadly, it worked out well for everyone else but not the employer.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m told there is absolutely zero chance that I am allowed to reside in Sweden with my wife and kids. I\u2019m told I can appeal in five years. I can appeal to the European court, but I want to be speak openly. \u201cI am afraid. I even get nervous talking about this because I am afraid if I put one foot out of line I\u2019m going to even lose my opportunity to be able to visit my wife and kids and my home as a tourist.\u201d Although Solomons pays a mortgage and has had a family home in Sweden for more than the five years that would have made him a permanent resident of the country, he is afraid that if he breaks a single rule by going back to see his family he will risk incurring a two-year entry ban. \u201cI\u2019m afraid If I continue to fight this, my health might not be able to keep up,\u201d he said. \u201cI can turn up as a tourist by law, but it\u2019s at the discretion of border control. I just want to go and see my wife and I want to go home and pay the mortgage and pay the bills and make sure the kids are OK.\u201d The couple said the British embassy in Stockholm was of no help. \u201cThey basically said they could not interfere with Swedish law,\u201d said Merkel Solomons. A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said it could not comment on individual cases but that it had raised the wider issue with Sweden and the EU. \u201cWe have raised the high refusal rates with the Swedish and EU authorities and continue to work with them to ensure British nationals have the latest advice and guidance,\u201d they said."

            "date": "2024-11-02T16:00:18Z",
            "content": "In 2001 I interviewed the late Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel. He was in Cambridge to attend the opening of a new library that he and his wife, Betty, had endowed. We met in the university library \u2013 the central library of the university \u2013 and had an agreeable chat about the history of the tech industry and the role that he had played in it. As ever, he was wearing a tacky digital watch that served as a cue for a party trick he used to play on people. He would ask them what they thought it had cost, and most people would suggest a trivial sum \u2013 $10, say. Nope, he\u2019d reply. The actual cost was $15m: because that was what it had cost Intel to get into \u2013 and out of \u2013 the market for digital watches. And one of the lessons he learned from that was that his company should stay away from selling consumer goods. Moore was world famous because of an observation he had made in the early days of the semiconductor industry that Intel once dominated. He had noticed that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit (or chip) had been doubling every two years since 1965, and this was likely to continue for several decades. Inevitably, this became known as \u201cMoore\u2019s law\u201d, as if it were a law of physics rather than just an empirical observation and an extrapolation into the future. Even so, it turned out to be an accurate prediction of how the business of making silicon chips would evolve. Since transistor density is correlated with processing power, what it meant was that computing power doubled every year until about 2010, after which it began to level off somewhat, largely because of the physical limits on the density of transistors that could be fitted on to a tiny rectangle. (Although it hasn\u2019t prevented Apple from getting 19bn of them on the A17 chip inside my iPhone.) But although Moore\u2019s \u201claw\u201d was bound to run out of steam eventually, it shaped an entire industry and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 changed the way we thought about computing. In particular, it fostered a hubristic mindset: confidence that if a problem could be solved by computing, if today\u2019s machines weren\u2019t powerful enough, Moore\u2019s law guaranteed that it would be soluble really soon. As the ancient Greeks knew only too well, after hubris comes nemesis. In the computing world it came in the computational needs of machine learning, which were orders of magnitude greater than those of more conventional serial processing \u2013 computing in sequence, one thing at a time (albeit at astonishing speeds). In one of those happy accidents, there was a part of the computer industry \u2013 gaming, which needed processors that could do several calculations simultaneously, or \u201cin parallel\u201d \u2013 to ensure that fast-changing scenes could be rendered realistically. And one particular company, Nvidia, was a prominent caterer to this esoteric requirement by providing what became known as graphics processing units (GPUs). At some point, Jensen Huang, a smart cookie who is the founder and chief executive of Nvidia, realised that his company had the technology that the burgeoning new field of machine learning (afterwards rebranded AI) needed, and he pivoted his entire company to focus on it. The rest, as they say, is history. Irrational exuberance about AI took over the tech industry, fuelling a gold rush in which Huang was the premier supplier of picks and shovels, and his company is now the second most valuable corporation on the planet, just behind Apple. In 2018 Huang started brooding on the rate at which the computational power of GPUs was increasing. He noted that Nvidia GPUs were \u201c25 times faster than five years ago\u201d whereas Moore\u2019s law would have expected only a tenfold increase. GPU performance was more than tripling every two years, significantly more than Moore would have estimated. Inevitably, this empirical observation has now become \u201cHuang\u2019s law\u201d. The comparison with Moore\u2019s law is misleading, though, because Moore was referring just to chips \u2013 CPUs \u2013 whereas Nvidia GPUs are dense clusters of numerous components with associated software which makes them more like miniature supercomputers. If, as seems likely, GPUs do become the basic building blocks of next-generation computers, then Huang\u2019s prediction of another exponential acceleration in computing power \u2013 Moore\u2019s law on steroids \u2013 will fuel a new wave of hubristic conviction that there is nothing that cannot be done with technology. Except of course the things that are really worth doing if humans are to survive into the next millennium. Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make complacent.

            "date": "2024-11-22T10:07:20Z",
            "content": "For most of the world\u2019s displaced women and girls, crossing into a safe country is not the end of their struggle, but the beginning of another. Having fled unimaginable horrors \u2013 war, violence, and persecution \u2013 they face new challenges on arrival, often lacking access to basic rights such as healthcare, education, and economic opportunities. In Uganda, one of Africa\u2019s leading countries for receiving refugees, organisations such as ActionAid play a vital role in supporting displaced women and girls as they navigate these difficulties. Led by Mercy Grace Munduru, head of Programmes and Fundraising, ActionAid Uganda, the chairty\u2019s efforts go far beyond basic relief. It works with women and girls to rebuild their lives, fostering resilience in the face of extraordinary adversity. ActionAid operates in two major refugee settlements in Uganda: Imvepi and Kiryandongo. Imvepi is located in the West Nile sub-region \u2013 one of Uganda\u2019s poorest \u2013 which hosts more than 784,000 refugees, the largest refugee population in the country. These refugees, mainly from South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, face unique challenges due to the scale of displacement and the region\u2019s existing vulnerabilities. The Imvepi refugee settlement In Uganda, the refugee population is overwhelmingly female. About 70% of refugees in these settlements are women and children, many arriving with deep trauma. Munduru explains that a large number of these women live in women-headed households, with little access to essential services such as healthcare, education and employment. Navigating sexual and reproductive health is particularly precarious, as they face language barriers, unfamiliar systems, and often hostile environments. Gender-based violence is a harsh reality for many displaced women and girls. To address this, ActionAid has partnered with local women-led organisations to create safe spaces within the refugee settlements, where women can begin the healing process. These centres offer legal aid, psychosocial support, and dignity kits containing essential items to help maintain health and hygiene. ActionAid\u2019s approach to trauma healing is survivor-centred, emphasising conflict-sensitive, trauma-informed care. Women and girls are grouped by age, enabling them to connect with peers who share similar experiences. Some survivors are trained as mentors, helping others in their healing journey. \u201cThey\u2019ve become trainers themselves,\u201d says Munduru, describing how this peer-led model creates a ripple effect, with women passing on their knowledge to new arrivals. Clockwise from top left: Suya, Eva and Hellen, women who sought refuge in Uganda from South Sudan; Anna, an ActionAid consultant on sexual gender-based violence and child protection; young girls in the Kiryandongo refugee settlement taking part in a workshop where they learn how to make reusable pads This trauma-healing work isn\u2019t confined to the camps. ActionAid also connects survivors with Ugandan women who have lived through their own conflicts, including those abducted or forced into child marriages. Sharing stories and coping mechanisms across these groups fosters resilience and promotes healing. Education is a key pillar of ActionAid\u2019s support for displaced women and the organisation provides both literacy training and vocational-skills training to help women and girls regain control over their futures. These programmes not only improve literacy rates but also challenge harmful social norms that have historically restricted women\u2019s access to education. ActionAid works closely with community stakeholders to develop these learning programmes to make sure they are tailored to the specific needs of refugee populations. This ensures displaced women develop the academic skills and practical expertise they need to survive and thrive. Gloria holding a batch of soap she produced For example, through agricultural training, women in West Nile have learned to grow crops and sell surplus produce, turning small plots of land into sustainable livelihoods. This initiative helps women gain independence and contribute financially to their families and communities. Another powerful success story comes from Gloria, a refugee in the Imvepi settlement. After receiving leadership training from ActionAid, Gloria ran for and was elected as a zone leader in her community. She has since started a soap-making business and now employs seven other women. \u201cThrough her leadership and entrepreneurship, Gloria not only supports her own family but also creates opportunities for others in her community,\u201d says Munduru. Clockwise from top: an ActionAid consultant with a farmer tending to crops; a workshop on how to make reusable pads Another critical part of ActionAid\u2019s remit is working alongside displaced women and girls to advocate for their rights. Munduru explains that the organisation equips them with the skills to fight for the services they deserve and hold governments accountable for providing them. This advocacy work is already yielding results. After two years of intensive campaigning, West Nile was finally connected to Uganda\u2019s national electricity grid in August, an achievement that will significantly improve economic opportunities for the region\u2019s refugees, according to Munduru. \u201cAccess to electricity opens the door for social enterprises, vocational training, and other essential services.\u201d Munduru is full of hope for the future of displaced women and girls in Uganda. \u201cUganda has one of the most progressive policy frameworks for refugees,\u201d she says. \u201cEven with the influx of refugees, there are policies that allow them to find their feet in our country.\u201d Her vision is for women to become more empowered than when they arrived in Uganda, equipped with the skills and confidence to rebuild their lives, whether they stay in the country or return home. Doreen (in pink top), meeting with a group of women\u2019s rights advocates in the Imvepi settlement She says a poignant moment in her work came at a recent national climate justice symposium, where a refugee female leader stood before an audience to tell her story. \u201cThe room \u2013 filled with media, academics and young people \u2013 broke into tears,\u201d Munduru recalls. \u201cYet the woman stood tall and proud, an embodiment of the resilience that ActionAid seeks to foster.\u201d This is the ultimate goal for both Munduru and ActionAid: to give displaced women and girls access to the resources that empower them not only to survive but to thrive, ensuring that their journeys, though fraught with challenges, can lead to futures filled with possibility.

            "title": "The 1920s desecration of a Gutenberg Bible shocked the US \u2013 but miraculously gave a Jewish family new life in Australia",
            "date": "2024-11-26T14:00:29Z",
            "content": "It was a brazen act of extreme literary vandalism that desecrated one of the world\u2019s most valuable books. But it also allowed a family of Holocaust survivors to forge a new life in Australia. The extraordinary tale was uncovered by the author and journalist Michael Visontay while researching his family history during Covid lockdown and has now been published as a book, Noble Fragments. It tells how 100 years ago a New York bookseller pulled apart a Gutenberg Bible \u2013 one of only 45 then thought to exist \u2013 and sold the individual pages for a fortune. \u201cIt was the holy grail of rare books,\u201d Visontay says. \u201cNoble fragments was a fancy term to cover up the fact that what was done was literary sacrilege. \u201cTo break up any book is offensive to most people, but to break up a Gutenberg Bible, that was a crime against history.\u201d Visontay\u2019s discovery began with a mystery surrounding the second of his grandfather\u2019s three wives, a woman the family appeared to have erased from existence. There were no photos of Olga, no indication of where she was buried, and an unspoken family rule that she was never to be discussed or acknowledged. Yet rummaging through old papers after the death of his mother five years ago, Visontay came across Olga\u2019s name in what appeared to be a legal document demanding money. Also mentioned in the document was a name Visontay had never heard before: Gabriel Wells. A simple Google search set the writer on an entirely new trajectory of his research. Visontay discovered online a 1946 obituary for Wells, who, he learned, had been one of the most influential antiquarian book dealers in the US in the first half of the 20th century. A brilliant and inconceivable act Wells, born Gabriel Weisz, had abandoned his wife and home country of Hungary and resettled in Boston in 1894. The \u201cgilded age\u201d, as it was later to be called, was a time when rare books were becoming a coveted commodity. By the time the \u201cGatsby\u201d era of wealth emerged in the 1920s, money from oil and the railroads boom meant nouveau riche families needed to fill their sprawling mansions with the hallmarks of wealth and good breeding; art for their walls and books for the shelves in their vast libraries. Wells rubbed shoulders with Rothschilds and Vanderbilts. He famously paid US$200,000 (about $3.6m in today\u2019s money) for the right to print a limited run of Mark Twain\u2019s definitive writings, and lost the world\u2019s most expensive copy of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, encrusted with more than 1,000 precious gems, while transporting it from Britain to the US on the Titanic\u2019s maiden voyage. But Wells\u2019s most noted achievement was his acquisition of a Gutenberg Bible in the early 1920s and, in a brilliant and inconceivable act of entrepreneurship/vandalism, broke it up and sold the individual pages, as well as some complete books of the Bible. Wells claimed the \u201cnoble fragments\u201d \u2013 the term he used to market the individual leaves \u2013 was a victory for egalitarianism, like the 15th-century book itself that heralded the dawn of secular literacy and mass printing. For the equivalent of about US$1,500 in today\u2019s money, anyone could own a piece of the world\u2019s most valuable book. The connoisseurs were outraged. The press were fascinated. The public were captivated. The pages sold like hot cakes. \u201cWells justified his actions by saying the book was already missing too many pages to sell it as a complete Bible,\u201d Visontay says. \u201cBut this was just not true. A number of the other Gutenbergs were missing more leaves than his one. So really it was a marketing ploy \u2013 break it up and maximise the returns.\u201d Tragedy and family turmoil With one piece of the puzzle solved, Visontay\u2019s next challenge was to find out how this literary vandal came to be entangled in his family. Like Wells, the Weiszmann family were Hungarian Jews, living in Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6s, a village about 100km from Budapest, where the family owned the local delicatessen. When Germany invaded Hungary in 1944, Pali and Sara Weiszmann, Visontay\u2019s grandparents, and his father, Ivan, then 14, were rounded up and transported to concentration camps \u2013 Pali to Mauthausen in Austria, Ivan and his mother to Auschwitz in Poland. Sara perished, but her husband and son survived, reuniting in Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6s at the war\u2019s end. The traumatised family picked up the remnants of their lives. Their home had been destroyed during the war, but the deli was still standing. Father and son reopened the business and rented rooms in a house owned by a woman who had also lost her spouse in the Holocaust, Olga Illovfsky. Within a year Olga Illovfsky had become Olga Weiszmann, Pali\u2019s second wife, much to the anguish of the teenaged Ivan. \u201cPali told his son that he was lonely \u2026 but it was a very devastating piece of news for my father, because he\u2019d been in the concentration camp with his mother,\u201d Visontay says. \u201cHe had lost her, and then there was just two of them, and then when my grandfather announced that he was marrying Olga, well, Ivan blamed her for reconfiguring the family and he felt left out.\u201d With Hungary under communist rule, the Weiszmanns, now using the surname Visontai, watched as their delicatessen was confiscated for the second time. They decided to flee, planning their relocation to the US from a migrant camp in Italy. Ivan\u2019s visa was accepted, but Pali\u2019s and Olga\u2019s were not. The family settled on Australia instead. In 1952 they arrived in Sydney, and before long were running a thriving business in the only field of endeavour Pali had ever known. The iconic Minerva deli in Sydney\u2019s bohemian Kings Cross of the 1950s sold exotic continental smallgoods most Australians had never heard of before the war. Locals and the growing Hungarian diaspora in Sydney came as much for the atmosphere and the camaraderie as the salamis and the goulash. The delicatessen thrived and so did the Visontai, now Visontay, family. The Gutenberg legacy So how did a family devastated by the Holocaust and financially ruined by the communists prosper so quickly in Australia? Some time between the late 1940s and the early 1950s, Olga, already married to Pali, inherited a small fortune from a childless uncle she had barely known \u2013 Gabriel Wells. A portion of the fortune Wells amassed through his desecration of the world\u2019s most valuable Bible had bankrolled a traumatised Jewish family\u2019s flight from Hungary and provided the foundation for a new life on the other side of the world. \u201cGabriel Wells breaking up this Bible had set off a chain of events that gave my family a rebirth, a second lease of life,\u201d Visontay says. Less than a year after the Minerva deli opened, Olga died suddenly from a stroke. Cousins who had co-inherited the Wells fortune sent a letter of demand to the Visontays in Sydney, seeking the return of Olga\u2019s inheritance to their families. Overwhelmed by the legal might of the challenge, Pali and Ivan decided not to fight the case. It would take them the next five years to get their small business back to where it had begun, and Olga\u2019s name \u2013 and the part she played in the family\u2019s newfound safety and prosperity \u2013 was expunged. There is a paradoxical footnote to the Gabriel Wells side of the saga. Yes, the rogue antiquarian built his wealth from an act of literary vandalism. But the noble fragments scandal enabled a number of institutions and universities to acquire pages missing from their own editions of the Gutenberg Bible, including some Wells donated to the New York Public Library. It is believed about 180 copies of the book were printed and first made available in 1455. Today there are 48 in existence \u2013 only 20 remain wholly intact. Visontay has so far established the location of 120 \u201cnoble fragments\u201d sold by his relative a century ago, including 11 that made their way to Australia. \u2022 Noble Fragments by Michael Visontay is published by Scribe. It will be available in the UK from 16 January, and the US from 4 March. The author will be in conversation with Caroline Baum at Sydney\u2019s Gleebooks on Wednesday 27 November at 6pm."

            "date": "2024-11-20T21:20:13Z",
            "content": "Canada\u2019s employment minister has resigned from the cabinet after weeks of scrutiny over his business dealings and his shifting claims of Indigenous ancestry. Moments before question period on Wednesday, Justin Trudeau\u2019s office said Randy Boissonnault would \u201cstep away from cabinet effective immediately\u201d and will \u201cfocus on clearing the allegations made against him\u201d. Boissonnault\u2019s claims to Indigenous identity were the subject of an investigation by the National Post in early November, which revealed that a company he co-owned positioned itself as Indigenous-owned or \u201cAboriginal\u201d while bidding on federal contracts. Boissonnault, the minister for employment, workforce development and official languages, blamed his former business partner and denied any knowledge of the claims. The Alberta lawmaker never explicitly said he was Indigenous but often described himself as \u201cnon-status adopted Cree\u201d. He also spoke often about his great-grandmother as \u201ca full-blooded\u201d Cree woman. In 2018, Boissonnault told a parliamentary committee that as a child, his great-grandmother told him: \u201cWe come from the land, Randy, and some day we\u2019ll go back to the land, and the land will be all shared in the future.\u201d The National Post also found instances in which Boissonnault would speak a few words in Cree when making funding announcements for the governing Liberal party. \u201cThat is Cree for: \u2018Guests you\u2019re welcome, there\u2019s room here,\u2019\u201d Boissonnault told an Edmonton crowd in 2019. \u201cAnd if my great-grandmother, full-blooded Cree woman Lucy Brenneis were here, she may well welcome you in exactly that same way.\u201d Last week, Boissonnault apologized for \u201cnot being as clear as he could have been\u201d about his heritage. Days later, Boissonnault\u2019s office acknowledged his adoptive great-grandmother\u2019s had M\u00e9tis lineage, not Cree, after being presented with census records by the Post. A spokesperson for the minister said his \u201cown understanding of his family\u2019s heritage was inaccurate\u201d. The revelations triggered a political row with lawmakers in the Conservative and New Democratic parties calling for his ejection from cabinet. Earlier this week, NDP member of parliament Blake Desjarlais said Trudeau should kick Boissonnault out of the cabinet if the minister did not leave voluntarily. \u201cThe real victims here aren\u2019t the Liberals. The real victim isn\u2019t Randy. The real victim is Indigenous businesses, Indigenous people that did everything right. They did all that, just to learn that the system is rigged right here at the top,\u201d Desjarlais, who is M\u00e9tis, told reporters, accusing the employment minister of \u201cpretendianism\u201d. Jody Wilson-Raybould, who served as Trudeau\u2019s attorney general and justice minister wrote on social media that \u201cwe get to watch white people play ancestry wheel of fortune\u201d and that if the prime minister was \u201ccommitted to true reconciliation\u201d then he would have ejected Boissonnault from cabinet long ago. Separately, Boissonnault is embroiled in a scandal over whether he was improperly involved in the daily operations of the PPE company Global Health Imports while serving as a cabinet member, after records of text messages showed someone named \u201cRandy\u201d in a discussion about a wire transfer of roughly C$500,000 to secure a large shipment of nitrile gloves. Boissonnault denied he was the person identified in messages between his former business partner and the representative of a California-based company. The Conservative ethics critic Michael Barrett told reporters it \u201cstretches reason and belief\u201d that someone working for Global Health Imports was also named Randy but whose last name is unknown to Boissonnault. Earlier this summer, Conservatives recently filed a motion calling for the \u201cother Randy\u201d to appear at the ethics committee. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 November 2024. An early version referred to Randy Boissonnault as Canada\u2019s education minister; he was the employment minister."

            "content": "One of Britain\u2019s biggest property developers has reinforced the growing shift to a return to office working, saying that occupancy in its central London offices has grown to an all-time high and the value of its portfolio has returned to growth. The improvement in the market helped Landsec, which owns offices and retail locations such as the Bluewater and Trinity Leeds shopping centres, bounce back to a \u00a3243m pre-tax profit in the six months to the end of September. The company, which has reduced its assets in the City of London from 42% of its office portfolio when the Covid pandemic began in 2020to 23% in 2024, had reported a loss of \u00a3193m in the same period last year. On Friday, Landsec said its West End offices were \u201cpractically full\u201d \u2013 with occupancy across its central London portfolio growing to a high of 97.9% \u2013 and 80% of customers striking lettings deals over the last year either growing space or maintaining existing size. \u201cAcross our central London portfolio, office utilisation continues to grow,\u201d the company said. \u201cRents for highly sustainable, best-in-class offices continue to grow.\u201d Investment activity in London had increased and, as a result, the value of its property portfolio returned to growth, Landsec said. \u201cFollowing two years of softening, property yields stabilised over the last six months.\u201d Landsec\u2019s overall central London office portfolio grew by 0.8% in value year on year to \u00a36.4bn, and within this its assets in the City of London grew by 1.9% to \u00a31.25bn. However, the company said the strongest signs of recovery were in its retail property operation, driven by demand for shops from big brands including Primark and JD Sports. \u201cBrands continue to focus on fewer but bigger and better stores in key locations,\u201d it said. \u201cThis means leading brands continue to take more space with us. As supply of both is constrained, rents continue to increase.\u201d The value of the company\u2019s big shopping centre and retail outlet locations grew by 2.8% year on year to just over \u00a32bn at the end of September. \u201cGiven the attractive returns in major retail, we will focus our investment for the remainder of this year on this, rather than making any new office commitments,\u201d Landsec said. Several high-profile companies including Amazon and Asda have recently asked employees to return to office working more regularly, in a boost to the office property market. Oli Creasey, a property analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said Landsec\u2019s financial results had defied expectations and would be welcomed by shareholders. \u201cLandsec\u2019s half-year results are strong, particularly when considered against recent history and expectations,\u201d he said. \u201cToday\u2019s results represent a positive surprise for shareholders, and the property market generally, demonstrating that core property sectors are likely past the low point in valuations and have now returned to positive, albeit modest, valuation growth.\u201d Shares in Landsec increased by more than 2% on Friday, among the top risers on the FTSE 100 index."

            "date": "2024-11-20T22:02:17Z",
            "content": "The AI chipmaker Nvidia, the world\u2019s most valuable company and the engine of the artificial-intelligence boom, rolled out another set of quarterly results on Wednesday to investors\u2019 delight. The company, whose value has soared by $2.2tn this year to $3.6tn on the back of near-doubling of chip sales, said it had revenue of $35.08bn, against expectations of $33.15bn. Its profits more than doubled year-over-year. Revenue surged 94% from the same quarter last year. The company projected that revenue would increase by 70% in the coming quarter. Analysts anticipated Nvidia to report earnings of $0.75 per share; the company reported $0.81. Shares of Nvidia fell about 5% in extended trading following the announcement but soon recouped the losses to remain at a similar price; they previously closed at $145.89 in New York. The Nvidia chief, Jensen Huang, who last week said he expected the computing power driving advances in generative AI to increase by \u201ca millionfold\u201d over the next decade, said in a press release. In an earnings call, Huang said that global adoption of Nvidia technology was creating a platform shift from coding to machine learning, with traditional data centers being rebuilt for machine learning to produce AI. \u201cGenerative AI is not just a new software capability but a new industry with AI factories manufacturing digital intelligence \u2013 a new industrial revolution that can create a multi-trillion-dollar AI industry,\u201d he said. \u201cAI is transforming every industry, company and country,\u201d Huang added. \u201cCreating an omniverse of synthetically generated data \u2026 the age of robotics is coming.\u201d Soaring demand for Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell GPU chips appears to have quelled anxiety that the company could be hit by pullback in demand from tech giants sinking billions into AI processing and data centers. Nvidia\u2019s value has bounced back after a summer slump, rising 45% from an August low. The chip stock \u2013 up nearly 200% this year and up over 1,100% in the last two years \u2013 hit record highs following the election. But many of Nvidia\u2019s chip-making peers have become a net drag on the industry as they struggle to compete with its AI dominance. Before the results were announced, the Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said he expected another \u201cdrop-the-mic performance\u201d from Nvidia, saying it was \u201cthe only game in town with $1tn+ of AI cap-ex on the way for the next few years with Nvidia\u2019s GPUs the new oil and gold in this world\u201d. The world\u2019s biggest tech companies have increased the amount they invest in AI by billions in recent quarters, positioning Nvidia as a major beneficiary. Nvidia, which many see as a bellwether of the tech sector and artificial-intelligence demand that has helped power Wall Street to multiple record highs this year. But an escalation in the Russia-Ukraine war, the threat of global tariff hikes from Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration, and the likelihood that US interest rates will not be cut by the Federal Reserve have also put markets on edge. Other analysts agreed with Ives\u2019s assessment that demand for Nvidia\u2019s new Blackwell chip could push Nvidia sales and market capitalization to new heights. The Saxo chief investment strategist Charu Chanana wrote that signs of \u201cextraordinary demand\u201d for the new chip, including forecasts of record sales and reports of sold-out inventories for the next year, are strong indicators of Nvidia\u2019s continued high performance. But Chanana warned that \u201cany signs of production delays or demand falling short could pressure the stock given its stretched valuation\u201d. Earlier this week, a report said that the chipmaker is having overheating issues with servers for its newest graphics chip, B200 &amp; GB200 NVL72, both named for David Harold Blackwell, a prominent American mathematician and statistician. A spokesperson for Nvidia did not reject the report directly but said \u201cthe engineering iterations are normal and expected\u201d. The computer billionaire Michael Dell posted that \u201cminutiae can shake you out of tremendous investments every time\u201d."

            "date": "2024-11-30T08:00:20Z",
            "content": "\u201cThis is why I love jobcentres: because they\u2019re intensely hopeful places.\u201d The employment minister, Alison McGovern, has just spent half an hour perched on the edge of a desk in a drab office block in Hoxton, east London, hearing from a group of job coaches. \u201cIntensely hopeful\u201d is not the stereotypical view of jobcentres, whose staff have the role of checking up on benefits claims, as well as pointing the way to jobs. Jobcentres have faced repeated criticism, not least by McGovern\u2019s boss, Liz Kendall, who says they are not fit for purpose. McGovern is here to make the point that an overhauled jobcentre network will play a central role in the government\u2019s plans to \u201cGet Britain Working\u201d, as a white paper published this week put it. Since the UK emerged from its Covid lockdowns, policymakers have fretted about the many thousands of people who have fallen out of the jobs market. \u201cThe big question, I think that everybody\u2019s been thinking about, post-pandemic in the country, is how we can deal with the fact that we seem to have a nation that is less well than it was before, and as a consequence, partly of that, partly of other things, seems to be working less,\u201d McGovern says. To tackle the problem, the government is targeting an 80% employment rate, up from just under 75% \u2013 which would require getting up to 2 million people back into work. At this bustling jobcentre, there is a careers fair, where local employers and training providers have set up shop. Hundreds of local jobseekers are queueing to meet them or chatting to advisers. After touring the crowded room, McGovern asked the coaches to tell her about their work trying to help a caseload of benefits claimants back into jobs \u2013 and what would make it easier. The white paper includes plans to \u201ctransform\u201d the UK\u2019s 650 jobcentres into \u201ca genuine public employment service\u201d with \u00a355m set aside over the next year to help implement the changes. The job coaches talk enthusiastically about their successes \u2013 as well as the challenge of dealing with the bureaucratic benefits system and out-of-date IT. Shohel Ahmed told McGovern he often sees claimants who have language barriers that have prevented them from finding work. He can direct them towards language classes, but also tries to give them the confidence to move forward. \u201cThe main factor I found with work coaching is about motivation, more than anything,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about me, building that relationship with you, building that rapport.\u201d Cansu Orhan works specifically with 18 to 24-year-olds. She says many of them have mental health challenges. \u201cI also think with young people, they all, preferably, would want to work remotely,\u201d she adds. Oladele Woye tells the minister he works with young people at risk of serious youth violence, many of whom have served time in prison or young offender institutions. \u201cMy bugbear, really, if you can help me, is to source employers that are friendly towards ex-offenders,\u201d he tells her. McGovern said she has been discussing this issue with the justice minister, James Timpson, and urged Woye to email her with more details. \u201cThe problem is, by and large, not work coaches,\u201d says McGovern. \u201cThe problem is time. So if you are spending your time dealing with old technology and inadequate systems that are laborious, the person in front of you is just sat there.\u201d She says she wants to cut down box-ticking bureaucracy, and upgrade the Department for Work and Pensions\u2019 (DWP) technology, to \u201crelease time\u201d for what she calls: \u201cthe thing that only another person can do, which is help build confidence and give that person the tools that they need\u201d. As the shadow employment minister, McGovern repeatedly complained about a lack of detailed evidence on the performance of the government\u2019s back-to-work schemes. Now in government, her department has published a slew of employment data alongside the white paper. McGovern points to one aspect of the analysis she is particularly concerned about: less than 8% of universal credit claimants who are searching for work find their way into a job each month, and the rate has been declining for the past couple of years. \u201cThe \u2018into work rate\u2019 is poor and falling,\u201d she says. \u201cSo whilse there\u2019s lots of jobcentres doing the right thing, the system is not helping.\u201d For those clients who do not need the intensive help the job coaches provide and can be straightforwardly matched to local jobs, McGovern says it will match \u201cthe ease of contact you have with your bank\u201d. \u201cWe need people to have a jobcentre in their pocket, if that\u2019s what\u2019s best for them, and that frees up time for people who really need it.\u201d The DWP has also published regional analyses of job markets and McGovern says that will be important as the role of jobcentres is different in different areas. \u201cDevolution is really important for its own sake, and also because our labour markets are just like a postcode lottery. Your chances and opportunities are so heavily dictated by where you happen to be.\u201d"

            "content": "The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, used his Mansion House speech on Thursday to say Brexit had undermined the UK\u2019s economy and to urge the government to improve relations with the EU, for the sake of growth. Could Labour pull the UK closer to the trading bloc \u2013 and would it make much difference to economic growth? What are Labour\u2019s plans? Keir Starmer once used to argue for the return of free movement between the UK and the EU \u2013 an integral part of the single market that binds EU members together. But Labour\u2019s prospectus for this year\u2019s general election made a much more modest set of proposals for making the trade and cooperation agreement (TCA), struck by Boris Johnson, work better. These include trying to strike a sanitary and phytosanitary agreement (SPS) that could alleviate the need for veterinary checks of products such as food at the border; negotiating mutual recognition of professional standards, so that UK lawyers, architects etc could practise freely in the EU; and making it easier for musicians to tour the continent. Will these changes boost growth? These modest aims mesh with the EU\u2019s determination not to reopen the TCA, as well as the fact that most EU countries have more pressing issues on their minds than bringing the UK back into the fold. Some sectors could benefit significantly from reduced friction at the border. However, the limited nature of the plans means most economists believe any upside in terms of GDP growth is likely to be limited. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about increments,\u201d says John Springford, of the Centre for European Reform. \u201cWhile it\u2019s helpful and necessary to try and improve the deal, and absolutely Labour should be doing it, the idea that this will offset the sizeable cost of moving from the single market and customs union to the trade and cooperation agreement is for the birds.\u201d Treasury analysis previously suggested leaving the single market would depress GDP by 3.5%. Returning to the single market and customs union has been firmly ruled out by Labour, which believes voters would not accept the quid pro quo of a return to unfettered EU migration. Recent research by the Resolution Foundation thinktank did suggest there could be additional benefits if the UK chose to go further, aligning regulation with the EU across key sectors \u2013 something Starmer and Reeves have sometimes seemed sympathetic to. For the moment, though, the EU has significant growth challenges of its own: the European Commission forecast on Friday that the German economy would decline by 0.1% in 2024, and the EU as a whole expand by just 0.9%, as the cost of living crisis continues to weigh on demand. How does a Trump administration complicate the picture? Considerably. Trump plans to wield tariffs \u2013 taxes on imports \u2013 as a weapon in his \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to the economy, despite the fact that experts say the plan is likely to drive up inflation. The incoming president has threatened to levy a tariff of up to 60% on all Chinese goods, and 10-20% on imports from the rest of the world. How the policy will be rolled out is highly unpredictable. But Trump watchers believe he is likely to try to use the threat of tariffs to exact concessions from big trading partners \u2013 whether through pledges to buy more from the US, or even wider policy changes, such as a commitment to spending more on defence. He could also urge other countries to join the US in targeting China. How could the UK respond? The government will have to decide whether to try to strike a deal with the US unilaterally, or line up alongside the EU, which could choose to retaliate with its own tit-for-tat tariffs. The former Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane suggested earlier this week that the UK should chart a middle course, seeking to improve the agreement with the EU, but also opening trade talks with the US under Trump. That chimes with Bailey\u2019s suggestion that it is a \u201cBritish characteristic\u201d to be an \u201cold-fashioned free trader\u201d. However, previous efforts to negotiate with the US have foundered, given queasiness in the UK about accepting imports of agriculture products, such as chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-fed beef, and allowing US corporations greater access to the public sector. Springford suggested the scope of any potential agreement was likely to be limited, particularly given that opening the door to more US agricultural products, for example, would complicate talks with the EU over veterinary standards. \u201cIt\u2019s more likely to be a kind of negotiation about what market access will we give to US interests, in exchange for Trump\u2019s tariffs being taken away,\u201d he said."

Financial markets are overwhelmingly forecasting that the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) will reduce rates for a second time when it announces its latest decision at noon. Markets believe there is a 96% chance of a cut, with the Bank citing the fall in the headline rate of inflation to 1.7% and an easing of underlying price pressures as justification for the move. After raising interest rates from 0.1% to 5.25% in 14 consecutive jumps from December 2021 to August 2023, the MPC voted to ease policy with a quarter-point reduction in August. Andrew Bailey, the Bank\u2019s governor, signalled rates had further to fall when he said last month that further progress in the battle against inflation would allow the MPC to be more \u201caggressive\u201d. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said before last week\u2019s budget that it expected rates to be reduced by 0.25 points at every one of the Bank\u2019s next nine meetings, taking them down to 2.75% by November 2025. Some analysts said the boost to growth provided by Rachel Reeves\u2019s package might make the Bank more wary of future rate cuts after Thursday\u2019s decision. James Smith, UK economist at ING bank, said: \u201cLast week\u2019s budget has made life more complicated for the Bank of England. A rate cut is all but certain, but the combination of extra fiscal stimulus and a volatile US election aftermath means officials won\u2019t want to comment on its next steps. \u201cA December rate cut has become less likely, although a lot hinges on the two inflation reports we get before Christmas.\u201d Paul Dales, Capital Economics said: \u201cThe Bank of England will almost certainly cut interest rates for the second time in this cycle, from 5% to 4.75%, at the meeting on Thursday 7 November. But it is unlikely to hint that it intends to quicken the pace by cutting rates again at the following meeting in December.\u201d The Bank of England\u2019s announcement on interest rates will be followed later on Thursday by the latest decision from the US Federal Reserve on US borrowing costs. Despite the expectation on Wall Street that a second Donald Trump presidency will lead to lower growth and higher inflation in the US, the Fed is also expected to cut rates by 0.25 points."

            "content": "Australia\u2019s unemployment rate held steady last month as employers kept hiring at almost the pace of a swelling population. The jobless rate in October was 4.1% for a third consecutive month, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. The result was in line with economists\u2019 forecasts and matched a similar outcome for September. The economy added 9,700 full-time jobs and 6,200 part-time roles, making a net change of 15,900 positions. Economists had tipped employers would add a net 25,000 jobs in October. A slight drop in the participation rate from a record 67.2%, seasonally adjusted, reported for September to 67.1% last month helped to explain the unchanged jobless rate. The overall labour market remained relatively tight even as the number of unemployed rose 8,000, bringing the tally to 623,500, or 67,000 more than a year ago. The jobless rate, while up from the June 2023 low of 3.5%, remains well below the pre-Covid pandemic low of 5.2%, the ABS said. The data prompted NAB, one of the big four banks, to push back the timing of when it expects the Reserve Bank of Australia to start cutting interest rates from February to May. \u201cThere is a real risk that policy rates stay on hold even deeper into 2025 should the labour market remain tight and services inflation remain elevated,\u201d said Tapas Strickland, NAB head of markets economics. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The Reserve Bank has a dual mandate to keep inflation within its 2-3% target range but also to ensure the economy is as close to full employment as possible. The labour market has been surprisingly strong for most of 2024. Demand for labour has helped nudge real wages higher but has also left inflation in the service sector in particular more elevated than the RBA would prefer before it starts to cut its cash rate. Prior to Thursday\u2019s jobs data, investors were not fully pricing in an RBA interest rate cut until next August. The initial market reaction was modest, with the Australian dollar hovering just below 65 US cents and stocks holding on to their gains for the morning of about 0.5%. Still, there are signs of emerging weakness in the labour market, much as the central bank expects. The RBA\u2019s latest forecast has unemployment creeping up to 4.3% by year\u2019s end. BDO Economics partner Anders Magnusson said the strength of the labour market may make the RBA jobless estimate \u201can overestimate\u201d. \u201cThe RBA won\u2019t be pleased as a weakening to 4.2% [for October] would have indicated that the cash rate was adequately restrictive,\u201d Magnusson said. \u201cUnlike other advanced economies, Australia continues to maintain a strong labour market.\u201d Bjorn Jarvis, ABS head of labour statistics, said although employment grew in October, the 0.1% increase was the slowest growth in recent months. \u201cThis was lower than each of the previous six months, when employment rose by an average of 0.3% per month.\u201d The employment-to-population ratio remained at the historical high of 64.4%, he said. Sean Langcake, the head of macroeconomic forecasting for Oxford Economics Australia, said the \u201cvery strong run of growth in employment [had belied] the generally weak state of the economy\u201d and the labour market remained \u201cin a tight position\u201d. \u201cWe expect the market will slacken as we move into 2025, but the timing and magnitude of this easing remains highly uncertain,\u201d he said, noting that forward indicators for labour demand remained resilient. The ACT\u2019s jobless rate in October was the lowest of all states and territories, at 3.1%, down from 3.4% in September. The Northern Territory, with an October jobless rate now at 4.6%, up from 4.2%, was at the other end of the scale. New South Wales and Victoria, which together account for about half the economy and jobs, both saw the jobless rate tick a bit higher to 4% and 4.5%, respectively. Queensland saw its unemployment rate ease to 3.9% from 4.1% in September. Western Australia went the other way, with a notable jump to 4% from 3.6%. Elsewhere, South Australia\u2019s jobless rate also eased 0.1 percentage points to 4.2%, while Tasmania\u2019s rose by a similar margin to 4.1%."

            "title": "Does the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate cut mean lower mortgage rates?",
            "date": "2024-11-07T13:27:41Z",
            "content": "The Bank of England has cut the cost of borrowing, reducing headline interest rates from 5% to 4.75% \u2013 a move that was widely anticipated. It is the second interest rate cut this year. Will my mortgage get cheaper? For the majority of people, the answer is no. That\u2019s because almost 7m of the UK\u2019s 8.4m existing residential mortgages are on a fixed rate, so 82% of people with a home loan won\u2019t see any change. However, some of these fixed-rate mortgage-holders will need to consider their options over the next few months because their current deal is coming to an end. This week\u2019s cut should translate into lower borrowing costs for the 629,000 homeowners with a base rate tracker mortgage, and also the 693,000 borrowers whose monthly payments are linked to their lender\u2019s standard variable rate (SVR). Only the tracker mortgage customers are guaranteed to see their payments go down. Although it is likely that lenders will reduce their SVRs, they are not obliged to do so and could choose to keep the rate as it is or pass on only some of the cut. For a tracker borrower paying 6.44% (the average current tracker rate, according to the banking body UK Finance), a 0.25-percentage point cut to 6.19% would knock \u00a322 a month off a \u00a3150,000 repayment mortgage with 20 years remaining, taking the monthly payment down from \u00a31,113 to \u00a31,091. The average SVR now is 7.95%, according to the financial data provider Moneyfacts, so if the full cut is passed on to someone on that rate, that would mean monthly repayments for the above mortgage example will drop by \u00a323 \u2013 from \u00a31,250 to \u00a31,227. That said, many people sitting on an SVR have smaller mortgages. Further interest rate reductions next year look almost certain, though the Bank of England is expected to dial things back a bit in terms of future cuts after the budget. The Bank\u2019s next two interest rate announcements are on 19 December and 6 February. How about new home loan deals? Fixed-rate mortgages \u2013 where what you pay is guaranteed for a set period, typically two or five years \u2013 are predominantly priced based on what the money markets think will happen to interest rates, rather than the current base rate. However, the budget shifted UK interest rate expectations a bit, which has \u2013 along with the extra frisson added by the US election result \u2013 injected some volatility into the pricing of new fixed-rate deals, which had been coming down in cost. Expectations that interest rates may end up staying a little higher for longer than previously expected prompted some lenders to increase the cost of some of their new fixed deals this week, though there have also been some rate reductions. Moneyfacts said on Thursday that the average new two-year fixed-rate mortgage deal had nudged up slightly to 5.42%, while the average five-year deal had ticked up to 5.13%. After Thursday\u2019s move by the Bank of England, and with the dust settling after the budget and US drama, some mortgage brokers are confident lenders will trim the cost of their new fixed-rate deals over the next few weeks \u2013 but others are not ruling out higher rates on new products. Nicholas Mendes, the mortgage technical manager at the broker John Charcol, said: \u201cI expect mortgage rates to resume their downward trend before the end of the year, likely returning to the best rates we\u2019ve seen recently, with further improvements anticipated into next year. However, borrowers should keep in mind that current fixed mortgage rates already reflect some of the anticipated bank rate cuts over the coming year. As a result, I foresee the lowest fixed rates stabilising around the low 3% range next year.\u201d By contrast, Peter Stimson, head of product at MPowered Mortgages, said anyone hoping the Bank\u2019s decision would instantly open the floodgates to cheaper mortgages \u201cis likely to be disappointed,\u201d adding: \u201cIn fact, the mortgage rates offered to new borrowers and remortgagers could even increase in coming weeks.\u201d If you have a fixed deal ending in perhaps four or five months\u2019 time, and you will be looking for a new fix, be aware that remortgage offers are typically valid for up to six months, so you could reserve a loan now and wait to see what happens. Some borrowers will be eyeing up a base rate tracker mortgage in order to take advantage of the expected further interest rate cuts. However, most people are still opting for a fixed deal as right now these are typically cheaper than base-rate trackers, said David Hollingworth, the associate director at broker L&amp;C Mortgages. A fixed deal also offers you payment certainty. So this is bad news for savers, isn\u2019t it? As with mortgage rates, the returns on savings are generally not entirely tied to the Bank of England base rate, but Thursday\u2019s reduction is likely to be passed on to many savers who have easy-access accounts and others who do not have guaranteed interest rates. Many savings rates have come down recently: for example, late last month, National Savings and Investments (NS&amp;I) announced it was cutting the rates on some of its best-known products. However, the budget fallout has had a knock-on effect and that, plus competition among challenger banks for savers\u2019 cash, prompted several providers to increase rates on some products this week. On Thursday it was possible to pick up a fixed-rate savings account paying as much as 5% from the likes of the app-based Atom Bank, provided you were happy to sign up to a short (six-month) term. The top-paying easy access accounts are also paying up to 5%, but those deals may not hang around for long. What about personal loans and credit cards? Most personal loan rates are fixed, so if you are already borrowing money in this way, you will continue to pay interest at the rate at which you originally signed up. New borrowing could come down in price, but rates are unlikely to fall significantly. Credit card rates went up in recent years as the base rate increased. However, they are not explicitly linked to the base rate, so providers will not be obliged to pass on cuts."

            "date": "2024-11-20T17:52:53Z",
            "content": "Inflation could rise above 3% next year after it increased to 2.3% in October, heaping pressure on the Bank of England to delay further interest rate cuts until the spring. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Wednesday showed that a rise in energy bills pushed up the consumer prices index (CPI), reversing a downward trend this year in inflation, which was 1.7% in September. The figure for the year to October was slightly above the 2.2% City economists had expected. The ONS said higher gas and electricity prices were offset by lower oil prices, which reduced the transport and raw materials costs of manufacturing businesses. Falls in the price of theatre and live music tickets also helped to limit the fastest month-on-month increase in prices since October 2022, at 0.6%. The quarterly energy price cap rose by 10% to \u00a31,717 in October, and the cap is forecast to rise again in January, to put the average annual bill at \u00a31,736. Retailers have said measures announced in Labour\u2019s budget last month would ultimately lead to higher prices, and the tax rises have already hit consumer confidence. Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said the figures confirmed \u201ca disappointing resurgence in inflation\u201d as the benefits of falling energy costs last year reversed to become a headwind. \u201cInflation should drift gradually higher from here, with rising energy bills, the impact of the budget and global trade frictions likely to keep the headline rate hovering above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target until well into 2025.\u201d Policymakers at the Bank, who are tasked with keeping inflation near 2%, have cut interest rates twice to 4.75%, but a further reduction at a meeting in December is likely to be put off until at least February. A leading thinktank said persistent wage pressures would push the CPI above 3% next year, leading to a slower pace of interest rate reductions during 2025. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research said: \u201cWhile we think the Bank of England will continue to cut rates in 2025, the pace of rate cuts is expected to be slower than previously anticipated, and rates may stay elevated for longer.\u201d Underlining the uncertainty surrounding the path of inflation over the next year, the Bank policymaker Dave Ramsden said the underlying weakness of the recovery would allow inflation to stay near 2%. In a speech at Leeds University business school, Ramsden said that while it was possible inflation would be higher than the 2% target next year, \u201cmy overall assessment is that the economy will continue to normalise, with the recent trend towards low and relatively stable inflation continuing\u201d. Financial markets now see the probability of a rate cut next month at about 16%. Core inflation increased from 3.2% to 3.3%, confounding a consensus forecast for a small fall to 3.1%, and services inflation rose from 4.9% to 5%. Ruth Gregory, the deputy chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said much of this overshoot was because of a sharp jump in air fares inflation, reflecting the biggest rise in ticket prices in October since monthly collection began in 2001. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said the rise in core inflation, services inflation and energy prices amounted to \u201ca triple dose of bad news\u201d. \u201cAfter recent lower-than-expected price rises, today\u2019s data is a reminder that the long tail of elevated inflation from the cost of living crisis is still in the economy,\u201d he said. Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cWe know that families across Britain are still struggling with the cost of living. That is why the budget last month focused on fixing the foundation of our economy so we can deliver change. That includes boosting the national minimum wage, freezing fuel duty and protecting working people\u2019s payslips from higher taxes.\u201d Rising prices have eaten into consumer spending power over the last three years, and by more in the UK than other big economies. Figures have previously shown that, from January 2021 to May 2024, UK consumer prices increased by 22.8% in total, compared with 20.9% in Germany, 18.8% in the US and 16.6% in France. Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said it was important that the government kept inflation low. \u201cWhat is worrying about today\u2019s announcement is that inflation is running ahead of expectations and official forecasts state these figures are not expected to improve. Labour\u2019s budget will push up inflation and mortgage rates.\u201d"

            "content": "I always worry when I hear politicians or economists talk about how the economy needs to be administered some painful medicine. Inevitably it means people suffering for no good reason. Right now the medicine of interest rate rises is poisoning the economy as living standards collapse. If ever there was an example of the disconnect between \u201cthe economy\u201d and what people actually experience, it came with the release of the annual gross state product (GSP) figures, which measure state economies much like GDP measures Australia\u2019s economy. The news was announced by the Bureau of Statistics, which told us \u201cgross state product rose in all states and territories\u201d. To be fair to the ABS, it was not spinning the numbers, just announcing the top line figure that every state and territory economy in 2023-24 was bigger than in 2022-23. This is unsurprising. Unless something drastic occurs \u2013 such as a pandemic that shuts down the state \u2013 economies are supposed to get bigger each year. The more pertinent fact was that each state economy grew more slowly in 2023-24 than it did in 2022-23: (I\u2019ve excluded NT due to scale \u2013 you can see its graph here.) If the graph does not display click here And, overwhelmingly, the growth was due to population growth. Once you take out the increase in population, nearly every state went backwards: If the graph does not display click here The biggest driver of economic growth across the economy last financial year was Queensland, even though its economy is only the third-biggest: If the graph does not display click here The reason was Queensland exports \u2013 especially coal \u2013 grew substantially compared with 2022-23 due to fewer weather disruptions. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email By contrast, WA had a shocker of a year because its exports were disrupted by weather. The ABS noted there \u201cwas less production of oil and gas due to weather disruptions\u201d. Who could have guessed climate change caused by oil and gas emissions would hurt the oil and gas sector? But weather disruption or not, households were unlikely to be feeling any joy from the GSP growing in all eight states and territories, because average household disposable income \u2013 essentially living standards \u2013 fell in every state except Tasmania (NT and ACT graph is here). If the graph does not display click here And this brings us to the pain that, apparently, is good for us. The main reason why our living standards have fallen is because the Reserve Bank seems to have been trying with all its might to reduce them. Interest repayments on dwellings have risen sharply in the past two years as a share of total household income: If the graph does not display click here The RBA has increased interest rates in order to cut back our disposable income (because mortgage repayments, much like taxes, are things you can\u2019t avoid paying, so they reduce the amount of your wages you have to spend). So great has been the increase in interest rates and so great are the size of mortgages, that the past two years have seen both the biggest one-year increase in average mortgage repayments: If the graph does not display click here It is then no surprise that average household disposable incomes have fallen so far that, rather than just undo the stimulus of the pandemic years, we\u2019re now back around where we were in 2015: If the graph does not display click here The RBA will be happy to see this \u2013 it is what it wanted. It has been determined to reduce the amount of income we have to spend because it believes that our spending has created \u201cexcess demand\u201d. It argues we are spending more than the economy can cope with and, as a result, inflation is going up. And so the medicine of interest rates, the RBA argues, is for our own good \u2013 we need to stop spending so much so the economy will be back \u201cin balance\u201d. Unfortunately for everyone, they got the diagnosis wrong, and the medicine they are inflicting is a poison. In the decade prior to the pandemic the RBA cut rates in a desperate attempt to keep households spending. It was a decade of historically poor household spending, a decade where the recovery from the GFC was stunted by austerity measures of the Abbott-Hockey years. By 2019 things were extremely dire, as even with rate cuts spending fell below the decade trend level. Then the pandemic came, and the RBA cut rates again to keep things somewhat alive. But since then, it has been all about the interest rate rises. And sure, maybe as things opened up and we all went shopping again, you could understand the RBA being worried that we were all a bit too excited. But even as our spending slowed, and then fell, the RBA kept administering the poison: If the graph does not display click here Average household spending in the June quarter was about 3.5% less than would have been expected had we just continued on along the very weak 2010-2020 trend. And yet apparently it is not yet time to cut rates. Apparently, we still are spending too much \u2013 it is not yet time to take away the poison. Let us hope someone in the RBA is asking for a second opinion on its diagnosis. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

All being well, the spacecraft will blast off from India\u2019s Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, on the Bay of Bengal coast, at 4.08pm local time (10.38am UK time) on Wednesday. After a four-month voyage, the probes will reach a highly elliptic orbit that swoops as close as 370 miles to Earth before swinging out for more than 37,000 miles. \u201cIt\u2019s an experiment in space to demonstrate a new concept, a new technology,\u201d said Damien Galano, the Proba project manager at ESA. \u201cIt\u2019s very challenging because we need to control very well the flight path of the two spacecraft.\u201d If the satellites operate as intended, they will line up with the sun such that the lead spacecraft casts a carefully controlled shadow on its partner, allowing instruments on the latter to measure the sun\u2019s corona, the outer layer of its atmosphere. Traditionally, scientists have studied the sun\u2019s ring-like corona during solar eclipses, when the moon blocks enough of the sun\u2019s glare to make the corona visible from Earth. The work requires scientists to chase eclipses around the world, often for only minutes of observation time, or none at all if the view is obscured by cloud. The \u20ac200m (\u00a3166m) Proba-3 mission promises to transform scientists\u2019 understanding of the corona by producing 50 artificial solar eclipses a year, each lasting six hours. The lead spacecraft carries a 1.4-metre wide occulter disc to block the sun as seen from the second spacecraft, turning the pair into a 150-metre-long instrument called a coronagraph. Data from the mission should shed light on the longstanding mystery of why the corona is so much hotter than the sun itself; the sun\u2019s surface is about 5,500C, but the corona can exceed 1 million C. By better understanding the corona, scientists hope to improve their predictions of solar weather, coronal mass ejections \u2013 where pulses of plasma and magnetic field burst into space \u2013 and solar storms, which can damage spacecraft and cause power outages and communications blackouts on Earth. The Proba-3 spacecraft will swing around the planet once every 19.7 hours for two years. For six hours in every orbit the satellites will fly in formation, drawing on optical sensors and flashing LEDs to locate one another, and a precision laser system to automatically finesse their distance and orientation. The first images from the mission are expected as soon as March 2025. Beyond the mission\u2019s main goals, ESA scientists have set aside time to test manoeuvres that may be helpful in the future to service faulty satellites or remove \u201cuncooperative\u201d hardware and debris from orbit. Formation flying could usher in a new era of space-based observatories and instruments by having multiple spacecraft work together in precise configurations. \u201cIf we would be able to have several satellites close to each other in an absolute, accurate, precise formation, we would be able to assemble larger instruments that are composed out of several satellites,\u201d said Dietmar Pilz, the director of technology at ESA. These multi-satellite instruments could be used to study the climate crisis, objects in the solar system, and more distant planets around faraway stars. \u201cWe all know that the launchers have been increasing in their power and the masses that they can bring into space,\u201d said Pilz, in reference to the heavy payloads carried by modern rockets. \u201cBut no matter what you do, there\u2019s always a limit.\u201d"

            "content": "Elon Musk\u2019s influence on a Donald Trump administration could lead to tougher safety standards for artificial intelligence, according to a leading scientist who has worked closely with the world\u2019s richest person on addressing AI\u2019s dangers. Max Tegmark said Musk\u2019s support for a failed AI bill in California underlined the billionaire\u2019s continued concern over an issue that did not feature prominently in Trump\u2019s campaign. However, Musk has warned regularly that unrestrained development of AI \u2013 broadly, computer systems performing tasks that typically require human intelligence \u2013 could be catastrophic for humanity. Last year, he was one of more than 30,000 signatories to a letter calling for a pause in work on powerful AI technology. Speaking to the Guardian at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Tegmark said Musk, who is expected to be heavily influential in the president-elect\u2019s administration, could persuade Trump to introduce standards that prevent the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), the term for AI systems that match or exceed human levels of intelligence. \u201cI do think that if Elon manages to get Trump\u2019s ear on AI issues we\u2019re more likely to get some form of safety standards, something that prevents AGI,\u201d he said. Tegmark, a professor specialising in AI at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, added: \u201cHe might help Trump understand that an AGI race is a suicide race.\u201d Tegmark said Musk\u2019s support for the SB 1047 bill in California, in the face of opposition from many of his tech peers, was a positive sign for AI safety campaigners. The bill, which required companies to stress-test large AI models before releasing them, was vetoed by the California governor, Gavin Newsom, after he said it could drive AI businesses from the state and hinder innovation. \u201cElon Musk came out and said I\u2019m for it, I want the regulation. I do think it\u2019s not completely implausible he could persuade Trump that AI needs to be controlled,\u201d Tegmark said. Musk was an early supporter and financial backer of Tegmark\u2019s Future of Life Institute, which campaigns for safer use of cutting-edge technology. The Tesla chief executive and owner of X\u2019s personal fortune has swelled significantly since Trump\u2019s victory last week. Musk launched his own AI startup last year and said the world needed to worry about a \u201cTerminator future\u201d in order to head off the worst-case scenario of AI systems evading human control. Other AI professionals have argued that focusing on apocalyptic concerns distracts from focusing on short-term problems with AI systems, such as manipulated and misleading content. Trump has vowed to repeal a Biden administration executive order on AI safety; the Republican party\u2019s election platform described it as a set of restrictions that \u201cimposes radical leftwing ideas on the development of this technology\u201d. The order includes requiring companies developing high-risk systems \u2013 AI models that pose a threat to national security, economic security or health and safety \u2013 to share their safety test results with the government."

            "date": "2024-11-26T17:10:20Z",
            "content": "Writers and publishers are criticising a startup that plans to publish up to 8,000 books next year using AI. The company, Spines, will charge authors between $1,200 and $5,000 to have their books edited, proofread, formatted, designed and distributed with the help of AI. Independent publisher Canongate said \u201cthese dingbats \u2026 don\u2019t care about writing or books\u201d, in a Bluesky post. Spines is charging \u201chopeful would-be authors to automate the process of flinging their book out into the world, with the least possible attention, care or craft\u201d. \u201cThese aren\u2019t people who care about books or reading or anything remotely related,\u201d said author Suyi Davies Okungbowa, whose most recent book is Lost Ark Dreaming, in a post on Bluesky. \u201cThese are opportunists and extractive capitalists.\u201d Spines \u2013 which secured $16m in a recent funding round \u2013 says that authors will retain 100% of their royalties. Co-founder Yehuda Niv, who previously ran a publisher and publishing services business in Israel, claimed that the company \u201cisn\u2019t self-publishing\u201d or a vanity publisher but a \u201cpublishing platform\u201d. \u201cRegardless of how they present their platform they ARE a vanity publisher,\u201d wrote Deidre J Owen, co-founder of \u201cindependent micropublisher\u201d Mannison Press, in a post on X. The company is seemingly \u201cjust trying to speed up\u201d self-publishing \u201cin a way that won\u2019t work well, and of course, they don\u2019t want to call it that\u201d, said Marco Rinaldi, co-host of Page One \u2013 The Writer\u2019s Podcast, in a post on Bluesky. \u201cWe would warn authors to think extremely carefully before committing to any author-contribute contract\u201d involving a writer paying for their work to be published, said Anna Ganley, chief executive of the UK\u2019s largest trade union for writers, illustrators and translators, the Society of Authors. \u201cIt is very unlikely to deliver on what an author is hoping they might achieve, it is most unlikely to be their best route to publication, and if it also relies on AI systems there are concerns about the lack of originality and quality of the service being offered \u2013 even if there are guarantees (which we suspect are unlikely) that the AI system in question was not developed by using unlawfully scraped copyright content,\u201d she added. Spines says it will reduce the time it takes to publish a book to two to three weeks. Last week, Microsoft announced it is launching a book imprint which likewise aims to print books faster than traditional publishers. Earlier this month, it was revealed that HarperCollins had reached an agreement with Microsoft to allow some of its titles to be used to train AI models, with the permission of authors. \u201cOur goal is to empower authors\u201d, a representative from Spines told the Guardian. \u201cWithout Spines, an aspiring author usually approaches a publishing agency when 99% of authors are refused, as they are not celebrities or connected to the right people. \u201cThose disappointed authors can turn to vanity publishing and pay between $10,000 and $50,000 for a single book, or go the route of self-publishing which requires their expertise in each task such as designing the cover, marketing the book and on and on. This process can take between 6 and 18 months. Using technology, Spines streamlines the process of publishing a book, allowing the authors to focus on what they do best: write great stories.\u201d Spines is \u201clevelling the playing field for any person who aspires to be an author to get published within less than three weeks and at a fraction of the cost. Our goal is to help 1 million authors to publish their books using technology,\u201d the representative added. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 November 2024 to include a response from Spines that was received after publication. A reference to the company raising $16m in \u201cseed funding\u201d was corrected; that sum was raised in a subsequent funding round. The subheading of an earlier version said books would be \u201cedited\u201d with the help of AI; Spines\u2019 software offers options to revise the style and length of a manuscript using AI, but the company told the Guardian that \u201cif an author would like to undergo an editing process with Spines, it would be done solely by a human editor\u201d."

            "content": "Back in 2022, when ChatGPT arrived, I was part of the first wave of users. Delighted but also a little uncertain what to do with it, I asked the system to generate all kinds of random things. A song about George Floyd in the style of Bob Dylan. A menu for a vegetarian dinner party. A briefing paper about alternative shipping technologies. The quality of what it produced was variable, but it made clear something that is even more apparent now than it was then. That this technology wasn\u2019t just a toy. Instead its arrival is an inflection point in human history. Over coming years and decades, AI will transform every aspect of our lives. But we are also at an inflection point for those of us who make our living with words, and indeed anybody in the creative arts. Whether you\u2019re a writer, an actor, a singer, a film-maker, a painter or a photographer, a machine can now do what you do, instantly and for a fraction of the cost. Perhaps it can\u2019t do it quite as well as you can just yet, but like the Tyrannosaurus rex in the rear vision mirror in the original Jurassic Park, it\u2019s gaining on you, and fast. Faced with the idea of machines that can do everything that human beings can do, some have just given up. Lee Sedol, the Go Grandmaster who was defeated by DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo system in 2016 retired on the spot, declaring AlphaGo was \u201can entity that couldn\u2019t be beaten\u201d, and that his \u201centire world was collapsing\u201d. Others have asserted the innate superiority of art made by humans, effectively circling the wagons around the idea that there is something in the things we make that cannot be replicated by technology. In the words of Nick Cave: Songs arise out of suffering \u2026 the complex, internal human struggle of creation \u2026 [but] algorithms don\u2019t feel. Data doesn\u2019t suffer \u2026 What makes a great song great is not its close resemblance to a recognisable work. Writing a good song is not mimicry, or replication, or pastiche, it is the opposite. It is an act of self-murder that destroys all one has strived to produce in the past. It\u2019s an appealing position, and one I\u2019d like to believe \u2013 but sadly, I don\u2019t. Because not only does it commit us to a hopelessly simplistic \u2013 and, frankly, reactionary \u2013 binary, in which the human is intrinsically good, and the artificial is intrinsically bad, it also means the category of creation we\u2019re defending is extremely small. Do we really want to limit the work that we value to those towering works of art wrought out of profound feeling? What about costume design and illustration and book reviews and all the other things people make? Don\u2019t they matter? Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Perhaps a better place to begin a defence of human creativity might be in the process of creation itself. Because when we make something, the end product isn\u2019t the only thing that matters. In fact it may not even be the thing that matters most. There is also value in the act of making, in the craft and care of it. This value doesn\u2019t inhere in the things we make, but in the creative labour of making them. The interplay between our minds and our bodies and the thing we are making is what brings something new \u2013 some understanding or presence \u2013 into the world. But the act of making changes us as well. That can be joyous, and at other times it can be frustrating or even painful. Nonetheless it enriches us in ways that simply prompting a machine to generate something for us never will. What\u2019s happening here isn\u2019t about unleashing our imaginations, it\u2019s about outsourcing them. Generative AI strips out part of what makes us human and hands it over to a company so they can sell us a product that claims to do the same thing. In other words the real purpose of these systems isn\u2019t liberation, but profit. Forget the glib marketing slogans about increasing productivity or unleashing our potential. These systems aren\u2019t designed to benefit us as individuals or a society. They\u2019re designed to maximise the ability of tech corporations to extract value by strip-mining the industries they disrupt. This reality is particularly stark in the creative industries. Because the ability of AI systems to magic up stories and images and videos didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. In order to be able to make these things, AIs have to be trained on massive amounts of data. These datasets are generated from publicly available information: books, articles, Wikipedia entries and so on in the case of text; videos and images in the case of visual data. Exactly what these works are is already highly contentious. Some, such as Wikipedia and out-of-copyright books, are in the public domain. But much \u2013 and possibly most \u2013 of it is not. How could ChatGPT write a song about George Floyd in the style of Bob Dylan without access to Dylan\u2019s songs? The answer is it couldn\u2019t. It could only imitate Dylan because his lyrics formed part of the dataset that was used to train it. Between the secretiveness of these companies and the fact the systems themselves are effectively black boxes, the inner processes of which are opaque even to their creators, it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what has been ingested by any individual AI. What we do know for sure is that vast amounts of copyright material has already been fed into these systems, and is still being fed into them as we speak, all without permission or payment. But AI doesn\u2019t just incrementally erode the rights of authors and other creators. These technologies are designed to replace creative workers altogether. The writer and artist James Bridle has compared this process to the enclosure of the commons, but whichever way you cut it, what we are witnessing isn\u2019t just \u201csystematic theft on a mass scale\u201d, it\u2019s the wilful and deliberate destruction of entire industries and the transfer of their value to shareholders in Silicon Valley. This unconstrained rapaciousness isn\u2019t new. Despite ad campaigns promising care and connection, the tech industry\u2019s entire model depends upon extraction and exploitation. From publishing to transport, tech companies have employed a model that depends upon inserting themselves into traditional industries and \u201cdisrupting\u201d them by sidestepping regulation and riding roughshod over hard-won rights or simply fencing off things that were formerly part of the public sphere. In the same way Google hoovered up creative works to make its libraries, filesharing technologies devastated the music industry, and Uber\u2019s model depends on paying its drivers less than taxi companies, AI maximises its profit by refusing to pay the creators of the material it relies on. Meanwhile the human, environmental and social costs of these technologies are kept carefully out of sight. Interestingly the sense of powerlessness and paralysis many of us feel in the face of the social and cultural transformation unleashed by AI resembles our failure to respond to climate change. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a coincidence. With both there is a profound mismatch between the scale of what is taking place and our capacity to conceptualise it. We find it difficult to imagine fundamental change, and when faced with it, tend to either panic or just shut down. But it\u2019s also because, as with climate change, we have been tricked into thinking there are no alternatives, and that the economic systems we inhabit are natural, and arguing with them makes about as much sense as arguing with the wind. In fact the opposite is true. Companies like Meta and Alphabet and, more recently, OpenAI, have only achieved their extraordinary wealth and power because of very specific regulatory and economic conditions. These arrangements can be altered. That is within the power of government, and we should be insisting upon it. There are currently cases before the courts in a number of jurisdictions that seek to frame the massive expropriation of the work of artists and writers by AI companies as a breach of copyright. The outcome of these cases isn\u2019t yet clear, but even if creators lose, that fight isn\u2019t over. The use of our work to train AIs must be brought under the protection of the copyright system. And we shouldn\u2019t stop there. We should insist upon payment for the work that has been used, payment for all future use and an end to the tech industry practice of taking first and seeking forgiveness later. Their use of copyright material without permission wasn\u2019t accidental. They did it on purpose because they thought they could get away with it. The time has come for them to stop getting away with it. For that to happen we need regulatory structures that ensure transparency about what datasets are being used to train these systems and what is contained in those datasets. And systems of audits to ensure copyright and other forms of intellectual property are not being violated, and that enforce meaningful sanctions if they are. And we need to insist upon international agreements that protect the rights of artists and other creators instead of facilitating the profits of corporations. But most of all, we need to be thinking hard about why what we do as human beings, and as creators and artists in particular, matters. Because it isn\u2019t enough to fret about what is being lost, or to fight a rearguard action against these technologies. We have to begin to articulate positive arguments for the value of what we do, and of creativity more broadly, and to think about what form that might take in a world where AI is a pervasive reality.

            "date": "2024-11-21T13:00:47Z",
            "content": "In domestic political terms, the foreign policy of the Biden administration has proved almost unimaginably successful \u2013 for Donald Trump, whom it enabled to run for president as the representative, however mendaciously so, of foreign policy restraint. A deep and searching debate on the Democratic party\u2019s approach to foreign affairs is now essential. Since the second world war there has only rarely been a significant difference between the Democrats and Republicans on foreign policy. The most significant divergence around the time of the backlash against the Vietnam war (initiated by a Democratic administration) and Watergate. This, however, lasted barely a decade. After the end of the cold war, Democrats wholeheartedly adopted the \u201cWolfowitz Doctrine\u201d, whereby the US should aim to be a hegemon not just in the world as a whole, but in every region of the world: in effect, an extension of the Monroe Doctrine to the entire planet. Barack Obama tried, to a limited extent, to push back against this, but was largely frustrated by the US foreign and security establishment \u2013 the so-called \u201cBlob\u201d. Can the Democrats break free from the hold of the Blob? If they were guided by US public opinion, it should be easy for them to do so. According to a recent poll, only 56% of Americans think that the US should play an active role in world affairs \u2013 among the lowest level recorded since the end of the Vietnam war. Only a third of Americans overall, and only a minority of Democrats, believe that spreading human rights and defending other nations are important goals. Large majorities in both parties prioritise domestic spending over foreign commitments. And indeed, responding to this public mood, Biden ran in 2020 on the slogan \u201cA foreign policy for the middle class\u201d. Very soon, this joined George Bush\u2019s promise in 2000 to pursue a more modest and restrained foreign policy in the dustbin of history, and Biden was quoting Madeleine Albright, Bill Clinton\u2019s secretary of state, about America being \u201cthe indispensable nation\u201d. Three overarching principles need to shape a new Democratic party approach. First, US policy needs to prioritise common threats to humanity, climate change first among them and international cooperation to address these threats. Second, to achieve such cooperation, the US needs to abandon its messianic strategy of spreading \u201cdemocracy\u201d through US power, which has become in practice little more than a means of trying to undermine rival states. Instead, it should return to relying on the force of US democratic example \u2013 if that example can in fact be renewed. There is after all a certain contradiction in Democrats calling the new US president a fascistic would-be dictator elected by a majority of illiterate bigots, and telling the rest of the world to adopt the US system. Third, the US needs to pull back from the pursuit of domination in every region of the world and instead adopt a limited and realistic strategy of defending America\u2019s position on the world stage as a whole. In Europe, this means accepting a peace deal with Russia (if Trump can achieve one), abandoning Nato expansion and shifting the chief responsibility for European security on to the Europeans, with the US military functioning only as an ultimate backstop. In the far east, this involves drawing a lesson from the defeat of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet by land-based missiles and drones and recognizing that the US navy will soon be incapable of defeating China close to China\u2019s shores \u2013 though on the other hand it remains entirely capable of maintaining US dominance of the world\u2019s oceans. This means that the US will need to share power with China and commit itself to the reunion of China and Taiwan, albeit only at some distant point in future. Finally, there is Israel and the Middle East. A progressive party seeking votes from the young cannot succeed without at least some measure of idealism. The sight of a Democratic administration supporting mass murder and ethnic cleansing abroad, while clubbing, arresting and expelling US students protesting against these crimes, will not persuade idealistic young Americans to vote Democratic. What it will do and has done is to persuade even more of them to do what many were doing already: to stay at home, in a mood of nauseated contempt for the entire US political system. The very least the Democratic party should do is to return to the policies of previous US administrations in setting limits to Israeli aggression. Such changes in their approach to the world would be extremely painful and difficult for the Democrats, but the deepening crisis of the western democracies demands radical new thinking. And if an electoral defeat this shattering does not lead Democrats to rethink some of their basic policies, then nothing will.

He went to Dearborn, the \u201ccapital\u201d of Arab America, attacked Kamala Harris for campaigning with the pro-war Cheneys, and came away with an endorsement from a local imam who called him the \u201cpeace\u201d candidate. In fact, I have lost count of the number of leftists who have told me in recent months: \u201cTrump didn\u2019t start any new wars.\u201d Sorry, what? Trump spent his four years in the White House escalating every single conflict that he inherited from Barack Obama. Many have forgotten that Trump bombed the Assad government in Syria twice; dropped the \u201cmother of all bombs\u201d on Afghanistan; illegally assassinated Iranian general Qasem Soleimani on Iraqi soil; armed Saudi Arabia\u2019s genocide in Yemen; and made John Bolton his national security adviser. Few are even aware that Trump launched more drone strikes in his first two years in office than Obama, dubbed \u201cthe drone president\u201d, did across eight years in office. But this time, we were told, it would be different. This time Trump meant it. No more war! No more neocons! Some took heart from Trump\u2019s very public rejection of arch-hawks Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley. Others signal-boosted efforts by RFK Jr, Don Jr and Tucker Carlson to block neoconservative figures from joining the new Trump-Vance administration. \u201cI\u2019m on it,\u201d bragged Trump\u2019s eldest failson. It was all for naught. \u201cI am peace\u201d? Really? Consider who Trump now plans to nominate as his secretary of state: Marco Rubio. The Florida senator was once an outspoken critic of the president-elect, calling him a \u201ccon man\u201d, \u201cthe most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency\u201d, and questioning the size of his manhood. Fast forward almost a decade and Rubio has happily bent the knee to Trump in order to become fourth in line for the presidency and to take charge of US diplomacy. The slight problem is that Rubio isn\u2019t a fan of diplomacy; he\u2019s a fan of war. An ardent hawk, Rubio defended the invasion of Iraq during his first Senate run in 2010. He has since backed regime change everywhere from Cuba to Venezuela to Iran to Syria. In 2019 he voted to oppose withdrawing US forces from both Syria and Afghanistan. Over the past year, he has been one of the strongest supporters in Congress of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s assault on Gaza, dismissing widespread Palestinian civilian casualties as the fault only of Hamas, and saying that Israel cannot coexist \u201cwith these savages \u2026 They have to be eradicated.\u201d \u201cI am peace\u201d? At Rubio\u2019s side, running the Trump transition team at the state department, is Brian Hook, a long-standing Iran hawk and co-founder of the John Hay Initiative, an anti-isolationist Republican group. He was the architect of the \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran during Trump\u2019s first term. And, as I revealed for the Intercept in 2018, Hook was in charge of the the state department\u2019s policy planning staff when one of its internal memos called for an \u201cIslamic reformation\u201d. \u201cI am peace\u201d? Trump wants Elise Stefanik to be the new US ambassador to the United Nations. The New York congresswoman is perhaps best known for being a Trump sycophant par excellence but she is also a long-standing Republican hawk whose first job out of college was working in the Bush White House. She later went on to be employed by two of the most hawkish thinktanks in Washington DC, the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD) and the Foreign Policy Initiative (FPI). The FDD is obsessed (obsessed!) with regime change in Iran, while the FPI, which was co-founded by neocons Bill Kristol and Robert Kagan and closed down in 2017, loudly pushed for an expansion of the war in Afghanistan. Stefanik is also a blind supporter of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, backs an uninterrupted supply of US weapons to the Netanyahu government, and has slammed Joe Biden for being too tough on the Jewish state. In May, she gave an address to the Knesset in which she called for a \u201ctotal victory\u201d against Hamas. \u201cI am peace\u201d? Trump is appointing Florida congressman Mike Waltz as his national security adviser. Waltz, a former Green Beret, is perhaps the leading China hawk in Congress. Like Stefanik, Waltz is also an alumnus of the Bush administration and an enthusiast for the \u201cwar on terror\u201d. As late as 2017, he was still calling for a \u201cmulti-generational war\u201d against terrorism and suggesting the US should be ready for \u201ca lot more fighting\u201d in Afghanistan. That sound dovish to you? In fact, here\u2019s the best (worst?) part: he served as counterterrorism adviser to the most hawkish vice-president in US history, the prince of darkness himself: Richard B Cheney. Got that? Trump spent the last few weeks of his presidential campaign attacking Dick and Liz Cheney, suggesting the latter should be forced to face \u201cnine barrels\u201d on the battlefield, and then just days after winning the election tapped the elder Cheney\u2019s former counterterrorism adviser to be his own national security adviser. File it under: You. Cannot. Make. This. Stuff. Up. \u201cI am peace\u201d? Trump is sending former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee to Israel as his ambassador. Huckabee is a Christian evangelical so extreme that he believes there is \u201cno such thing as a West Bank\u201d and \u201cno such thing as an occupation\u201d. He compared Barack Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear deal to the Nazi Holocaust and was such a proud supporter of the Iraq war that he even criticized George W Bush for setting a timetable for withdrawal! \u201cI am peace\u201d? Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary is Fox host Peter Hegseth, a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Dubbed \u201cTrump\u2019s war whisperer\u201d, Hegseth called for the US to disregard the \u201crigged\u201d rules of war in order to attack Iranian religious and cultural sites in 2020, and also helped persuade Trump to pardon three soldiers accused or convicted of war crimes in 2019. How do you get more hawkish than a supporter of a literal war criminal? In Washington DC, as the saying goes, personnel is policy. Trump is surrounding himself with hawks so you can be assured that his will be a very hawkish administration. Again. But this is the Trump playbook: run as a dove, govern as a hawk. It\u2019s what he did in 2016 and again this year. Attack neocons; get elected; hire neocons. So \u201cDonald the dove\u201d, as Maureen Dowd of the New York Times once put it? If only. Whether it is on domestic policy or foreign policy, Trump remains a conman. Don\u2019t take my word for it. Take his new secretary of state\u2019s.

            "date": "2024-11-18T11:00:09Z",
            "content": "The nightmare has arrived. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d norm-flouting was bad enough the last time around, when a collection of traditional Republicans in senior positions moderated his worst impulses. No such grown-ups are expected to return. Our only hope may be that Trump no longer must worry about re-election. Instead of pandering to \u2013 and promoting \u2013 the worst instincts of his base, Trump, long preoccupied by his image, may begin to contemplate his legacy. Will history mock or admire him? The greater his concern with his lasting reputation, the better our chances of averting disaster. Ukraine illustrates the choices ahead. Does Trump really want to be known as the Neville Chamberlain of the 21st century, appeasing a brutal tyrant in the naive hope that he will be sated with a single gulp of ill-gotten territory? For reasons that are not wholly understood, Trump has long harbored an unseemly admiration for Vladimir Putin. Trump is likely to stop sending arms to Ukraine and to insist that Kyiv settle for at best a frozen conflict, in effect ceding its occupied eastern territory to Russia. But with Trump in the White House, Putin is likely to want more. Behind Putin\u2019s self-serving rhetoric about denazifying Ukraine is a desire to de-democratize it. A democratic Ukraine on Russia\u2019s border is a constant reminder to the Russian people of the freedoms that Putin\u2019s dictatorship denies them. He wants another Belarus. No amount of strongman-admiration on Trump\u2019s part will overcome the Ukrainian people\u2019s refusal to become another Kremlin vassal state. Nor will it avoid Ukraine\u2019s understandable distrust of Putin and insistence on western security guarantees if there is to be any formal accord. Trump as Chamberlain would be indifferent to Kyiv\u2019s pleas. A Trump sensitive to his place in history might be more accommodating. Moreover, a humiliating surrender for Ukraine would hardly go unnoticed in Beijing. Trump might try to spin it as enabling greater focus on China, which he rightly sees as a threat, but Xi Jinping is likely to read it as a lack of resolve. If Trump will not defend an aspiring democracy on the threshold of the European Union, why would he prevent Beijing from incorporating Taiwan by threatened or actual force? Even close American allies such as Japan and South Korea would quickly recalibrate their need to accommodate Beijing. Is that what Trump wants to be remembered for? Trump mainly sees China as a commercial threat. Having hiked tariffs during his last presidency (Joe Biden maintained them), Trump now threatens to substantially increase them. He laughably claims that China would pay for the tariffs, ignoring the near-universal view of economists that the cost would be passed on to American consumers. Trump contends that tariffs would force more manufacturing to US soil, but a battle of tit-for-tat tariffs would more immediately fuel inflation. During the campaign, Trump played on many Americans\u2019 mistaken tendency to equate higher prices from past inflation with ongoing inflation, but they would soon appreciate the difference as prices again soared. Biden showed the way toward a smarter trade policy \u2013 one built on common values rather than mere competition \u2013 that Trump would be wise to continue and expand. Beyond subsidies, many Chinese producers exploit Beijing\u2019s use of Uyghur forced labor, especially in China\u2019s north-west province of Xinjiang. That forced labor infects exports of cotton, tomatoes, aluminum and, significantly, polysilicon, the building block of China\u2019s corner-the-market solar panels. Both the US government and the European Union claim to oppose importing the product of forced labor, but only the United States has created a legislative presumption against any imports from Xinjiang without proof that forced labor was not involved \u2013 proof that is impossible to obtain given China\u2019s opaque supply chains. The EU never adopted that presumption, so imports from Xinjiang have surged, while US imports have diminished. A smart policy on trade with China would push the EU to adopt a similar presumption. Trump should also have US customs officials pay more attention to Beijing\u2019s subterfuges, such as shipping from Xinjiang via other parts of China or even third countries to avoid the presumption. Israel\u2019s war in Gaza will demand a rethink from Trump. During his first term, he gave Benjamin Netanyahu whatever he wanted, from recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital to greenlighting rapid expansion of Israel\u2019s illegal (war-crime) settlements and refusing to call Palestinian land \u201coccupied\u201d. Now, Trump says that Biden has imposed too many restraints on the Israeli prime minister \u2013 by pushing him to stop bombing and starving Palestinian civilians \u2013 even though Biden refused to use the leverage of conditioning US arms sales and military aid to enforce those demands. Trump wants to let Israel \u201cfinish the job\u201d, ideally quickly, and told Netanyahu to \u201cdo what you have to do\u201d. But an unrestrained Netanyahu might heed the calls of his rightwing ministers to force the mass deportation of the Palestinians of Gaza to Egypt \u2013 a trip that, like the Nakba of 1948, is likely to be one-way. That would outrage the world and almost surely yield additional war-crime charges from the international criminal court (ICC). During Trump\u2019s last term, he disgracefully imposed sanctions on the prior ICC prosecutor for opening investigations that could implicate Israeli officials in Palestinian territory as well as US torturers under George W Bush in Afghanistan. Biden lifted those sanctions, and even mainstream Republicans warmed to the court after its prosecutor charged Putin with war crimes in Ukraine. If Trump were to revive sanctions, he would virtually invite the prosecutor to abandon political restraints that keep him from charging senior US officials (soon, including Trump) for aiding and abetting Israeli war crimes in Gaza. Trump\u2019s desire to expand the Abraham Accords, perhaps the most visible foreign policy achievement of his first term, will also founder without a tougher approach to Israel. Although the Saudi crown prince is notoriously indifferent to the plight of Palestinians, Saudi public opinion has forced him to announce that, however much he wants the carrot of US security guarantees against Iran, he will not normalize relations with Israel without a firm path to a Palestinian state. That is anathema to the Israeli government. Trump must decide whether to abandon his reflexive support for Israel in favor of a deal that would indeed be historic. A similar dilemma faces Trump on Iran. His ripping up of Barack Obama\u2019s nuclear deal has put the clerics just a few short steps from a nuclear bomb. Netanyahu is itching for Trump to join him in a military attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, but that would risk involving American forces in a regional war that Trump wants to avoid. It would also endanger the Gulf states\u2019 oil supplies, fueling inflation. And it would only encourage Iran to obtain a ready-made nuclear weapon from, say, North Korea. Is that what Trump wants? More broadly, Trump needs to decide whether to continue his professed admiration for the world\u2019s autocrats. He seems to relish their ability to act without the impediments of democratic checks and balances that so frustrated him during his first term. But the autocrats have learned to play him. Trump can hardly trumpet his artful dealmaking when word is out that a round of calculated fawning is all it takes to manipulate his fragile ego. Will Trump be known for dispensing with the national interest in his quest for the sugar high of flattery? Despite his transactional, go-it-alone tendencies, even Trump might come to appreciate how few friends he has if he stands for little beyond a quest for praise. Trump might even reconsider his instinctive opposition to multilateral endeavors. Biden, sadly, has already done him the favor of abandoning the US seat on the UN human rights council. But does Trump really want to defund the World Health Organization again when it is the frontline for our defense against the next pandemic, whether bird flu, mpox, antimicrobial resistance or something as yet unidentified? Does he really want to continue treating climate change as a \u201choax\u201d as severe weather decimates the homes of his supporters? On migration, Trump\u2019s threat to deport millions of undocumented immigrants would cost billions, create labor shortages that fuel inflation and separate millions of US-citizen children from one or both parents. Yet with the need for an election issue behind him, he could negotiate long-awaited comprehensive legislation that would bolster border enforcement, fund the asylum system to reduce backlogs and introduce a statute of limitations that exempts longtime residents (who, despite his racist claims, typically have families, jobs and constructive lives in America) from the threat of deportation. I recognize this may all be wishful thinking. Trump may be too self-absorbed to think beyond the self-gratification of the moment. But if he has a shred of mental space left to worry about his legacy, that may be our best bet to salvage a potentially disastrous presidency \u2013 for America and the world.

            "date": "2024-11-09T09:00:43Z",
            "content": "In the first Trump term Richard Moore, then the political director of the UK Foreign Office and now the head of MI6, admitted half of Britain\u2019s diplomats woke up each morning dreading what they might read on the president\u2019s Twitter feed. The sheer unpredictability of Trump\u2019s caprice, and his faith in his quixotic charisma, made it hard for diplomats to operate. It would often taken feverish consultations with Trump\u2019s senior aides, including some in the Pentagon, before a plan \u2013 such as a premature withdrawal of 2,500 US troops from Afghanistan \u2013 could be finessed. Now, for all the pro-forma congratulations, that sense of foreboding is back. Although only 4% of the American electorate said foreign policy was the most important issue to them in the election, for those watching from abroad it was the all-consuming preoccupation. That is hardly surprising, as Trump represents an injection of highly combustible material into an already explosive world. Two wars are raging, one now including North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia, and the other still capable of pitting Iran against Israel. And a third with China is looming. In the eyes of Republican foreign policy thinkers, that is at least two wars too many. Yet, extraordinarily, Trump\u2019s campaign left few clues as to how he would conduct foreign policy. Often the proposals he referenced were mere headlines \u2013 such as ending the war in Ukraine in 24 hours; outlandish, such as deporting 10 million migrants; or contradictory, concerning committing to Nato and suggesting Russia does whatever it wants to European freeloaders. Apart from that, there is a broad intent to make tariffs as much as sanctions the central part of the US foreign policy armoury. It is hard to claim it amounted to a serious prospectus. At one level, this is surprising, as so much of Trump\u2019s analysis of America\u2019s domestic ills derives from his analysis of the failures of US foreign policy. Indeed, the link between foreign and domestic policy is a preoccupation of the small group of foreign policy experts closest to him, not least the vice-president-elect, JD Vance. Vance, for instance, has argued: \u201cFrom Iraq to Afghanistan, from the financial crisis to the Great Recession, from open borders to stagnant wages, the people who govern this country have failed and failed again.\u201d He went on: \u201cFurthermore, they failed because they bought into a theory of the world that forgot to put the interests of the US front and centre. No longer. As Trump famously declared back in 2016 when he first won the White House, \u2018Americanism, not globalism, will now be our credo.\u2019\u201d * * * Peace through strength? How Trump intervenes in the world now is a matter of debate within his circle of foreign policy specialists. Jeremy Shapiro from the European Council on Foreign Relations has put them into three tribes \u2013 the restrainers, who want the US to do as little as possible, the prioritisers, who argue that distractions such as Ukraine must be removed to focus on the Great Power competition with China, and the primacists, who insist the US must remain the hegemonic power throughout the globe, and ceding any status to the rising powers in Brics would be fatal. But they all agree Trump\u2019s second term has to be different, because the challenges have changed. Nadia Schadlow, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cHe will step into a more hazardous geopolitical arena than the one he left four years earlier. Simply resuming the foreign policy of his first term will not be sufficient to navigate a complex environment in which US rivals are arming at a rapid pace and, in the case of Russia and Iran, are engaged in regional wars. This is no longer just a competition; today\u2019s conflicts could be a prelude to a wider war.\u201d A second Trump administration, she argued, would need to adjust its mindset to ensure that the US can protect itself and restore deterrence in an increasingly dangerous world. \u201cThe US would need to adopt a strategy of overmatch, a military concept that refers to combining capabilities in sufficient scale to ensure lopsided victories over the enemy in combat,\u201d Schadlow said. \u201cTo achieve overmatch, US forces must be able to seize the initiative, maintain their freedom of action and find ways to limit the country\u2019s adversaries to reactive measures.\u201d This assertion of peace through strength comes with a price tag. She says it would require a \u201cbuild-up of US military force not seen since the last decade of the cold war\u201d. That necessitates prioritising, the key theme of the 2018 Trump national security strategy in which Elbridge Colby had a key role. Colby insists Trump will not oppose alliances per se but view them as less values-driven and more \u201ca private business partnership\u201d, in which both sides aim to have their commercial self-interest satisfied. If those partnerships become inequitable, or the US feels it is being fleeced, then they can be broken. * * * Concessions to Putin and Netanyahu The first test of this transactionalism will come with Ukraine. Vance has already set out one idea of what could happen. He said in September: \u201cTrump would sit down with Russians, Ukrainians and Europeans and say: \u2018You guys need to figure out what a peaceful settlement looks like.\u2019\u201d But Vance said he already knew what this deal would entail, making the European presence at the negotiation table close to superfluous. \u201cThe Russians would retain the land they have taken and a demilitarised zone would be established along the current battle lines, with the Ukrainian side heavily fortified to prevent another Russian invasion,\u201d he said. While the remainder of Ukraine would stay an independent sovereign state, Vance said, Russia would get a \u201cguarantee of neutrality\u201d from Ukraine. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t join Nato, it doesn\u2019t join some of these sort of allied institutions. I think that\u2019s ultimately what this looks like.\u201d By contrast, a lead candidate to be Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Richard O\u2019Brien, writing in Foreign Affairs, said he supported Ukraine so long as Europe paid more, something it feels it is already doing. He wrote: \u201cTrump\u2019s approach would be to continue to provide lethal aid to Ukraine, financed by European countries, while keeping the door open to diplomacy with Russia \u2013 and keeping Moscow off balance with a degree of unpredictability. He would also push Nato to rotate ground and air forces to Poland to augment its capabilities closer to Russia\u2019s border and to make unmistakably clear that the alliance will defend all its territory from foreign aggression. \u201cIf Europe wants to show that it is serious about defending Ukraine, it should admit the country to the European Union immediately, waiving the usual bureaucratic accession protocol.\u201d Conspicuously, in neither plan would there be any room for Ukraine to enter Nato, a red line for Putin. Olaf Scholz, eager to shed the cost of Ukraine before next year\u2019s federal election, may feel Europe has no choice but to urge Zelenskyy to accept, yet there is no guarantee Putin will negotiate. Sir Peter Westmacott, a former UK ambassador to the US, suggests that Trump, if he wants to be the negotiator in chief, should listen to David Cameron and buy Ukraine some time to get some better bargaining chips on the table. Ukraine\u2019s future will be part of a wider discussion, conducted in Europe and across the Atlantic, about the nature of the Russian threat and perennial subject of strengthening European security. Europe, of course, already had four years to make itself more self-reliant before a possible second Trump term. There were phrases bandied about such as \u201cthe era of geopolitical outsourcing is over\u201d. But Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, the German CDU party\u2019s foreign policy expert, told a recent Chatham House event: \u201cWe are not prepared and we are to blame for that.\u201d The European rhetoric never matched reality. The coordination in defence spending advocated by the French for a decade had proved too daunting, expensive and at odds with the needs of national defence industries. A pan-European air defence shield, for example, would cost \u20ac500bn ($540bn; \u00a3416bn), the EU\u2019s incoming defence commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, said this week. That\u2019s roughly 50% more than EU countries collectively spend on defence each year, he added. Europe is already pointing out that, as of June, 23 of Nato\u2019s 32 members had met its target of spending 2% of GDP on defence, twice as many as four years ago. But Colby, who believes the US should focus its energy on China, says that Europe, however indebted, will have to spend still more. In this narrow regard, he and Emmanuel Macron think alike. Part of the problem is that the EU has demonstrated its unwillingness to conduct a common foreign policy, as evidenced by its year-long division over Palestine, divisions born of national histories. Those divisions will allow Trump, in partnership with Benjamin Netanyahu, to ignore the resolutions of the UN, which both men hold in contempt. Netanyahu will have a freer hand to obliterate Hamas and form an Israeli-led administration in Gaza. The sporadic US pressure on Israel to back a two-state solution, encouraged by Saudi Arabia, will dissipate. Trump told Time magazine: \u201cThere was a time when I thought two states could work.\u201d Instead, O\u2019Brien says, Iran and those who trade with Iran will once again feel the heat of maximum sanctions pressure, the policy devised by Stephen Mull, now appointed to be the head of Trump transition at the State Department. Iran in turn will debate in its more isolated circumstances whether the fatwa on possessing nuclear weapons should be lifted. But there will be a tension. Some in the administration will back the Greater Israel project. Others will want Saudi to normalise relations with Israel in a further extension of the Abraham accords, Trump\u2019s signature first-term foreign policy achievement. * * * Focus on China All of this is for a single purpose \u2013 to focus laser-like on the coming challenge of China, and what Colby has referenced as \u201cthe cosmic role of the dice\u201d, the decision facing China on whether to invade Taiwan. The sense that China is the pre-eminent strategic threat shines through the thinking of the entire Trump policy circle, many of whom advocate the complete decoupling of the two economies. Beijing may have drawn comfort from Trump\u2019s recent proclamation that \u201cTaiwan doesn\u2019t give us anything\u201d, even though the US, which he likened to the mafia, gave them protection. But Beijing knows that is not a green light. O\u2019Brien writes: \u201dThe Chinese Communist party seeks to expand its power and security by supplanting the United States as the global leader in technological development and innovation in critical areas such as electric vehicles, solar power, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. To do so, Beijing relies on enormous subsidies, intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices.\u201d Beijing knows what is coming: tariffs. Yet Trump\u2019s threat to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese exports (and up to 200% on electric vehicles) would, if implemented, destabilise international trade patterns and raise political tension with Europe. Brussels would either have to follow suit, or, worried about China retaliating, pursue a visibly different approach towards engagement with China, which may incur US penalties. Those penalties could include efforts to destabilise the EU by offering tariff deals to populist rightwing governments. Dividing allies so as to rule them is far from beneath Trump, and it is far from beneath European states to push one another aside in the hope of winning Trump\u2019s favour. Yet even here, Trump is contradictory. In his last presidency he offered to lift key export controls in return for the elusive trade deal with China that never materialised. Appearing on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast, he attacked the Chips and Science Act, designed to reduce US reliance on Asia for semiconductors and passed with overwhelming Republican support, complaining it had given government support to key American competitors. It is going to take advisers of great patience and loyalty to work alongside what the political scientist Stephen Walt has warned will be \u201can increasingly erratic and infirm president\u201d. It is hard to underestimate how foreign policy will not be about his advisers but about Trump, and the efficacy of his protection-racket diplomacy. He told the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board in October that he would not have to threaten China with the use of US military force over Taiwan because Xi Jinping \u201crespects me and knows I am crazy\u201d. Similarly, he claims he told the Russian leader: \u201cVladimir, if you go after Ukraine, I am going to hit you so hard, you\u2019re not even going to believe it. I\u2019m going to hit you right in the middle of fricking Moscow.\u201d Welcome to the new world order."

            "date": "2024-11-07T07:00:54Z",
            "content": "The US foreign policy establishment is set for one of the biggest shake-ups in years as Donald Trump has vowed to both revamp US policy abroad and to root out the so-called \u201cdeep state\u201d by firing thousands of government workers \u2013 including those among the ranks of America\u2019s diplomatic corps. Trump\u2019s electoral victory is also likely to push the Biden administration to speed up efforts to support Ukraine before Trump can cut off military aid, hamper the already-modest efforts to restrain Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu in Gaza and Lebanon and lead to a fresh effort to slash and burn through major parts of US bureaucracy including the state department. Trump backers have said he will be more organised during his second term, often dubbed \u201cTrump 2.0\u201d, and on the day after election day US media reported that Trump had already chosen Brian Hook, a hawkish State Department official during the first Trump administration, to lead the transition for America\u2019s diplomats. And yet analysts, serving and former US diplomats and foreign officials said that it remained difficult to separate Trump\u2019s bluster from his actual plans when he takes power in January. What is clear is that his priority is to bin many of the policies put in place by his predecessor. \u201cI\u2019m skeptical that the transition process will be super-impactful since the natural instinct of the new team will be to toss all of Biden\u2019s foreign policy in the dumpster,\u201d one former senior diplomat said. \u201cIf you go back to 2016, Mexico didn\u2019t pay for the wall. And, you know, it doesn\u2019t look like there was a secret plan to defeat Isis,\u201d said Richard Fontaine, the CEO of the Center for a New American Security thinktank. \u201cSome of these things didn\u2019t turn out the way that they were talked about on that campaign trail and we go into this without really knowing what the president\u2019s proposal will be for all of this \u2013 and what he will do.\u201d One clear priority, however, is to target many of those involved in crafting US foreign policy as part of a broader purge of the US government. Trump has vowed to revive Schedule F, a designation that would strip tens of thousands of federal employees of their protections as civil servants and define them instead as political appointees, giving Trump immense powers to fire \u201crogue bureaucrats\u201d, as he called them in a campaign statement. Within the State Department, there are concerns that Trump could target the bureaus that focus specifically on issues that he has attacked during his reelection campaign such as immigration. In particular, he could slash entire bureaus of the State Department, including the bureau of population, refugees and migration (PRM, which resettled 125,000 refugees to the US in 2022 alone), as well as the bureau of democracy, human rights and labor, which has focused on the violation of the rights of Palestinians by Israel. Project 2025, a policy memo released by the conservative Heritage Foundation, suggested that Trump would merely reassign PRM to shift resources to \u201cchallenges stemming from the current immigration situation until the crisis can be contained\u201d and said it would demand \u201cindefinite curtailment of the number of USRAP [United States refugee admissions program] refugee admissions\u201d. But the blueprint, authored by Kiron Skinner, a former director of policy planning at the State Department during the first Trump administration, went further, suggesting that Trump could simply freeze the agency\u2019s work for a complete reevaluation of its earlier policy. \u201cBefore inauguration, the president-elect\u2019s department transition team should assess every aspect of State Department negotiations and funding commitments,\u201d a section of the memo said. After inauguration, Skinner wrote, the secretary of state should \u201corder an immediate freeze on all efforts to implement unratified treaties and international agreements, allocation of resources, foreign assistance disbursements, domestic and international contracts and payments, hiring and recruiting decisions, etc\u201d pending a review by a political appointee. \u201cEveryone is bracing [themselves],\u201d said one diplomat stationed abroad. \u201cSome [diplomats] may choose to leave before he even arrives.\u201d Trump has also vowed to \u201coverhaul federal departments and agencies, firing all of the corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus\u201d. As Joe Biden enters his lame duck period, the administration will focus on trying to push through $6bn in aid that has already been approved for Ukraine, as well as exerting whatever leverage remains in his administration to find an unlikely ceasefire in Gaza. At the same time, they will have to calm a nervous world waiting to see what Trump has planned for his second term. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to do everything they can to make the case that the United States needs to continue to aid Ukraine, and they\u2019ll have to spend a lot of time, I\u2019m sure, dealing with nervous Ukrainians and nervous Europeans,\u201d said Fontaine. At an upcoming G20 summit in Rio, the current administration was \u201cgoing to try to reassure the rest of the world that a lot of the things that they have done over the past four years are going to stick into the future rather than just be kind of undone\u201d. \u201cAnd,\u201d he added, \u201cwe\u2019ll see what the reaction to that is.\u201d"

            "content": "When Margot Robbie made a surprise cameo in the 2015 film adaptation of Michael Lewis\u2019s book The Big Short, she did more to educate the general population about the risks of securitisation than most financial experts. The Australian actor\u2019s brief monologue, notoriously delivered from a champagne bubble bath, explained how banks were bundling up their growing cache of risky sub-prime mortgages into investable bonds, before slicing them up and selling them off for profit. But the proliferation of these mortgage-backed securities in the early 2000s meant there was a catastrophic ripple effect across the global financial system when borrowers started to default on their home loans. The resulting crisis in 2008 triggered a crackdown by regulators. They introduced new rules that could help ensure that asset-backed securities \u2013 once allegedly referred to as \u201ccrack cocaine of the financial services industry\u201d by the billionaire Guy Hands \u2013 would never again spark such a massive meltdown. But, 16 years later, some experts believe new risks are emerging. And this time, they are linked to highly indebted companies backed by private equity firms, which are part of the growing but opaque portion of the financial system known as the shadow banking sector. Shadow banking refers to financial firms that face little to no regulation compared with traditional lenders, and includes businesses such as hedge funds, private credit and private equity funds. While the use of securitisation dipped in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, as a result of a tarnished reputation and regulatory backlash, its popularity has subsequently risen. Today, the global securitisation market covers about \u00a34.7tn of assets, according to estimates by analysts at RBC Capital. The UK accounts for about \u00a3300bn of that total, but more than half \u2013 about \u00a3180bn \u2013 is part of the so-called public securitisation market. In this public market, bundled loans are rated by credit rating agencies and sold on to a broad range of investors, and their terms, structure and sales are openly disclosed. These are the routes typically taken by traditional banks, which face far more stringent regulation. The remaining \u00a3120bn is made up of securitised loans bundled up by the shadow banking sector. Private securities are sold directly to a limited pool of sophisticated investors. They are less regulated, need not be reviewed by ratings agencies, and are far more opaque. Some believe that the growth of the private market, and its lack of transparency, could pose a problem. \u201cIt probably is an under-appreciated risk, given the lack of regulation in that space and the complexities of the instruments that are being held there,\u201d Benjamin Toms, an analyst at RBC Capital, said. But even the public securities market warrants close review, according to Natacha Postel-Vinay, an assistant professor at the London School of Economics and expert in regulation and financial history. That includes risks related to collateralised loan obligations (CLOs). These are types of securities that are backed by a pool of debt, including loans to companies with low credit ratings, or struggling businesses that have been snapped up by private equity firms with the help of big loans, in what are known as leveraged buyouts. \u201cThe private equity firms invest in companies that are almost failing, and in order to make these companies survive, they load them up with debt,\u201d said Postel-Vinay. \u201cThese loans end up being repackaged as well, a little bit like the junk mortgages before the 2008 crisis.\u201d And although CLOs are usually made up of different kinds of loans to businesses in a variety of sectors, this does not entirely eradicate risk. \u201cIt\u2019s a game of whack-a-mole. You regulate stuff, but then the financial system finds ways around the regulation very quickly,\u201d Postel-Vinay said. The Bank of England is in the midst of compiling the results of its first stress test involving the shadow banking sector, the results of which are expected to be released at the end of next week. Although it will not focus directly on securitisation, the Bank has not been shy in flagging its concerns. It warned last December that, while UK banks were partly shielded from losses on CLOs by generally holding the highest-quality slices of the securities, the UK financial system was indirectly at risk through its connection to foreign banks and insurers that have a high and growing exposure to the loans held by already highly indebted companies. And in June, the financial policy committee highlighted risks related to the private equity industry more broadly: \u201cVulnerabilities from high leverage, opacity around valuations, variable risk management practices and strong interconnections with riskier credit markets mean the sector has the potential to generate losses for banks and institutional investors.\u201d Postel-Vinay said it was important to determine who should be held responsible before things go wrong. \u201cWe want to make sure that we don\u2019t repeat the mistakes [of the 2000s] and that it\u2019s super, super clear who is responsible for the underlying credit risk in these loans. \u201cThere are underlying loans that need to be repaid, and they need to be screened, and they need to be monitored \u2026 And in these cases, I have to say, there is a lack of transparency. I think a lot of people don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going on.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-18T15:52:40Z",
            "content": "Spirit Airlines said on Monday that it had filed for bankruptcy protection and would attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused decrease in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue. Spirit, the biggest US budget airline, has lost more than $2.5bn since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1bn over the next year. Spirit said it expected to operate as normal as it works its way through a prearranged Chapter 11 bankruptcy process and that customers could continue to book and fly without interruption. All existing tickets, credits and loyalty points can be used as normal. The bankruptcy will not affect employee wages or benefits. The company said in a statement that it had $300m in financing from bondholders that, along with the company\u2019s cash reserves and revenue, was expected to keep the company running during the bankruptcy process. Shares of the Miramar, Florida-based Spirit dropped 25% on Friday, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. It was just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2013 when Spirit was still making money. The airline expected its stock to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange \u201cin the near term\u201d, the company said in a statement. Ted Christie, Spirit CEO, confirmed in August that the company was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. He called the discussions a priority, and said the airline was trying to get the best deal it could as quickly as possible. \u201cThe chatter in the market about Spirit is notable, but we are not distracted,\u201d he told investors during an earnings call. \u201cWe are focused on refinancing our debt, improving our overall liquidity position, deploying our new reimagined product into the market, and growing our loyalty programs.\u201d People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They are just not paying as much. In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they are paying 10% less a mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit\u2019s red ink. It is not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded. There are several reasons behind the slump. Spirit\u2019s costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest US airlines have snagged some of Spirit\u2019s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for US leisure travel \u2013 Spirit\u2019s core business \u2013 have sagged because of a glut of new flights. Last month, Spirit announced it would conduct layoffs as part of $80m in cost-saving measures, though it did not specify how many employees would be affected. The company also announced it had agreed to sell 23 airplanes to GA Telesis, an aviation services company, for $519m. The October announcement briefly boosted the stock, before it came down as bankruptcy appeared likely. The airlines also said in October that it planned to furlough about 330 pilots starting 31 January 2025, in addition to the 186 pilots it furloughed in September. The company downgraded 120 captains to first officers at the time. The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit\u2019s traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. That is a huge change from Spirit\u2019s longtime strategy of luring customers with rock-bottom fares and forcing them to pay extra for things such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda. In a highly unusual move, Spirit plans to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20%, compared with the same period last year, which analysts say should help prop up fares. But that will help rivals more than it will boost Spirit. Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say that Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes. Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, which is forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots. The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target. Frontier Airlines tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the justice department sued to block the $3.8bn deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later. US airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying. The last bankruptcy by a major US carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013."

            "date": "2024-11-22T10:00:10Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the outgoing Biden administration is putting national security at risk and weakening safeguards against corruption, the US senator Elizabeth Warren has warned. The president-elect has broken from precedent by refusing to sign memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with the current White House team and failing to release a comprehensive ethics plan. On Thursday, Warren, a Democratic senator for Massachusetts, wrote to the General Services Administration (GSA), an agency that oversees much of the presidential transition process, to raise the alarm. In her letter, seen by the Guardian, she noted that the MOUs are normally mundane agreements, which no previous president-elect has refused to sign. \u201cThe Trump team\u2019s unprecedented refusal to sign agreements with the outgoing administration threatens the American public by hamstringing incoming officials\u2019 ability to govern responsibly,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cThe Trump Transition has also refused to publish an ethics plan, increasing the risk of the incoming administration governing for the benefit of special interests rather than the American public.\u201d Biden hosted Trump in the Oval Office last week and promised to \u201cdo everything we can to make sure you\u2019re accommodated\u201d. Trump said he looked forward to a \u201ctransition that\u2019s so smooth it\u2019ll be as smooth as it can get\u201d, but suffered a setback on Thursday when Matt Gaetz, his pick for attorney general, withdrew from consideration due to sexual misconduct allegations against him. The president-elect\u2019s transition has been led by Howard Lutnick, Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s chief executive, and Linda McMahon, the former wrestling executive who led the Small Business Administration during Trump\u2019s first term. Both have been named in Trump\u2019s new cabinet. Warren co-sponsored the Presidential Transition Enhancement Act of 2019 to strengthen the ethics requirements that govern presidential transitions. In her letter to the GSA administrator, Robin Carnahan, she wrote that the Trump transition team had not signed MOUs with the GSA for administrative support or with the White House for access to federal employees, facilities and documents. Nor had it entered an MOU with the justice department for FBI background checks on nominees, delaying critical vetting for national security positions. Warren cited The 9/11 Commission Report, which linked the delayed transition in 2000 to national security vulnerabilities that \u201cmay have contributed to the 9/11 attack\u201d. In addition, the Trump transition team missed the 1 October deadline set by the Presidential Transition Act for publishing an ethics plan, raising concerns about potential corruption and undue influence from special interests. Warren wrote: \u201cThe Trump Transition has prepared an ethics code, but it includes nothing about how President-elect Trump will manage his own extensive financial conflicts of interest \u2013 which experts anticipate will be one of the most alarming corruption challenges of the incoming administration.\u201d Furthermore, she said, the transition team remains unbound by donor contribution limits and disclosure requirements, and is relying on private donors rather than federal funds \u2013 \u201copening Trump\u2019s team to financial corruption with no public transparency even before he takes office\u201d. Warren also requested information and accountability from the GSA regarding the Trump transition team\u2019s actions, which she said violate the Presidential Transition Enhancement Act, signed into law by Trump himself. She added: \u201cIn effect, President-elect Trump is undermining his administration\u2019s ability to manage urgent national security threats, health and safety threats, and serious conflicts of interest starting on day one of his presidency.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-06T14:10:39Z",
            "content": "Somalia has announced that more than $1.1bn (\u00a3860m) of outstanding loans will be cancelled by the US, a sum representing about a quarter of the country\u2019s remaining debt. The announcement is the latest in a series of agreements in which Somalia\u2019s creditors have committed to forgiving its debt obligations. Most of Somalia\u2019s debt had built up during the era of Siad Barre\u2019s military dictatorship, which collapsed in the early 1990s and triggered a ruinous three-decade civil war. Somalia\u2019s president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, said the country had been \u201csuffocating under the huge weight of unsustainable debt\u201d as interest payments that could not be paid accrued \u201cduring the painful, prolonged period of state collapse\u201d. On Tuesday, the US and Somalia signed an agreement formalising debt cancellation worth $1.14bn. In a post on X, Somalia\u2019s finance minister, Bihi Egeh, expressed gratitude, thanking the \u201cUS government and people for their unwavering support of our economic reforms and growth\u201d. Mohamed Shire, director general of Somalia\u2019s Ministry of Planning, Investment and Economic Development, hailed the \u201chistoric\u201d agreement, adding that it was more \u201cexcellent news for Somalia\u2019s ongoing recovery effort\u201d. In a tweet on X, Mohamed Dubo, head of the Somali government\u2019s official investment promotion office, posted: \u201cSomalia can now face its future UNCHAINED.\u201d The US was Somalia\u2019s largest bilateral lender, holding approximately a fifth of Somalia\u2019s total debt in 2018, prior to the beginning of its debt-relief efforts, according to IMF figures. Speaking at the embassy in Mogadishu, where the announcement was made, the US ambassador, Richard Riley, described it as a \u201cgreat day\u201d for both countries. \u201cThis was the largest single component of the $4.5bn debt that Somalia owed to various countries, which was forgiven through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative [HIPC].\u201d The initiative is an economic and financial reform programme led by the IMF and the World Bank, aimed at relieving the poorest countries of unsustainable debt levels. In December 2023, Somalia announced that after completing its HIPC programme it had become eligible for $4.5bn in debt relief, and normalised its relationship with international financial institutions after decades of exclusion. Riley said: \u201cWith support from the United States and our partners, Somalia undertook a host of reforms, passing new laws, changing operational practices, and bringing improved accountability to its finances while transitioning to sustainable practices.\u201d In March, the Paris Club, a group of some of the world\u2019s wealthiest creditor countries, announced that it would also waive 99% of $2bn Somalia owed its members. According to the World Bank, this reduced Somalia\u2019s external debt from \u201c64% of GDP in 2018 to less than 6% of GDP by the end of 2023\u201d. That was followed in June by another agreement with the Opec Fund for International Development, which cleared $36m Somalia owed, with a bridging loan provided by Saudi Arabia. \u201cThe signing of today\u2019s agreement will also unlock new resources from the Opec Fund for our national development,\u201d Egeh said at the time. Harry Verhoeven, an expert on the political economy of the Horn of Africa, said Somalia\u2019s debt forgiveness was \u201cmeaningful\u201d as it \u201cenables Somalia to more readily access public financing\u201d from multilateral development banks. However, he said private creditors were likely to remain cautious due to lingering concerns about \u201cfinancial governance and political instability\u201d."

            "content": "Canada has ordered TikTok to shut down its operations in the country after conducting a security review, but users will not be barred from accessing the video app or uploading content to it. The Canadian government said it was demanding the winding up of TikTok\u2019s business in the country due to \u201cspecific national security risks\u201d. It currently has offices in Vancouver and Toronto. \u201cThe decision was based on the information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community and other government partners,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, Canada\u2019s minister of innovation, science and industry. Champagne added that the government was not blocking citizens\u2019 access to TikTok or their ability to post content on the platform. TikTok has been banned from government-issued phones in Canada, the US, the UK, New Zealand and Australia amid concerns about the Chinese-owned app\u2019s access to user data. Champagne\u2019s statement did not give details of the security concerns behind the move but referred to risks related to ByteDance, the Beijing-based owner of the app, and its operations in Canada through TikTok Technology Canada. \u201cIt is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices and assess the possible risks of using social media platforms and applications, including how their information is likely to be protected, managed, used and shared by foreign actors,\u201d said Champagne. A TikTok spokesperson said : \u201cShutting down TikTok\u2019s Canadian offices and destroying hundreds of well-paying local jobs is not in anyone\u2019s best interest, and today\u2019s shutdown order will do just that. We will challenge this order in court. TikTok takes data privacy concerns very seriously.\u201d TikTok faces the threat of a full ban in US where the White House has introduced a law that gives ByteDance, until 19 January to sell its stake in the platform to an approved buyer, otherwise the app will be shut down. The president-elect, Donald Trump, who tried to force a sale of TikTok during his first administration, has said on the campaign trail he would \u201csave\u201d it.

            "date": "2024-11-13T17:58:42Z",
            "content": "Congratulations to Thames Water: it is not going bust early in the new year. Probably. The necessary three-quarters of A-class bondholders have backed a proposal for the company, already drowning in \u00a315bn of debt, to borrow another \u00a33bn at the nose-bleed rate of 9.75% plus a hefty serving of fees on top. And, critically, the numbers are looking good to get permission from bondholders to access \u00a3400m of cash reserves. A court still has to approve the new \u00a33bn of \u201csuper senior\u201d funding \u2013 meaning debt that ought to be super-safe because it ranks above both the A class of bonds and the junior Bs. But if that hurdle is cleared next month, Thames will have shoved its debt mess around another U-bend. The script then imagines a more permanent restructuring of the finances \u2013 surely with hefty debt write-downs \u2013 at some point in the next 18 months. The company may also take a detour to the Competition and Markets Authority to appeal against Ofwat\u2019s final proposal (also due next month) on bills for the next five-year period. Everybody happy? Well, of course not. The transparency around this emergency fundraising process has been miserable. Why has the board of Thames not explained why it wants to borrow at 9.75% when the B class of bondholder was touting an alternative proposal at 8%? Wednesday\u2019s announcement didn\u2019t bother to address the question. Mutterings from the wings suggest the Bs arrived too late in the day, that only the As were likely to get the necessary 75% support, and the corporate priority was survival and the need to avoid sudden collapse into special administration, AKA temporary nationalisation. Come on, though \u2013 the borrowing terms aren\u2019t a small detail. A rate of 8% beats 9.75% and, once the various pots of fees are totted up, the gap in terms of hard payments by Thames may amount to hundreds of millions of pounds. The precise figures are disputed but the board of Thames is perfectly positioned to offer a definitive opinion. But it hasn\u2019t. This newspaper reported at the weekend that the board was split over which deal to back, which would be understandable. But, if it has now come to a conclusion, it should explain its thinking. One can, of course, see this affair as the normal argy-bargy one sees between different classes of bondholder in any restructuring. And, at one level, that\u2019s correct. Everyone is jostling for position in the eventual permanent debt-for-equity swap, and it\u2019s no surprise that the As, as the senior and bigger class of bondholder (\u00a312bn-worth), have brought more muscle to the scrap. Yet Thames is not any old company. It is an outfit with 16 million customers that has failed those customers so badly it is now in a form of regulatory \u201cspecial measures\u201d. And, since the current emergency fundraising will have a direct bearing on the debt-for-equity conversion \u2013 and thus who emerges as owners \u2013 transparency ought to be set to maximum. In theory, the poor old customers \u2013 already braced for substantially higher bills whatever happens \u2013 are spared additional financial pain via this emergency debt top-up. But some of us would still like to know how the board is reaching its decisions. Yes, the company is a deeply distressed borrower \u2013 but it\u2019s still allowed to explain its thinking."

            "date": "2024-11-25T14:19:19Z",
            "content": "Barclays will pay a fine of \u00a340m for \u201creckless\u201d failures to disclose a fundraising deal with Qatar at the height of the financial crisis, after the British bank agreed to withdraw a legal challenge against it. The FTSE 100 bank effectively won a discount of \u00a310m by challenging the fine, but was found by the regulator to have committed serious misconduct. Barclays withdrew an appeal shortly before it was due to be heard on Monday by the upper tribunal, a court in London \u2013 although it said it still disputed the findings. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) first imposed a \u00a350m fine in 2022 after a long examination of the hurried deals struck as the British banking system teetered on the edge of collapse during the financial crisis of 2008. The UK government was forced to bail out Lloyds Banking Group and the former Royal Bank of Scotland, now known as NatWest Group, to prevent the crisis escalating further. Barclays narrowly avoided UK government intervention thanks to the deal with the Qatari state, as part of efforts in June and October 2008 to raise \u00a311.8bn. The Qatar Investment Authority still owns 2.9% of Barclays. That deal included a fee paid to Qatar of \u00a3322m, which critics saw as a way of Barclays giving a steep discount that was not offered to other shareholders. The FCA on Monday said that failure to tell shareholders at the time was \u201cmisleading, false and/or deceptive\u201d. The Barclays board did not want to accept government ownership because that would limit its ability to pay dividends and executive bonuses. However, they also knew that the Qatari demands were \u201clikely to be unacceptable to Barclays\u2019 existing shareholders\u201d because they would cost more than the government funding, the FCA said. The separate fees given to Qatar were not disclosed, despite advice that they should be. The FCA said Barclays showed a \u201cfailure to act with integrity\u201d. The FCA first announced that it was looking at the deal in 2013 but put enforcement on hold while the Serious Fraud Office brought a case for conspiracy to commit fraud and the provision of unlawful financial assistance. The SFO lost that case in 2018 and the FCA restarted its case, and found that Barclays misled other investors by failing to disclose the terms of the Qatari deal. The deal kept the bank out of UK government hands, but it has struggled with a string of challenges since. John Varley, the chief executive who led the lender through the financial crisis and who would have appeared at the tribunal this week, handed over to Bob Diamond in 2011. However, Diamond was forced out within 18 months after the bank was accused on manipulating a key interest rate benchmark. A later successor as chief executive, Jes Staley, was forced to resign in 2021 and banned from holding senior City roles last year after misleading regulators over the strength of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted paedophile. Steve Smart, the joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: \u201cBarclays\u2019 misconduct was serious and meant investors did not have all the information they should have had. However, the events took place over 16 years ago and we recognise that Barclays is a very different organisation today, having implemented change across the business. It is important that listed firms provide investors with the information they need.\u201d Barclays said it continued to dispute the FCA\u2019s findings even as it agreed to pay \u00a340m, which it had already accounted for in 2022. The bank\u2019s share price rose by 1.9% on Monday to \u00a32.62, just shy of its peak last week of \u00a32.64, the highest point since the summer of 2015. The bank was valued at \u00a337bn on Friday. In a statement on Monday, Barclays said it \u201cdoes not accept the findings\u201d outlined in decision notices by the FCA. \u201cIn view of the time elapsed since the events, Barclays wishes to draw a line under the issues referred to in the decision notices and has decided not to contest the decision notices further,\u201d the bank said. \u201cNotwithstanding the difference of view, Barclays has concluded that the interests of the bank, its shareholders and other stakeholders are best served by withdrawing the references.\u201d"

They requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from future job prospects. \u201cLosing an election does not absolve the organization of its responsibility to treat workers with basic dignity.\u201d Over 100 staff at the DNC voted to unionize with Service Employees International Union Local 500 in January 2022. Workers were notified at night on 13 November of the layoffs, according to the press release, and the union claimed the DNC had not disclosed to the union the full extent of the layoffs or if additional cuts were planned. The former staffer argued that nothing in the union contract precludes the DNC from providing severance and transparency regarding layoffs. \u201cHow could we have raised record-breaking numbers and still find ourselves in this situation?\u201d they added. The press release claimed DNC leadership had not been responsive in the wake of the layoffs and criticized the layoffs in contrast to the staff management whose decisions \u201ccreated this situation\u201d remain on payroll. \u201cEvery cycle, political organizations scale up to meet the demands, and as the cycle comes to a close, it\u2019s a tough reality of our industry that we must part with talented, hardworking staff,\u201d a DNC spokesperson said in a statement to the Guardian \u201cWhile the DNC has met the terms of the union agreement negotiated by the CBA, we share the entire DNC family\u2019s frustration and continue to provide resources to all members of the team to support them in this transition.\u201d They claimed, per the Warn Act, staffers were notified 60 days in advance of termination, that 95% of staffers laid off were cycle hires. They also claimed that all union contract terms were upheld and that the DNC union and DNC management had been in communication, adding that the current DNC staff were focused on the transition ahead of the new DNC chair election early next year, ongoing fundraising and infrastructure upkeep, and holding Trump\u2019s Republican party accountable."

            "date": "2024-11-27T19:00:21Z",
            "content": "Australian researchers have created building blocks out of DNA to construct a series of nano-scale objects and shapes, from a rod and a square to an infinitesimally small dinosaur. The approach turns DNA into a modular material for building nanostructures \u2013 thousands of times narrower than a human hair. Developed by researchers from the University of Sydney Nano Institute and published in the journal Science Robotics, it suggests exciting possibilities for future use of nanobot technology. As a proof-of-concept, the authors made more than 50 tiny shapes to test their precision and express their creativity. These included a dragon, a dinosaur, and a tiny map of Australia measuring only 150 nanometres wide. (A nanometre is one millionth of a millimetre.) University of Sydney scientist Dr Shelley Wickham, co-author of the paper and research team leader, said the dinosaur was her favourite because it had both compact and flexible parts and was \u201cnot something that could assemble by accident\u201d. The director of RMIT\u2019s micro nano research facility, Prof Arnan Mitchell, who was not involved with the paper, noted that the approach relied on using DNA as a mechanical object rather than as a chemical. This was interesting, he said, because structures made from DNA were potentially small enough to be used in drug delivery. DNA could be wrapped around a drug to protect it for delivery to a particular part of the body, he said. \u201cDeliver it to where it needs to go, and then use light or heat or something else to make it unfurl and release the drug.\u201d With increased complexity and greater control, Wickham said the researchers\u2019 approach could be used to make components for robotic boxes capable of delivering targeted drugs, or in the development of smart materials that could respond to the environment. \u201cThis work enables us to imagine a world where nanobots can get to work on a huge range of tasks, from treating the human body to building futuristic electronic devices.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Wickham outlined the process. The first step involved making the 3D building blocks, called \u201cvoxels\u201d, she said. DNA, extracted from a type of virus called a bacteriophage, was \u201cfolded\u201d into a cylindrical shape using an approach called DNA origami and held together with synthetic DNA (made by chemists). Voxels were formed by self-assembly, Wickham explained, relying on carefully sequenced DNA binding together at pre-determined locations, a bit like velcro or specialised glue. \u201cWe throw in 300 of these staples that all have a unique DNA sequence \u2013 like a unique glue \u2013 and they find different parts of the scaffold and stitch it together,\u201d she said. Additional DNA strands incorporated on to the exterior of the voxels, acted as programmable binding sites. These could be used to join voxels together to construct more complex shapes and modular objects, which could be viewed under an electron microscope. \u201cThe results are a bit like using Meccano, the children\u2019s engineering toy,\u201d Wickham said. \u201cAs experimentalists, we spent a lot of time designing these on computers. And then we take the DNA and mix it together and it assembles itself.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-10T17:23:14Z",
            "content": "Ukraine has carried out its biggest drone strike on Moscow since Vladimir Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022, Russian media said on Sunday, as the Kremlin launched its own record air attack over Ukraine. Three airports in the Russian capital were temporarily closed and flights were diverted. At least one person was injured. Russia said its air defences shot down 70 drones, nearly half of them in the skies above Moscow and the rest in western Russia. The general staff of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces said it successfully targeted an ammunition dump near the Russian city of Bryansk. Video showed multiple explosions coming from warehouses on the military site. Fires could be seen burning in the night sky. Other footage posted on Russian Telegram channels recorded drones buzzing above urban areas including suburbs of multistorey buildings and a lorry park. Ukrainian commentators said the strike on Moscow was in response to a massive Russian drone barrage directed at Kyiv on Thursday, soon after Donald Trump was elected as US president. On Saturday and Sunday, Moscow sent over another wave of 145 drones, the largest number yet. There was damage to the Black Sea port of Odesa. Ukrainian officials said 62 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were downed and others lost en route. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said it had thwarted a \u201cterrorist attack\u201d on its territory using \u201cairplane-type drones\u201d. At least 36 planes were diverted, the country\u2019s air transport agency said. Both sides have developed innovative and increasingly sophisticated UAV programmes. Ukraine has established its own drone command and has improved the range of its systems, with attacks hundreds of kilometres into Russia. It has hit weapons storage units, oil processing facilities and enemy airstrips near the Arctic Circle, as well as naval vessels in the Caspian Sea. Russia has begun using drones steered by fibre-optic cables in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops control a salient around the Russian town of Sudzha. The new drones cannot be jammed with regular electronic countermeasures. The air attacks happened as Russia reportedly massed 50,000 soldiers to launch a major assault aimed at recapturing Ukrainian-held territory in Kursk oblast. The force, which includes North Korean reinforcements, is likely to attack in the coming days, according to a US assessment cited on Sunday by the New York Times. Pyongyang has sent 11,000 troops to take part in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week. Russia has seized a dozen or so villages and has shrunk the area controlled by Ukraine. But despite carrying out numerous attacks \u2013 using guided bombs, kamikaze drones, and infantry groups \u2013 it has been unable to dislodge dug-in Ukrainian combat units. Trump\u2019s victory has fuelled speculation that Russia\u2019s 10-year-old war against its smaller neighbour may be coming to a close. Zelenskyy spoke to Trump last week and also chatted to Elon Musk, after Trump passed the phone to the billionaire. The president-elect famously boasted he could fix the war in Ukraine in \u201c24 hours\u201d. Vladimir Putin has indicated he is ready to listen to what Trump has to say, with a pre-condition that the US cease military assistance to Ukraine before bilateral relations can be improved. Zelenskyy is ready to fly to the US this week and hold substantive talks with Trump, sources in Kyiv indicated. Their most recent phone call was \u201cvery positive\u201d, they added. The two met last month in Trump Tower when Zelenskyy flew to New York for the UN general assembly meeting. Trump\u2019s aides have previously sketched the outlines of a Russia-friendly \u201cpeace plan\u201d. It would involve current frontlines being frozen, with the de facto loss by Ukraine of Crimea and much of the east of the country, plus a veto or a long-term pause on Kyiv\u2019s Nato application. What Trump will actually propose in office remains unclear. Musk\u2019s views on Ukraine are wildly contradictory. He has provided Ukraine with Starlink satellite internet, which is used extensively on the frontline and is a crucial tool for Ukraine\u2019s military. Zelenskyy thanked Musk for Starlink during their conversation. At the same time, Musk has echoed Kremlin talking points, calling for Crimea to be made part of Russia and for Ukraine to remain neutral. He has held secret talks with Putin, the Wall Street Journal recently reported. There was no sign of panic on Moscow\u2019s boulevards after the drone attack, agencies reported on Sunday. Muscovites walked their dogs, and the bells of the onion-domed Russian Orthodox churches rang out across the capital."

            "content": "One of Britain\u2019s biggest property developers has reinforced the growing shift to a return to office working, saying that occupancy in its central London offices has grown to an all-time high and the value of its portfolio has returned to growth. The improvement in the market helped Landsec, which owns offices and retail locations such as the Bluewater and Trinity Leeds shopping centres, bounce back to a \u00a3243m pre-tax profit in the six months to the end of September. The company, which has reduced its assets in the City of London from 42% of its office portfolio when the Covid pandemic began in 2020to 23% in 2024, had reported a loss of \u00a3193m in the same period last year. On Friday, Landsec said its West End offices were \u201cpractically full\u201d \u2013 with occupancy across its central London portfolio growing to a high of 97.9% \u2013 and 80% of customers striking lettings deals over the last year either growing space or maintaining existing size. \u201cAcross our central London portfolio, office utilisation continues to grow,\u201d the company said. \u201cRents for highly sustainable, best-in-class offices continue to grow.\u201d Investment activity in London had increased and, as a result, the value of its property portfolio returned to growth, Landsec said. \u201cFollowing two years of softening, property yields stabilised over the last six months.\u201d Landsec\u2019s overall central London office portfolio grew by 0.8% in value year on year to \u00a36.4bn, and within this its assets in the City of London grew by 1.9% to \u00a31.25bn. However, the company said the strongest signs of recovery were in its retail property operation, driven by demand for shops from big brands including Primark and JD Sports. \u201cBrands continue to focus on fewer but bigger and better stores in key locations,\u201d it said. \u201cThis means leading brands continue to take more space with us. As supply of both is constrained, rents continue to increase.\u201d The value of the company\u2019s big shopping centre and retail outlet locations grew by 2.8% year on year to just over \u00a32bn at the end of September. \u201cGiven the attractive returns in major retail, we will focus our investment for the remainder of this year on this, rather than making any new office commitments,\u201d Landsec said. Several high-profile companies including Amazon and Asda have recently asked employees to return to office working more regularly, in a boost to the office property market. Oli Creasey, a property analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said Landsec\u2019s financial results had defied expectations and would be welcomed by shareholders. \u201cLandsec\u2019s half-year results are strong, particularly when considered against recent history and expectations,\u201d he said. \u201cToday\u2019s results represent a positive surprise for shareholders, and the property market generally, demonstrating that core property sectors are likely past the low point in valuations and have now returned to positive, albeit modest, valuation growth.\u201d Shares in Landsec increased by more than 2% on Friday, among the top risers on the FTSE 100 index."

            "date": "2024-11-20T22:02:17Z",
            "content": "The AI chipmaker Nvidia, the world\u2019s most valuable company and the engine of the artificial-intelligence boom, rolled out another set of quarterly results on Wednesday to investors\u2019 delight. The company, whose value has soared by $2.2tn this year to $3.6tn on the back of near-doubling of chip sales, said it had revenue of $35.08bn, against expectations of $33.15bn. Its profits more than doubled year-over-year. Revenue surged 94% from the same quarter last year. The company projected that revenue would increase by 70% in the coming quarter. Analysts anticipated Nvidia to report earnings of $0.75 per share; the company reported $0.81. Shares of Nvidia fell about 5% in extended trading following the announcement but soon recouped the losses to remain at a similar price; they previously closed at $145.89 in New York. The Nvidia chief, Jensen Huang, who last week said he expected the computing power driving advances in generative AI to increase by \u201ca millionfold\u201d over the next decade, said in a press release. In an earnings call, Huang said that global adoption of Nvidia technology was creating a platform shift from coding to machine learning, with traditional data centers being rebuilt for machine learning to produce AI. \u201cGenerative AI is not just a new software capability but a new industry with AI factories manufacturing digital intelligence \u2013 a new industrial revolution that can create a multi-trillion-dollar AI industry,\u201d he said. \u201cAI is transforming every industry, company and country,\u201d Huang added. \u201cCreating an omniverse of synthetically generated data \u2026 the age of robotics is coming.\u201d Soaring demand for Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell GPU chips appears to have quelled anxiety that the company could be hit by pullback in demand from tech giants sinking billions into AI processing and data centers. Nvidia\u2019s value has bounced back after a summer slump, rising 45% from an August low. The chip stock \u2013 up nearly 200% this year and up over 1,100% in the last two years \u2013 hit record highs following the election. But many of Nvidia\u2019s chip-making peers have become a net drag on the industry as they struggle to compete with its AI dominance. Before the results were announced, the Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said he expected another \u201cdrop-the-mic performance\u201d from Nvidia, saying it was \u201cthe only game in town with $1tn+ of AI cap-ex on the way for the next few years with Nvidia\u2019s GPUs the new oil and gold in this world\u201d. The world\u2019s biggest tech companies have increased the amount they invest in AI by billions in recent quarters, positioning Nvidia as a major beneficiary. Nvidia, which many see as a bellwether of the tech sector and artificial-intelligence demand that has helped power Wall Street to multiple record highs this year. But an escalation in the Russia-Ukraine war, the threat of global tariff hikes from Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration, and the likelihood that US interest rates will not be cut by the Federal Reserve have also put markets on edge. Other analysts agreed with Ives\u2019s assessment that demand for Nvidia\u2019s new Blackwell chip could push Nvidia sales and market capitalization to new heights. The Saxo chief investment strategist Charu Chanana wrote that signs of \u201cextraordinary demand\u201d for the new chip, including forecasts of record sales and reports of sold-out inventories for the next year, are strong indicators of Nvidia\u2019s continued high performance. But Chanana warned that \u201cany signs of production delays or demand falling short could pressure the stock given its stretched valuation\u201d. Earlier this week, a report said that the chipmaker is having overheating issues with servers for its newest graphics chip, B200 &amp; GB200 NVL72, both named for David Harold Blackwell, a prominent American mathematician and statistician. A spokesperson for Nvidia did not reject the report directly but said \u201cthe engineering iterations are normal and expected\u201d. The computer billionaire Michael Dell posted that \u201cminutiae can shake you out of tremendous investments every time\u201d."

            "date": "2024-11-15T13:25:56Z",
            "content": "The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, used his Mansion House speech on Thursday to say Brexit had undermined the UK\u2019s economy and to urge the government to improve relations with the EU, for the sake of growth. Could Labour pull the UK closer to the trading bloc \u2013 and would it make much difference to economic growth? What are Labour\u2019s plans? Keir Starmer once used to argue for the return of free movement between the UK and the EU \u2013 an integral part of the single market that binds EU members together. But Labour\u2019s prospectus for this year\u2019s general election made a much more modest set of proposals for making the trade and cooperation agreement (TCA), struck by Boris Johnson, work better. These include trying to strike a sanitary and phytosanitary agreement (SPS) that could alleviate the need for veterinary checks of products such as food at the border; negotiating mutual recognition of professional standards, so that UK lawyers, architects etc could practise freely in the EU; and making it easier for musicians to tour the continent. Will these changes boost growth? These modest aims mesh with the EU\u2019s determination not to reopen the TCA, as well as the fact that most EU countries have more pressing issues on their minds than bringing the UK back into the fold. Some sectors could benefit significantly from reduced friction at the border. However, the limited nature of the plans means most economists believe any upside in terms of GDP growth is likely to be limited. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about increments,\u201d says John Springford, of the Centre for European Reform. \u201cWhile it\u2019s helpful and necessary to try and improve the deal, and absolutely Labour should be doing it, the idea that this will offset the sizeable cost of moving from the single market and customs union to the trade and cooperation agreement is for the birds.\u201d Treasury analysis previously suggested leaving the single market would depress GDP by 3.5%. Returning to the single market and customs union has been firmly ruled out by Labour, which believes voters would not accept the quid pro quo of a return to unfettered EU migration. Recent research by the Resolution Foundation thinktank did suggest there could be additional benefits if the UK chose to go further, aligning regulation with the EU across key sectors \u2013 something Starmer and Reeves have sometimes seemed sympathetic to. For the moment, though, the EU has significant growth challenges of its own: the European Commission forecast on Friday that the German economy would decline by 0.1% in 2024, and the EU as a whole expand by just 0.9%, as the cost of living crisis continues to weigh on demand. How does a Trump administration complicate the picture? Considerably. Trump plans to wield tariffs \u2013 taxes on imports \u2013 as a weapon in his \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to the economy, despite the fact that experts say the plan is likely to drive up inflation. The incoming president has threatened to levy a tariff of up to 60% on all Chinese goods, and 10-20% on imports from the rest of the world. How the policy will be rolled out is highly unpredictable. But Trump watchers believe he is likely to try to use the threat of tariffs to exact concessions from big trading partners \u2013 whether through pledges to buy more from the US, or even wider policy changes, such as a commitment to spending more on defence. He could also urge other countries to join the US in targeting China. How could the UK respond? The government will have to decide whether to try to strike a deal with the US unilaterally, or line up alongside the EU, which could choose to retaliate with its own tit-for-tat tariffs. The former Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane suggested earlier this week that the UK should chart a middle course, seeking to improve the agreement with the EU, but also opening trade talks with the US under Trump. That chimes with Bailey\u2019s suggestion that it is a \u201cBritish characteristic\u201d to be an \u201cold-fashioned free trader\u201d. However, previous efforts to negotiate with the US have foundered, given queasiness in the UK about accepting imports of agriculture products, such as chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-fed beef, and allowing US corporations greater access to the public sector. Springford suggested the scope of any potential agreement was likely to be limited, particularly given that opening the door to more US agricultural products, for example, would complicate talks with the EU over veterinary standards. \u201cIt\u2019s more likely to be a kind of negotiation about what market access will we give to US interests, in exchange for Trump\u2019s tariffs being taken away,\u201d he said."

            "content": "The \u201cglacial\u201d growth in the number of women coaches at the elite level has forced Australian Olympic sports to up their game in order to meet community expectations and avoid the federal government adopting the \u201cstick\u201d of funding cuts. Fewer than one in five coaches at the Paris Games were women, or 18.6%, up barely three percentage points from Tokyo, and from 9% in Rio in 2016. Some sports recorded lower figures, including elite athletics at 12% and golf at 6%. Australian Sports Commission chair Kate Jenkins said women had achieved broad success in sports administration and as athletes, but that she was impatient to see more progress among high-performance coaches. \u201cThe bad news is, while we\u2019ve now got these sports governance boards that are going to have 50% women, we\u2019ve got women in lots of senior roles, we\u2019ve got women now able to play most sports, coaching has really been pretty glacial in the change,\u201d Jenkins said. More than a hundred Australian coaches and administrators were part of a biennial workshop in Melbourne on Tuesday, including 33 chief executives and board members. It was the first meeting since September\u2019s announcement that the government would require gender balance on the boards of sporting entities. \u201cWe need to do things differently and we can, and we need leaders to back that in, and we need you not to just think it\u2019s someone else\u2019s job,\u201d Jenkins said. Targets were discussed but not agreed upon by officials in the largely taxpayer-supported sector, whose boards will need to have 50% women by July 2027 in order to continue to receive government funding. Jenkins said there had been strong buy-in from sporting decision-makers for increasing the share of women coaches, and there was optimism progress could be made without mandating targets. \u201cThe carrot is, you\u2019ll get better results, you\u2019ll have a better organisation, there\u2019s a lot of rewards for doing this well and improving your coaching, you\u2019ll access better talent,\u201d she said. \u201cThe stick, ultimately, for the board [gender balance policy], is you will lose funding, and the Sports Commission does fund a lot of sports for a lot of their operations and we might consider that in the future.\u201d Nicole Hannan, who represented Australia in beach volleyball at Athens in 2004, has only recently returned to the high-performance environment as a coach after 12 years away from the sport. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in a great space when I finished playing and I went off and did completely different things, and it wasn\u2019t until my daughter had seen her friends play volleyball when she was about 11 and said, \u2018oh, can you teach me how to play volleyball?\u2019\u201d Hannan is now assistant coach of Australia\u2019s women\u2019s indoor volleyball team and believes sports needed to be better at checking whether past players want to stay involved. \u201cMaybe the sports need to ask, are you interested, who would like to be interested, how can we pull you back into the sport, and once you\u2019re back in here, how can we support you.\u201d Former Diamonds netballer Caitlin Thwaites has recently started a family and said she was fortunate in finding work with the Victorian Institute of Sport that has given her a degree of flexibility, including job sharing with another young mother. \u201cIt\u2019s being open to have that flexibility of what might the coaching role look like at the moment, or how do we keep these people engaged,\u201d Thwaites said."

            "date": "2024-11-11T00:01:33Z",
            "content": "Expectations that UK interest rates may stay higher for longer, as well as revenue-raising measures in the budget, have prompted a leading estate agent to cut its forecast for house price growth over the longer term. The revised forecast from Hamptons came days after Halifax and Nationwide banks said the annual rate of property price growth had slowed, with the former saying it was likely to be \u201cmodest \u2026 for the rest of this year and into next\u201d. The new analysis of the market is one of the first to emerge after the Bank of England\u2019s quarter-point cut in interest rates to 4.75% last Thursday. The central bank\u2019s warning that last month\u2019s budget would push up inflation has fuelled expectations that interest rates will now take longer to come down. However, while Hamptons said \u201chigher [interest] rates for longer will weigh on long-term growth,\u201d it is forecasting that the typical value of a home in Great Britain will end this year up 3.5% on where it was at the end of 2023, and is predicting a 3% rise in prices for 2025. The firm said the property market had outperformed its original prediction that prices would stay flat this year. This \u201crebound\u201d was attributed to a faster-than-anticipated fall in mortgage costs as inflation fell more quickly than expected. However, it has downgraded its forecast for 2026 from 5% to 3.5%, which it said \u201creflects the dampening effect of higher interest rates alongside a fairly lacklustre and higher tax economy, which, while set to improve, remains weak on a historical basis\u201d. Beyond that, Hamptons said that \u201cthe new era of interest rates, likely to remain above 3%,\u201d was expected to temper house price growth. \u201cThe combined effect of persistently higher interest rates and sluggish economic growth is likely to dampen long-term house price performance compared to previous cycles,\u201d said Aneisha Beveridge, the head of research at the estate agent. Earlier this month, Nationwide said annual house prices grew at a rate of 2.4% in October \u2013 a slowdown from the near two-year high of 3.2% recorded in September. Last Thursday, Halifax said that while the average price of a UK home hit a \u201crecord high\u201d of \u00a3293,999 in October, the annual rate of growth had slowed to 3.9%, and the fallout from the budget \u201ccould keep mortgage costs higher for longer\u201d. Some experts predict that the chancellor\u2019s decision not to extend temporary stamp duty thresholds put in place by the previous government will spark a rush in property sales early next year. At the moment, buyers of homes worth less than \u00a3250,000 in England and Northern Ireland do not pay stamp duty (there are separate rules in Scotland and Wales) \u2013 a figure that was doubled from \u00a3125,000 in September 2022. The threshold is \u00a3425,000 for those buying their first home \u2013 up from \u00a3300,000. But these higher thresholds will end on 31 March 2025 and are set to revert to previous levels. Nationwide is predicting \u201ca jump\u201d in house sales in the first three months of 2025, followed by a \u201cperiod of weakness\u201d during the next three to six months."

            "title": "Silver lining? Why an Australian startup is betting on a copper solar boom",
            "date": "2024-11-02T23:00:28Z",
            "content": "If an Australian startup gets its way, the silver lining in the global solar boom will become a copper one \u2013 before reserves of the material run out. SunDrive Solar, backed by investors including Malcolm Turnbull and the billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, is hoping its copper-based solar cell can reach commercial scale through a partnership with Trina Solar, one of the world\u2019s biggest panel producers. Consuming about one-seventh of silver output yearly, solar photovoltaic (PV) panels could account for as much as 98% of world silver reserves on present trends and technology by 2050, University of New South Wales researchers argue. SunDrive is hoping its copper-based solar cells will catapult from the pilot to the market stage in Australia and beyond through a planned joint venture with Trina. It\u2019s applied for funding from the first round of the Albanese government\u2019s $1bn Solar Sunshot program to build 1 gigawatts of solar modules a year at a western Sydney site. \u201cCopper is 1,000 times more abundant and 100 times cheaper per kilo than silver,\u201d Natalie Malligan, SunDrive\u2019s chief executive, says. \u201cIt also has performance benefits so you can generate more electricity per cell. \u201cWe\u2019ll start to substitute in SunDrive\u2019s copper technology as our tools reach commercial scale,\u201d Malligan says. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads SunDrive will hold a majority of the joint venture with Trina, with investment for the first stage of module produce in the \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars, she says. Australia\u2019s PV market is about 6GW of capacity a year \u2013 but it could expand as prices for modules continue to fall. Global solar panel capacity is close to 1,000GW yearly \u2013 the vast bulk of it in China \u2013 outstripping demand of less than 600GW. \u201cWe\u2019re in a huge oversupply condition at the moment [but] it will settle because the market doubles every three years,\u201d Renate Egan, the head of the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics based at UNSW, says. In a decade, \u201cwe\u2019re expecting it to be 10 or 20GW a year\u201d in Australia alone. Trina, which boasts capacity to build more than 120GW of solar panels alone, has been developing plants from the United Arab Emirates to Vietnam and the US, and is keen to develop a production foothold in Australia too. Edison Zhou, the head of Trina in Australia, says module production with SunDrive could start as soon as 2026 \u201cif everything goes well and we get the funding\u201d from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. Arena is managing the Sunshot program. \u201cWe see Australia as a valuable market,\u201d Zhou says, adding his company wants to bring the whole supply chain \u2013 from silicon processing to wafer, cell and module \u2013 to the country. If the adoption of SunDrive\u2019s copper-based cell technology proves successful, including with their higher generation efficiency, Trina may consider using it in other plants, he says. Malligan says SunDrive has collaborated with Trina on its technology since 2019, adding the Chinese firm is \u201cexcited about its potential global application\u201d. Australia\u2019s relatively high labour costs might not be a major hurdle since most of the process is automated, Zhou says. The initial factory would employ between 300 and 400 people. SunDrive Trina and AGL Energy are also considering developing a second production site in the Hunter Valley to develop \u201cupstream\u201d panel components, such as solar cells. The Hunter operation could also enable exports, Malligan says. As with the module plan, support from Sunshot capital investment and also subsidies for initial production would be critical, the companies say. Egan says the \u201cbest value for money for the government\u201d would be for Australian firms to learn from their much bigger Chinese partners, given their dominance of the sector. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly impossible to innovate your way in[to the industry] at this point,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can build a line, you can get it going, and you can start to understand the industry and the processes and skill-up,\u201d Egan says."

            "date": "2024-11-13T02:59:19Z",
            "content": "Diversity of local news may be at risk if a rightwing startup, ADH TV, is given the green light to purchase Southern Cross Austereo\u2019s regional television network, an expert has warned. Southern Cross Austereo (SCA) has confirmed it has received an offer from the fringe streaming news channel to buy its 93 regional free-to-air TV stations. The digital broadcaster, which is chaired by the former ABC chair Maurice Newman, was launched in December 2021 with the former 2GB broadcaster Alan Jones at the helm. \u201cSCA continues to actively progress with the sale of its regional television assets and is in active negotiations with several parties with an interest in acquiring those assets,\u201d an SCA spokesperson told Guardian Australia. Jones has been off air since the Sydney Morning Herald reported in December that he was the subject of allegations of indecent assault, which he has denied. The Australian Digital Holdings co-founder Jack Bulfin confirmed \u201ca robust and compelling offer\u201d had been made, but said he had yet to receive a response. \u201cRevenue is still strong for free-to-air regional television, despite the pressures of the times, and with improved cost-controls and investment in key markets, the group sees a good future for the licences and improved TV services for the regions,\u201d Bulfin said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email SCA claims to reach 2.7 million people a week, including viewers in regional Queensland, southern New South Wales, regional Victoria, Broken Hill and Spencer Gulf in South Australia. SCA\u2019s contract with Sky News Regional means conservative views are already available on free-to-air in 17 of the regional markets across Victoria, southern NSW and Queensland. Sky News Regional claims to reach an average of 1.1 million viewers monthly. Matthew Ricketson, a professor of communication at Deakin University, said independent local journalism must be free of political and commercial interests. \u201cWe already know that the provision of locally gathered and reported news and current affairs in regional and rural Australia is stretched almost to breaking point,\u201d Ricketson said. \u201cIf what gets added in there now is slanted heavily to one side of politics or another, does that serve rural and regional audiences in being provided with good quality public interest journalism?\u201d Any new owner would have to abide by broadcasting regulation which governs free-to-air television licences. It requires factual material in TV news and current affairs programming to be accurate; and for news to be distinguished from commentary, analysis or opinion. The chief executive officer of the Public Interest Journalism Initiative (PIJI), Anna Draffin, also said there was an urgent need generally to ensure that regional communities have access to meaningful, locally focused public interest journalism instead of generic, one-size-fits-all news. \u201cAustralia\u2019s news market is facing a critical downturn, especially in regional areas,\u201d Draffin said. \u201cOver the past five years, there have been around 600 market changes, with 180 news outlets closing \u2013 nearly double the closure rate of the previous decade. \u201cPIJI data shows that around 60% of these changes have taken place in regional and remote Australia, a disproportionately high figure given their smaller populations compared to metropolitan areas. \u201cOf Australia\u2019s local government areas with at least one news producer, more than a quarter have fewer outlets now than at the beginning of 2019, the data shows. This paints a troubling picture.\u201d The president of the Journalism Education and Research Association of Australia, Alexandra Wake, said regional and rural areas need a diversity of news. \u201cAny further cutbacks to regional news services will be absolutely devastating,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ABC can\u2019t do it all. We need diversity of views.\u201d The Australian Financial Review reported the offer was expected to be about $15m. The Southern Cross Media Group, which also owns the Triple M and Hit radio network brands, including 99 stations across FM, AM and DAB+ digital radio, will hold its annual general meeting on 25 November. Jones and Newman were approached for comment."

            "content": "I read your editorial on the proposed reforms to the Mental Health Act with interest (6 November). The act serves as the balancing point between the state\u2019s negative duty not to interfere with individual liberty without good reason and its positive duties to prevent harm to vulnerable people and the wider public. The criteria for detention represent the threshold at which both of those duties are triggered: detention under the MHA is also a gateway to rights to proactive care and support both during and after detention. We may argue about whether the existing criteria for detention strike the right balance between the state\u2019s positive and negative duties, but it is at least the same balance for everyone. The draft bill sets a much higher threshold for detention unless a person has committed a crime, and while this will lead to fewer people suffering the trauma and indignity of being detained, it will also mean fewer people receiving the positive support and protection of the state \u2013 that is unless they commit a crime. Even leaving aside the unexplored equalities implications of such a perverse incentive, it can surely be neither less restrictive of the individual nor more caring of the state to force people into the criminal justice system in order to receive the help they need. Michael Chalmers Associate director of mental health law, North London NHS foundation trust \u2022 As a social worker, I couldn\u2019t agree more that the outcome of the proposed reforms to the Mental Health Act will depend on resources. I am employed by an NHS trust to work with people for three years after they experience a first episode of psychosis. If staff in my trust did everything that we are already supposed to, it would be a fantastic place to receive care. We cannot. There are not enough beds, caseloads are too high, staff retention is too low, advertised posts often remain unoccupied and well-meaning but misguided attempts at system reform create administrative burdens without improving the quality of care. Small pockets of the system receive higher levels of funding. These teams tend to deliver better quality care as a result. The staff are not more skilled, they simply have been given adequate resources. There is no point banning the use of police cells as a place of safety unless additional assessment suites are provided in hospital settings to meet that need. Staff who are rushed off their feet cannot build the kind of relationships with patients that make family involvement or collaborative care planning meaningful. It is one thing to legislate for higher standards, another to secure the resources to meet those standards. Richard Braham Ilminster, Somerset \u2022 Your editorial is full of the hope and values that we need to offer positive and effective mental health services to people with serious mental illness, as are the amendments in the bill. So it pains me to call out the naivety of these changes being sought at a time when services are so deteriorated that it takes the horror of the Nottingham attacks to begin the process (NHS England\u2019s review of assertive outreach provision 2024) of recognising the vast hole. If we are to move towards a more humane Mental Health Act, we first need to provide full community provision for the people whose lives are lived in and out of psychiatric wards. Dr William Hall NHS consultant psychiatrist in rehabilitation, Bristol \u2022 As a parent of adults with severe mental illness, I would like to see easier access to treatment and care. Already, most people with severe illness are left to live, at best, impoverished lives in the \u201ccommunity\u201d. I don\u2019t recognise the narrative of people\u2019s rights being removed by hospital admissions. Already, people\u2019s rights are removed by not having access to good, timely treatment and care, under section if necessary. If the threshold for admission rises even further, I can only see this leading to more misery, deaths and criminalisation. Name and address supplied \u2022 The National Autistic Society has campaigned on this for many years now. The Tories pledged to reduce the number of autistic people in mental health wards back in 2015 when they made up 38% of patients. The latest figure is 68% of patients. This is shocking and needs to change. Placing people with autism on such wards is so harmful, due to patients being prescribed medications and being subjected to restraint. As an autistic adult, it is frightening to think I could be sectioned for a lack of understanding about my behaviour \u2013 especially during a meltdown, when I lose control.

            "content": "Re university fees, the numbers don\u2019t add up, and never did (Editorial, 4 November). Assumptions by George Osborne and colleagues of high graduate earnings, based on times when far fewer people went to university, were unrealistic. The current \u201csolution\u201d is no better. If fees have not changed since 2017 and inflation since 2017 is 29% then tuition fees rising by several hundred pounds next year still leaves universities with massive cuts in funding. There are few (if any) angles from which it makes sense. Graduates who work as key workers, eg nurses, are unlikely to earn enough to pay off their loans. If fees are to be thought of as a graduate tax, why would a just society ask those doing a service to society (such as nurses) to pay more tax? And, if it\u2019s a graduate tax, why are we not taxing all graduates, rather than only taxing young people \u2013 those who went to university after New Labour introduced fees? Solutions might include increasing income tax on the highest earners (and closing more tax loopholes), noting that the top rate of income tax used to be much higher than it is today (more than 80%, before the Thatcher government). Is this penalising hard-working people? Possibly, but nurses and others work hard, too. Those with the broadest shoulders should carry the bigger load. Helen Gourlay Wymondham, Norfolk \u2022 While those of a certain generation can afford to sound off about adding a few hundred pounds here and \u201crenaming graduate contributions\u201d there, the elephant in the room is that education is a right, not a privilege. Charging a fee \u2013 no matter how nominal \u2013 feeds into an individualised and commodified perception of a good that ultimately benefits society as a whole. Turning students into consumers has also warped the economic model of universities and university towns so that rent-seeking becomes a cornerstone of how these places are managed (or mismanaged). This fee rise should also bring the spotlight back on to the gaping and unjust divergence between what domestic and foreign students pay. Ultimately, due attention needs to be paid to tertiary education as part of the current Department for Education review \u2013 including demands such as the abolition of fees, reintroduction of grants and the end of the universities\u2019 quasi-monopoly on post-18 learning.

            "content": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Russia\u2019s war against his country will \u201cend sooner\u201d than it otherwise would have once Donald Trump becomes US president next year. In a radio interview aired on Saturday, the Ukrainian president conceded that the battlefield situation in eastern Ukraine was difficult and Russia was making advances. He said his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, was not interested in agreeing to a peace deal. Zelenskyy said US legislation prevented him from meeting Trump before his inauguration next January. The Ukrainian leader said he would only talk with Trump rather than an emissary or adviser. \u201cI, as the president of Ukraine, will only take seriously a conversation with the president of the United States of America, with all due respect to any entourage, to any people. \u201cFrom our side, we must do everything so that this war ends next year, ends through diplomatic means,\u201d Zelenskyy said. Zelenskyy said on Friday that he had a \u201cconstructive exchange\u201d with Trump during their phone conversation after his victory in the US presidential election. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything that goes against our position,\u201d he added. Speaking at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Friday, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to work very hard on Russia and Ukraine. It\u2019s got to stop.\u201d In other developments: Zelenskyy criticised a phone call between the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and Putin, saying it opened a \u201cPandora\u2019s box\u201d by undermining efforts to isolate the Russian leader. \u201cNow there may be other conversations, other calls. Just a lot of words,\u201d Zelenskyy said in his evening address on Friday. \u201cAnd this is exactly what Putin has long wanted: it is extremely important for him to weaken his isolation and to conduct ordinary negotiations.\u201d According to Reuters, Zelenskyy and other European officials had cautioned Scholz against the move. Scholz said Donald Trump privately held \u201ca more nuanced position than is often assumed\u201d on Ukraine. Trump\u2019s re-election in last week\u2019s US presidential vote has raised concerns he could withdraw Washington\u2019s significant support for Ukraine once back in the White House. Scholz, who spoke to Trump by phone on Sunday, told the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on Friday his call with the president-elect was \u201cperhaps surprisingly, a very detailed and good conversation\u201d. Asked by the paper whether Trump would make a deal over the head of the Ukrainians, Scholz said Trump gave \u201cno indication\u201d that he would. Germany, for its part, would not accept a \u201cpeace by diktat\u201d, Scholz said. Scholz urged Putin to pull Russian forces out of Ukraine and begin talks with Kyiv that would open the way for a \u201cjust and lasting peace\u201d, in the first phone conversation between the two leaders in nearly two years. The Kremlin said the conversation on Friday had come at Berlin\u2019s request, and that Putin had told Scholz any agreement to end the war in Ukraine must take Russian security interests into account and reflect \u201cnew territorial realities\u201d. A German government spokesperson said Scholz \u201cstressed Germany\u2019s unbroken determination to back Ukraine in its defence against Russian aggression for as long as necessary\u201d. Russian air defence units intercepted a series of Ukrainian drones in several Russian regions, officials said, many of them in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops launched a major incursion in August. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said air defences downed 15 drones in Kursk region on the Ukrainian border. It said units downed one drone each in Bryansk region, also on the border, and in Lipetsk region, farther north. The ministry said one drone was downed in central Oryol region. And the governor of Belgorod region, a frequent target on the Ukrainian border, said a series of attacks had smashed windows in a block of flats and caused other damage, but no casualties were reported. Russia will suspend gas deliveries to Austria via Ukraine on Saturday. Russia\u2019s gas export route to Europe via Ukraine is set to shut at the end of this year. Ukraine has said it will not extend the transit agreement with Russian state-owned Gazprom, in order to deprive Russia of profits that Kyiv says help to finance the war against it. The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said Gazprom\u2019s notice of ending supplies was long expected and Austria has made preparations, but the Ukrainian foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Russia\u2019s action showed it \u201conce again uses energy as a weapon\u201d. Russia\u2019s leading tanker group, Sovcomflot, said on Friday that western sanctions on Russian oil tankers were limiting its financial performance, as it reported falling revenues and core earnings. The US imposed sanctions on Sovcomflot in February, part of Washington\u2019s efforts to reduce Russia\u2019s revenues from oil sales that it can use to finance its war in Ukraine. Sovcomflot reported a 22.2% year-on-year drop in nine-month revenue to $1.22bn and said its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation slumped by 31.5% to $861m."

            "content": "Summit leaders hold joint press briefing: Bush and Gorbachev seek rapid arms-cuts progress By Hella Pick in Valletta 4 December 1989 The decision to stage a joint press conference at the end of the turbulent seawater summit was one more programme change forced on the two leaders yesterday by Malta\u2019s stormy weather. President George Bush had planned to have his press conference on the USS Belknap, and President Mikhail Gorbachev to have his on the Soviet liner, Maxim Gorky. But as it turned out, their improvised joint meeting with the press only served to underline the sincerity of their determination to cooperate closely and constructively in the exciting era they both see ahead. The press conference also illustrated the good humour, and the effort to reach out to each other, that had marked their talks. Both stressed the importance of US-Soviet cooperation in bilateral relations and in the context of \u2018the epoch-making changes\u2019 in Europe and many other parts of the world. Mr Bush said \u2018the stage has now been set for progress over a broad set of issues\u2019, adding later that he \u2018could not have hoped for a better non-summit summit\u2019. President Gorbachev, for his part, stressed the frankness and the good personal relationship he had achieved with Mr Bush. He was emphatic that \u2018political means\u2019, and not force, should be used to solve world problems. \u2018The leaders of our two countries cannot act as fire brigades,\u2019 he added. Both leaders spoke of their commitment to an east-west conventional arms agreement next year. Mr Gorbachev also stressed the importance of the CSCE process on cooperation and security in Europe. He called for Nato and the Warsaw Pact to be transformed to meet the challenge of the new times. They \u2018should not remain military alliances, but rather military-political alliances, and later on just political alliances\u2019. In reply to a question about the demise of the Brezhnev doctrine, Mr Gorbachev emphatically welcomed the transformation now under way in eastern Europe. It was making these countries \u2018more democratic and humane\u2019. In a reference to the EC, he added: \u2018I also see profound changes in West European countries, where integration is taking place while preserving at the same time the national identity of one\u2019s own people. This is very important for us to understand.\u2019 Both leaders were guarded on the question of German reunification. Mr Bush said: \u2018I don\u2019t think it is a role of the United States to dictate the rapidity of change in any country. It is a matter for the people to determine themselves.\u2019 The Soviet leader said: \u2018The reality is that we have today\u2019s Europe with two German states \u2026 This was the decision of history. This is an edited extract. Editorial: Two men in the same boat 4 December 1989 The symbolism was ironic and inescapable. The leaders of the two old superpowers had rival warships on Mediterranean station so that, as rulers of the world, they might commute between the two. But there was an almighty wind and a lashing sea. Hours of chat were slashed from the schedule. And, in the end, they wound up together on a slightly tatty cruise liner anchored out of the gale, holding \u2013 through force of circumstance \u2013 a joint press conference. Brisk conclusions. The elements are the only superpower. The impetus for progress was there, preordained, without the circumscribed chat. And George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev \u2013 the crucial thing about the Maltese summit \u2013 are now two politicians stuck in the same boat, sinking and swimming together. That committed relationship is more important than any number of zizzy initiatives: 97 per cent cuts in this or that category of weaponry, the familiar stuff of modern summitry. It means that Mr James Baker, the American secretary of state, is now the man most in charge of what happens next. It means that George Bush, after months of thumb-sucking, has made his fundamental choice. He has signed up for the ride. He even thinks his good mate Mikhail is being lied to something rotten by those Commy Nicaraguans over arms supplies to El Salvador. Nothing is the fault of the Soviet Union any longer. They are the good guys, so helpful in the Middle East and beyond. Next year\u2019s formal summit can deliver a dramatic range of agreements that will knock the socks off the Democratic Party just before the midterm elections. Jim Baker, a political wizard, has done the calculations. Doing business with Gorbachev is great electoral business. It is thus vital that Mikhail remains around to do business with. The Soviet president, to be sure, stands surrounded by weakness. He cannot control what is left of his empire. Good night, over night, Egon Krenz. Farewell Jakes. He cannot control his own patch: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Lithuania, Latvia, Moldavia. He cannot find any way to make his economy deliver the goods. He has precious few cards to play because he sinks, week by week, ever deeper into an intractable quagmire of problems. But anything that George can now do to help, George will deliver. President Bush has signed up for the trip. What Bush and Gorbachev proclaimed yesterday wasn\u2019t merely, for the umpteenth time, the end of the cold war. It was the beginning of a warm and self-serving relationship. And, because it signalled such a change, not merely from chilly distrust but also from the pretence that the US and the USSR can order the world to behave in certain ways, it was more significant than any detailed communique. More significant and possibly, for countries like Britain, more distressing. Here is where one summit touches another: this weekend Malta, next weekend Strasbourg. Gorbachev and Bush, together in a Maltese harbour, did not decide the future shape of the European world. They decided, perforce, to create a forum in which the big and middling and little nations of Europe must begin to do that for themselves (with, fascinatingly, Moscow now included beneath the rafters of what Washington might deem a common European home). Under that roof, within a matter of months, the last traces of the cold war will vanish as sweeping arms cuts render conventional assumptions of conflict a practical impossibility to add to today\u2019s common sense and emotional impossibility. At which point, we Europeans have to decide. None of this means that, in a trice, all the GIs and hardware will be gone. But hundreds of thousands and billions of tons will go home. None of this means that the Warsaw Pact will cease to exist. But the resident, despised armies in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany will gradually return to barracks and then to civilian life. That will be a time of danger and stress: self-evident to all those who remember the bloody trivia of nationalist ferment which riddled the old, raddled Europe. It will also be a time of vital opportunity to show that we can manage now without the discarded crutches of special relationships, the illusion of power in the reflected glory of American amity. In Malta, Mr Bush and Mr Gorbachev proclaimed that they are themselves a special relationship. President Bush has staked his prestige on it; to the limits of congressional approval, he is cast as the historic peace-maker, offering his new friend enough international momentum to keep the domestic wolves at bay. President Gorbachev, from a far feebler position, no longer feels the need to offer minty notions to woo the Europeans in order to goad Bush into action, because Bush and Baker have made up their minds. That is pell-mell progress, for all the talk of measured consideration and studied calm. It is an apt backcloth for the pell-mell unfolding of events on the east European ground. But we, who watch and wonder from the sidelines, should have no illusions. The process itself is ultimately unpredictable. It poses questions about the future governance, and integrity, of the Soviet Union that can only be guessed at. And, in a far shorter run, it poses questions of the Europeans themselves that they have only hesitantly begun to formulate. A couple of weeks ago in Paris, the leaders of western Europe asked history to slow down a bit. It isn\u2019t. It is speeding up. Two weeks ago, Czechoslovakia was a Communist dictatorship; and Egon Krenz ruled East Germany. Next weekend, along the practical economic lines ground out over years, those leaders will be asked to find common cause in a process of integration that provides one platform of assured relationships from which to proclaim a European view of what Europe should become. If \u2013 after Malta \u2013 that imperative is forgotten amid petty nationalist trumpetings, we may all begin to despair of our ability to chart our own future. This is an edited extract.

Europe Tomorrow: The climb to the sunlit uplands \u2013 planning for a new Europe By Martin Woollacott 4 December 1989 This week, after the Gorbachev-Bush summit, in the wake of the most momentous events since the second world war, European Community leaders meet in Strasbourg to shape a single European market for the 90s. But they must also begin planning for a new Europe in the 21st century, with a Community that might include more than a score of nations and many associated countries as far east as Azerbaijan. Today, in a momentous period of 20th century history, the Guardian publishes a four-page analysis of the new Europe. Martin Woollacott sets the scene. Read the article. US urges faster EC integration: Thatcher is isolated at Bush\u2019s Nato summit By John Palmer and Martin Walker 5 December 1989 BRUSSELS President Bush yesterday threw the full weight of the United States behind faster economic and political integration in the European Community \u2013 in clear defiance of Mrs Thatcher\u2019s known objections. The president\u2019s unambiguous support for faster European integration \u2013 made at the special Nato summit here yesterday \u2013 comes on the eve of the Strasbourg European summit, where the prime minister is already isolated over plans for economic and monetary union. Speaking to a press conference after the Nato summit, President Bush said: \u201cI appreciate the vital role of the Twelve in the new Europe, and it is my belief that the events of our times call both for continued and even intensified efforts by the Twelve to integrate, and that there is a role for Europe as a magnet to draw the forces of reform towards eastern Europe.\u201d Afterwards, senior US officials said the president\u2019s remarks were a clear signal that the US stood behind those in the EC pushing for faster progress towards a more united Europe. Chancellor Kohl was left in no doubt that faster European integration was the only context in which the superpowers and their allies would tolerate total German reunification. Accepting this, the chancellor agreed to the new Nato formula that \u201cGerman self-determination should be a peaceful, step-by-step process, linked firmly to European integration and the Nato Alliance.\u201d For her part Mrs Thatcher was obviously stung by the unexpected force of President Bush\u2019s backing for European integration, which was received with delight by the other European Community leaders. Speaking after the end of the Nato meeting, Mrs Thatcher pointedly said that the president\u2019s remarks had been carefully prepared and would \u201crequire study in depth\u201d before she replied. \u201cThere were some things I would have no trouble in replying to, but other parts will require reflection,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not that we are opposed to European integration, but it is a question of the kind of Europe we will want in the future.\u201d This is an edited extract. US outlines vision for new Europe By Anna Tomforde and John Palmer 13 December 1989. BONN The US yesterday linked support for East Germany\u2019s new leaders with a new vision for a changing Europe in which Nato would adopt a more political role and Washington\u2019s ties with the European Community would be enhanced. After outlining Washington\u2019s response to the recent changes in eastern Europe, the secretary of state, Mr James Baker, made an unscheduled visit to East Germany where he held talks with the new prime minister, Mr Hans Modrow. It was the first time that a US secretary of state held official talks with East German leaders on their own territory, underlining Washington fears that a collapse of the East German reform process could imperil developments throughout eastern Europe. In what he called \u201ca new architecture for a new era\u201d, Mr Baker outlined closer cooperation between western Europe and the US which would bind the west closer together while at the same time \u201copening up the doors to the east.\u201d Washington, he said, stood by its commitment to overcome the division of Europe, Germany and Berlin, but this had to come about in a gradual process which satisfied German aspirations and met the \u201clegitimate interests\u201d of all concerned. Mr Baker declared his support for the EC \u201ctaking on increasingly important political roles\u201d. His remarks \u2013 to the Berlin press club \u2013 were received gleefully by senior EC officials in Strasbourg as evidence of US support for their view about how the community should evolve in the new European situation. His views appear to contradict Mrs Thatcher\u2019s statement to the House of Commons that US policy towards European integration had not changed under President Bush. In Potsdam \u2013 where the Prussian kings had their summer seat and where the wartime allies in 1945 decided the future of defeated Nazi Germany \u2013 Mr Baker assured Mr Modrow of US support for East German reforms. Overlaps between Nato and European institutions would inevitably grow, Mr Baker said. Nato should be transformed into a political body capable of building a new security structure for Europe. \u201cIn our view there is no conflict between the process of European integration and an extension of the cooperation between the European Community and its neighbours in east and west.\u201d He described Nato as a forum where western countries would work together to negotiate agreements between east and west and see that they were implemented and verifiable. As Nato\u2019s military role was reduced, the European Security Conference could become the \u201cmost important forum of east-west cooperation.\u201d In a passage likely to upset Mrs Thatcher\u2019s belief in a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between London and Washington, he suggested that the US and the EC \u201cwork together to achieve whether in treaty or some other form, a significantly strengthened set of institutional and consultative links. We suggest that our discussions about this idea proceed in parallel with Europe\u2019s efforts to achieve by 1992 a common internal market so that plans for interaction would evolve with changes in the community,\u201d he said.

            "content": "I read with interest your article based on the recent report by Human Rights Watch (Israel accused of crimes against humanity over forced displacement in Gaza, 14 November). I am surprised that there is any debate. In my personal and non-legal view, crimes are being committed. I have been a war surgeon in Gaza on three occasions. The first two were for the Great March of Return in 2018, when I was operating in Gaza\u2019s Khan Younis. There, I treated dozens of gunshot wounds to the shinbone (tibia) in men who were aged between 18 and 35. As most doctors will tell you, a shattered shinbone assures a lifetime of disability. It appeared that the intention was to disable, not to kill. I was also in Gaza this year and have written about it in my recent book, Gaza Medic: A War Surgeon\u2019s Story 2024. Most of the multitudinous patients I treated were children, women and elderly people. I never once saw fighters or tunnels, but I did see many families ripped apart and children rendered orphans in a blink. I take no political view, am neither Jew nor Arab, have always been driven entirely by patients and have sleepless nights to this day. If I were a politician, I would be hanging my head in shame for not resolving what is so clearly a significant problem. Thank you for highlighting what is, to me, one of the most tragic issues of our time.

            "date": "2024-11-14T16:30:49Z",
            "content": "The culture war has made artists wary of discussing the Israel-Palestine conflict, according to Jeremy Deller, who has donated work to a charity auction to support M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF). Deller is one of more than 260 artists, including Yinka Shonibare, Wolfgang Tillmans, Mark Wallinger, Mona Hatoum, Sir John Akomfrah, Jesse Darling and Dame Sonia Boyce, who have contributed work that will be sold at the exhibition and auction in aid of the medical charity\u2019s work in Palestine. \u201cYou have to be careful, because it is politicised and it shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d Deller said when asked if he thought artists feared repercussions. \u201cIt\u2019s become part of the war \u2026 the culture war and the war itself have run concurrently. I think that\u2019s maybe made some people a bit fearful, wary.\u201d More than 300 works will be for sale in an online auction that runs from 18 November until 1 December. An exhibition of the work will be held at 14 Wharf Road, north London. Rana Begum, one of several Royal Academy alumni who organised the auction, said the event served a double purpose: a way for artists to raise funds and a \u201csafe space\u201d for them to discuss the conflict. \u201cIt just hasn\u2019t been easy for people to talk, to be able to have a dialogue, even to understand, even to learn. People are so afraid of doing or saying anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI think what this auction is doing, and something far beyond raising money, is also giving a space for voices, for diverse voices.\u201d This year the Fossil Free Books campaign successfully pressed several book festivals to sever ties with the investment firm Baillie Gifford because of its investments in fossil fuel companies and companies with links to the Israeli state. Afterwards, some argued that \u201cart should not be political\u201d and that \u201cart should be for art\u2019s sake\u201d. Deller said: \u201c\u2018Art for art\u2019s sake\u2019 is a meaningless term. It\u2019s like saying writing should be for writing\u2019s sake, or film-making for film-making\u2019s sake. It doesn\u2019t work like that. You can\u2019t unless you have an exalted position as an artist where you can just make abstract work and get paid handsomely for it. You know, there are people like that. But on the whole that\u2019s not how it works. I studied art history, it\u2019s never worked like that.\u201d However, Deller said art did not have to be political and that it was a mistake to expect artists to offer solutions. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should look to artists for answers. Artists shouldn\u2019t expect artists to solve the problems of the world, because they tried it. It hasn\u2019t worked,\u201d he said. \u201cOften very rich, powerful people think artists can solve the world\u2019s ills. We can raise money for charities \u2026 Live Aid, basically. That\u2019s the most practical, immediate thing that we can do and that\u2019s what this exhibition and auction is.\u201d Dr Natalie Roberts, the executive director of MSF UK, said the organisation was deeply moved by and grateful for the generosity of the artists who had supported its work. She said: \u201cTheir creativity and commitment are a testament to the power of art to inspire compassion and solidarity. These funds will have a direct impact on our ability to provide immediate life-saving medical care to some of the most marginalised people in society.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2024 because an earlier version referred to the Fossil Free Books campaign related to Baillie Gifford\u2019s \u201cinvestments in fossil fuel companies and Israeli state-owned arms manufacturers\u201d. This has been changed to \u201cinvestments in fossil fuel companies and companies with links to the Israeli state\u201d. Baillie Gifford contacted the Guardian to say that it has no investments in Israeli state owned arms manufacturers."

            "date": "2024-11-26T18:40:47Z",
            "content": "A woman who became a prominent campaigner for military personnel after her husband was killed by a Taliban bomb has been found guilty of assaulting her new partner. Christina Plumb, whose late husband Olaf Schmid was a bomb disposal expert, hit, kicked and bit Adam Plumb at their home in Devon, a judge heard. Alistair Verheijen, prosecuting, told South Devon magistrates court in Newton Abbot that Plumb, 49, drank a large amount of gin when she got into bed and tried to cuddle her husband in September last year. He said Adam Plumb, 41, went to go to another bedroom to sleep but she began kicking him in the back and pulling off the bedcovers. They ended up in a dressing room where the prosecution said the defendant bit her husband\u2019s back and ripped off his T-shirt during an attack lasting up to 20 minutes. Adam Plumb the court: \u201cShe was full of rage, scratching, kicking out at me relentlessly. I put my hands out to stop her but it did not work. I could not get out of the corner. I could not get her off me.\u201d The court was shown photos of what appeared to be a bite to his back and scratch mark to his chest. Christina Plumb claimed her husband bit her on the nose during the incident and that he trapped her fingers in a door, but he denied both accusations and said she sustained no injuries. Under cross-examination by the barrister Francesca Whebell, representing Christina Plumb, her husband denied he was in a new relationship at the time of the incident. He also denied he was annoyed because she had booked an appointment the next day about getting a divorce. Adam Plumb said it was he who wanted a divorce, claiming his wife had abused him over the previous two years and police had been called five times to their home. Asked why he did not walk out of the house and wait for the police, he replied: \u201cShe was behaving like a dog.\u201d PC Alex Lyons-Martin, who went to the scene, said Ms Plumb was \u201cextremely emotional, crying and almost hysterical\u201d. He added: \u201cShe said she was the victim of serious domestic violence by Adam. I did not see any injuries on her as far as I can recall.\u201d Judge Stuart Smith ruled that Adam Plumb\u2019s evidence was compelling and that Christina Plumb had consumed most of a bottle of gin. The judge said she tried to make out she was the victim of domestic violence in a \u201cfailed scheme to get him arrested\u201d. The case was adjourned for a pre-sentence report and Christina Plumb will be sentenced next month. The court heard she had no previous convictions, cautions or warnings. Christina Plumb became a figurehead for bereaved families of service personnel after Olaf Schmid died in Afghanistan in 2009. She campaigned for better pensions for war widows and higher salaries for those in the armed forces, and called on politicians to \u201cfight as hard as Olaf did\u201d for peace."

            "title": "Thousands return to southern Lebanon amid uneasy ceasefire",
            "date": "2024-11-27T22:06:04Z",
            "content": "Thousands of people displaced from war-torn southern Lebanon have begun returning home after a ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah took effect on Wednesday, amid fears on both sides of the border about whether the truce would hold. Israel heavily bombed the capital, Beirut, and the south of the country throughout Tuesday, killing 42 people, until the truce began at 4am local time, while Hezbollah fired rockets into Israel, triggering air raid sirens. On Wednesday, Lebanon\u2019s motorways were thronged with packed vehicles carrying families and their belongings returning south despite warnings from the Israeli military that they should stay away while its forces remained in the area. The Lebanese army asked displaced people to avoid frontline villages and towns near the UN-drawn \u201cblue line\u201d that separates the two countries. Lebanese military convoys were spotted travelling south as the army announced it would deploy to southern Lebanon under the terms of the ceasefire agreement. \u201cThe army has begun to strengthen its deployment in the South Litani sector and extend state authority in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil),\u201d the military said in a statement. \u201cIn this context, the concerned military units are moving from several areas to the South Litani sector, where they will be stationed at the locations designated for them.\u201d In a sign of how volatile the situation remains, Israeli forces opened fire on a number of cars that attempted to enter what it said was a restricted area on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear if there were casualties in the incident. In televised remarks on Tuesday night, Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said that the country would \u201crespond forcefully to any violation\u201d. The Israeli military declared a curfew for southern Lebanon from 5pm on Wednesday until 7am on Thursday, prohibiting people north of the Litani River in Lebanon from travelling south toward the border with Israel. Those in the area must stay put, the Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said on social media. \u201cWe do not want to harm you \u2013 but our forces will not hesitate to engage with any forbidden movements in this zone,\u201d Adraee said. In its first statement since the truce was announced, Hezbollah made no direct mention of the ceasefire and vowed to continue its resistance. The militia said its fighters \u201cremain fully equipped to deal with the aspirations and assaults of the Israeli enemy\u201d. Its forces will monitor Israel\u2019s withdrawal from Lebanon \u201cwith their hands on the trigger\u201d. The US-brokered ceasefire, the most significant development in the effort to calm regional tensions that have rocked the Middle East since the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, has largely been welcomed by the war-weary Lebanese and Israelis. Hezbollah began firing on Israel a day after its ally\u2019s surprise assault, and the sides traded fire for a year before Israel stepped up its air campaign in late September and sent in ground troops. The deal is not linked to a ceasefire in Gaza \u2013 a previous Hezbollah demand. The 60-day staged withdrawal, in which Israel will pull out of southern Lebanon and Hezbollah will move its fighters and heavy weaponry north of the Litani River, about 16 miles (25km) north of the frontier, is designed to broker a permanent end to 14 months of fighting. It will be monitored by a US-led supervisory mechanism that will mediate on infringements. Predictably, Hezbollah and Israel are both seeking to portray themselves as the victorious side as the violence ends. The Lebanese group has suffered its worst losses since the group was formed to fight Israel\u2019s occupation of Lebanon in the 1980s: much of its leadership has been wiped out and its communication networks and security protocols are compromised. It is unclear how much heavy weaponry and military infrastructure has been destroyed, but the group\u2019s inability to cause significant damage with rocket strikes on Israeli cities suggests its military capabilities are severely degraded. Hezbollah, which participates in Lebanon\u2019s political system but is considered a terrorist organisation by many western states, participated in the talks for the truce via mediators but has not formally commented on the ceasefire. To its supporters, however, the group\u2019s survival is a win in itself. Street celebrations where people waved its yellow and green flag and honked car horns were held across southern Beirut on Wednesday, and celebratory gunfire rang out in some neighbourhoods. Iran, Hezbollah\u2019s ally, welcomed the end of Israel\u2019s \u201caggression\u201d in Lebanon on Wednesday morning. In a statement, the foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei stressed Iran\u2019s \u201cfirm support for the Lebanese government, nation and resistance\u201d. In Israel, the ceasefire has met a more mixed reaction. On Tuesday night, Netanyahu said he had endorsed the deal after his cabinet approved it, despite opposition from his far-right allies. The country\u2019s army relies heavily on reservists, units that are tired after more than a year of fighting in Gaza and Lebanon and will welcome the break. But rightwingers and residents of Israel\u2019s north \u2013 where about 60,000 were displaced from their homes at the beginning of the conflict \u2013 have criticised the agreement, which relies on the western-backed Lebanese army and UN peacekeeping troops to ensure Hezbollah does not redeploy to the border buffer zone. Dozens of people gathered outside the Israeli army\u2019s headquarters in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night to protest against the ceasefire, blocking traffic on a motorway. It is unclear how many displaced Israelis are now planning to go home. Gabby Neeman, the mayor of the northern town of Shlomi, told Israel\u2019s army radio station that no residents were planning to return, and that he believed that the fighting would restart eventually. \u201cEverything we were shown testifies to the fact that the next round is ahead of us, whether in a month, two months or 10 years,\u201d he said. The Lebanon deal will not have any direct impact on the fighting in Gaza, where US efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have repeatedly failed. Overnight on Wednesday, Israeli strikes on two schools turned shelters in Gaza City killed 11 people, including four children, according to hospital officials. Israel said one of the strikes targeted a Hamas sniper and the other targeted militants hiding among civilians. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, announced earlier this month it was quitting its role until both parties showed \u201cwillingness and seriousness\u201d in the talks. Announcing the Lebanon ceasefire on Tuesday night, the US president, Joe Biden, said his administration would now push to renew ceasefire talks in Gaza, but the delinking of the two fronts is likely to strengthen Israel\u2019s hand in the Palestinian territory."

            "date": "2024-11-26T07:37:36Z",
            "content": "Israel\u2019s security cabinet is due to meet on Tuesday to decide on a ceasefire agreement with Lebanon after more than a year of fighting between Israeli forces and the Shia militia Hezbollah. Under the deal being considered, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would reportedly withdraw entirely from southern Lebanon, Hezbollah would pull its heavy weapons north of the Litani River, about 16 miles (25km) north of the Israeli border, and the Lebanese army would move in to provide security in the border zone alongside an existing UN peacekeeping force, during an initial 60-day transition phase. The White House national security spokesperson cautioned on Monday that the deal the Biden administration had been trying to broker for months had not yet been finalised. \u201cThere\u2019s still some process, things that I think that they\u2019re working through,\u201d John Kirby said. Calling the discussions so far constructive, he added: \u201cWe believe that the trajectory of this is going in a very positive direction. But nothing is done until everything is done. Nothing\u2019s negotiated till everything is negotiated.\u201d Reuters quoted four senior Lebanese sources as saying they expected Joe Biden and French president Emmanuel Macron to announce the ceasefire imminently. Hezbollah has not been a direct party to the talks, in which the Lebanese government has given assurances that the militia would abide by the terms of the deal. Under the proposed ceasefire blueprint, the US would lead a five-country international monitoring committee that would act as a referee on infringements, and the US is reported to have offered guaranteed support for Israeli military operations over the border in the event that Hezbollah mounts an attack or reconstitutes its forces south of the Litani. The conflict started on 8 October last year, when Hezbollah fired shells and missiles into Israeli border towns in solidarity with Hamas, and the fighting has intensified significantly since the end of September, when Israel launched a ground invasion amid intensified bombing across Lebanon, which has killed about 3,500 Lebanese people as well as much of Hezbollah\u2019s leadership. Israel carried out intensive airstrikes on Monday. The IDF said it had struck 25 command centres in Lebanon associated with Hezbollah\u2019s executive council, the militia\u2019s ruling body, including four targets in Dahiyeh, the largely Shia district of southern Beirut. Before the strikes the IDF sent out warnings on social media telling people to evacuate designated buildings in Dahiyeh, and the southern cities of Nabatieh and Tyre. The UN peacekeeping force Unifil said it was \u201cseriously concerned\u201d by lethal strikes on the Lebanese army, which reported 19 soldiers killed. On Sunday, the IDF expressed regret for a strike on a Lebanese army position, which it said was a mistake, adding that Israeli operations were being \u201cdirected solely against Hezbollah\u201d. Sirens sounded across northern Israel in response to reports of Hezbollah rockets launched from Lebanon heading toward the Israeli border. Hezbollah fired more than 200 rockets into northern Israel on Sunday, one of the heaviest attacks since the start of the current conflict. The government of Benjamin Netanyahu is under domestic political pressure to agree a deal that would allow about 60,000 Israelis from the border region to return home, after spending a year in displacement camps, and their safe return is Israel\u2019s primary war aim in Lebanon. Reacting to news of a possible ceasefire, the mayors of some northern Israeli towns decried it as a \u201csurrender deal\u201d as it would not involve the complete elimination of Hezbollah from the border zone and therefore failed to guarantee the safety of returning residents. Israel\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Mike Herzog, told Israeli army radio that a ceasefire could be reached within days. Herzog said there remained points to finalise but added: \u201cWe are close to a deal.\u201d Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, said on Monday that ceasefire talks were moving forward, but insisted that Israel would retain its capacity to strike southern Lebanon in any agreement. He confirmed that the issue would be discussed by Israel\u2019s security cabinet in the next two days. Lebanon\u2019s deputy parliamentary speaker, Elias Bou Saab, told Reuters there were \u201cno serious obstacles\u201d to starting the implementation of the truce. Reuters also cited an unnamed Lebanese official and western diplomat as telling Lebanese officials that a ceasefire could be announced within hours. The US news site Axios reported that a deal had been nearing completion last week but was delayed by the international criminal court decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant, and in particular France\u2019s apparent indication on Thursday that it would fulfil its obligations as a state signatory to the court\u2019s founding statute. The immediate Israeli response was to oppose French membership of the five-nation monitoring committee envisaged by the ceasefire agreement, despite France\u2019s historic ties and longstanding involvement in Lebanon. Israel reportedly dropped its opposition to French participation in the committee on Monday after Paris clarified its reaction to the court\u2019s warrant, calling the question over whether France would arrest Netanyahu or Gallant if they visited its territory \u201clegally complex\u201d. On Monday the \u00c9lys\u00e9e said ceasefire negotiations had made significant progress and urged both sides to seize the opportunity. The Biden administration has been working on a deal for several months, anxious to contain the spread of the Gaza war and eager to secure a diplomatic win in its last two months in office, before Donald Trump takes over. A US special envoy, Amos Hochstein, was in the region last week, seeking to finalise the agreement. US Middle East envoy Brett McGurk will be in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to discuss using a potential Lebanon ceasefire as a catalyst for a deal ending hostilities in Gaza, the White House said on Monday. The proposed agreement is closely modelled on a ceasefire deal that ended the last major Israeli war with Hezbollah in 2006, which also involved an Israeli and Hezbollah withdrawal from the zone between the Litani River and the border. It was never fully implemented."

            "content": "Good morning. A highly anticipated ceasefire aimed at ending the 14-month-old war between Israel and Hezbollah officially came into effect early this morning, hours after Joe Biden hailed the \u201chistoric\u201d moment. The ceasefire began at 4am in Lebanon after the heaviest day of raids on Beirut, including a series of strikes in the city\u2019s centre, since Israel stepped up its air campaign in Lebanon in late September before sending in ground troops. By 7am in Lebanon there were no immediate reports of alleged violations of the truce. Some celebratory gunshots could be heard in parts of Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. The Israeli army warned soon after the ceasefire began that residents of south Lebanon should not approach Israel Defense Forces positions and villages that its forces had ordered to be evacuated. However, the roads leading from Beirut to south Lebanon were filled with traffic. What does the ceasefire stipulate? The resolution calls for the withdrawal of Hezbollah fighters north of the Litani River \u2013 about 18 miles from the Lebanon-Israel border \u2013 and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon. Trump pick for US health agency proposed \u2018herd immunity\u2019 during Covid Donald Trump announced his selections for a series of positions in his administration last night, including another high-level health official, nominating the Stanford academic and physician Jay Bhattacharya to lead the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Bhattacharya was an outspoken critic of the US government\u2019s Covid policies during the pandemic, and published the Great Barrington Declaration in October 2020 which called for a return to life as normal for those who were less vulnerable to the virus. The declaration \u2013 which came before the availability of Covid-19 vaccines \u2013 promoted \u201cherd immunity\u201d, the idea that when enough people in a population are immune to the virus, it can\u2019t find a new host. Many people suggested this would happen if the virus was simply allowed to spread, rather than be contained through lockdowns. The proposal was embraced by some in the first Trump administration, including Trump himself, who mistakenly referred to it as \u201cherd mentality\u201d. What other views does Bhattacharya hold? He has questioned the safety of vaccines, testified against the effectiveness of face masks, and argued that NIH officials should not be involved with scientific policy.

            "title": "Israelis displaced by war split over prospect of Hezbollah ceasefire",
            "date": "2024-11-25T18:46:38Z",
            "content": "There is a crack, a boom and a siren, all more or less simultaneously. Sergio Helman has not quite reached the concrete shelter a dozen metres away from his hummus restaurant, off highway 99, which marks the northernmost limit of the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona. The 60-year-old shrugs and explains that Hezbollah fires the rockets from so close that Israeli air defence systems can give only 15 seconds warning at best. \u201cBut I always try to get to the shelter \u2026 I\u2019ve got five children to support so I have to stay alive to keep my restaurant open,\u201d he said. Business at Helman\u2019s restaurant has not been good in recent months. The evacuation of most of the population of Kiryat Shmona and the surrounding communities in the days after Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack into southern Israel last year means his usual customers are sometimes a 100km away or more. Neighbouring eateries are closed and the shared car park is strewn with fallen branches. This soon may change. A ceasefire to end the 13-month conflict between Israel and the Lebanese Islamist militant movement Hezbollah now looks possible, even likely. More than 3,750 people, both combatants and civilians, have been killed in Lebanon, health officials say, and about a million are displaced. Forty-four civilians and more than 70 soldiers have been killed in Israel\u2019s north. Following the visit of the US envoy Amos Hochstein to Beirut and Jerusalem last week, Israel\u2019s security cabinet is due to meet on Tuesday to decide on a ceasefire proposal. Many \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the 60,000 Israelis who have been displaced from their homes in the north of the country since Hezbollah rocket fire began on 8 October last year welcome news of an imminent end to the war. Erez Bergman, 51, left the kibbutz of Snir, a kilometre or so from Kiryat Shimona, days after the outbreak of the conflict and spent months in hotels with his wife and three children before ending up in a rented house in the small central Israeli town of Bat Ofer. There are some advantages to his new life: coffee shops, theatre and concerts in nearby Tel Aviv. Even if hundreds of rockets have been fired weekly into central Israel by Hezbollah in recent months, almost all are intercepted and casualties have been light. A former senior artillery officer, Bergman said the IDF\u2019s airstrikes across Lebanon and its extensive ground attack into southern Lebanon had \u201cdone a good job\u201d, so the time had come to end the war. Military officials say the IDF has destroyed much of Hezbollah\u2019s military infrastructure along the border. \u201cHezbollah is here to stay, and they don\u2019t like us \u2026 but we had 17 years of peace after the last war with them [in 2006]. The Middle East being what it is there will be something else of course but if we get another 15 years of calm, that\u2019d be OK. It\u2019d be enough for my kids to grow up,\u201d Bergman said. The road to Snir from Helman\u2019s restaurant runs within two kilometres of the contested border with Lebanon, where a plume of smoke rises from a village to the north. The few cars there are drive fast. There is little sense at the kibbutz that the war is winding down. Artillery is clearly audible, as are the launch of anti-rocket missiles that leave a brown trail through the blue sky. Israeli warplanes roar overhead. Lior Shelef, 48, has been in charge of Snir\u2019s security team since the beginning of the war. His wife and three children now stay in another kibbutz, 30km away. \u201cThere is a very direct link between the people who live on the border here, and those who live on the border in Gaza \u2026 When they were attacked [on 7 October last year] we felt we would be too. We had seen [Hezbollah elite] forces building up and we knew they were watching us,\u201d Shelef said. Now, Shelef said, he would welcome a \u201csolid deal\u201d within three months. \u201cWe are not expecting a promise of eternal peace. I just want a quiet life to raise my kids and I know that the Lebanese people over the fence want the same \u2026 All wars end in diplomatic agreements so this will too,\u201d he said. The proposed deal involves an initial two-month ceasefire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah would end its armed presence between the southern border and the Litani River. Avi Dichter, an Israeli minister and member of the security cabinet, told the Guardian on Sunday: \u201cWhen people get back to the settlements along the border with Lebanon, after reaching the agreement with Hezbollah, they will be able to go back \u2026 knowing that they\u2019re going to live there safe and sound.\u201d But while under pressure to return Israelis to their homes in the north, Netanyahu knows too that much of the public, particularly his own supporters, fear a premature end to hostilities. A recent poll by the Institute for National Security Studies thinktank found that a third of Israelis wanted the offensive expanded \u201cuntil Hezbollah is disarmed\u201d. In Kiryat Shmona itself, views are more hawkish than in the surrounding kibbutzim, reflecting deeper social, political and economic divisions in Israel. Kibbutz residents who live close to the border have a history of opposition to the Netanyahu government, the most rightwing in the history of Israel. They are also more prosperous than many in Kiryat Shmona, a stronghold of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party. Yamit Malul Yanai, a commentator and lawyer from Kiryat Shmona who was interviewed in a rocket shelter during repeated alerts, said: \u201cThere is massive resentment in the town. The two communities have very different views of this war.\u201d She added: \u201cThe residents of Kiryat Shmona don\u2019t want to be a human shield for the rest of the country. We have to have a real deal, a real victory or we won\u2019t go back. I don\u2019t think we are close to the end of this war.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-11T23:13:14Z",
            "content": "Israel\u2019s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said on Monday that \u201ccertain progress\u201d had been made on ceasefire talks in Lebanon, where Israel has been engaged in fighting Hezbollah for more than 13 months. \u201cWe will be ready to be there if we know, first of all, that Hezbollah is not on our border, is north of the Litani River, and that Hezbollah will not be able to arm with new weapons systems,\u201d Saar said. He added that diplomatic efforts were taking place through US mediation, but that the lack of an enforcement mechanism in any future deal remained a stumbling block. Israel\u2019s stated objective in its ground invasion of south Lebanon was to enable the return of residents of north Israel, of whom tens of thousands have been displaced since Hezbollah began firing rockets \u201cin solidarity\u201d with Hamas on 8 October 2023. Israel has said that Hezbollah would need to retreat north of the Litani, 18 miles from its northern border, to ensure the security of north Israel. Diplomatic efforts were not only confined to US channels, as Israel\u2019s army radio reported that Israel\u2019s minister of strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, visited Russia last week to discuss ways to reach a ceasefire in Lebanon. Saar said Russia could play a role in a ceasefire agreement by helping ensure that arms do not flow to Hezbollah via Syria, where Russian troops are present. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, also met a number of Arab leaders, including Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II and the crown prince of Kuwait, at the Arab-Islamic Summit in Riyadh on Monday. Despite the reported progress on a ceasefire deal, Hezbollah has said that it had not seen any actual proposal come across its desk, nor does it expect to anytime soon. Mohammad Afif, the head of Hezbollah\u2019s media office, said at a press conference on Monday: \u201cThere is great movement between Washington and Moscow and Tehran and a number of capitals. \u201cI believe that we are still in the phase of testing the waters and presenting initial ideas and proactive discussions, but so far there is nothing actual yet.\u201d Any ceasefire in Lebanon would have to be approved by Hezbollah, and presumably its patron, Iran. Hezbollah\u2019s secretary general, Naim Qassem, has said the group is ready for a ceasefire with Israel and that it has backed away from its previous demand that a ceasefire in Gaza come before it stops fighting. Despite apparent movement on a ceasefire deal, Israel\u2019s military announced on Sunday that it was expanding its ground assault in southern Lebanon. The head of Israel\u2019s military, Herzi Halevi, approved the expansion of the ground operation in southern Lebanon, which could involve thousands of more permanent and reserve soldiers, Israel\u2019s state broadcaster, Kan, reported. Israel\u2019s defence minister, Israel Katz, said on Sunday that Israel had defeated Hezbollah and that further gains could be made in Lebanon. \u201cNow it is our job to continue to put pressure in order to bring about the fruits of that victory,\u201d Katz said. He added that he hoped Lebanon would join other countries in normalising relations with Israel. Israel said that its ground invasion of southern Lebanon, which it launched on 30 September, would be \u201climited and targeted\u201d and was aimed at dismantling Hezbollah infrastructure in the area. Wide swathes of the border area in southern Lebanon have been flattened since then, with dozens of border villages partly or completely destroyed by Israel. Hezbollah has been reportedly fighting against advancing Israeli troops, with Afif, its media office head, claiming on Monday that Israel has not been able to \u201coccupy one single village\u201d in 45 days of fighting. The extent of Israel\u2019s progress in southern Lebanon is unclear, but Israeli troops and tanks have been photographed as far as two miles inside southern Lebanon. More than 3,190 people have been killed and more than 14,000 wounded by Israel in Lebanon since fighting began a year ago, the vast majority in the last two months."

            "date": "2024-11-13T17:39:50Z",
            "content": "A bill that would have allowed the government to strip tax-exempt status from any non-profit it deemed to be supporting \u201cterrorism\u201d was narrowly blocked in the House of Representatives on Tuesday evening. The bill was widely feared as a tool that Donald Trump could use to punish dissent, and critics argued the measure could have disproportionately targeted groups that criticize Israel and support Palestinian causes \u2013 and that it was designed to do just that. The vote failed with 145 votes against it, falling short of the two-thirds required to circumvent regular House rules. Fifty-two Democrats voted in support of the bill. The bill, called Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act, or HR 9495, joined two measures together \u2013 one allowing the treasury department to withhold tax-exempt status from any non-profit it decides is a \u201cterrorist-supporting organization\u201d and another, less controversial measure, which would offer tax relief to Americans imprisoned unjustly abroad or held by terrorist groups. Providing material support to US-designated terrorist groups is already illegal. Critics of the bill argued that Republicans cynically pushed to fast-track the bill by merging the measure targeting non-profits with the provision offering tax relief to Americans imprisoned abroad, and described it as a gift to Trump, who made retaliation against \u201cenemies\u201d within the US a centerpiece of his campaign. \u201cThis bill authorizes Donald Trump to recklessly impose a death penalty on any non-profit in America that happens to be on his enemies list,\u201d said the Texas Democratic congressman Lloyd Doggett before the bill was taken to a vote. \u201cWith this bill, he can destroy the very life of civil society in this country, one group after another, even though the group involved that he targets as a terrorist supporting group has not violated a single law.\u201d Activists who have publicly criticized Israel amid its assault on Gaza have faced steep recriminations already, including doxxing, harassment and \u2013 in the case of one Cornell University student \u2013 the threat of deportation. Pro-Israel politicians have regularly claimed that pro-Palestinian groups are aligned with the militant group Hamas, a US-designated terrorist group. Some critics of HR 9495 worried the bill would disproportionately target such activists. \u201cIt could target major liberal funders who support Palestinian solidarity and peace groups who engage in protest. But it could also theoretically be used to target pro-choice groups, and I could see it being used against environmental groups,\u201d Ryan Costello, policy director at the National Iranian American Council Action, told the Intercept. But it was Trump\u2019s impending second presidential term, and concerns about how he could use, or abuse, the law, that appear to have stopped the bill in the house. \u201cWith Trump\u2019s election, the conditions have changed,\u201d said Doggett, who said he had supported an earlier version of the measure. \u201cThe dangers of granting additional power to him are far outweighed by any benefits from this bill.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-11-27T23:47:25Z",
            "content": "UK-based Kurdish advocacy groups have condemned the arrest of seven people by counter-terrorism police in London as part of an investigation into the banned Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party, known as the PKK. Four men aged 23, 27, 56 and 62, and two women aged 31 and 59, were arrested at separate addresses during dawn raids in the capital on Wednesday and remain in custody, the Metropolitan police said. A 31-year-old man was arrested Wednesday afternoon in west London. All are yet to be charged. Shortly after noon on Wednesday, disorder broke out in Haringey, north London, with large numbers of people turning out to prevent further raids in the area. Searches were taking place at eight addresses, including the Kurdish Community Centre in Haringey where police said their investigation could take up to two weeks. Acting commander Helen Flanagan, of the Met\u2019s Counter Terrorism Command, said: \u201cThis activity has come about following a significant investigation and operation into activity we believe is linked to the terrorist group PKK. These are targeted arrests of those we suspect of being involved in terrorist activity linked to the group. \u201cI hope that these arrests show that we will not tolerate any sort of terrorist activity and that we will take action where we believe there is harm being caused to communities here, in the UK or elsewhere.\u201d The force said there was no imminent threat to the public. Kurdish community groups called for the \u201cimmediate release of those detained\u201d and said the arrests were an \u201caffront to the principles of democracy, justice, and human rights that the UK claims to hold\u201d. In Haringey Green Lanes, the heart of the UK\u2019s Turkish-speaking community, the usually quiet streets saw scenes of disorder on Wednesday. More than 100 people took to the streets, chanting \u201cshame on you\u201d at police and blocking officers from conducting further raids in the area. The Kurdish Community Centre was among the sites targeted by police. The Kurdish People\u2019s Assembly in the UK, an advocacy group for the community, is based in the building. Ishak Milani, co-chair of the Kurdish People\u2019s Assembly in the UK, said: \u201cWe, the Kurdish community in London, strongly condemn the recent unjust and heavy-handed raid conducted by British police on our community spaces. \u201cThis aggressive act is not only an attack on our people but also an affront to the principles of democracy, justice, and human rights that the UK claims to uphold. \u201cWe demand accountability for this raid and a clear explanation for the actions taken.\u201d Speaking outside the centre, Milani said: \u201cWe woke up in shock, because the UK police attacked our friends, our political activists. They arrested six of them and raided our community centre, which is really important to us.\u201d He said police had raided the centre almost on the same date last year: \u201cWe are really worried about today. Last year, during our celebrations, they raided our community centre and attacked us.\u201d Day-Mer, another community group for the Turkish-speaking community in London, condemned the raid on the Kurdish Community Centre and called for \u201cthe immediate release of those detained\u201d. One man said his sister was among those arrested and he was staying with her when the police came. \u201cAt 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, I was staying at my sister\u2019s house. They broke the door down, I thought it was a robbery,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen police like this, they didn\u2019t look like Metropolitan police. They covered their face.\u201d When he spoke to the Guardian, he had stitches on his forehead and dried blood on his ear. \u201cI ran into my sister\u2019s bedroom. I closed the door then they broke it and they broke my face. Half an hour later, they took me to hospital. Blood was coming down my hand and my face,\u201d he said. \u201cMy sister was scared. They called the ambulance and arrested her. I don\u2019t know where she is now.\u201d He said his sister is often detained when travelling abroad. \u201cMy sister, when we go to Europe, they always keep her. Last month, they kept her for eight hours, from 8pm to four in the morning,\u201d she said. Feryal Clark, the first Kurdish-British Labour MP, said on Wednesday night she was concerned by the raid. \u201cI have raised the matter with the relevant ministers and I\u2019m in contact with the local authorities &amp; leaders,\u201d the MP for Enfield North posted on X. The PKK is a separatist group that wants an independent Kurdish state in south-east Turkey. It has been banned in the UK since 2001. The group has been fighting against the Turkish state since the early 1980s."

            "date": "2024-11-21T16:52:41Z",
            "content": "The Republican-controlled US House on Thursday passed a bill that would give the government broad powers to punish non-profit organizations it deems support \u201cterrorism\u201d. This was the second time members voted on the Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act, or HR 9495. Last week, after suspending House rules to fast-track the bill, the lower chamber failed to garner the two-thirds majority required to pass. This time, after passing the House committee on rules, the bill \u2013 requiring only a simple majority to pass \u2013 survived by a vote of 219-184. Fifteen Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the measure. The bill, which gives the treasury the power to strip non-profits it claims support \u201cterrorism\u201d of their tax-exempt status, does not require the treasury to adhere to any evidentiary standard in releasing its findings. Although groups targeted could appeal to the IRS or the courts for review, simply being identified as a supporter of terrorism could have a chilling effect on advocacy groups, critics warn. In the days since the first vote last week, non-profit organizations that have historically worked closely with Democrats have pushed against the passage of the bill, arguing that it would give Donald Trump sweeping powers to crack down arbitrarily on his political opponents in civil society. Thirty-seven fewer Democrats supported it during the Thursday vote than last week. The bill merges the non-profit measure with another, uncontroversial measure that would grant tax relief to Americans unjustly imprisoned abroad. \u201cA sixth-grader would know this is unconstitutional,\u201d said the Maryland congressman Jamie Raskin, a Democrat, during debate over the bill on Monday. \u201cThey want us to vote to give the president Orwellian powers and the not-for-profit sector Kafkaesque nightmares.\u201d Raskin called the bill \u201csloppy\u201d, and said it constituted a violation of due process and \u201ccontains everything condemned by the supreme court\u201d. Groups that advocate for Palestinians\u2019 rights \u2013 many of whom politicians have spuriously accused of forging an alliance with the US-designated terrorist group Hamas \u2013 have long opposed the non-profit bill. After Trump, who has vowed to root out \u201cenemies from within\u201d the state, was elected, the bill generated broader opposition. During debate on Thursday, the Republican Pennsylvania congressman Lloyd Smucker claimed that \u201cnefarious groups\u201d had provided material and financial support to Hamas, and said Democrats who changed their minds about the bill had only done so because Trump was elected. \u201cTalk about election denialism, when are you gonna accept that Trump won this election?\u201d said Smucker. Members opposing the bill warned that Trump would abuse it if it was signed into law. \u201cAmericans want checks and balances, not a blank check for any president to label anyone as a terrorist without evidence,\u201d said the Washington congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat. \u201cWith this bill, the only guardrail against authoritarian abuse to any voice of dissent to his agenda will be Trump\u2019s imagination.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 21 November 2024. An earlier version referred to Pramila Jayapal as representing California, when the state of Washington was meant."

            "content": "Trump\u2019s former national security adviser John Bolton has laid into Sebastian Gorka, the president-elect\u2019s pick for counter-terrorism chief, as a \u201cconman\u201d whose selection is not \u201cgoing to bode well for counter-terrorism efforts when the [national security council\u2019s] senior director is somebody like that\u201d. Trump praised Gorka, who was born in the UK to Hungarian parents, as a \u201ctireless advocate for the America First Agenda and the MAGA Movement\u201d. But Bolton came out swinging at Gorka on Friday. The arch-conservative, who served in the Reagan, George W Bush and first Trump administrations, has set out his stall against many of Trump\u2019s picks, including former Democrat and Iraq veteran Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence, and told CNN that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t have him in any US government\u201d. Earlier this week, Bolton told NewsNation\u2019s The Hill that up until Gorka was nominated by Trump as a deputy assistant to the president and the senior director for counter-terrorism, he would have said that Gabbard\u2019s nomination \u201cwas the worst cabinet appointment in recent American history\u201d. Bolton\u2019s not alone in his criticism. Democratic National Committee spokesperson Alex Floyd called Gorka \u201ca far-right extremist who is as dangerous as he is unqualified to lead America\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy\u201d. Gorka is outspokenly pro-Israel and supportive of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and has faced allegations of Islamophobia for supporting Trump\u2019s 2017 Muslim travel ban that barred travel to the US for 90 days for visitors from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Gorka also claimed that Islam is \u201cnot a religion of peace\u201d. He\u2019s come under fire for showing up at Trump\u2019s 2017 inaugural ball wearing an honorary medal from the Hungarian nationalist organization Vit\u00e9zi Rend and for a previous position serving as an adviser to the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Bolton said Gorka \u201cneeds a full FBI field background investigation\u201d and his \u201ceducation claims\u201d need to be investigated. \u201cI think he is a perfect example of somebody who owes his position purely to Donald Trump,\u201d Bolton told the outlet. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t display loyalty. He displays fealty. And that\u2019s what Trump wants. \u2026 \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want Gorka\u2019s opinions, he wants Gorka to say \u2018yes, sir\u2019, and I\u2019m fully confident that\u2019s exactly what will happen no matter what it is Trump says.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 24 November 2024. An earlier version referred to Sebastian Gorka as \u201can immigrant from Hungary\u201d; to clarify, Gorka was born to Hungarian parents in the UK, where he was raised, and he later moved to Hungary as an adult."

Netanyahu added: \u201cIsrael rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions and charges against it by the international criminal court, which is a biased and discriminatory political body.\u201d Under the Rome statute that established the ICC, the court was set up to be an independent body that stands apart from international politics. The Israeli statement said: \u201cThere is nothing more just than the war that Israel has been waging in Gaza since the seventh of October 2023, after the terrorist organisation Hamas launched a murderous attack against it, and carried out the greatest massacre committed against the Jewish people since the Holocaust. \u201cThe decision was made by a corrupt chief prosecutor trying to save his own skin from the serious charges against him for sexual harassment, and by biased judges motivated by antisemitic hatred of Israel,\u201d it continued, referring to claims made against the chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, which Khan has denied. Benny Gantz, a former member of Netanyahu\u2019s war cabinet, in a post on X described the ICC move as \u201cmoral blindness and [a] shameful stain of historic proportion that will never be forgotten\u201d. The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, said: \u201cThis is a dark day for justice. A dark day for humanity. Taken in bad faith, the outrageous decision at the ICC has turned universal justice into a universal laughing stock. It ignores the plight of the 101 Israeli hostages held in brutal captivity by Hamas in Gaza.\u201d ICC judges said reasonable grounds existed to believe that Netanyahu and Gallant had committed the war crime of using starvation as a method of warfare, and the crimes against humanity of murder and persecution. Most outspoken in Israel was the far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who said Israel should annex the West Bank in response to the ICC\u2019s issuance of the arrest warrants. \u201cThe response to the arrest warrants: applying sovereignty over all areas of Judea and Samaria [the West Bank], Jewish settlement throughout the entire land,\u201d he said. Describing the warrants as \u201can unprecedented disgrace\u201d, Ben-Gvir said the ICC \u201conce again demonstrates that it is antisemitic from beginning to end\u201d. Israel\u2019s foreign minister, Gideon Sa\u2019ar, said: \u201cThis is a black moment for the international criminal court, in which it lost all legitimacy for its existence and activity. In fact, this is an attack on Israel\u2019s right to defend itself. This attack is directed against the most attacked and threatened country in the world, which is also the only country that other countries in the region openly call for and work to destroy.\u201d The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, described the warrants as a \u201creward for terrorism\u201d. \u201cIsrael is defending itself against terrorist organisations that attacked, murdered and raped our citizens. These arrest warrants are a reward for terrorism,\u201d he said. The chair of the Yisrael Beiteinu party, Avigdor Lieberman, who has previously served as defence minister under Netanyahu, said the move provided \u201cfurther proof of the double standards and hypocrisy of the international community and the UN institutions\u201d. He said: \u201cThe state of Israel will not apologise for protecting its citizens and is committed to continuing to fight terrorism without compromise.\u201d The warrants were issued on a day when Netanyahu was meeting the US special envoy Amos Hochstein in Jerusalem to discuss recent renewed efforts to secure a ceasefire with Hezbollah. Hochstein has been in Beirut this week to advance an agreement to halt fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Describing the response by Israeli politicians to the ICC decision, Dahlia Scheindlin, a political scientist, told the Guardian: \u201cEverything to do with international institutions tends to unite the opposition and coalition. There is a widespread conviction in Israel that international institutions are antisemitic and hypocritical. \u201cIt is early, but you would expect a show of unity, even if Netanyahu is not popular because Israelis see it as an attack on the state. It has been a sword of Damocles hanging all these months. The court had to do it or lose credibility.\u201d"

            "content": "Policymakers have been \u201cleft in the dark,\u201d by official jobs figures since the pandemic, which may have \u201clost\u201d almost a million workers according to the thinktank Resolution Foundation. In a report, the thinktank said the regular snapshot from the Office for National Statistics may have painted an \u201coverly pessimistic\u201d picture of the UK labour market since the pandemic. Principal economist, Adam Corlett, says in the report that response rates to the key Labour Force Survey (LFS) have collapsed, from 39% in 2019 to just 13% last year. There are concerns that workers may be less likely to respond to the survey than people who are economically inactive \u2013 potentially skewing the results. \u201cOfficial statistics have misrepresented what has happened in the UK labour market since the pandemic, and left policymakers in the dark by painting an overly pessimistic picture of our labour market,\u201d said Corlett. \u201cThe ONS Labour Force Survey appears to have \u2018lost\u2019 almost a million workers over the past few years compared to better sources.\u201d Ministers are expected to publish a Back to Work white paper within weeks, aimed at helping people back into the workplace \u2013 including by improving the service provided by Jobcentres, and joining up work and health support. The official jobs data has shown employment in the UK failing to recover to pre-Covid levels \u2013 a different pattern from other major economies. In particular, the number of people out of work because of health conditions has risen sharply. Resolution has constructed an alternative assessment, using tax and population data. This tracks the official figures closely until 2020, but then diverges sharply. It suggests the ONS may be underestimating the number of people in jobs by as much as 930,000. The analysis suggests that the working age employment rate may be back to the pre-pandemic level of 76%, instead of the 75% currently estimated by the ONS. Resolution Foundation urged the ONS to act swiftly to reconcile the official figures with alternative estimates. \u201cThe government faces a significant challenge in aiming to raise employment, even if the rate is higher than previously thought. But crafting good policy is made harder still if the UK does not have reliable employment statistics,\u201d said Corlett. The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, reiterated his concerns about the labour market data on Tuesday, after raising the issue at last week\u2019s Mansion House dinner. \u201cThe sample is now so small that it is not a statistically representative sample, that\u2019s the problem \u2013 so we don\u2019t know how much faith we can put into it,\u201d Bailey told MPs on the cross-party Treasury select committee. \u201cIt\u2019s an important issue: it\u2019s very important, and it\u2019s not just important for us, it\u2019s important for other aspects of public policy as well.\u201d The Bank\u2019s understanding of how much slack there is in the labour market is a key factor in setting interest rate policy. A spokesperson for the ONS said it is aware that other measures of employment may be giving \u201ca more accurate picture\u201d than the LFS, but insisted it is working to improve the figures. \u201cOur ongoing work to improve the LFS estimates by increasing the sample, reintroducing face-to-face interviews, increasing incentives for those taking part and re-weighting the data using the latest population information will all help to improve the quality of the survey,\u201d they said. The spokesperson added that the ONS is cooperating with outside experts, to see if more action needs to be taken."

            "content": "Donald Trump will be propelled to the White House for a second term amid concerns about inflation kicked off by the pandemic, with a leading vaccine skeptic \u2013 Robert F Kennedy Jr \u2013 at his side, and proposals from conservative supporters to fundamentally restructure public health agencies central to pandemic-era ire. Covid-19 was never seen as the central issue of the 2024 presidential campaign season, but in the first post-pandemic presidential election, it reverberated as the anti-vaccine movement ascended to its greatest political heights ever. Even in his Wednesday morning acceptance speech, Trump alluded to changes he expects as his administration comes into focus. The vaccine skeptic and conspiracy theorist Robert F Kennedy Jr. is \u201cgoing to help make America healthy again\u201d, Trump told supporters, before adding: \u201cWe\u2019re going to let him go to it.\u201d Dr Howard Markel, a historian of medicine at the University of Michigan who has studied pandemics, said he was struck by widespread anger, and called the election\u2019s theme \u201cthe ghost of pandemic future\u201d. \u201cDid you ever think,\u201d Markel said he remarked to colleagues, \u201cwhen you were doing all this hard work and staying up all night that not like 1% or 10%, but like 50% of the country would be saying you destroyed their life and kept them inside, out of harm\u2019s way, during the pandemic?\u201d Although it never topped his agenda, the pandemic echoed throughout Trump\u2019s campaign. He adopted the slogan: \u201cMake America healthy again\u201d from Kennedy, answered supporters\u2019 recent questions about Covid-19 vaccine mandates in the military, and spoke with the popular podcaster Joe Rogan about polio vaccines. Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation\u2019s conservative playbook, repeatedly drew on anger about mask mandates. One prominent concern from experts is the damage that could be wrought by putting a vaccine skeptic at the helm of powerful federal health agencies. Trump has not announced a specific role for Kennedy in the administration, but Kennedy said he was \u201cpromised\u201d control over health policy. His influence appears to have increased amid repeated mentions of \u201cBobby\u201d in the lead-up to election day. Kennedy, who had been running as an independent candidate in the 2024 presidential election but dropped out and endorsed Trump in August, is a conspiracy theorist known for spreading unfounded claims. Some of those included the idea that HIV does not cause Aids and thoroughly debunked theories that vaccines are linked to autism. \u201cThe first issue on the table is vaccines,\u201d said Dr Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Even without changing public policy, Osterholm said, if authorities with the imprimatur of the federal government speak out against vaccines, \u201cthat discourages people who might otherwise be vaccinated, and at that point that\u2019s as bad as not having a vaccine at all\u201d. The effects are not theoretical. As recently as last week, the CDC released a report that found fewer than one in six healthcare workers had received updated Covid-19 vaccines in the 2023-24 respiratory virus season, and fewer than half had received flu shots. Childhood vaccinations have also dipped since the pandemic. In the US, for children born in 2020-21, the rates of children younger than two who had received all their vaccinations fell as the percentage who had received none grew. The largest declines were for children who received both flu shots (-7.8%). Vaccination hesitancy and misinformation both were cited as major reasons by researchers. \u201cWe forget what this country was like 50 years ago \u2013 how many children died every year from polio, pertussis, measles,\u201d said Osterholm. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see the return of diseases we have controlled for decades and with that many additional severe illnesses in hospitals and deaths \u2013 and that\u2019s just from the rhetoric, not even withdrawing vaccines.\u201d Kennedy has already recommended another vaccine skeptic and the current Florida surgeon general, Dr Joseph Ladapo, as secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), a massive federal agency that houses 13 divisions and 10 subagencies, including the CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the largest publicly funded biomedical and behavioral research agency in the world. Ladapo urged Floridians not to get the Covid-19 vaccine and allowed unvaccinated children to go to school amid a measles outbreak in the state. \u201cRFK Jr holds a series of false beliefs not supported by scientific evidence, and he\u2019s always a threat to vaccines,\u201d said Dr Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and a doctor at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Offit added that proposals in Project 2025 may hold a comparable threat. Currently, the CDC makes recommendations about which vaccines people should get and when, including for children; the CDC works in tandem with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which approves vaccines. Project 2025, the conservative playbook written in part by Trump\u2019s former director of the office of civil rights at HHS, proposes limiting the CDC\u2019s ability to make policy recommendations, such as producing vaccine schedules. \u201cTheir notion was: \u2018Let the parents and doctors decide\u2019 \u2013 the notion being that the parents and doctors are just as informed as the people sitting around making those decisions,\u201d said Offit. Put another way, by Osterholm: \u201cWe often say a physician who treats himself is a fool.\u201d"

            "content": "The rising death toll from drug-resistant bugs is \u201cvery scary\u201d and people do not even realise it is happening, the UK\u2019s special envoy for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has said. Superbugs kill more than a million people each year but neither governments nor the public recognise the scale of the threat, doctors complain. The crisis is largely driven by the misuse of antibiotics \u2013 about 70% of which are given to livestock \u2013 which encourages the evolution of microbes too strong for modern medicine to handle. \u201cWe need to use antibiotics safely and appropriately,\u201d said Sally Davies, who stepped down as England\u2019s chief medical officer in 2019 to champion the UK\u2019s fight against superbugs. By 2050 it is projected that drug-resistant bugs will kill nearly 2 million people each year and play a role in the deaths of 8 million people. The figures put AMR in a similar ballpark to the Covid-19 pandemic, which the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates led to 4m excess deaths in 2020 and 10m in 2021. Data published on Thursday showed a rise in serious antibiotic-resistant infections in 2023 to 66,730 cases, above pre-pandemic levels. E coli caused 65% of cases in the UK over the past five years. \u201cSome people talk about [AMR] being a pandemic \u2013 it is,\u201d Davies said. \u201cIs it a slow-developing one, an insidious one, or what? I don\u2019t mind the words you want to use, but it\u2019s pretty awful.\u201d World leaders have taken little action to cut AMR-related deaths but they promised to reduce them by 10% by 2030 at the UN general assembly in September. Public health experts are frustrated by the lack of interest from governments and the lack of awareness among the public. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a lack of prioritisation \u2013 and that must be a failure of our communication,\u201d Davies said. \u201cThat\u2019s in part the name, \u2018antimicrobial resistance\u2019, AMR, in part the complexity, and the big bit that\u2019s hidden \u2026 they [doctors] don\u2019t tell people what they\u2019re dying of.\u201d Davies, who has previously served on the executive board of the WHO, lost her goddaughter to antimicrobial resistance two years ago. \u201cIt was horrible. She had cystic fibrosis, she knew she had AMR, and she knew she was going to die of it because it was infecting her lung transplant,\u201d she said. \u201cShe said to me: Sally, you\u2019ve worked on this for years, you must use my case [to raise awareness]. She was very brave.\u201d Doctors have urged people to play their part in fighting the rise of superbugs by only using antibiotics when prescribed them and then taking the full course. They also point to the large role that animal agriculture plays behind the scenes. The growing hunger for meat is increasing demand for livestock and use of antibiotics \u2013 some of which are used to treat animals that are not sick, sometimes as a substitute for keeping them in clean conditions, Davies said. \u201cThat drives the development of resistance,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich can then be on the meat when it\u2019s sold, and people pick it up that way. It can be passed to abattoir workers who go home to their families. And it definitely does get to farmworkers and their families.\u201d Most antibiotics are flushed out of an animal\u2019s body in its excretions, Davies said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got high-intensity farming, you\u2019re going to get antibiotics in the fields and in the runoff \u2026 That can get into the water table. But also, it turns out, wind coming along can pick up bacteria and bits of genes, take them up into the sky and clouds, and rain it down somewhere else.\u201d Antibiotic use in farm animals is correlated with antimicrobial resistance in humans, a study found last year. It found an \u201cextremely high\u201d E coli resistance of 73.3% to aminopenicillins, which are used in animals, but \u201cvery low\u201d resistance of 0.78% to glycylcyclines, which are banned in animal farming. For S aureus, the researchers found a resistance to the macrolides group of antibiotics of 56%, while resistance to vancomycin, a more recent antibiotic banned in animal farming, was just 0.22%. EU rules to encourage better farming practices have reduced the amounts of antibiotics given to animals, with little impact on the industry. In Denmark, a leading producer of pork, pigs consume one-fifth of the global average. In France, which is famous for its cheese, cows consume about one-quarter of the average. Alan Dangour, who leads the climate and health team at Wellcome, a nonprofit research organisation, said scientists discovering new treatments were in a race against the bugs. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that if we don\u2019t find another set of antibiotics or responses to bacterial infections, more and more people will be catching infections that are no longer responsive to the medicines we have,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s very dangerous. Imagine going back to a world before the invention of antibiotics, where people were dying left, right and centre from being cut \u2026 we don\u2019t want to go back to that world.\u201d"

Keir Starmer has condemned Kemi Badenoch for breaking what he said had been a cross-party consensus on reducing carbon emissions. (See 11.27am.) Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, has told the Covid inquiry that England\u2019s hospitals were within \u201chours\u201d of running out of some items of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the early months of the pandemic. (See 5.08pm.) Steve Reed, the environment secretary, has promised to reform the food system to ensure farmers are paid fairly for the food they produce, after many filled the streets of Westminster to campaign against inheritance tax changes. School leaders have said they lack the resources to manage a rising tide of challenging behaviour since the Covid pandemic, after figures revealed a significant rise in the number of pupils being suspended and expelled in England. Nigel Farage\u2019s group campaigning against the World Health Organization (WHO) is staffed by consultants who work with the nicotine products industry, the Guardian can reveal. Elon Musk has said UK MPs \u201cwill be summoned to the United States of America to explain their censorship and threats to American citizens\u201d in a fresh escalation of tensions between the world\u2019s richest man and Labour. This is what PA Media has filed from the Covid inquiry hearing this afternoon. England\u2019s hospitals were within \u201chours\u201d of running out of some items of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the early months of Covid, Matt Hancock has said. The former health secretary told the Covid inquiry some PPE was in very short supply during the first wave of the pandemic. He also said he believes vaccines should be mandatory for NHS and social care staff in any future pandemic, while masks should be worn in hospitals from day one. Lead counsel to the inquiry, Jacqueline Carey KC, asked Hancock: \u201cDo you accept that entering the coronavirus pandemic as we did, without a single gown, severely hampered the ability to provide safe and appropriate PPE for healthcare workers?\u201d Hancock replied: \u201cThe stockpile that we had was not as good as it needs to be in the future, absolutely.\u201d Asked if England ever ran out of PPE, he said: \u201cAs a whole? No, but individual locations did. \u201cWe came extremely close. We came within small numbers of items on a regular basis during April and May 2020 \u2013 by the second wave, we were in better shape.\u201d Asked about no more stock of gowns in April 2020, he said: \u201cGowns I think at one point we got to within six or seven hours of running out. \u201cWe were working incredibly hard to make sure that we didn\u2019t (run out). We nearly did.\u201d On the question of whether facemasks should be worn by hospital staff, visitors and workers in a future pandemic, he said: \u201cIt should be brought in immediately, and supplies need to be ready, preferably in each hospital, to make that possible.\u201d Furthermore, Hancock said, ensuring health and social care workers are fully vaccinated is a \u201creasonable step that should be expected\u201d and should be brought in to the NHS and social care at the same time. Vaccination as a condition of deployment came into effect in November 2021 and required Care Quality Commission-registered care home staff to be fully vaccinated in order to be deployed in care homes unless medically exempt from April 2022. Hancock said he regretted that decision as social care and the NHS should have had the rule at the same time, adding: \u201cIf you are employed to care for others, then you should take reasonable steps to ensure you are not harming those in your care. \u201cA clinically proven vaccine is a reasonable step that should be expected.\u201d King Charles has paid tribute to John Prescott. It is unusual for the monarch to issue a statement after the death of a politician, and this is a sign quite what an impact Prescott made during his long career. The king said: I am deeply saddened to learn of the death of Lord Prescott. I remember with great fondness his unique and indomitable character, as well as his infectious sense of humour. My thoughts and greatest sympathy are with Lord Prescott\u2019s wife, family and loved ones at such a difficult time, and I am sure that very many people will recognise and greatly appreciate Lord Prescott\u2019s decades of public service in front line politics, not least as the United Kingdom\u2019s longest serving deputy prime minister. Here is our obituary of John Prescott by Stephen Bates. The ongoing row about the prospect of SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn \u201cdouble jobbing\u201d risks becoming a distraction for the party, first minister John Swinney has warned. Flynn has faced a furious backlash amongst MSPs after he announced that he was planning to stand for the Holyrood seat of Aberdeen South and North Kincardine, currently held by his SNP colleague Audrey Nicoll, in the 2026 Holyrood elections. Flynn also confirmed he would aim to hold his Westminster seat until the next general election, due in 2029, but would not accept two salaries. The SNP has previously been highly critical of previous Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross for holding seats in both parliaments, and Flynn\u2019s colleagues are privately angry at the implication that a Holyrood position does not amount to a full-time job, as well as what many see as the high-handed way he\u2019s attempting to oust a respected female colleague. Asked about the escalating conflict after FMQs, Swinney said that Flynn was a \u201cgreat star\u201d but added: What I want to make sure is that the SNP is in no way distracted by internal issues. It\u2019s been a mantra of mine that I want us to look outwards not inwards. At the last Scottish parliament election, the SNP\u2019s national executive committee made a ruling that any MP standing for Holyrood would have to resign their Westminster seat. The NEC has until next spring to decide its candidates\u2019 rules, so this row could go on and on. Neal Lawson, a prominent Labour activist, has been told that he won\u2019t be expelled from the party over a tweet that backed tactical voting. Lawson is director of Compass, a leftwing group that campaigns for more pluralism in progressive politics. He has been cleared by Labour after a 17-month investigation into something he retweeted in May 2021, from the Lib Dem MP Layla Moran urging people to vote Green in a council ward where the Lib Dems weren\u2019t standing. Moran said pointed out that she had only won her parliamentary seat in 2017 as a result of the Greens standing aside. In a comment Lawson described this as \u201cproper grown up progressive politics\u201d from both Moran and the Greens. But Labour launched an investigation on the basis that he may have broken rules saying members should not support rival parties. The decision to launch disciplinary action against Lawson was seen by many in the party as an example of excessive control freakery. Even Keir Starmer was said to be surprised by the move. Under Starmer many leftwing Corbynites have been ruthlessly thrown out of the party, or blocked from standing as candidates, but Lawson is not part of that faction. At the time Lawson wrote an article for the Guardian saying he hoped \u201cLabour\u2019s persecutors and witchfinders\u201d would fail and that \u201cpluralism, that ugly but powerful word, is the force that will shape anything that is progressive\u201d. Today, in a news release, Compass said Lawson has been told he did not break party rules. The organisation said: Compass has long argued for tactical voting, closer cooperation between progressive parties and for a voting system that better reflects the latent progressive majority in this country. At the last election, Labour showed it also recognised the importance of tactical campaigning by ruthlessly targeting its resources in seats it could win and actively discouraging campaigning elsewhere. Thus they were inviting voters to do exactly what Mr Lawson was advocating - supporting the best placed progressive to win. A Compass spokesperson said: We welcome this decision and hope Labour can begin to recognise what Compass has been arguing for years: that no single faction or party can navigate the chaos of the 21st century alone. Labour must be an open tribe if it has any chance of tackling the turbulent challenges of the 21st century - if it fails, the far right is waiting in the wings. Supporters of assisted dying should give up trying to get Kim Leadbeater\u2019s private member\u2019s bill through the Commons, and instead get the government to commission a proper review into how legislation should work, Ed Balls, the former Labour cabinet minister has suggested. Speaking on his Political Currency podcast, Balls said legislation this significant should be introduced by the government, following proper consultation. MPs are due to vote on the bill at second reading a week tomorrow. Increasingly it looks as if the Commons will vote against. Even if it passes, experts say it will never become law unless ministers allocate extra time for it \u2013 which so far they have declined to promise. Explaining his stance, Balls said: I would vote against this bill if I was in parliament now at the second reading, but not because I\u2019m opposed to action on assisted dying at all. But I don\u2019t think parliament can cross the massive threshold of conceding the principle that it is acceptable for doctors and the courts to cooperate in the taking of somebody\u2019s life \u2013 unless you are absolutely sure you know how it will work in practice, legally, and in terms of resources and in terms of the difficult cases. And I just don\u2019t feel that that\u2019s where we are. There isn\u2019t yet enough solidity, and the government has to kind of engage in this more. What should happen is after the opening speeches, there should be a statement in the house or publicly or from Downing Street to say \u2018We think Kim Leadbeater has done a brilliant job of raising this issue, we don\u2019t think yet we\u2019ve got to a place where we can see a way forward. What the government is now going to do is start some kind of review process.\u2019 Could be a Royal Commission, could be judge-led, it could be a small panel expert-led to report with a fixed date, next year. At that point, Kim Leadbeater says, \u2018Look, you know, I\u2019ve got as far as I can with this bill.\u2019 She withdraws, the bill drops, the private members bill. We have that process, and then we come back, if it can be made to work with government legislation next year. That is the best way, and I think it may be the only way. George Osborne, who co-hosts the podcast with Balls, said that he was now in favour of assisted dying, having been opposed in the past, but that he also did not think Leadbeater bill would become law. The government has indicated that its proposed new law \u201cto bring the feudal leasehold system to an end\u201d will take longer than expected. The last government proposed leasehold reform, but it was accused of watering down its original plans and, by the time the election was called, its leasehold and freehold reform bill had not cleared parliament. A very basic version was rushed through parliament just before the dissolution. In the king\u2019s speech the government promised to publish a new, more extensive draft leasehold and commonhold reform bill that would implement Law Commission reform proposals that had been dropped by the Tories. The government said it wanted \u201cto bring the feudal leasehold system to an end, reinvigorating commonhold through a comprehensive new legal framework and banning the sale of new leasehold flats so commonhold becomes the default tenure.\u201d But today, in a written ministerial statement, Matthew Pennycook, the housing minister said the draft bill is not expected to be published until the second half of 2025. He said the process was more complicated than expected because he had been told that the Tory act, which was pushed through parliament by Michael Gove, contained \u201ca small number of specific but serious flaws\u201d that would have to be fixed by primary legislation. Pennycook went on: These serious flaws include a loophole which mean the act goes far beyond the intended reforms to valuation and that undermines the integrity of the amended scheme. In addition we must correct an omission that would deny tens of thousands of shared ownership leaseholders the right to extend their lease with their direct landlord given that the providers in question do not have sufficiently long leases to grant 990-year extensions. This government will not make the same mistakes as the last when it comes to reforming what is, without question, an incredibly complicated area of property law. While we intend to continue to work at pace, we will take the time necessary to ensure the reforms we pass are fit for purpose. Pennycook also said a white paper on commonhold reform would be published early next year. In Birmingham, MP Jess Phillips and former West Midlands mayor Andy Street are among those who have gathered to pay tribute to the victims of the 1974 pub bombings in the city, on the 50th anniversary of the atrocity in which 21 were killed and 220 injured. Survivors and families of the victims have today renewed their calls for a public inquiry into why no one has been brought to justice for the attacks, with Street saying he \u201cdeeply regrets that the previous government didn\u2019t get to award it\u201d. He told the BBC: Twenty-one people lost their lives and we still to this day do not know exactly what happened and who the perpetrators were. One of the principles of British justice is that you should get to a closure. You might now not be able to hold those accountable for it but I do still feel that that needs to be done. Following a one-minute silence at the memorial service outside New Street station, Phillips read out the names of the deceased and the Duchess of Edinburgh read out a message on behalf of King Charles. The king\u2019s message said: My wife and I would like to take this opportunity to say that you and all those affected by this dreadful attack remain very much in our thoughts. What happened on this day 50 years ago was one of so many dreadful tragedies in a devastating period that touched us all, many of us very personally. I must also express my sincere admiration for the people of Birmingham who have lived so courageously with the grief of that day and the days that followed. Asked about racial disparities in Covid deaths, Hancock told the inquiry that this was an issue he was alert to because he had already taken an interest in institutional racism in the NHS. But he also said some the \u201chard left stuff\u201d put out by NHS bodies to address this were not the right way forward. During evidence this morning Hancock was challenged when he claimed that the NHS was not overwhelmed during the pandemic. Jacqueline Carey KC , counsel for the inquiry, put it to Hancock: The fact that the nurses are being stretched to the ratios that we\u2019ve looked at and the potential adverse consequences for those who are in ICU does not in fact demonstrate the NHS was, in fact, overwhelmed. And Hancock replied: No, because people could get treatment. The treatment was not as good as in the same way that the waiting times for a knee operation was not as good as pre-pandemic. I\u2019m not saying that the NHS was perfect in the pandemic, and I\u2019m not saying that it wasn\u2019t severely pressured in many areas and that that pressure had consequences. The point of saying that it would be overwhelmed is that the system as a whole, withstood the pressure. As Martin Bagot reports in a story for the Mirror, Carey pushed back at this point, saying that if people were not getting the treatment they would normally get, they would think the system was overwhelmed. Bagot says the exchanges got testy, and that some relatives of people who died who were attending the hearing seemed to get distressed by what they were hearing. Hancock tells the inquiry that some hospitals refused to test their staff for Covid because they did not want to lose too many people off sick. He says that is an example of a \u201ccultural problem in the NHS\u201d in that not enough is done to tackle \u201cnosocomial infection\u201d (infection picked up during a medical procedure). Back at the Covid inquiry, Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, is being asked about PPE. He has just said that at one point the country was \u201cwithin six or seven hours\u201d of running out of gowns. Hancock was being asked about this chart, showing how long stocks of various types of PPE were expected to last before they ran out. Earlier in his evidence this afternoon Hancock said that, although individual hospitals may have run out of PPE, the country as a whole never ran out. Jacqueline Carey KC, counsel for the inquiry, put it to him that that was not any consolation to health staff who went without PPE. The flag at the Guildhall in Hull is flying at half-mast to mark the death of John Prescott, who was an MP for the city for 40 years. The city council has posted this on social media. Tributes from the council are here. And there is a good round-up of tributes to Prescott on the LabourList website too. David Lammy\u2019s announcement of sanctions against kleptocrats (see 1.19pm) came as crown dependencies and overseas territories (OTs) wrapped up a joint ministerial council in London at which resistance to the decade-old UK demand to set up public registers of beneficial ownership was once again raised. Public registers, by ending the secrecy surrounding the transfer of assets to tax havens, make it easier for campaigners to expose money laundering, as well as deter it taking place in the first place. The last missed deadline was for the end of 2023. The key OTs have found a series of reasons not to implement the measure including citing a 2022 European Court of Justice ruling saying the registers breach European privacy laws. None of the OTs are inside the EU but they argue they cannot afford to have stricter declaration laws than other countries or else funds will leave their jurisdiction.. As prime minister ahead of the G8 in Northern Ireland in 2016 David Cameron first set out the UK goal of setting up registers, but a succession of deadlines have been allowed to be missed with no action taken by the government to impose registers. The lack of the registers, as well as the presence in London of money laundering enablers, is the Achilles heel of the UK\u2019s efforts to become an international leader in the fight against corruption. Stephen Doughty the Foreign Office minister, has written to the OTs setting out his expectation that the registers will be set up, and has visited some of the territories to seek their cooperation. A spokesperson for the Cayman Islands government said it was continuing to work towards an \u201cenhanced beneficial ownership framework\u201d by the end of 2024,. A cross-party coalition of 40 MPs in a letter earlier this week called for ugent action against the overseas territories. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, claimed he was bringing the golden age of money laundering to an end when he announced sanctions against three high-profile kleptocrats and their key enablers. Lammy said the tide was being turned on corruption after a long period when the previous government allowed the role of London as a money laundering capital to continue. When Labour was in opposition Lammy stressed how much damage Britain\u2019s role in laundering corrupt money was causing the country\u2019s reputation in the global south, as well as the damage done to the international financial system,. The three main designations announced today cover: Dmitry Firtash who is known to have extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from Ukraine, hiding millions in the UK property market; Isabel Dos Santos, the daughter of Angola\u2019s former president who is accused abused her positions at state-run companies to embezzle at least \u00a3350m; and Aivars Lembergs, one of Latvia\u2019s richest people, who abused his political position to commit bribery and launder money. Firtash has already been sanctioned in other jurisdictions. The UK also sanctioned his wife, Lada Firtash, who has profited from his corruption and holds UK assets on his behalf, including the site of the old Brompton Road tube station, as well as Denis Gorbunenko, a UK-based financial \u2018fixer\u2019 who enabled and facilitated Firtash\u2019s corruption. Dos Santos was once dubbed \u2018Africa\u2019s richest woman\u2019. She has been subject to an Interpol Red Notice since November 2022 and just last month lost a case at the court of appeal regarding her worldwide asset freeze. The UK also said it was sanctioning her business partner Paula Oliveira, and her chief financial officer Sarju Raikundalia. The Foreign Office said both had helped Dos Santos funnel Angola\u2019s national wealth for her own benefit. It is not known how many assets they still have in the UK. Lammy said: These unscrupulous individuals selfishly deprive their fellow citizens of much-needed funding for education, healthcare and infrastructure - for their own enrichment. I committed to taking on kleptocrats and the dirty money that empowers them when I became Foreign Secretary and these sanctions mark the first step in delivering this ambition. The tide is turning. The golden age of money laundering is over. At FMQs today the Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay attacked John Swinney over today\u2019s Audit Scotland report which was damning in its criticism of the Scottish government\u2019s lack of long-term strategy over public finances. The report also criticised the SNP\u2019s short-term fixes, lack of transparency and warned that fundamental changes were needed to keep public services affordable. Swinney insisted that financial constraints on his budget were the result of UK Tory austerity, trotting out his favourite jibe about Findlay\u2019s future previous support for Liz Truss, and said next month\u2019s budget would involve \u201can honest conversation with the people of Scotland\u201d. Meanwhile the Scottish Greens\u2019 co-leader Lorna Slater pressed Swinney on whether the budget would introduce a public health levy on alcohol and tobacco, as health campaigners lobby his government to introduce one. Swinney said he couldn\u2019t pre-empt budget decisions, arguing the finance secretary was facing pressure from all sides with a budget under severe constraints thanks to inflation and hefty public sector pay deals. Downing Street has described unconfirmed reports that Russia may have fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into Ukraine as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. Asked about this at the morning lobby briefing, the PM\u2019s spokesperson said: As you will understand it is a rapidly developing situation and I don\u2019t want to get ahead of our intelligence services who are looking at these reports urgently, but if true, clearly this would be another example of grave, reckless and escalatory behaviour from Russia and only serves to strengthen our resolve. Martin Belam had more coverage of this story on today\u2019s Ukraine war live blog Keir Starmer has defended the government\u2019s decision to register 470 delegates to attend the Cop29 climate conference in Baku in Azerbaijan. During his Commons statement he was asked about the large number of people attending by the independent MP Shockat Adam who asked if the cost was justified, particularly given the cut to winter fuel payments. Starmer said the British contingent was small than it was at last year\u2019s Cop, and that there was \u201ca lot of negotiation\u201d to be carried out there. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely vital that we\u2019re doing that important work,\u201d he said. John Healey, the defence secretary, has been giving evidence to the Commons defence committee this morning. But he wouldn\u2019t confirm that Ukraine has started firing Storm Shadow missiles provided by Britain at Russia. Asked to confirm these reports, Healey said: I won\u2019t be drawn on the operational details of the conflict. It risks both operational security and in the end the only one that benefits from such a public debate is President Putin. Healey also said this was a \u201cserious moment\u201d for Ukraine and he said battle lines were now \u201cless stable than at any time since the early days of the full scale Russian invasion\u201d. UPDATE: Healey said: This is a serious moment that I come before the committee. Defence intelligence will reveal today that the front line is now less stable than at any time since the early days of the full scale Russian invasion in 2022. We have seen in recent weeks a very clear escalation from Putin and his forces. They have stepped up attacks on the energy system in Ukraine ahead of winter, they have stepped up attacks on civilian centres killing children, they have deployed at least 10,000 North Korean troops to the battle front line. And there are unconfirmed but media reports today of Russia firing a new ballistic missile into Ukraine which we know they have been preparing for months. While the Ukrainian actions on the battlefield speak for themselves, be in no doubt that UK government is stepping up our support for Ukraine, determined to continue doubling down our support for Ukraine. The Guardian columnist Martin Kettle has sent me this anecdote, which he describes as his favourite memory of the late John Prescott. Martin says: I was at a Labour conference in Blackpool in the 90s and I bumped into him back stage in the press room and he said: \u201cIs your fella Steve Bell here?\u201d I said, yes, Steve was. \u201cWell can you introduce me? He always draws me as Tony\u2019s dog, and I\u2019m not a fuckin\u2019 dog.\u201d Steve was sitting quite nearby, so I nervously made the introductions as the two big guys met up. Within a few seconds, Prescott\u2019s threatening manner vanished and he and Steve were in stitches about some joke or other. Then, as Prescott was leaving he turned and squared up to Steve and said. \u201cNo dogs, OK?\u201d Of course it made absolutely no difference whatever, and Steve kept on drawing him as a dog. Matt Hancock has told how he \u201cruffled some feathers\u201d protecting the NHS from political \u201cinterference\u201d during the Covid pandemic, PA Media reports. Giving evidence to the Covid inquiry, the former health secretary said part of his role was to \u201cshield\u201d the NHS from \u201cpeople being difficult in Number 10\u201d. He said: Within the running of the NHS, we were protected in a way because of the independence of the NHS. And therefore the people being difficult for Number 10, part of my job was to provide a shield from that. And I know that I ruffled some feathers in doing so, but my job was, ironically, also to protect the NHS from some of that. Hancock told the inquiry that interference from Number 10 caused \u201cincredible difficulties\u201d with regards to testing people for Covid. Hancock is giving evidence as part of the inquiry\u2019s third module investigation, focusing on the impact of the pandemic on the NHS. As PA reports, Hancock was asked by inquiry counsel Jacqueline Carey about his witness statements which suggested \u201cinappropriate political interference from Number 10\u201d, and whether that interference applied to the scope of these hearings. He replied: Well, of course some of it did. For instance, the biggest interference that caused difficulties was within testing, where some of the political appointees in Number 10 caused incredible difficulties. Hancock was almost certainly referring to Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser at the times. Earlier hearings have proviced copious evidence showing that relations between Hancock and Cummings were dire. Earlier today Hancock also claimed that former first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, caused \u201call sorts of difficulties\u201d as the pandemic unfolded. (See 10.26am.) Keir Starmer said that he condemned the jailing of 45 pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong by the Chinese authorities during his statement in the Commons. He was challenged to use the word condemn after Conservative MPs suggested that he was reluctant to sound too critical of China on this issue. In her response to Starmer\u2019s opening statement, Kemi Badenoch said that the activists were sentenced the day after Starmer held talks with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, at the G20 summit. She said she had not heard him condemn the sentences at the time, and she challenged him so do so \u201cunequivocally\u201d. In response, Starmer said \u201cMinister West\u201d (Catherine West, the minister for the Indo-Pacific\u201d made a statement on this and he said he was happy \u201cto repeat and affirm her position\u201d. Later Iain Duncan-Smith, one of the most China-criticial Tories and a former party leader, asked Starmer to be more explicit. Starmer replied: I said I condemned it a moment ago, and I\u2019m happy to say so. I just did and I will say it again. It is important that where we have these significant differences, particularly on issues of human rights, that we have frank, open discussions about them and that is why these matters have been raised repeatedly. Here are two more tribute to John Prescott. From the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock John Prescott was an intriguing mixture of ferocity and charm who attracted affection, respect and, sometimes, outrage. He was truly a political innovator in policies ranging from integrated transport to combating climate change and regional democratic and economic development to European co-operation. Vitally, he was also a very practical MP and minister who continually sought the best way to \u2018get things done\u2019 whether that meant bringing divergent people together or insisting on details of implementation. This central invaluable quality made him an essential figure in 10 years as deputy prime minister. From John Major, the former Conservative prime minister [Prescott] was an essential part of Labour\u2019s electoral success in the 1990s and \u2013 as deputy prime minister \u2013 continued to say what he thought in unmistakable terms. He never lost sight of the causes that first motivated him into politics, and remained a passionate advocate for all he believed \u2013 even if that meant the odd tussle with colleagues along the way. Although a political opponent, I much admired him as a man who never betrayed his core instincts. He was, in essence, a deep down genuine politician. The public saw that \u2013 and respected him for it. In his response to Kemi Badenoch in the Commons (see 11.27am), Keir Starmer also criticised her suggestion that he should not have attended the G20 in Brazil. Badenoch did not quite say he should have stayed at home, but she said being at the G20 was probably \u201ca lot easier\u201d than being in London when '\u201chard-working farmers were protesting outside the Downing Street gates at his cruel family farm tax\u201d. Referring to her comments, Starmer said: [Badenoch] references me being in Rio when the farmers were protested. G20 is the leading economies of the world, getting together to discuss questions of common issues on the economy and on security. If her implication is that the UK should not be there at leader level, that we should join Putin in avoiding that meeting, if that\u2019s the position of her party, then she should say so. Keir Starmer\u2019s statement to MPs about the G20 and Cop29 summits largely summarised announcments made while he was at those events. Kemi Badenoch, the new Conservative leader, responded. Normally exchanges like this are relatively tame, because the main parties often broadly agree on foreign policy issues, but Badenoch was very critical of Starmer\u2019s foreign policy positions, particularly on climate, and Starmer condemned her for breaking what had been a cross-party consensus on reducing emissions. Referring to Cop29, Badenoch said: Cop has not yet concluded, so we do not know what the final impact on the UK will be. But we do know the prime minister\u2019s rush to a further cut in our emissions [a reference to this announcement] is yet another example of politicians putting short term publicity above long term planning. When will he publish the plans to achieve this new target? Where this government does the right thing, we will back it. Yet, where it puts politics before people and press releases before practicality, we will hold them to account. It is time for politicians to tell the truth, and it is time the prime minister provided some substance to back this costly rhetoric. Badenoch pointed out that, by attending the G20 summit in Brazil, Starmer was out of London for the farmers\u2019 protests. And she ended: The prime minister\u2019s foreign policy is a pick and mix of empty platitudes, unilateral commitments that he could have announced at home, and dangerous precedents \u2013 rushing to give away the Chagos islands and paying for the privilege, an ill-judged suspension of export licences to Israel, damaging our defence and security industry and failing to set out a roadmap for spending 2.5% GDP on defence in a world that is becoming yet more dangerous. I hope the prime minister is up to the very real and serious challenges posed to our security and prosperity. In response, Starmer said that Badenoch\u2019s decision to abandon the cross-party consensus on reducing carbon emissions and the drive to net zero \u201cshows just how far the party opposite has fallen\u201d. He said: On Cop \u2026 I have to say, it is a shame that what used to be a cross-party issue not so many years ago \u2026 when Cop was in Scotland, there was a real unity across the house about the importance of tackling one of those central issues of our time. I think the fact that she has now taken the position she has of attacking the very idea of setting targets shows just how far the party opposite has fallen. On an issue like this, I was proud that under some of her predecessors we had that unity. It\u2019s a shame it\u2019s now been lost because of the position adopted by the opposition. Badenoch describes herself as a \u201cnet zero sceptic\u201d and in a recent interview she suggested that an adaption strategy might be a better solution to the climate crisis than just focusing on cutting carbon emissions. The former health secretary is answering questions on the NHS response to the pandemic Keir Starmer is in the Commons where he has made a statement to MPs on the two summits he has attended recently, the G20 and Cop29. But he started with a tribute to John Prescott, calling him \u201ca true giant of the Labour movement\u201d. He went on: John achieved that rare thing \u2013 he changed people\u2019s lives, and he set the path for us all to follow \u2026 He did it all in his own way, with humour, with pride, passion and total conviction. He truly was a one off. Starmer also said that there would be full tributes to Prescott in the Commons on another occasion. Steve Reed, the environment secretary, has announced a plan which he said would make farming more profitable. In his first speech since the thousands of farmers held a mass rally in Westminster on Tuesday to protest about the government\u2019s plans to extend inheritance tax to farms, he announced a new, farmer-led 25-year roadmap for the sector. He also said that, instead of reversing the inheritance tax changes in the budget, he would make changes to the supply chain to ensure farmers get a fair price for their produce. Recent research has shown that farmers get about 1p from the price of a block of cheese or a loaf of bread in the supermarket, and farmers make about a 0.5% return on their investments. Speaking at the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) conference, Reed said: I\u2019m not prepared to let so many farmers keep working so hard for so little. We need to work together to agree what we want British farming to look like in 25 years time. That means a plan to transition farming to new models that are more environmentally but also more financially sustainable for the long term. We will do this by developing a 25-year farming roadmap. This will be the most forward looking plan for farming in our country\u2019s history, with a focus on making farming and food production more profitable in the decades to come. It will not tell farmers what to do. It will be farmer led so they can tell the government what they need to make the success of this vital transition. Referring to the inheritance tax row, Reed went on: One of the things farmers were telling me last Tuesday is how little profit they make. How little money for all the hard work they put into producing the food for the rest of us to enjoy. The answer to that isn\u2019t to tell farmers they\u2019re not in it for the money, as I\u2019ve heard just last week. The answer is to make farming more profitable. The government will do precisely that. We will make the supply chain fairer so food producers and growers are not forced to accept unfair contracts. Reed concluded: I heard the anguish of the countryside on the streets of London earlier this week. We may not agree over the inheritance tax changes, but this government is determined to listen to rural Britain and end its long decline. The CLA conference is the where Reed told farmers last year, when he as shadow environment secretary, that Labour was not going to extend inheritance tax to farms. Victoria Vyvyan, president of the CLA, has accused the government of \u201ctaxing us out of existence\u201d and \u201cembroiling\u201d rural people in a \u201cstupid row about numbers\u201d. Today, addressing Reed before he gave his speech, she said: Secretary of state, you need to act. Last year, I asked you, were you to be elected, could we in this room count on you to go into bat for us at cabinet? And you said yes, and that\u2019s what I want to see from you. This isn\u2019t about party politics. It\u2019s not about personal party alignment. This is about the fact that you are the one who\u2019s sitting there at the cabinet, representing us, and you have to forget any differences that we might have, and you have to remember that you are our voice at the heart of government. Jacqueline Carey KC, lead counsel for the inquiry, asks about a minute of a meeting he had with health ministers from the devolved governments. She shows an extract on screen. The minutes refer to Jeane Freeman (JF), health minister in the Scottish government, asking for a reset in the relationship between the English and Scottish administrations. Carey asks if that related to anything related to the theme of module 3 \u2013 the impact of Covid on the NHS. Hancock says that was a reference to Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, \u201ccausing all sorts of difficulties\u201d. He says that is not relevant to this module. Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, has now started his evidence to the Covid inquiry. Asked if he thought the \u201cStay at home, protect the NHS, save lives\u201d messaging struck the right balance, Hancock says he thinks it did. Q: Do you think everything possible was done to keep healthcare workers safe? Hancock says: It was obviously extremely difficult to keep healthcare workers as safe as possible, because effectively the wards of the NHS became the front line in this deadly battle. Q: Do you think visiting restrictions, and restrictions on people being with loved ones when they were dying, were too strict? Hancock says: We were balancing incredibly difficult considerations on both sides. I think, on balance, we got those broadly right across the pandemic. But I entirely understand and feel very, very strong arguments on both sides. But Hancock says he thinks the guidance for funerals was applied in a stricter way than had been intended. Q: Do you accept that going into the pandemic with a low number of intensive care beds and high bed occupancy put the system under more strain? Of course, says Hancock. Q: Do you think now that the decision to suspend all non urgent elective care was the right one? Yes, says Hancock. We are inviting readers to share their memories of John Prescott. You can do so via this page. We will carry on reporting tributes to John Prescott as the day goes on, but there is other news happening today too and soon I will switch to the Covid inquiry, where Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, is giving evidence from 10am. He has already given evidence to the inquiry before, but the inquiry is now on module 3, focusing in particular on the impact of the pandemic on the NHS, and Hancock will be talking about that. We have also got John Healey, the defence secretary, giving evidence to the Commons defence committee from 10.30am this morning. Peter Mandelson was one of many people in the Labour party who feuded with John Prescott at various times when they were in government, and at one memorable photocall in the summer of 1997 Prescott compared him to a crab. Today, speaking on Sky News, Mandelson played down the extend of their disagreements, and pointed out that Prescott had supported his application to become Labour\u2019s communications director in 1985 \u2013 the job that turned out to be the launchpad for Mandelson\u2019s career. Mandelson said it was wrong to say Prescott was not New Labour. Some people say sometimes that he wasn\u2019t New Labour. But that\u2019s not true. He was New Labour. He was one very essential part of New Labour. He basically kept us anchored in our working class roots, our trade union history. And he was the bridge, essentially, between that and the modernisers in the Labour party, Tony, Gordon, me and the others. And he always wanted that project to work. It\u2019s not as if he was standing outside it and peering in. He was on the inside and making it work. He was, in many respects, the cement that kept New Labour together. Asked what he was like to work with, Mandelson replied: He was absolutely impossible. When I say he was sort of courageous, he was. When I say he was loyal, he was. When I say he was determined, he was. He was always determined to get his own way on any particular issue at any given moment. Right up until the point he\u2019d say, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll do this for you. You do this for me. As long as you cover this off I\u2019ll happily go along with it.\u2019 So he was a negotiator. He was a trade union negotiator. He was a broker. But at the end of the day he wanted it to work and the way in which he made it work was by being incredibly difficult for days on end and then finally sealing it, making work, agreeing it and off we went. Mandelson also recalled a surprise conversation earlier this year he had with Prescott. I was at home on a Sunday morning and the phone went and then suddenly I put it on and it was the face of John Prescott on my phone FaceTiming me from Hull. I mean, no advanced warning. No how do you do. It was, \u2018Hello, is that you?\u2019 \u2018Yes John it is me. What do you want?\u2019 He said \u2018I just want to say that I know it was difficult and we were bloody awful to you at times and I was, but actually you did good and I want to forgive you.\u2019 What am I being forgiven for here? It was just, \u2018I want to forgive you because you did good. And I know it wasn\u2019t easy at times and I know it was rough and I know I didn\u2019t help but now I understand.\u2019 And I said, \u2018John that\u2019s very kind of you. How do you suddenly understand this?\u2019 He said, \u2018Oh well somebody gave me this book of yours. I didn\u2019t read it before. It looked very boring. But I\u2019ve looked at it, I\u2019ve dipped into it and I\u2019ve seen what you went through \u2026 I feel rather sorry for you actually. And anyway, thanks very much.\u2019 It was a few minutes more \u2026 but that was it. That was the last time I spoke to him. Here are more tributes to John Prescott from Labour figures on social media. From Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s communications director in No 10 JP RIP \u2026 there was nobody else like him. Tony could not have had a better deputy. Labour could not have had a better campaigner. The government could not have had a better negotiator and - yes, often, peacemaker. Hull could not have had a better MP. Of course he was combative but he had an enormous heart and a great capacity for friendship. Even with his horrible illness in later years, the old JP was always there. Love to Pauline, Jonathan and David and nothing but fond memories of a total one off who will be missed by so many. From Yvette Cooper, the home secretary Such sad news about John Prescott. A campaigning Labour hero &amp; a remarkable minister who transformed lives - upgrading millions of council homes, coalfield regeneration, tackling climate change. Fierce &amp; warm hearted - there was no one like him. Thinking of Pauline &amp; family today From Ed Balls, the former adviser to Gordon Brown and later secretary of state for children From Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader I am really sad to hear that John Prescott has passed away. John was a huge figure and personality, from his seafaring union days to the highest offices in Government. I will be forever grateful for his personal and political support in the 2017 and 2019 elections. His endless warmth and iconic wit were loved on the campaign trail. My deepest sympathies to John\u2019s family at their loss. He will be greatly missed. From Hilary Benn, the Northern Ireland secretary 1/2 John Prescott was a political giant who made a unique contribution to the Labour and trade union movement he loved so deeply. Authentic, funny, tough, highly skilled and, at times, unpredictable, he often used the phrase \u201ctraditional Labour values in a modern setting\u201d. 2/2 In doing so, he would reassure and inspire Party members with whom he had a great bond. He will be much missed. All our thoughts are with Pauline and his family on this very sad day. From David Lammy, foreign secretary John Prescott was one of the giants of our party. Committed, loyal, Labour to his core. A relentless champion of working people who never forgot who he came into politics to fight for. Full of good humour and blunt common sense. Rest in peace Angela Rayner is often compared to John Prescott. They were both brought up working class, became Labour MPs after working in the trade union movement and have been frequently patronised or demonised by Tories and the media, partly on the grounds of class snobbery. And both ended up deputy PM. Here is her tribute to Prescott. Through his half a century of public service and a decade as deputy prime minister, John Prescott was driven by his Labour values to serve working people. Fiercely proud of his working class and trade union roots, he never lost sight of who he came into politics to serve. He used the chance he was given to change the lives of millions of working people. A giant of the labour movement and loyal friend, he will be remembered with huge fondness by all those who knew him. John was not only a Labour legend but an inspiration to me, and always so generous with his time and support. We will miss him greatly. Our thoughts and prayers are with Pauline, David, Johnathan and the rest of the family. Here is the full statement from John Prescott\u2019s family announcing his death. Prescott was living with Alzheimer\u2019s in his final years and his family have asked wellwishers minded to send flowers to donate to Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK instead. They say: We are deeply saddened to inform you that our beloved husband, father and grandfather, John Prescott, passed away peacefully yesterday at the age of 86. He did so surrounded by the love of his family and the jazz music of Marian Montgomery. John spent his life trying to improve the lives of others, fighting for social justice and protecting the environment, doing so from his time as a waiter on the cruise liners to becoming Britain\u2019s longest serving deputy prime minister. John dearly loved his home of Hull and representing its people in parliament for 40 years was his greatest honour. We would like to thank the amazing NHS doctors and nurses who cared for him after his stroke in 2019 and the dedicated staff at the care home where he passed away after latterly living with Alzheimer\u2019s. In lieu of flowers and if you wish to do so, you can donate to Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK. As you can imagine, our family needs to process our grief so we respectfully request time and space to mourn in private. Thank you. Here is a John Prescott picture gallery. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Caroline Davies. The former prime minister Gordon Brown has just been on the Today programme paying tribute to John Prescott. He said: John was a friend of mine, he was a colleague, but when you think of him, he was a colossus, he was a titan of the Labour movement. John Lennon talked about working class hero. It\u2019s difficult to fit that term, but I think John would like that. You\u2019ve got to look at his achievements. He was probably the first government minister to see the importance of the environment. Kyoto, that environmental treaty in 1997, you\u2019ve got to attribute that to John\u2019s hard work with Al Gore. Then he saw the importance, and he was a pioneer of regional policy. So the fact we have devolution and mayors owes a great deal to what John was thinking right throughout the 1980s and 90s when I was working with him. And then we mustn\u2019t forget that one of the great achievements of John as environment secretary was the repair and improvement of housing, 1.5m houses which would not have been repaired without John\u2019s determination that the social housing stock had to be remodernised. So you\u2019ve got to look at the practical achievements of someone who possibly surprised himself by the way that he managed to become deputy prime minister, but actually made a huge difference. Yorkshire has \u201clost one of its great political heavyweights,\u201d said Tracy Brabin, mayor for West Yorkshire. In a post on X she said: Deeply sad news to hear of John Prescott\u2019s passing. Yorkshire has lost one of its great political heavyweights. A true Northerner with unwavering authenticity. John\u2019s record speaks for itself: tackling regional inequalities, fighting for social justice and protecting the environment. We must all now build on his legacy and work tirelessly, as he did, to create a country that works for all. Lord Prescott\u2019s wife and two sons said he had been in a care home recently living with Alzheimer\u2019s. Hilary Evans-Newton, chief executive at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said: It\u2019s heartbreaking to hear that former deputy prime minister, Lord John Prescott, one of the most prominent political figures of our generation, has died with Alzheimer\u2019s. Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones during this difficult time. It\u2019s tragic how many lives are being lost to dementia, the leading cause of death in the UK. We\u2019re incredibly moved by Lord Prescott\u2019s family, who have asked for donations to Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, in lieu of flowers. As the UK\u2019s leading dementia research charity, we\u2019re accelerating progress towards a cure, so no one\u2019s life has to end this way. London mayor Sadiq Khan said Lord Prescott was a \u201ctrue giant\u201d of the Labour movement. Khan wrote on X: Sad to hear the news about John Prescott. A lovely man, proud trade unionist, brilliant campaigner and someone who committed his whole life to helping others. The last Labour Government simply couldn\u2019t have achieved all it did without him. A true giant of the Labour movement. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: I am deeply saddened by the news of John Prescott passing away and my thoughts and prayers are with his friends and family. John Prescott will be remembered as a towering figure in British politics and his unwavering tenacity on the causes he championed should be a lesson to us all. His influence on our modern society will still be felt for years to come and his legacy remembered far into the future. Recalling the moment John Prescott punched a protester who threw an egg at him in 2001, Tony Blair told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that he answered \u201cwell, John is John\u201d at a subsequent press conference. Someone smashed an egg on his head, and he turned up, and he turned around, and he punched the guy and laid him out. This caused a huge sort of fracas, obviously... We had to give a press conference in the election campaign the next day, and some people were saying, well, look, he\u2019s deputy prime minister - you know, you can\u2019t have a deputy prime minister thumping a voter. And then there were other people who said, yeah, but you know... he had this egg slammed in his head, and he turned around and whacked the guy, and a lot of people think, well, fair enough. A long debate ensued, Blair said, adding: \u201cFinally, at the press conference, when I was asked about that, I just said, well, John, is John. And so was that supposed to be an answer? I said, Yeah, that\u2019s an answer, that\u2019s as much as you can say.\u201d Ed Miliband, the energy secretary and former Labour leader said Lord Prescott was a \u201ctitan of the Labour movement\u201d. Miliband wrote on X: I am deeply saddened to hear of the death of John Prescott. He was a titan of the Labour movement, a unique and irreplaceable fighter for justice. He fought for social and economic equality all his life, championed the cause of the environment and showed how politics could change lives for the better. John represented the best of Labour values and I will always be grateful for the support he provided to me as Labour leader. I extend my deepest condolences to Pauline, Jonathan and David. Former Conservative Party leader Lord Hague said Lord Prescott was a \u201cformidable debater\u201d. Posting on X, Hague said: John Prescott was one of the great figures of our political era\u2014passionate, loyal, and full of life. I will never forget our many lively exchanges across the despatch box. John was a formidable debater, unflinching in his commitment to his values, and he had a unique ability to speak directly to the concerns of the people he represented. It was a point of pride for both of us that we hailed from Rotherham; although it shaped us in different ways, we shared a certain bluntness in our exchanges\u2014though in true Yorkshire fashion, John usually got straight to the point faster than I did! John\u2019s legacy as a voice for working people and a relentless advocate for Labour will endure. My thoughts are with his family and loved ones at this very sad time. Sir Tony Blair\u2019s tribute continued: I relied on him many times: when in difficulty, under attack; and less well known when I needed someone whose gut instinct I trusted better than my own. To say we were partners would never capture the nature of our relationship. There was nothing formal about it. We met and talked regularly. Rules of protocol were cast aside. Debates were had which could be fierce. But once concluded, the common line was kept. The truth is for all the difficulties and the differences and the jokes about us both and our \u2018odd couple relationship\u2019, we had developed a genuine admiration, respect and affection for each other. Underneath what could be a fierce exterior, and a manner some undoubtedly found intimidating, beat a loving, kind and compassionate human heart. John was as good a friend as you could ever hope to have, with a deep sensitivity, even vulnerability. He will deservedly occupy a special place in the pantheon of the Labour leadership; he will be mourned by his many friends and fans around the world and for me personally, today is a day of profound sadness but also immense pride in having known him and worked with him: a great man and great servant of country and party. Labour former prime minister Sir Tony Blair said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the death of Lord Prescott, and described his deputy as \u201cone of the most talented people I ever encountered in politics\u201d. Blair said: Although we all knew that the end was approaching and was inevitable, I am devastated by John\u2019s passing. He was one of the most talented people I ever encountered in politics; one of the most committed and loyal; and definitely the most unusual. There was nothing about John which fitted conventional wisdom. He was from proud traditional working class stock yet understood instinctively and completely the aspirations of that class and their desire to better themselves. He was liberal and tolerant, yet instantly intolerant of any overly liberal middle class dismissal of the misery suffered by poor inner city communities from crime and drug abuse. He could talk in the bluntest and sometimes bluest language, but it concealed a first rate intellect which meant he thought as deeply about issues as much as he cared about them. It is no exaggeration to say the Labour Party could never have won three consecutive full terms without John. He was a commanding presence. He represented the wing of the party which was not New Labour, but he did it in a way which never reduced the effectiveness of our appeal and indeed extended it, broadening the base of our support. He had extraordinary accomplishments: he revived many of Britain\u2019s inner cities, was responsible for the refurbishment of thousands of council homes, the revival of British shipping, completed the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, established the Coalfield Communities Trust to breathe life back into villages and towns affected by the closure of mines; and was Britain\u2019s lead negotiator for the Kyoto climate treaty, the world\u2019s first attempt to agree a global response to climate change. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, the BBC\u2019s political editor Chris Mason described John Prescott as a piece of \u201cblunt grit\u201d among the \u201cslick middle class polish of New Labour.\u201d He told listeners Prescott was \u201cproudly working class, proud of his trade union background, and proud to bind his party\u2019s past with its present.\u201d Mason quoted former prime minister Tony Blair in his memoirs, recalling of Prescott that \u201che could be maddening, he could be dangerous, he could be absurd, he could be magnificent, [but] never dull, placid, uneventful, forgettable.\u201d Jon Trickett, the MP for Normanton and Hemsworth, wrote on X a short while ago: John Prescott was a Labour giant. I knew him well. V sad to hear of his passing. Mining communities owe him a debt for settling the enormous claim for industrial injuries. In my constit over 10000 families received compensation which amounted to \u00a3100m plus Thank you my mate. Here is Keir Starmer\u2019s tribute on X in full: He wrote: \u201cI am deeply saddened to hear of the death of John Prescott. John was a true giant of the Labour movement. He was a staunch defender of working people and a proud trade unionist. During a decade as deputhy Prime Minister, he was one of the key architects of a Labour Government that transformed the lives of millions of people across the nation. So much of John\u2019s work set the path for those of us fortunate enough to follow. From leading climate negotiations to fighting regional inequality, his legacy will live on well beyond his lifetime. Across the Labour Party and the union movement he will be remembered for his conviction, courage and strength of character. His passion , force of personality and pride in his working-class roots was key to his authenticity \u2013 an honesty that was recognised and respected across the political divide and across the nation. On behalf of the Labour Party, I send my condolences to Pauline and all his family, to the city of Hull which he served as MP for forty years, and to all those who knew and loved him. May he rest in peace. British prime minister Keir Starmer says he is \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d to hear that Prescott has died, and called him a \u201ctrue giant of Labour\u201d. In a statement on X, he said, \u201cI am deeply saddened to hear of the death of John Prescott. John was a true giant of the Labour movement. On behalf of the Labour Party, I send my condolences to Pauline and his family, to the city of Hull, and to all those who knew and loved him. May he rest in peace.\u201d Former US vice-president Al Gore, who worked with John Prescott on the Kyoto protocol climate change agreement in 1997, said he had \u201cnever worked with anyone in politics \u2013 on my side of the pond or his \u2013 quite like John Prescott\u201d. Gore said in a statement: He possessed an inherent ability to connect with people about the issues that mattered to them \u2013 a talent that others spend years studying and cultivating, but that was second nature to him. He fought like hell to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol and was an unwavering champion of climate action for decades to come. I\u2019m forever grateful to John for that commitment to solving the climate crisis and will miss him as a dear friend.\u201d Maria Eagle, the Labour MP for Liverpool Garston, described John Prescott as a great Labour deputy leader. She recalled his work for the relatives of those who lost their lives in the sinking of the MV Derbyshire in 1980. In a post on X, she wrote: \u201cI\u2019ll always remember what he did for the MV Derbyshire families, insisting on work that led to the vindication of their deceased relatives, who they felt had been blamed for the sinking.\u201d When Labour won the election in 2007 with Blair as PM, Prescott, in addition to being made deputy PM, was put in charge of a new \u201csuper ministry\u201d covering the environment, transport and the regions. In that role he was credited with a number of successes, including helping to negotiate the international Kyoto Protocol on climate change and creating regional development councils as well as reforms to the transport system. East Hull MP Karl Turner has released a statement on Prescott\u2019s death. Turner has known Prescott all of his life, he said, and knows \u201cfirst-hand the impact that he had on many thousands of people across the city and the country.\u201d Prescott played an instrumental role in negotiating the Kyoto protocol on climate change, Turner recalls. Times radio breakfast host Stig Abel described Prescott on X as, \u201cOne of the most colourful, memorable politicians of our lifetimes. A man everyone can conjure in their minds immediately, and you can\u2019t say that about many politicians any more.\u201d Born in Prestatyn in Wales on 31 May 1938 the son of a railwayman, Prescott left school at the age of 15 to work as a trainee chef and then as a steward on the Cunard Line before entering politics. In a private letter in 2007, Blair said his former deputy\u2019s role \u201csmoothing out problems, sorting out colleagues and troubleshooting\u201d had been an \u201cintegral part of getting things done\u201d. The former prime minister said: \u201cThe completely unique Prescott blend of charm and brutality \u2013 made always more effective by the unpredictability of which would be predominant \u2013 got you through the decade, kept the government together and above all, gave me a lot of fun. I was lucky to have you as my deputy.\u201d Over a parliamentary career spanning more than half a century, Prescott served for 10 years as deputy prime minister after Labour\u2019s 1997 general election landslide. At times short-tempered, he once famously punched a protester who threw an egg at him during an election campaign visit to north Wales in 2001. But during much of his time in office, he acted as a mediator in the often turbulent relationship between Tony Blair and his chancellor, Gordon Brown. He also oversaw the environment, transport and the regions, a brief that included helping to negotiate the international Kyoto protocol on climate change. Prescott was a loyal supporter of Blair in office but subsequently critical of parts of New Labour\u2019s legacy, denouncing Britain\u2019s involvement in the Iraq war. He also strongly defended Jeremy Corbyn during his time as party leader in the face of fierce criticism. In their statement, Prescott\u2019s family said that representing Hull for 40 years in parliament was the former deputy PM\u2019s \u201cgreatest honour\u201d. The statement reads, in part: John spent his life trying to improve the lives of others, fighting for social justice and protecting the environment, doing so from his time as a waiter on the cruise liners to becoming Britain\u2019s longest serving deputy prime minister. John dearly loved his home of Hull and representing its people in parliament for 40 years was his greatest honour. We would like to thank the amazing NHS doctors and nurses who cared for him after his stroke in 2019 and the dedicated staff at the care home where he passed away after latterly living with Alzheimer\u2019s. In lieu of flowers and if you wish to do so, you can donate to Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK. As you can imagine, our family needs to process our grief so we respectfully request time and space to mourn in private. Thank you.\u201d The former British deputy prime minister John Prescott has died aged 86, his family announced on Thursday morning. His family said he had \u201cspent his life trying to improve the lives of others, fighting for social justice and protecting the environment\u201d. \u201cWe are deeply saddened to inform you that our beloved husband, father and grandfather, John Prescott, passed away peacefully yesterday at the age of 86,\u201d they said. \u201cHe did so surrounded by the love of his family and the jazz music of Marian Montgomery. Prescott served in Parliament for 40 years, eventually becoming deputy prime minister under Tony Blair. After leaving office along with Blair in 2007, he became increasingly critical of the New Labour legacy, denouncing Britain\u2019s involvement in the Iraq War. More shortly."

            "title": "Schools in England lack funds to tackle rise in bad behaviour since Covid, say heads",
            "date": "2024-11-21T16:22:59Z",
            "content": "School leaders have said they lack the resources to manage a rising tide of challenging behaviour since the Covid pandemic, after figures revealed a significant rise in the number of pupils being suspended and expelled in England. The figures from the Department for Education (DfE) showed more pupils were being suspended repeatedly, and for longer periods, than before the pandemic struck in 2020 and schools were closed for most children over extended periods. The number of suspensions issued by schools has nearly doubled, with 346,000 in the autumn term of 2023, compared with 174,000 before the pandemic in autumn 2019. Over the same period the number of children permanently excluded from school rose by nearly a third, from 3,167 in 2019 to 4,168 in autumn last year. The figures support reports from teachers that behaviour among older children has continued to deteriorate since the pandemic, with the suspension rate in secondary schools jumping by a third between 2022 and 2023. At the same time schools are struggling to deal with sustained increases in pupils persistently absent, while the numbers of children on free school meals, or with mental health difficulties or other special needs, are also at record levels. Pepe Di\u2019Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the school system was \u201cteetering on the brink of collapse\u201d because of funding and support shortages, and urged the government to address the problems. Di\u2019Iasio said: \u201cThere is clearly a very serious problem facing schools with rising incidents of challenging behaviour \u2026 This has become a great deal worse since the pandemic where many children experienced disruption to their education and isolation that are continuing to have a lasting impact. \u201cIn many cases, schools simply do not have the resources to provide the level of specialist support required to prevent behavioural issues from escalating and so we see this ending up with suspensions and permanent exclusions being used as a last resort.\u201d He added: \u201cFunding pressures have meant that many schools have had to cut back on pastoral support, and there are serious shortages in teachers and specialist support staff such as educational psychologists. \u201cThere are also long waiting times to assess and identify the support required for children with the most complex special educational needs. The whole system is teetering on the brink of collapse and the government must show urgency in addressing these problems.\u201d Stephen Morgan, the education minister, said the previous Conservative government had allowed suspensions and exclusions to \u201cspiral out of control shamefully,\u201d harming the life chances of children. \u201cWe have reached crisis point but this government is determined to turn the tide on poor behaviour, break down barriers to opportunity and ensure every child can achieve and thrive,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already announced a significant \u00a31bn investment in [special education], committed to providing access to specialist mental health professionals in every school, and our new regional improvement teams will work with schools to spread the highest standards of behaviour across our classrooms. \u201cBut we know there is more to do, and are looking closely at how we can go further to support teachers and drive up standards for all our children.\u201d The exclusion rate for pupils eligible for free school meals was six times higher than those not eligible, while the peak age group for exclusions was in year 9 \u2013 the cohort whose transition between primary and secondary school was interrupted by the pandemic. Headteachers and school leaders are adamant that exclusions are only used as a last resort, while suspensions are necessary to protect the learning environment for other children. Schools cited \u201cpersistent disruptive behaviour\u201d as a factor in half of all exclusions and a third of exclusions, while verbal abuse and threatening behaviour towards an adult was the next most common at 16%, followed by physical assaults on other pupils at 13%. The number of individual pupils suspended increased by 28% to 171,000. While nearly half were suspended for only one day or less, 12,600 were suspended for more than two weeks in the course of a single term \u2013 an increase of 37% in the space of one year. If the high levels of exclusions and suspensions continue into spring and summer 2024, it will surpass 2022-23 \u2013 when 787,000 suspensions were issued \u2013 as the worst school year since current records began in 2006. The Department for Education has been approached for comment."
