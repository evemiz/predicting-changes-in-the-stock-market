            "date": "2024-05-17T17:04:34Z",
            "content": "Jeremy Hunt has been accused of exaggerating the Conservatives\u2019 economic record and presenting a \u201cdodgy dossier\u201d on Labour\u2019s spending plans, as he moved to put low tax at the heart of his party\u2019s offering at the next election. The chancellor gave a speech in central London on Friday, pitching the Conservatives as having helped the UK recover from economic troubles more quickly than expected. He also signalled a further cut to national insurance in the autumn, having already reduced the tax from 12p in the pound to 8p. \u201cIf we can afford to go further, responsibly, to reduce the double tax on work this autumn, that is what I will do,\u201d he said, arguing the economy had already \u201cturned a corner\u201d. In contrast, he painted Labour as a party of high tax and released a dossier claiming it had \u00a338bn of unfunded policies, from spending on more GP appointments to extra mental health support teams. The costings were carried out by civil servants at the request of the government, but were based on interpretations of Labour\u2019s policies provided by Conservative special advisers. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, described the document as a \u201cdesperate and cheap political stunt with a flawed dodgy dossier to distract from the Tories\u2019 record in government\u201d. \u201cBut if the Tories want to play that game, we\u2019re happy to play it because we are confident our plans are fully funded and costed,\u201d he said. Labour said there were at least 11 serious flaws in the Conservatives\u2019 claims about the opposition\u2019s spending on policies and that the Tories had stated they wanted to abolish national insurance, which would cost \u00a346bn, without saying how they would pay for that. Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government and a former Treasury civil servant, said such costings from Whitehall should be \u201ctaken with a very large pinch of salt\u201d as they were commissioned by government ministers and relied on their political advisers\u2019 assumptions. Economists also questioned Hunt\u2019s claims that the Conservatives had managed the economy well over the last 14 years. In his speech, Hunt acknowledged families had been \u201cbattered by the global shocks\u201d of the Covid pandemic and the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine but argued the Conservatives had sheltered people\u2019s finances. He also insisted the economy was doing well, with inflation down to 3% and the country emerging from a shallow recession with a \u201csoft landing\u201d. Dario Perkins, a former Treasury official who now heads global research at the economics consultancy TS Lombard, said Hunt\u2019s claim that Conservative policies had benefited the UK economy was \u201cbizarre\u201d. He said: \u201cWe have had the worst decade of productivity growth since the Industrial Revolution and shockingly low levels of public and business investment. And this has led to an enormous squeeze on living standards. \u201cThe Conservatives had an obsession with austerity after the financial crash [in 2008] at a time when businesses and households were also cutting back on borrowing, which was a calamity for the economy. \u201cIt is hard to see how, if you are looking at the long-term health of the economy, you pull anything positive out of the last 14 years.\u201d Carys Roberts, the executive director at the IPPR thinktank, also questioned Hunt\u2019s interpretation, saying: \u201cThe economic story of the last 14 years has been one of turbulence. \u201cWithout a doubt the financial crisis, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine have put external pressures on the UK economy. However, the UK has experienced meagre productivity growth, stagnant incomes and deepening regional inequalities, and these have deeper roots than the recent pressures. There is much to be proud of in the UK but our recent economic record is not one of them.\u201d Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said Hunt was \u201cquite right to draw attention\u201d to the pandemic and energy shock, which were \u201cnot the fault of the government\u201d. He said it was certainly the case that \u201creal earnings are rising at the moment but our expectation is that household incomes will be no higher at the end of this year than they were at 2019, which is pretty remarkable\u201d. He added: \u201cWhat we have had is a long period of stagnation and if you look over a year or 18 months, we are still in a period of stagnation. \u201cThe first quarter\u2019s numbers, we will have to wait until they are repeated two or three times before we are really confident that things are turning round. But if you look at the last two years, it is basically a picture of stagnation, with what might be the beginning of a more significant uptick now, but too early to start getting excited.\u201d In his speech, Hunt also hit out at Labour for claiming the Conservatives\u2019 ambition to get rid of national insurance would lead to the end of the state pension in its current form. The chancellor said it was \u201cfake news\u201d and a lie intended to scare older people, and that pensioners should trust the Conservatives to cut taxes. However, pensioners\u2019 tax levels are not lowered by cuts to national insurance as it is a tax on earnings from employment. Hunt\u2019s speech is the fourth major press conference held by a senior politician in the past two weeks. He followed the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer, as the parties move into election campaign mode. No date has been announced yet."

            "date": "2024-05-30T11:26:22Z",
            "content": "Nigeria has reverted to a national anthem it dropped nearly 50 years ago after lawmakers replaced the current one, prompting widespread criticism over the lack of public consultation on the change. The country\u2019s president, Bola Tinubu, confirmed the law on Wednesday, a day after it was approved by both chambers of Nigeria\u2019s national assembly, which is dominated by the governing party. The federal lawmakers introduced and passed the bill in less than a week \u2013 an unusually fast process for important bills that usually take weeks or months to be considered. Nigeria\u2019s economy has plunged during Tinubu\u2019s first year in office, with inflation reaching a 28-year high of 33.2%, and the change of anthem was dismissed by some as a cynical distraction from an escalating economic crisis. The reintroduced anthem was played publicly for the first time at a legislative session attended by Tinubu. Titled Nigeria, We Hail Thee, it was introduced in 1960 when Nigeria gained independence from Britain. It was written by Lillian Jean Williams, a British expatriate. It was replaced in 1978 by Arise, O Compatriots under the military government of Olusegun Obasanjo. That anthem was composed at a time when the country was reeling from a deadly civil war and calls on Nigerians to \u201cserve our fatherland with love and strength\u201d and not to let \u201cthe labour of our heroes past [be] in vain\u201d. The change was met with incredulity by some Nigerians given the economic crisis and deteriorating security. \u201cIt is a waste of time,\u201d said Cheta Nwanze, a lead partner at SBM Intelligence. \u201cWhat is more important are inflation and security problems: that is what the government should squarely be looking at.\u201d Chioma Agwuegbo, an activist and the head of TechHer, an Abuja nonprofit working to get more women into technology, said: \u201cIt is a disaster but it is much deeper than that. This administration isn\u2019t going to bother to pay lip service to public consultations like the [previous, Muhammadu] Buhari administration did. They\u2019re just going to do the first thing that comes to their heads. \u201cTwo, this administration is very aware of the power of the media and the public sphere. This means that they\u2019re not bumbling about. Everything they are doing is targeted. They knew yesterday would be a disaster, hence this distraction with the anthem. There is no reason for this reversal. None whatsoever.\u201d Oby Ezekwesili, a former education minister and presidential candidate, said the law showed that the country\u2019s political class did not care about the public interest. \u201cIn a 21st century Nigeria, the country\u2019s political class found a colonial national anthem that has pejorative words like \u2018native land\u2019 and \u2018tribes\u2019 to be admirable enough to foist on our citizens without their consent,\u201d Ezekwesili posted on X. Supporters of the new anthem argued it was wrong for the country to use an anthem introduced by the military. \u201cAnthems are ideological recitations that help the people to be more focused. It was a very sad development for the military to have changed the anthem,\u201d said the public affairs analyst Frank Tietie. Associated Press and Reuters contributed reporting"

            "date": "2024-05-24T12:47:02Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak\u2019s slim chance of pulling off a victory against the odds in July\u2019s general election depends on voters buying the argument that tough decisions taken since he became prime minister are paying off. That claim will be tested over the next six weeks \u2013 with every piece of economic news more closely scrutinised than usual for evidence that the UK\u2019s tentative economic recovery is gaining momentum or has started to falter. There are five key dates \u2013 crammed into a 10-day period in the middle of the campaign \u2013 to look out for. 11 June: labour market figures This could be one of the trickier pieces of economic news for Sunak to cope with since the last set of official data showed unemployment rising and job vacancies declining. Despite this evidence that the labour market is cooling, earnings growth remained strong, rising at an annual rate of 5.9%. In better news for the prime minister, wages have been rising more strongly than prices for the past 10 months, resulting in rising living standards. The Conservatives will say: four million jobs have been created since 2010 and workers are becoming better off. Labour will say: for the first time in recent history, voters will be worse off at the end of a parliament than they were at the start. 12 June: growth figures for April One factor behind Sunak\u2019s decision to call an election was the unexpectedly strong growth figures for the first three months of 2024, which showed national output 0.6% higher than in the final three months of 2023 and brought to an end the UK\u2019s short and shallow recession. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, expects gross domestic product to rise by 02% between March and April, pushing up the quarterly growth rate from 0.6% to 0.8%. The Conservatives will say: Britain is growing faster than other leading developed economies. Labour will say: over the past 14 years Britain\u2019s growth and productivity record has been dismal. 19 June: annual inflation in the year to May This is probably the most important single piece of economic news during the campaign, given Sunak\u2019s claim that the UK\u2019s cost of living problem has now been cracked. The all-items annual inflation rate came down from 3.2% in March to 2.3% in April and is set to fall further in May. In part, that\u2019s because consumer prices rose by 0.7% last May, a hefty increase that is unlikely to be repeated this year. Bruna Skarica, the chief UK economist at Morgan Stanley, sees the headline inflation rate falling to 2% \u2013 smack on the government\u2019s target. Services inflation, which is closely watched by the Bank of England, should fall from 5.9% to 5.4%, Skarica says. The Conservatives will say: our tough action has brought stability to the economy. Labour will say: prices are 20% higher than they were at the start of the cost of living crisis and are still going up. 20 June: Bank of England interest rate decision The Bank of England raised interest rates 14 times between December 2021 and August 2023 \u2013 a jump from 0.1% to 5.25% \u2013 and there had been growing speculation that its monetary policy committee might start reducing borrowing costs at its June meeting. In theory, there is nothing to prevent the Bank cutting rates during an election campaign, but it would need to have strong evidence to do so. The City now sees little chance of a rate cut next month, with attention focused on whether the Bank will cut rates at its first post-election meeting in August. The Conservatives will say: interest rates are coming down soon because we have fixed the economy. Labour will say: homeowners are paying for Tory mismanagement through higher mortgage rates. 21 June: retail sales and public finances The last of the big five economic events between now and the election, and, while less significant than the other four, it is not without interest. A strong retail sales number would chime with recent evidence that consumers are feeling more confident about the state of their own finances and the economy more generally. Falling retail sales would suggest the absence of a feelgood factor. The poor state of the public finances helps explain why Sunak called an early election because had they been in better shape Jeremy Hunt would now be planning to cut national insurance contributions for a third time in an early autumn statement. The size of the May deficit will have little bearing on the election but will provide a guide to the difficult choices either a Conservative or Labour chancellor might be faced with in the next parliament. The deficit in May 2023 was just over \u00a314bn. The Conservatives will say: life is getting better, so don\u2019t let Labour wreck things. Labour will say: you are paying higher taxes because the Tories crashed the car. Take away the keys. Dales says overall the economic news over the next six weeks will be \u201creasonably positive\u201d but suspects it will not have much of an impact. \u201cPeople\u2019s views on the economy are formed and baked in,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are not going to change that much.\u201d"

            "content": "Your claim that \u201cRachel Reeves prefers a deadening consensus, sacrificing policies to placate business\u201d is absurd, and fails to recognise the radicalism of Reeves\u2019 recent Mais lecture (Editorial, 28 April). Although the need for fiscal stability was mentioned, the main theme of the lecture was quite different. It was about Britain\u2019s increasing economic backwardness \u2013 \u201ca failure to deliver the supply-side reform needed to equip Britain to compete in a fast-changing world\u201d. Reeves\u2019s allocation of primacy to institutional reform recalls the analysis of economic backwardness by the great Harvard economic historian Alexander Gerschenkron. Gerschenkron argued that economic success derives from the development of new institutions that channel funds into the large-scale investment that is necessary not just to catch up but to surpass successful competitors. In the Mais lecture, Reeves set out the rationale for \u201ca new model of economic management\u201d. She recognises that the dire state of Britain\u2019s economy is of sufficient urgency as to motivate the \u201cdecade of national renewal, shaping the institutional architecture of the British economy in the direction of mission-led government\u201d. Accordingly, she proposes new, focused institutions \u2013 a new British Infrastructure Council, a revived Industrial Strategy Council, a national wealth fund and Great British Energy. The challenge Reeves faces is whether her \u201cnew model of economic management\u201d is sufficiently strong to overcome the obstacles to change. Inevitably, in even the best-run reform, there will be mistakes and failures. Building momentum around confidence in the success of her programme of renewal is crucial to dealing with bumps in the road. Britain has undoubted economic potential that can be mobilised by investment in the science base and in the engineering and skills that transform invention into innovation, both in goods and services. John Eatwell Queens\u2019 College, Cambridge \u2022 Proponents of modern monetary theory, discussed in your editorial, have been plugging away for some time to break the stranglehold that neoliberal economic theory has on the discipline. Stephanie Kelton\u2019s book The Deficit Myth, which you also mention, is an excellent example of this. Such is this stranglehold that politicians, when expounding this, that or other policy to the media, are inevitably confronted with the simplistic question \u201cHow are you going to pay for it?\u201d, and the usual reply is a mixture of jiggling about with the tax system, economies in other areas (cuts and productivity increases) and economic growth. The question should be \u201cHave we the resources to do this?\u201d Then the proper political debate can commence. It is refreshing to see that one section of our media is starting to address this. John Boodle Whitwick, Leicestershire \u2022 At last, someone with a voice has brought modern monetary theory into the light. Please keep it there. More discussion needs to be had about the UK being a country that issues its own sovereign currency, which can therefore \u201cprint\u201d the money it needs to invest and to support its citizens. After all, they found a way to do it for the banks with quantitive easing. We must not fall for the \u201cmaxing out of the country\u2019s credit card\u201d scam, because it only serves those who wish to perpetuate austerity. Where to spend the money is a choice. And not to create the money when it is so desperately needed is a choice. Austerity is an ideological choice, not a necessity. Clever minds could work out how to spend first and then make it work; avoiding inflation by appropriate taxation and borrowing after our spending priorities. Now is the time to pursue this seriously, because we already know the results of the alternative approach from the last 14 years. A government\u2019s priority must be the welfare of its citizens.

            "title": "Economic damage from climate change six times worse than thought \u2013 report",
            "date": "2024-05-17T14:00:37Z",
            "content": "The economic damage wrought by climate change is six times worse than previously thought, with global heating set to shrink wealth at a rate consistent with the level of financial losses of a continuing permanent war, research has found. A 1C increase in global temperature leads to a 12% decline in world gross domestic product (GDP), the researchers found, a far higher estimate than that of previous analyses. The world has already warmed by more than 1C (1.8F) since pre-industrial times and many climate scientists predict a 3C (5.4F) rise will occur by the end of this century due to the ongoing burning of fossil fuels, a scenario that the new working paper, yet to be peer-reviewed, states will come with an enormous economic cost. A 3C temperature increase will cause \u201cprecipitous declines in output, capital and consumption that exceed 50% by 2100\u201d the paper states. This economic loss is so severe that it is \u201ccomparable to the economic damage caused by fighting a war domestically and permanently\u201d, it adds. \u201cThere will still be some economic growth happening but by the end of the century people may well be 50% poorer than they would\u2019ve been if it wasn\u2019t for climate change,\u201d said Adrien Bilal, an economist at Harvard who wrote the paper with Diego K\u00e4nzig, an economist at Northwestern University. \u201cI think everyone could imagine what they would do with an income that is twice as large as it is now. It would change people\u2019s lives.\u201d Bilal said that purchasing power, which is how much people are able to buy with their money, would already be 37% higher than it is now without global heating seen over the past 50 years. This lost wealth will spiral if the climate crisis deepens, comparable to the sort of economic drain often seen during wartime. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear that the comparison to war is only in terms of consumption and GDP \u2013 all the suffering and death of war is the important thing and isn\u2019t included in this analysis,\u201d Bilal said. \u201cThe comparison may seem shocking, but in terms of pure GDP there is an analogy there. It\u2019s a worrying thought.\u201d The paper places a much higher estimate on economic losses than previous research, calculating a social cost of carbon, which is the cost in dollars of damage done per each additional ton of carbon emissions, to be $1,056 per ton. This compares to a range set out by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that estimates the cost to be around $190 per ton. Bilal said the new research takes a more \u201cholistic\u201d look at the economic cost of climate change by analyzing it on a global scale, rather than on an individual country basis. This approach, he said, captured the interconnected nature of the impact of heatwaves, storms, floods and other worsening climate impacts that damage crop yields, reduce worker productivity and reduce capital investment. \u201cThey have taken a step back and linking local impacts with global temperatures,\u201d said Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia University who wasn\u2019t involved in the work and said it was significant. \u201cIf the results hold up, and I have no reason to believe they wouldn\u2019t, they will make a massive difference in the overall climate damage estimates.\u201d The paper found that the economic impact of the climate crisis will be surprisingly uniform around the world, albeit with lower-income countries starting at a lower point in wealth. This should spur wealthy countries such as the US, the paper points out, to take action on reducing planet-heating emissions in its own economic interest. Even with steep emissions cuts, however, climate change will bear a heavy economic cost, the paper finds. Even if global heating was restrained to little more than 1.5C (2.7F) by the end of the century, a globally agreed-upon goal that now appears to have slipped from reach, the GDP losses are still around 15%. \u201cThat is still substantial,\u201d said Bilal. \u201cThe economy may keep growing but less than it would because of climate change. It will be a slow-moving phenomenon, although the impacts will be felt acutely when they hit.\u201d The paper follows separate research released last month that found average incomes will fall by almost a fifth within the next 26 years compared to what they would\u2019ve been without the climate crisis. Rising temperatures, heavier rainfall and more frequent and intense extreme weather are projected to cause $38tn of destruction each year by mid-century, according to the research. Both papers make clear that the cost of transitioning away from fossil fuels and curbing the impacts of climate change, while not trivial, pale in comparison to the cost of climate change itself. \u201cUnmitigated climate change is a lot more costly than doing something about it, that is clear,\u201d said Wagner. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 May 2024 because an earlier version misquoted Gernot Wagner in the last sentence."

            "date": "2024-05-15T08:26:36Z",
            "content": "The British technology company Raspberry Pi has confirmed its intention to float in the UK, in a significant boost to the London Stock Exchange. The Cambridge-based business, which is best known for selling low-cost computers aimed at helping children to learn about computing, has been a UK business tech success story, selling 60m units worldwide since 2012. In an update to the market the company said it would send a registration to join the stock market in London, with an intention to fully list. The business could be valued at up \u00a3500m, according to the Sunday Times, which first reported the intention to float. The Raspberry Pi decision comes as welcome news for the London Stock Exchange, which has struggled to attract listings from big companies this year, while some members have moved their listings to other exchanges. Earlier this month the Paddy Power owner, Flutter, announced its decision to switch its primary listing to New York. This followed the Anglo-German travel company Tui and the building materials firm CRH, who have also switched listings away from the UK in the past year. However, according to recent reports, the China-founded fast-fashion company Shein is stepping up preparations for a London listing after its attempt to float in New York faced regulatory hurdles and pushback from US lawmakers. Raspberry Pi is a subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, which was founded in 2008 with a goal of promoting interest in computer science in children. It was co-founded by Eben Upton, who is now the chief executive of Raspberry Pi. The foundation, which has received $50m (\u00a340m) in dividends from the company since 2013, will remain a major stakeholder after the float. The company\u2019s main products are small computer boards that can cost as little as $15 and can operate as fully functioning computers when plugged into screens. They are mainly intended for children to build their coding and IT development skills, but are also now used by companies to power systems such as security cameras and ventilation. For the year ending 31 December 2023, the company posted operating profits of $37.5m, on revenues of $265.8m. Upton said: \u201cFor the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a patient and supportive shareholder, this IPO brings the opportunity to double down on their outstanding work to enable young people to realise their potential through the power of computing. \u201cIn an ever more connected world, the market for Raspberry Pi\u2019s high-performance, low-cost computing platforms continues to expand. We have the technology roadmap to play an increasingly significant role, and we are excited to embark on the next stage of our growth.\u201d"

            "title": "Researchers urge more Australian pharmacies to stock anti-opioid overdose drug naloxone",
            "date": "2024-05-01T21:00:39Z",
            "content": "Just 60% of pharmacies stock naloxone, a life-saving medication that rapidly reverses the effects of an opioid overdose, as concerns grow about the danger posed by synthetic opioids. A survey of 530 pharmacies across New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia, led by researchers from Monash University, found 321 pharmacies have naloxone in stock. A co-author of the study and deputy director of the Monash Addiction Research Centre, Prof Suzanne Nielsen, said this was an improvement from 2016, when only 23% of pharmacies stocked naloxone. But she said with unintentional opioid-related deaths in Australia nearly tripling since 2006, more pharmacies should stock naloxone. The findings are being presented at a research symposium being held by the centre on Thursday. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The introduction of the national Take Home Naloxone program in 2022 means anyone can access the drug from a pharmacy free, without a prescription, with people at risk of an opioid overdose or adverse reaction, their carers, friends and family members encouraged to have it on hand. Nielsen said she was aware of pharmacies that had not received information about the program, which demonstrated the need for additional support. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen great gains in Australia \u2026 the fact we have a nationally funded program is quite unique globally,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re aware implementing new programs takes time \u2026 but we still need to do the necessary work to make sure that the other 40% of pharmacies can provide naloxone.\u201d The survey is an update to the centre\u2019s research published on Thursday in the medical journal, Drug and Alcohol Review, which found only 38% of Victorian pharmacies stocked naloxone in 2020, and a third of which had not supplied their stock to any customer in the past year. Nielsen and her colleagues found that pharmacists lacked the training necessary to confidently identify at-risk patients and supply naloxone over the counter. Synthetic opioids, known as nitazenes, are mixed into other drugs like MDMA and heroin without the user\u2019s knowledge. A cluster of 20 drug overdoses in NSW in April prompted the state\u2019s health department to issue a public warning about the danger of synthetic opioids, which are often substantially more powerful than heroin and to promote the importance of take-home naloxone. Nielsen called for naloxone to be part of the mainstream first aid response, particularly in environments like festivals where illicit drugs that \u201cmay or may not contain synthetic opioids\u201d are more common. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that we have this medication that can reverse an opioid overdose and be administered by a person with very little training,\u201d she said, with naloxone easily administered through injection or nasal spray. Dr Paul MacCartney, an addiction medication specialist at the Melbourne not-for-profit health service CoHealth, said heavy stigma around opioid use within both the general public and medical profession hindered naloxone\u2019s availability. \u201cThe most popular newspaper in our city ran an active campaign against people who use drugs in order to prevent a second safe injecting room being implemented \u2026 and that stigma persists in society through the medical profession,\u201d he said. On 23 April the Victorian government rejected a proposal for a second safe injecting room, which was to be located in the city, after a strong backlash from some media outlets and members of the public. MacCartney said pharmacists were under the impression that opioid users were more likely to be aggressive. \u201cPeople who use drugs are on edge when they go into a medical setting \u2026 they may not even feel comfortable asking a pharmacist for naloxone for fear they might be judged,\u201d he said. He called for pharmacists to be \u201cproactive\u201d in offering the medication to those at risk of an overdose. He also suggested that naloxone be given out alongside prescription opioids, as in Australia, more people die from overdoses of prescribed opioids compared with illicit types."

            "content": "The market for carbon offsets shrank dramatically last year, falling from $1.9bn (\u00a31.5bn) in 2022 to $723m in 2023, a new report has found. The drop came after a series of scientific and media reports found many offsetting schemes do nothing to mitigate the climate crisis and biodiversity loss. The research by Ecosystem Marketplace, a nonprofit initiative that collects data about the carbon market from brokers and traders, found the market had shrunk 61%. It attributed the contraction to a flurry of scientific studies and media reports that concluded millions of offsets were \u201cworthless\u201d, with some projects linked to human rights concerns. Each carbon credit is meant to represent the reduction or removal of one tonne of CO2 emissions removals or reductions, and they have been used by leading companies to label their products \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d, or to tell consumers they can fly, buy new clothes or eat certain foods without making the climate and biodiversity crises worse. Offsets generated by schemes protecting rainforests, the most popular type, lost 62% of their value between 2022 and 2023. These schemes were the focus of a joint investigation by the Guardian, which found more than 90% of rainforest carbon offsets from a large sample of projects from Verra \u2013 the world\u2019s leading certifier \u2013 are worthless, and uncovered potential human rights abuses at a flagship project. Verra disputed the findings. Julia Jones, a co-author on one of the studies in the investigation and a professor at Bangor University, said urgent reforms were necessary so carbon markets could work as intended. \u201cThe media scrutiny revealing that many projects issuing Redd+ credits to the voluntary carbon market have sold more credits than justified is important,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, I am deeply concerned that some of the recent coverage of the issue gives the impression that the very idea of tackling climate change by slowing tropical deforestation is a scam \u2013 this is not true and the idea could harm forests. \u201cDramatically more finance is urgently needed to stop the ongoing loss of forests and the vital services they provide \u2013 a reformed voluntary carbon market could play a key role in providing that finance,\u201d she said. On Tuesday, the White House held an event to support industry-led efforts to reform carbon markets, backing initiatives to help companies avoid greenwashing and ensure credits represent actual environmental impact. The US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said companies should be prioritising cuts to emissions, but the Biden administration still wanted carbon credits \u201cto succeed\u201d. The move comes amid deep divisions between environmental groups about the role of carbon credits in helping companies meet net zero targets. Stephen Lezak, a programme manager at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, University of Oxford, said people should not turn away from carbon markets. \u201cThe current market for carbon offsets is a bit like a burning building. We need folks to be firefighters and run toward it, rather than walk away and let it burn to the ground. Limiting global warming to 1.5C simply isn\u2019t feasible without having a functioning market for this sort of climate finance,\u201d he said. Kaya Axelsson, a research fellow at Oxford Net Zero, said: \u201cThis is a critical transition moment. Carbon markets will lose relevance unless they radically reform in line with net zero aims.\u201d Rene Velasquez, managing partner at the carbon markets consultancy Valitera, disputed the size of the fall reported by Ecosystem Marketplace and said there were problems with the methodology. \u201cAs with previous years, their report is incomplete and relies on a survey of market participants to provide confidential trade data,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is fewer and fewer institutional respondents participate. While I will concede the market retreated, this skews the numbers.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features"

            "date": "2024-05-14T20:06:30Z",
            "content": "Shares in GameStop and AMC Entertainment doubled again on Tuesday, before losing ground, as a turbulent market frenzy surrounding top meme stocks took hold for a second day. Retail traders\u2019 interest in GameStop, the struggling video games chain, has been reignited by the re-emergence of an influencer known as Roaring Kitty. GameStop soared by as much as 98% during early trading on Wall Street, before losing steam in volatile trading, after rallying 74% on Monday. AMC, the world\u2019s largest cinema chain, climbed by as much as 120%. By the time markets closed in New York, GameStop was up 60% and AMC was up 31%. Meme stocks \u2013 boosted by memes on social media \u2013 first emerged as a force three years ago, when amateur traders mobilized on platforms including Reddit to boost shares in GameStop. Their bids triggered an extraordinary, but fleeting, increase in GameStop\u2019s stock market value. It also left hedge funds that had bet against the company nursing heavy losses. Earlier this week Keith Gill, the influencer known as Roaring Kitty, posted on X for the first time since the height of the meme stock frenzy in 2021. He shared a sketch of a gamer leaning forward, as if things were getting serious \u2013 and followed up with a string of clips from movies and TV shows. Three years ago Gill\u2019s videos on YouTube, and posts on Reddit, where he is known as DeepFuckingValue, placed him at the front of an army of meme-toting day traders who tried to mount a rebellion against Wall Street \u2013 and the financial titans dominating the market. The story of the initial meme stock rallies has already been transformed into a Hollywood movie. Paul Dano played Gill, the central character in Dumb Money, which was released last year. Gill himself has largely kept his head down, however \u2013 and steered clear of social media \u2013 until now. His posts on Sunday evening and Monday unleashed a torrent of speculation around his plans. Other meme stocks including BlackBerry and Tupperware also rallied on Tuesday. Shares in GameStop have fallen dramatically since their extraordinary peak in early 2021. Questions have been raised, too, about the strength of GameStop\u2019s business, which has reported falling sales and endured a series of high-profile departures from its management team. Institutional investors were quick to condemn the latest rally. \u201cIt is gambling,\u201d Cole Smead, a fund manager, told CNBC. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember these are young people, these are 40-year-old people like me, who are going out and doing stuff that is just frankly stupid.\u201d AMC, which also owns the Odeon chain of cinemas in Europe, was quick to capitalize on its stock\u2019s latest rally \u2013 raising $250m by selling shares."

            "content": "A limited-edition pineapple priced at $395 \u2013 a cost many would find exorbitant \u2013 is being sold at a southern California produce store as the bustling specialty fruit market expands. While the average family may not be able to spring for the costly fruit, the expensive pineapple is a visible reminder of the demand among wealthy customers for luxurious produce. The Rubyglow pineapple is a rarity, with only a few thousand produced each year, the local news station KTLA reported. The fruit is being made available at Melissa\u2019s Produce, a speciality produce shop in Vernon, California. The rare fruit is known for its ruby color \u2013 similar to the precious gemstone \u2013 and sweet, yellow interior. It was created in Costa Rica after 16 years of research, according to the fruit wholesaler Del Monte Foods. \u201cAs the leaders of pineapple innovation, we\u2019re excited to debut our latest creation, the Rubyglow pineapple,\u201d Del Monte announced on its website. \u201cNamed for the ruby and its rich red color, scarce supply and association with luxury, this exceptional fruit offers a special experience to those who appreciate uniqueness.\u201d The pineapple was previously available only in China. But Del Monte decided to introduce the luxury fruit to North America for the first time. The Rubyglow pineapple is the latest high-end fruit to make a splash in the US. Oishii strawberries, widely known as the world\u2019s most expensive strawberries, have gone viral across social media for their sweeter taste. A pack of six strawberries can cost more than $10 in some areas. Other pricy produce, such as Sumo Citrus, has similarly captured hearts and stomachs across the US. Though many have publicly aired grievances about the rising costs of certain common grocery items, luxury fruits continue to entice some American shoppers. \u201cConsumers are willing to pay for something that\u2019s special,\u201d Cindy van Rijswick, a global strategist for fruit, vegetable and floriculture sectors with Rabobank, told CNN. Van Rijswick added that specialty fruit \u201calways [had] a small market for higher-end restaurants, or foodies, or certain online channels\u201d."

            "date": "2024-05-28T14:41:45Z",
            "content": "Sales in British shops have bounced back in May, according to retail data that suggests slowing inflation is encouraging customers to buy more. A net balance of +8% of retailers told a Confederation of British Industry (CBI) survey that sales volumes were up this month compared with the same period a year earlier \u2013 a sharp improvement on the -44% year-on-year figure for April. The balance is the difference between companies who answered that the number of items was \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d. May marked the most positive monthly reading for the CBI distributive trades survey since December 2022. Alpesh Paleja, the CBI lead economist, said there were signs of a recovery in retail in the short term. \u201cFalling inflation, and continuing real wage growth will contribute to a healthier consumer outlook, in turn supporting the retail sector further,\u201d he said. The figures are likely to be seized on by Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives, with much of the prime minister\u2019s justification for calling a summer election based around his claim that \u201cthe economy is turning a corner\u201d. May\u2019s better data follows poor sales values in April and March that were blamed on bad weather and the ongoing cost of living crisis. The amount of goods bought in April also dropped 2.3% month on month, according to Office for National Statistics data, with furniture, clothing, sports equipment, and games and toys among the big ticket items customers elected to do without. The fall was partly blamed on Easter falling earlier than usual, at the end of March. Shop prices are also growing more slowly, according to the CBI\u2019s measure of selling price inflation. Inflation was at its slowest since August 2020 and below its long-run average, with the expectation of only a slight pickup in June. This matched earlier data from the British Retail Consortium showing that store prices grew at an annual rate of 0.6% in May, down from 0.8% the previous month. This was a huge drop from the high of 9% reached in May 2023 and the slowest price growth since November 2021. The data will be welcomed by the Bank of England as further proof that the economy is cooling as it considers a cut to interest rates in June. However, the long-term picture was less positive. The CBI polled 137 businesses involved in retail, of which 56 were chains, and found that jobs in the sector were shrinking, with employment declining for the seventh consecutive quarter. The number of people employed in retail is also expected to decline, though more slowly, next month. Retailers said they were less likely to invest now than they were in February, demonstrating pessimism about the future state of the economy. \u201cThe mixed mood from our survey demonstrates just how nascent the economic recovery is,\u201d Paleja said."

Here is a wrap up: Five state education ministers have urged the federal government to properly fund public schools ahead of the budget on Tuesday; Former Prime Minister Scott Morrison has condemned a vote by the Australian government at the United Nations in support of giving a Palestinian delegation more rights; Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers has promised a \u201cbalanced\u201d federal budget that will combat inflation while offering Australians some cost-of-living relief; Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor says the government should follow financial rules laid down by Peter Costello when putting together its budgets; Warragamba Dam is spilling after continuous rain across the Sydney metropolitan area and reports of thunderstorms across northern New South Wales and south- east Queensland; The Greens have called for the government to commit to making childcare free; A tornado has hit Bunbury, about 175km south of Perth, causing millions of dollars in damage and scattering asbestos through the local community. We will be back tomorrow morning with all the latest. Asbestos emergency after tornado hits Bunbury in WA southwest Asbestos scattered over residential streets has prompted a \u201chazmat emergency\u201d response in Western Australia\u2019s southwest, with specialist crews urgently working to contain any possible exposure following a devastating tornado. More than 100 homes were damaged when the tornado ripped off roofs, collapsed walls and sucked up debris into the sky at Bunbury on Friday afternoon. The town\u2019s prison, a sporting centre, other community buildings and infrastructure were badly damaged but no one was seriously injured. Seven homes have so far been declared uninhabitable and seven others were severely affected. That number is expected to rise after crews finish assessing the scale of the damage. Residents living in three blocks have been told to stay away from their homes due to asbestos contamination fears near the Hay Park sports complex. WA Premier Roger Cook says there is \u201ca lot of asbestos in the streets\u201d. We\u2019ve got specialist teams on the ground trying to clean that up but there are exclusion zones which ensures that we can secure the public\u2019s safety. Authorities are now turning their attention to recovery, Department of Fire and Emergency Services Acting Commissioner Melissa Pexton says. Specialist contractors have been hired to sweep affected streets to reduce the size of the exclusion zone. We are hopeful that in the next two to three days we will have that finalised and we\u2019re very comfortable with the progress that\u2019s being made; we\u2019ll definitely keep the community up to date. Nine people are booked into emergency accommodation and Bunbury locals will gather at a community meeting on Sunday afternoon to discuss what other services are needed. - AAP Elective surgery target slashed by Victorian government A key target for 240,000 Victorians to go under the knife for elective surgery each year is no more, with the state government quietly moving the goal-posts. In 2022, the Andrews Labor government boldly set itself a target to carry out 240,000 elective surgeries a year by 2024, as part of a $1.5bn Covid catch-up plan. But buried in Tuesday\u2019s budget papers, was a new, lower target of 200,000 for 2024/25 after failing to reach the earlier target in 2023/24. The budget attributed the shortfall to continued demandfor health services post-pandemic. In November, the state\u2019s health Minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, told ABC Radio Melbourne the government would not stop until it hit the ambitious target, saying she couldn\u2019t accept anything less on behalf of Victorians. We\u2019re going to hit it. We will come very close ... and if we don\u2019t achieve that target we\u2019ll keep working until we do. Thomas told reporters on Sunday that the government had changed the target because of staff shortages within the health system. We\u2019re still not able to access the workforce that we need. We\u2019re in a global war for talent when it comes to getting healthcare workers. The opposition health spokeswoman, Georgie Crozier, says the government has broken a promise, leaving tens of thousands of Victorians to languish in pain waiting for vital surgery. Whether it\u2019s elective surgery, building hospitals like at Arden Street or the 10 community hospitals that they promised two elections ago, this government is full of broken promises and as a result it\u2019s Victorians who are paying the price. - AAP Proposed laws will tighten Queensland\u2019s assisted reproductive technology regulation Assisted reproductive technology companies will face greater scrutiny and regulation under laws proposed by the Queensland government. The state health service will be able to enter and inspect premises, put conditions on licences and even suspend or cancel non-compliant IVF clinic services, bringing Queensland into line with other states and jurisdictions. A donor conception register is also set to be unveiled in the legislation put forward by Health Minister Shannon Fentiman following recommendations from a parliamentary inquiry. Queensland has fallen behind the rest of Australia in regulating assisted reproductive technology providers, Fentiman says. It\u2019s so important that Queensland Health has the compliance and enforcement powers it needs to make sure that the services these companies are providing are safe,\u201d she told reporters on Sunday. There was really no powers for Queensland Health to be able to enter these premises, inspect these premises, make sure that these providers were doing the right thing by families. This legislation now will give Queensland Health those powers that most other states already have. The $2m donor conception register will allow donor-conceived people to access genetic and medical information from the past 50 years. Counselling will be offered to those using the register as part of its implementation. - AAP Australians need more cost-of-living relief, higher wages, ACTU president says ACTU President Michele O\u2019Neil has called for the government to prioritise cost-of-living relief and support for continued wage growth. Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s budget, O\u2019Neil says Australians have dealt with 10 years of weak nominal wage growth, while real wages stagnated under the previous 10 years of a Coalition government. But she says that had changed under the new government. Australians suffered historic low wage growth under the Coalition government, and it remains the economic and ideological position of the Dutton Coalition to drive down workers wages as [an] answer to economic growth. Wage growth has finally turned around as a result of decisions made by the Albanese government, and we expect the 2024 budget to continue to deliver on the economic conditions that support higher wages. The government has made good steps in addressing the cost-of-living, with workers seeing improvements in bargaining rights, support for increases in the minimum wage, and a pay rise for aged care workers. Particularly important is the cost-of-living tax bonus from 1 July for workers who need it the most, as well as last year\u2019s energy bill relief, which took pressure off household budgets. Woman suffers serious spinal injury at Australian band Trophy Eyes\u2019 New York gig A woman has been left partially paralysed after the lead singer of Newcastle post-punk bank Trophy Eyes attempted to crowd surf during a show in New York. Local news organisation WGRZ reported that Bird Piche, 24, attended a show by Trophy Eyes at Mohawk Place in Buffalo last week. Video of the incident later posted to the band\u2019s Reddit page shows the moment where frontman, John Floreani, jumps from the stage during a crowdsurf. Floreani, however, appears to land on Piche\u2019s head as others lift the singer. Those who claimed to be at the concert posted in the Reddit thread that people thought the women had fainted but when she didn\u2019t get back up, the show stopped and people, including Floreani, rushed to help her. She was taken to a hospital emergency room. She is thought to be in a stable condition with a severe spinal cord injury, although she still has use of her arms and is able to communicate through text messages. Stores up in smoke following suspected tobacco war attacks Victoria\u2019s tobacco wars show no signs of abating, with two stores in Melbourne\u2019s north-west suffering extensive fire damage after suspected targeted attacks. Two tobacconists have been torched in more suspected fire bombings linked to ongoing tobacco wars in Victoria. The stores at Hadfield and Gladstone Park in Melbourne\u2019s north-west caught alight within the space of 45 minutes on Sunday morning. Nobody was inside either store at the time and both stores suffered significant damage. A burned-out ute remained in front of the Gladstone Park store on Sunday morning, while an SUV with major fire damage to its front was outside the Hadfield shop. No arrests have been made for the suspected arsons. Investigators are treating the fires as targeted attacks and will look at any possible links to other recent fires. Victoria police set up Taskforce Lunar in 2023 to investigate the firebombing of dozens of shop fronts and other venues in an ongoing battle for control of the state\u2019s tobacco market. In April, assistant commissioner Martin O\u2019Brien told a parliamentary inquiry that youths recruited into the illegal tobacco and vape wars were being paid as little as $500 to commit arson attacks. O\u2019Brien says gangs have stepped into the market as the cost of legal tobacco products soars, shipping in illegal tobacco and vapes from China and Arab nations. The Victorian government has committed to establishing a tobacco retailer and wholesale licensing scheme in the second half of 2024. - AAP Australian data expected to show robust wage growth Australian workers have likely logged a robust start to the year for wage growth, even as the jobs market continues to soften around the edges. While the federal budget on Tuesday is likely to dominate the headlines this week, there are a couple of top-shelf data releases due as well. The Australian Bureau of Statistics is scheduled to drop the March quarter wage price index on Wednesday and the April labour force report on Thursday. Wages have been growing strongly due to a tight labour market and robust public sector pay decisions, lifting 0.9% in the December quarter, and 4.2% for the year. For March, Westpac economists had a 0.9% quarterly rise pencilled in, keeping the annual pace flat at 4.2%. The April jobs data from the statistics bureau will follow March\u2019s unemployment rate ticking higher to 3.8%, from 3.7% in February. Australia\u2019s labour market has proved resilient in a slowing economy, although there are signs it is softening, with job vacancies increasing and the underemployment rate edging up. The National Australia Bank business survey for April will be released on Monday, which will show how the private sector is coping. There\u2019s also a speech expected from Reserve Bank of Australia chief economist Sarah Hunter on Thursday, which will follow the central bank\u2019s decision to keep interest rates on hold at 4.35% in May. Local investors will assess modest gains on Wall Street on Friday as investors digested the Federal Reserve\u2019s comments about monetary policy and eyed upcoming inflation data. - AAP \u2018Exemplar\u2019 solutions to housing crisis being blocked by councils, resident groups When a group of Melburnians banded together with a plan to build their dream homes, they did not envision the barriers they would face from local council. The proposed development of 21 townhouses overlooking a creek in Eltham, on Melbourne\u2019s fringe, promised environmentally-conscious design, plenty of shared space and respect for heritage and the local neighbourhood. According to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, it is the type of project that \u201ccould and should have been supported and fast-tracked\u201d, an \u201cexemplar of an innovative approach\u201d to dealing with the state\u2019s housing crisis. Instead, the Brougham Street co-housing project has been \u201cmet with substantial delays and opposition\u201d from the local Nillumbik Shire council and residents group, in what Vcat says is a growing issue across the state. \u201c[It] is part of a wider trend we are observing, that will fail to produce appropriate housing projects that can start to address the existing shortfall of housing supply presently being experienced across metropolitan Melbourne,\u201d Vcat says. For more on this story read the full report by Guardian Australia Victorian state correspondent Benita Kolovos: Auction activity has remained stable this weekend with 2,168 auctions scheduled. This is just below the 2,202 held last week but a gain on the 1,692 auctions on the corresponding weekend last year. CoreLogic\u2019s found on results collected so far that the preliminary clearance rate was 72.6% across the country, which is lower than the 73.5% preliminary rate recorded last week but well above the 65.9% actual rate on final numbers. Across the capital cities: Sydney: 572 of 753 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 75.9%. Melbourne: 766 of 1066 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 68%. Brisbane: 103 0f 152 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 76.7%. Adelaide: 60 of 115 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 91.7%. Canberra: 35 of 69 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 71.4%. Tasmania: Two auctions to be held. Perth: Eight of 11 auctions held. Thunderstorms forecast for south-east Queensland and northern NSW The wet weather along the east coast is set to continue through Sunday into the evening with thunderstorms forecast for south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales.

Sudanese Australians desperate to reunite with families There are renewed calls for the Australian government to set up a special humanitarian scheme for Sudanese people to be repatriated with families in Australia, similar to those offered to Afghans and Ukrainians. A 48-year-old Sudanese-Australian civil engineer, Ahmed El Tahir, is among those desperate to reunite with his family which has been displaced to Egypt following ongoing violence that Human Rights Watch has described as a genocide. El Tahir says the circumstances his wife and daughter are living under are intolerable. When she (his daughter) hears a chopper or an aeroplane, she starts to hide under the bed. My daughter is an Australian citizen and has her passport. I applied to get my wife here but ... I still haven\u2019t received a humanitarian visa for her. All my thinking is geared towards them. I can\u2019t concentrate the whole time. His seven-year-old daughter had no citizenship papers at the outbreak of the conflict in April 2023 to prove she could be evacuated with other Australian nationals, let alone with her mother who is a Sudanese national. She and her mother had an arduous journey waiting for four months at the border crossing between Sudan and Egypt. El Tahir says the government has not done enough to assist Sudanese people in similar situations. We tried to mention this to (the immigration minister) Andrew Giles. We are Australian and are supposed to be treated the same but when it comes to the Sudanese crisis, nothing has happened. - AAP Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s federal budget, Victorian Greens Senator Steph Hodgins-May has called for free childcare. The senator says making childcare free would provide women with economic security and provide a \u201clifeline\u201d to those seeking to escape violent partners by ensuring their children are safe while they try to find work. She cited research by the Australia Institute that found free childcare would combat inflation by boosting the participation of women in the workforce. In this cost-of-living crisis, early childhood education and care is too expensive and too hard to access. As a result, women are missing out on paid work, they\u2019re being left behind because they can\u2019t afford childcare. For women trying to flee violent partners, free childcare means women aren\u2019t forced to choose between violence and poverty. If we can spend $368bn on submarines, we can spend money on making childcare free for all parents across Australia. Labor must prioritise women\u2019s safety. Childcare is an essential public service, and for children the early years are the most important in their development. It removes barriers that limit choices for women, boosts women\u2019s capacity to engage in paid work and relieves financial pressures in a cost-of-living crisis. Hodgins-May replaced Greens Senator Janet Rice at the start of May after Rice retired. New scholarship program will train regional nurses to treat endometriosis Endometriosis Australia is partnering with the Australian College of Nurses to launch a scholarship aimed at delivering 100 trained nurses to regional, rural and remote communities across the nation. The scheme, funded by government grants and community donations, will train nurses to treat those living with endometriosis without access to health services available in major cities. Endometriosis is a disease that causes tissue similar to the lining of the uterus to grow in other parts of the body. Its symptoms include period pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, fatigue, pain during sex and reduced fertility. Director and co-founder of Endometriosis Australia, Donna Ciccia, said nurses better understanding the condition could drastically change how patients are treated. Some communities only have nurses - they don\u2019t have any GPs in town, or it might take longer to see a GP or clinic that specialises in endometriosis and pelvic pain. Having a nurse that can dedicate more time so they can understand what\u2019s happening to [patients\u2019] bodies can be life-changing. It\u2019s also just awesome to have someone who [understands] endometriosis, that you don\u2019t need to walk into a clinic and explain what endometriosis is. - AAP Government investment in extra urgent care clinics \u2018misguided\u2019, GPs college says The Royal Australian College of GPs (RACGP) says the government has the wrong priorities on healthcare in its budget. The RACGP\u2019s president, Dr Nicole Higgins, says amajor investment in 29 extra urgent care clinics is a \u201cmisguided investment\u201d when frontline GP services are struggling. There is no substitute for the personalised quality care delivered by a GP who knows you and your history. The urgent care clinics will make some difference, but the government should be boosting investment in general practice care so that no patients anywhere are left behind. There is no greater health need right now than supporting people struggling with their mental health and suffering from chronic conditions. Higgins says the urgent care clinics will \u201ctake years to roll route, create confusion for the public and disrupt care people usually receive from their regular GP\u201d. These clinics are also likely to redirect limited general practice workforce capacity away from regular clinics where they are needed most. Sydney\u2019s Warragamba Dam is spilling over after reaching capacity following heavy downpours across New South Wales. WaterNSW has confirmed the dam began spilling at 7.30am on Sunday following widespread rain across Sydney catchments. The water reservoir last spilled after heavy rain on 6 April, causing catastrophic damage to some homes near the catchment area. The SES has issued minor flood warnings for the Hawkesbury River at North Richmond and the Colo River but does not expect any significant impact to properties in the area. There will possibly be low-lying flooding over roads but we\u2019re not expecting major impacts like there was [during] the last spill. Over the past 24 hours to 9am on Sunday, Sydney had recorded rainfall totals in excess of 30mm at Campbelltown (35.4mm) and Observatory Hill (31.2mm). Heavy rain and significant runoff led to a 10-metre wide sink hole opening in a residential street at Dover Heights in Sydney\u2019s east on Saturday night. NSW SES Waverley-Woollahra Deputy Unit Commander Anthia Kollaras says: We were on scene until 1 o\u2019clock this morning, using sandbags and a retaining wall to divert water away from properties. The hole was quite big, and part of the road had washed away. It was one of 273 incidents SES volunteers attended across the state in the 24 hours to 8am on Sunday. \u2013 AAP Executive Council of Australian Jewry: Australia\u2019s UN vote on Palestine breaks with \u2018like-minded democracies\u2019 The Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-CEO Alex Ryvchin has responded to the Australian government\u2019s vote in favour of a United Nations resolution giving more rights to Palestine: As the government admits, the resolution alters practically nothing. The real obstacles to a two-state solution remain untouched. Hamas has not been eliminated, the Palestinian Authority is still corrupt and undemocratic and still won\u2019t declare that it seeks a state alongside the Jewish national home and not in place of it. Ryvchin says the Australian government has \u201cbroken with like-minded democracies\u201d in casting its vote. Australia voted in the same way as New Zealand, Japan and South Korea. The US voted against the resolution while the UK abstained. Chalmers: \u2018Deploying\u2019 private investment a \u2018massive focus\u2019 of the budget The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, also flagged a bump in spending on Medicare, saying the country needs to train more health workers to meet growing demand. There is a provision in the budget in aged care, early childhood education to make sure that we are paying people in the care economy what they need and deserve. This is also another important reminder that a budget which is primarily about cost of living and A Future Made in Australia [policy] also has really substantial investments in health and the care economy and Medicare, in housing, in universities reform and in skills you do need to train the workers that we\u2019ll need in the care economy. Asked what is its Future Made in Australia policy, Chalmers says the focus is \u201cabout grabbing these fast, industrial and economic opportunities from the fast growth\u201d as the country moves to a net zero economic. What you will see in the budget is a whole combination of levers to turn this opportunity into prosperity, whether it is using the tax system, whether it is using targeted grants, whether it is attracting and absorbing and deploying more private investment \u2013 which is a massive focus of the budget on Tuesday night. There will be a range of different levers and different measures and policies to make sure that we can make our economy an indispensable part of the global push to net zero [carbon emissions]. Chalmers says Australia isn\u2019t trying to compete dollar-for-dollar with bigger economies but it wants the settings right so it can grab opportunities as they arise. Our world is changing and the pace of that change is accelerating; other countries are changing their orthodoxies in order to take full advantage and we need to do that as well. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has kicked off Sunday morning with a media blitz, giving an extended interview to the ABC and appearing on channels Nine and Sky. Speaking to ABC earlier this morning, Chalmers promised a \u201cresponsible\u201d budget that would respond to persistent inflation pressures while offering modest cost-of-living relief. Chalmers is trying to present the budget as a good news story saying \u201cit is a good opportunity to remind people that we have made pretty substantial progress in this inflation fight\u201d as inflation is \u201cless than half of what its peak was in 2022\u201d. There is a really sharp near-term focus on the inflation fight in this budget. It\u2019s the most important thing we can focus on in the near term but we need to remember that we have a growth challenge as well and we will invest in the future. Challenged on the decision to tweak broad-ranging tax cuts instead of winding back or scrapping them, Chalmers said the government\u2019s approaches \u201care bang on for the circumstances that we are confronting\u201d. We found other ways to provide cost-of-living help to those who may be not in the tax system, for example, or people who are under pressure in particular. Taylor evasive on immigration detainee decisions made on Dutton\u2019s watch The back-and-forth continues between the federal government and opposition over former immigration detainees accused of participating in a violent home invasion in Perth, and whose fault it is that they were released into the community without electronic monitoring. The coalition has been hammering the immigration minister, Andrew Giles, because one of the alleged offenders was out on bail and the government-appointed community safety board did not recommend he wear an electronic ankle bracelet. Over the weekend, it\u2019s emerged another of the alleged offenders was released when the Coalition was in government and Peter Dutton was immigration minister. Dutton and his shadow ministers, Dan Tehan in immigration and James Paterson in home affairs, have all called for Giles to take responsibility for the decision in the first case. This morning on the ABC\u2019s Insiders, shadow treasurer Angus Taylor was asked if Peter Dutton will now take responsibility for a decision made on his watch. Taylor didn\u2019t answer directly but pointed the finger back at Labor. This was an illegal arrival under a Labor government that gave this person a protection visa. So there\u2019s a bit of hypocrisy going on here. Expect this issue to get a bit of attention when parliament resumes this week, budget or no budget. Taylor coy on full extent of Coalition\u2019s plans for supermarket sector On the National party\u2019s push to break up Australia\u2019s supermarket duopoly, Angus Taylor says Liberal policy is for a mandatory code for the supermarket sector. Asked again about divestiture powers, Taylor says: We\u2019re working through the issue. Taylor: Coalition\u2019s nuclear position will be \u2018significant change\u2019 in Australia\u2019s energy policy Asked whether he believes nuclear power in Australia will deliver a financial return, Angus Taylor is bullish. We\u2019ll have more to say about nuclear in time but, yes, I do. Taylor has also accused the government of being \u201cmugged by reality\u201d on energy policy saying \u201cwe have collapsing supply in Bass Straight and we need to get more gas out of the ground and into our pipelines\u201d. When will the public get to see the Coalition\u2019s nuclear policy? We have already been moving at a rapid pace towards nuclear, which will be one of the most significant changes in energy policy in this country in a long while. There\u2019s a sense from some in the commentariat that we\u2019re not contrasting with Labor. We\u2019re making serious contrasts with Labor right now as an opposition and they\u2019re important. Nuclear is one of them and gas has been another. Taylor warns \u2018major manufacturers leaving\u2019 Australia Angus Taylor says \u201cwe\u2019re seeing major manufacturers leaving the country\u201d. It is worth bearing in mind that the first act of the Abbott Coalition government in 2016 was to demand General Motors Holden \u201ccome clean\u201d about its plans for the future, which precipitated the collapse of a major manufacturing industry in 2016. He says he has yet to see the detail of the government\u2019s plan to encourage solar panel manufacturing or the plan to buy a Quantum computer. Taylor is also asked whether a Coalition government would subsidise a nuclear power plant. It has to be capable of delivering a commercial return. That\u2019s an important threshold test for any investment. Time to embrace free market, Coalition\u2019s Taylor says The key theme from Angus Taylor this morning is that the government needs to \u201cget back to basics\u201d saying that more housing and more manufacturing require an embrace of the free market. You have to make sure you get your industrial relations right, which ensures that we have productive competitive workplaces, which are good for both employees and employers. You have to make sure government is not getting in the way and you\u2019re getting approvals done. Those there are basics. If you don\u2019t get them right you try to do loads of government spending and it fails. Shadow treasurer says government must \u2018show restraint\u2019 when it comes to spending Angus Taylor is challenged on his budget spending claim, with it being pointed out that Labor\u2019s spending increase is only 1.4% compared with 4.1% under the previous Coalition government. The shadow treasurer says this is \u201cgoing back to Covid-era spending\u201d. It is pointed out to him that it actually refers to spending over the past 30 years. Asked what the Coalition\u2019s proposed spending rule will look like, Taylor says it would involve \u201cstructural budget balance, not windfall surplus\u201d. What we\u2019ve got at the moment is a focus on windfall. Taylor says with Australian households \u201cstruggling with their budgets\u201d, it\u2019s now \u201ctime for the Australian government to show restraint\u201d. The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor says the government should be cautious about its spending or risk \u201canother flop\u201d in its 2024 budget. Taylor says the government should \u201cre-establish the fiscal rules that Peter Costello put in place back in the 1990s to have a structural budget balance. The shadow treasurer accused the government of $209bn in additional spending since it came to power. \u201cThat\u2019s over $20,000 for every Australian household. I bet there\u2019s not many Australian households out there listening to this who feel as though they\u2019ve got that benefit. That\u2019s what they\u2019ve done.\u201d Challenging on this figure, Taylor says \u201cit\u2019s in the budget papers\u201d. Part of this figure includes automatic increases in Jobseeker and rent assistance, which the Coalition has supported. And the winner is \u2026 The 2024 Eurovision song contest has been decided with Switzerland\u2019s Nemo taking out the competition. It is the third time Switzerland has won, with the previous win taking place in 1988 when Celine Dion performed Ne partez pas sans moi. Australia failed to make it through to the final after Electric Fields was eliminated but an Australian representing Cyprus, Silia Kapsis, did make it through and wowed with her final performance. For more, check out the Guardian\u2019s Eurovision live blog: The education ministers of five states have urged the Albanese government to fairly fund public schools in Tuesday\u2019s federal budget. The ministers for South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland joined the Australian Education Union and principals\u2019 associations to call for the federal government to bring the School Resourcing Standard up to 100%. The Gonski 2.0 education reforms require states to fund 75% of the standard for public schools, with the federal government funding 20%, leaving a funding gap. The education ministers say fair funding would lead to billions more flowing to schools that need it. Only in the ACT are public schools funded to the full standard. The NSW minister Prue Car said: State governments are facing unprecedented pressure as our public schools do the heavy lifting when it comes to educating growing populations, and supporting students with increasingly complex needs. The Victorian minister Ben Carroll said: Federal Labor changed the course of education funding with the Gonski Review, the biggest reforms in 40 years. Today, we have a collective opportunity to change course after the inequities delivered by the federal Coalition to the school system. We stand ready to work with the commonwealth government to deliver fair and full funding to government schools. The Australian Government Primary Principals Association President Pat Murphy said: When it comes to education there is no bigger elephant in the room than why government school students are not funded at 100% of the Schooling Resource Standard. Since 2012 when the Gonski report identified the minimum funding a student should receive, we see only 3% of public school students in Australia receiving this minimum standard. The federal education minister, Jason Clare, has struck deals with the NT and Western Australia \u2013 who did not sign onto the call on Sunday \u2013 and has said as part of negotiations with the other states that he wants the extra funding tied to reporting obligations on the states. The shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor is speaking to ABC Insiders host David Speers this morning. Earlier the treasurer Jim Chalmers spoke to Sky after the shadow finance minister Jane Hume was interviewed. We will bring you the highlights from those interviews across the morning. Scott Morrison has described Australia\u2019s vote in support of a United Nations motion to give additional rights to Palestine as the \u201cmost hostile act of an Australian government to the state of Israel in our history\u201d. The former prime minister said Palestine was \u201ccurrently governed by terrorists\u201d and that any recognition \u201cmust only occur where there is an agreement and when Palestine can be a functional state\u201d. Labor backbencher Josh Burns, who supports a two-state solution, said on Instagram that Australia should have abstained from the vote while Hamas remained in power in the Gaza Strip. An abstention would have signalled we\u2019re open to further recognition, but that we acknowledge the short-term hurdles that need to be overcome in order to achieve lasting piece. Anti-Semitism is on the rise in Australia and this decision will make Jewish Australians feel even more isolated as they remain gravely concerned for hostages in Gaza. The foreign minister Penny Wong has defended the move, saying Australia\u2019s vote is \u201cthe opposite of what Hamas wants\u201d. Australia was among 143 UN general assembly members to pass the resolution calling on the security council to reconsider granting full membership to Palestine. The resolution was significantly watered down in last-minute negotiations. For more on this story, read the full report below: And welcome to another Sunday Guardian live blog. Education ministers from five Australian states have urged the Albanese government to fairly fund public schools ahead of Tuesday\u2019s federal budget. Ministers from South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland joined with the Australian Education Union and principals\u2019 associations asking federal Labor to fully fund public schools. The Labor MP Josh Burns and the former prime minister Scorr Morrison have been two of the more vocal critics after Australia voted in support of a United Nations vote on Palestinian membership. The foreign minister Penny Wong said supporting the draft resolution was not about recognising Palestine as a state. I\u2019m Royce Kurmelovs and I\u2019ll be taking the blog through the day.

            "date": "2024-05-22T08:12:09Z",
            "content": "The annual inflation rate fell sharply in April. Prices are rising more slowly than at any time in almost three years. Inflation is lower in the UK than it is in the EU. Even so, the latest bulletin on the cost of living from the Office for National Statistics was mildly disappointing. April\u2019s inflation figure was always going to be good, with a sharp fall guaranteed by the fact the energy price increases of a year earlier were not repeated. But at 2.3%, the number was slightly higher than expected. The consensus among economists polled by Reuters was 2.1%. Some had even predicted it would drop below the government\u2019s 2% target. The main reason for the fall from 3.2% in March was the continuing downward trend in household energy bills. According to the ONS, prices of electricity, gas and other fuels were 27.1% lower this April than in April 2023, the sharpest decline since records began in 1989. Food price inflation was also down \u2013 from 4% to 2.8%. These developments are helpful for poorer households, which spend a bigger share of their income on heating, lighting and putting food on the table. But there was also some less good news. Core inflation \u2013 which strips out food, energy, tobacco and alcoholic drinks \u2013 fell from 4.2% to 3.9%, rather than the 3.6% expected. Even more worryingly, inflation in the services sector \u2013 which is closely monitored by Bank of England interest rate setters \u2013 barely budged, falling from 6% to 5.9%. One reason for that appears to be that businesses passed on at least some of the higher costs from the higher national living wage, which went up from \u00a310.42 to \u00a311.44 last month, to their customers. Inflation in the hotels and restaurants sector \u2013 parts of the economy with a heavy concentration of minimum-wage workers \u2013 rose last month from 5.8% to 6%. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee will be paying a lot more attention to services inflation than they will to the headline 2.3% figure because it thinks it is a reasonable guide to price pressures generated by the domestic UK economy. Rob Wood, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said there were plenty of examples of sticky service inflation: accommodation, water bills, air fares, catering, and recreation and cultural services all experienced hefty price increases last month. \u201cUpside surprises elsewhere were widespread, not focused in a few erratic components,\u201d he said. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at Capital Economics, had been predicting a much bigger fall to 5.2% in services inflation in April, and says the much smaller decrease will affect the timing of cuts in official borrowing costs. \u201cEven though there is still a wages and an inflation release to go before the Bank of England meeting on 20 June, it feels as though a cut then now seems very unlikely. Even a cut in August is looking a bit more doubtful,\u201d he said."

            "content": "Inflation across the US eased slightly last month as concerns about the cost of living loomed over the battle between Joe Biden and Donald Trump for the White House. The closely watched consumer price index (CPI) rose at an annual rate of 3.4% in April, down from an annual pace of 3.5% the previous month. The White House released a low-key statement after the figures were released. \u201cFighting inflation and lowering costs is my top economic priority,\u201d said Biden. \u201cI know many families are struggling, and that even though we\u2019ve made progress we have a lot more to do.\u201d Policymakers have been surprised by stubborn price growth, which they hope to bring down to 2%. The Federal Reserve has pushed interest rates to a two-decade high to tamp down inflation and had been expected to start cutting them this year. But price gains have remained higher than the central bank\u2019s target and hopes of a rate cut have faded. \u201cWe did not expect this to be a smooth road,\u201d Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, said before the news on Tuesday, \u201cbut these [inflation readings] were higher than I think anybody expected.\u201d The \u201ccore\u201d CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.3% in April, down from 0.4% in the previous three months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The annual rate of core CPI was 3.6% in April, its lowest rate since April 2021. Rising housing and fuel costs were the two biggest factors behind April\u2019s price increases. \u201cThe index for shelter rose in April, as did the index for gasoline. Combined, these two indexes contributed over 70% of the monthly increase in the index for all items,\u201d the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. Food prices were flat and egg prices dropped sharply \u2013 7.3% \u2013 over the month. \u201cWhile on the surface it is positive to see inflation fall from the previous month, looking at the trend over the past 12 months provides a different picture. Inflation has been bouncing around the 3%-4% range for a considerable period of time now, and this is now arguably singlehandedly preventing the Federal Reserve from pushing the button on rate cuts,\u201d said Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors. Inflation has fallen sharply since peaking at 9.1% \u2013 its highest level in a generation \u2013 almost two years ago. But the pressure exerted by elevated prices on household budgets nationwide has become a key flashpoint in the run-up to November\u2019s presidential election, with a string of polls indicating that the economy is a top issue for voters. Biden has hit back at polls that suggest many Americans question his handling of the economy, labeling them as \u201cwrong\u201d last week. \u201cWe\u2019ve already turned it around,\u201d he told CNN. In the interview, Biden also pointed to the robust growth of the US labor market, which has added hundreds of thousands of jobs this year. Trump is, nevertheless, seeking to cast Biden as \u201cthe destroyer of America\u2019s jobs\u201d, claiming the president\u2019s policies have fueled \u201crunaway\u201d inflation."

            "title": "UK has moved out of recession, official figures show ",
            "date": "2024-05-10T14:51:00Z",
            "content": "The UK is officially out of recession after figures showed the economy grew by 0.6% in the first three months of the year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the period from January to the end of March marked a return to growth after a mild recession in the second half of 2023. It was the strongest rate of quarterly growth since the end of 2021, and a better performance than expected by economists, who forecast growth of 0.4% in the first quarter. The downturn came to an end after an increase in activity across the services sector, which has flourished since the turn of the year as wages have outstripped inflation, easing pressure on consumers. However, forecasters expect the UK to grow slowly this year as high interest rates and last year\u2019s inflation surge continue to take their toll on disposable incomes. The Bank of England has predicted that a lack of momentum in the economy means gross domestic product (GDP) will grow by only 0.5% this year. The Bank kept interest rates unchanged at 5.25% on Thursday but indicated it may begin cutting them from June. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cThere is no doubt it has been a difficult few years, but today\u2019s growth figures are proof that the economy is returning to full health for the first time since the pandemic.\u201d Speaking after a trip with Hunt to a Siemens factory near Oxford, Rishi Sunak said it would take time for people to \u201creally feel better\u201d. \u201cOf course there\u2019s more work to do,\u201d said the prime minister. \u201cAnd I get that. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m keen to stick to our plan and keep delivering for people. But I think today\u2019s figures show that we now have momentum.\u201d Hunt said the UK had the best outlook among European G7 countries over the next six years, \u201cwith wages growing faster than inflation, energy prices falling and tax cuts worth \u00a3900 to the average worker hitting bank accounts\u201d. However, apart from Germany, other eurozone countries avoided a recession last year. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said last week that the UK would be the worst performing economy in the G7 next year, as high interest rates and the lingering effects of last year\u2019s surge in inflation drag on growth. Responding to the first-quarter GDP numbers, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said it was a case of going \u201cfrom no growth to low growth\u201d. She said: \u201cThis is no time for Conservative ministers to be doing a victory lap and telling the British people that they have never had it so good. The economy is still \u00a3300 smaller per person than when Rishi Sunak became prime minister.\u201d The ONS said consumer spending and business investment recovered in the first quarter after declines across the second half of 2023. An increase in transport and storage services was the biggest driver of the 0.7% increase in the services sector. The boom in private healthcare and renewed activity in the NHS after a series of strikes last year were among the other factors pushing up services sector growth. Construction activity fell in response to a decline in housebuilding, while the manufacturing sector benefited from a recovery in car production. Textile factory output fell by 3.6% to register the sixth consecutive quarter fall. Energy production increased between January and March. However, the ONS said growth in this sector and manufacturing was partly offset by a fall of 2.4% in the output of activities associated with the big water companies, including sewage and waste management. Ruth Gregory, an economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the increase in GDP showed the economy had been recovering from last year\u2019s contraction with more strength and momentum than was previously understood. But she doubted the increase in GDP would prevent the Bank of England from making its first interest rate cut in the summer. \u201cAt this stage we doubt the recovery will be strong enough to prevent inflation from falling further and the Bank from cutting rates to 3% next year,\u201d she said. GDP per head is estimated to have increased by 0.4% in the first quarter of 2024, after seven consecutive quarters without positive growth. It is estimated, based on ONS projections of the UK\u2019s rising population, that GDP per head is 0.7% lower compared with the same quarter a year ago."

            "date": "2024-05-22T09:00:07Z",
            "content": "Nearly three in five Americans wrongly believe the US is in an economic recession, and the majority blame the Biden administration, according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. The survey found persistent pessimism about the economy as election day draws closer. The poll highlighted many misconceptions people have about the economy, including: 55% believe the economy is shrinking, and 56% think the US is experiencing a recession, though the broadest measure of the economy, gross domestic product (GDP), has been growing. 49% believe the S&amp;P 500 stock market index is down for the year, though the index went up about 24% in 2023 and is up more than 12% this year. 49% believe that unemployment is at a 50-year high, though the unemployment rate has been under 4%, a near 50-year low. Many Americans put the blame on Biden for the state of the economy, with 58% of those polled saying the economy is worsening due to mismanagement from the presidential administration. The poll underscored people\u2019s complicated emotions around inflation. The vast majority of respondents, 72%, indicated they think inflation is increasing. In reality, the rate of inflation has fallen sharply from its post-Covid peak of 9.1% and has been fluctuating between 3% and 4% a year. In April, the inflation rate went down from 3.5% to 3.4% \u2013 far from inflation\u2019s 40-year peak of 9.1% in June 2022 \u2013 triggering a stock market rally that pushed the Dow Jones index to a record high. A recession is generally defined by a decrease in economic activity, typically measured as gross domestic product (GDP), over two successive quarters, although in the US the National Bureau of Economic Research (NEBR) has the final say. US GDP has been rising over the last few years, barring a brief contraction in 2022, which the NEBR did not deem a recession. The only recent recession was in 2020, early in the Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, the US economy has grown considerably. Unemployment has also hit historic lows, wages have been going up and consumer spending has been strong. But the road to recovery has been bumpy, largely because of inflation and the Federal Reserve raising interest rates to tamp down high prices. Despite previously suggesting the Fed could start lowering rates this year, Fed officials have recently indicated interest rates will remain elevated in the near future. While inflation has eased considerably since its peak in 2022, officials continue to say inflation remains high because it remains above the Fed\u2019s target of 2% a year. After a tumultuous ride of inflation and high interest rates, voters are uncertain about what\u2019s next. Consumer confidence fell to a six-month low in May. So even though economic data, like GDP, implies strength in the economy, there\u2019s a stubborn gap between the reality represented in that data \u2013 what economists use to gauge the economy\u2019s health \u2013 and the emotional reality that underlies how Americans feel about the economy. In the poll, 55% think the economy is only getting worse. Some have called the phenomenon a \u201cvibecession\u201d, a term first coined by the economics writer Kyla Scanlon to describe the widespread pessimism about the economy that defies statistics that show the economy is actually doing OK. While inflation has been down, prices are at a higher level compared with just a few years ago. And prices are still going up, just at a slower pace than at inflation\u2019s peak. Americans are clearly still reeling from price increases. In the poll, 70% of Americans said their biggest economic concern was the cost of living. About the same percentage of people, 68%, said that inflation was top of mind. The poll showed little change in Americans\u2019 economic outlook from a Harris poll conducted for the Guardian on the economy in September 2023. A similar percentage of respondents agreed \u201cit\u2019s difficult to be happy about positive economic news when I feel financially squeezed each month\u201d and that the economy was worse than the media made it out to be. Another thing that hasn\u2019t changed: views on the economy largely depend on which political party people belong to. Republicans were much more likely to report feeling down about the economy than Democrats. The vast majority of Republicans believe that the economy is shrinking, inflation is increasing and the economy is getting worse overall. A significant but smaller percentage of Democrats, less than 40%, believed the same. Unsurprisingly, more Republicans than Democrats believe the economy is worsening due to the mismanagement of the Biden administration. Something both Republicans and Democrats agree on: they don\u2019t know who to trust when it comes to learning about the economy. In both September and May, a majority of respondents \u2013 more than 60% \u2013 indicated skepticism over economic news. The economy continues to present a major challenge to Joe Biden in his re-election bid. Though he has tried to tout \u201cBidenomics\u201d, or his domestic economy record, including his $1.2tn bipartisan infrastructure bill from 2022, 70% of Republicans and 39% of Democrats seem to think he\u2019s making the economy worse. But it\u2019s not all bad news for Biden. Republican voters were slightly more optimistic about the lasting impacts of \u201cBidenomics\u201d than they were in the September Harris poll. Four in 10 Republicans, an 11 percentage-point increase from September, indicated they believe Bidenomics will have a positive lasting impact, while 81% of Democrats said the same. And three-quarters of everyone polled said they support at least one of the key pillars of Bidenomics, which include investments in infrastructure, hi-tech electronics manufacturing, clean-energy facilities and more union jobs. Yet even with these small strands of approval, pessimism about the overall economy is pervasive. It will be an uphill battle for Biden to convince voters to be more hopeful. \u201cWhat Americans are saying in this data is: \u2018Economists may say things are getting better, but we\u2019re not feeling it where I live,\u2019\u201d said John Gerzema, CEO of the Harris Poll. \u201cUnwinding four years of uncertainty takes time. Leaders have to understand this and bring the public along.\u201d"

            "title": "FTSE 100 hits new closing high after UK economy escapes recession with fastest growth since 2021 \u2013 as it happened",
            "date": "2024-05-10T16:03:45Z",
            "content": "A late update: The FTSE 100 share index has finished the day at a new alltime high of 8433 points. That\u2019s a gain of 52 points, or 0.6%, and means the blue-chip share index has racked up its third weekly gain in a row. It\u2019s been on quite the rally since mid-April. Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cIt\u2019s Friday afternoon, the sun\u2019s out, and the FTSE 100 has closed at an all-time high \u2013 no this is not a dream. Investors are finally starting to look at UK businesses and see reasons to be optimistic. The Bank of England held rates steady earlier in the week but hinted at rate cuts to come. Meanwhile, economic growth came in better than expected, but crucially not too much better to drive up fears it could cause inflation to spike. This comes on the cusp of major UK banks reporting over the past couple of weeks, and there was a huge array of optimism from management teams around the outlook for the UK. Many will look at this run and assume it has no legs, UK investors have been beaten down too many times in the past. UK bulls will argue it\u2019s been long overdue, with the market suffering from a hefty valuation discount to global peers for some time. Next week\u2019s jobs and wages data will be key for momentum, markets will want to see continued signs that stickier elements of inflation are easing, or it\u2019ll raise fresh questions about if and when rate cuts might come.\u201d Time to recap\u2026. The UK is officially out of recession after figures showed the economy grew by 0.6% in the first three months of the year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the period from January to the end of March marked a return to growth after a mild recession in the second half of 2023. It was the strongest rate of quarterly growth since the end of 2021, and a better performance than expected by economists, who forecast growth of 0.4% in the first quarter. The downturn came to an end after an increase in activity across the services sector, which has flourished since the turn of the year as wages have outstripped inflation, easing the pressure on consumers. However, forecasters expect the UK to grow slowly this year as high interest rates and last year\u2019s inflation surge continue to take their toll on disposable incomes. The Bank of England has predicted that a lack of momentum in the economy means gross domestic product (GDP) will grow by only 0.5% this year. The Bank kept interest rates unchanged at 5.25% on Thursday but indicated it may begin cutting them from June. Economists broadly hailed the pick-up in growth, which suggests the UK economy may do better this year than expected. Here\u2019s the full story: And our analysis: Optimism over economic prospects, and hopes that interest rates will soon be cut, helped to push the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 to a new intraday high of 8455 points today \u2013 on track for another strong week. And in other news: Deutsche Bank has lifted its forecast for UK growth this year, saying: We now expect UK GDP to expand by 0.8% (previously: 0.5%), converging with the OBR\u2019s central projection, but sitting some way above consensus (0.3%) and the Bank of England\u2019s now slightly stale growth forecast (0.5%). We maintain our GDP growth projections for 2025 and 2026 at 1.5% and 1.6%, respectively (Figure 10). Over in the City of London today, Standard Chartered has been accused of being complicit in environmental destruction by environmental activists, at its annual general meeting. A group called the Climate Choir Movement sang a tune called \u201cFossil Fuels are Trouble\u201d, a reworking of Taylor Swift\u2019s hit \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble\u201d They say Standard Chartered is complicit in environment destruction and human rights violations in the Philippines and Mozambique. Here\u2019s a clip from the AGM: Jo Flanagan, co-founder of the Climate Choir Movement, says: \u201cLast year we sang at Barclays AGM. In March we occupied and sang in the Houses of Parliament. And today we say to Standard Chartered \u2018your standards are twisted\u2019. While they continue to invest in dirty gas and coal, global warming has exceeded temperatures of 1.5 degrees Celsius over a 12-month period. This is a dire warning to humanity \u2014 a warning that some bankers still do not seem to heed.\u201d Luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has reported its highest ever yearly sales and its biggest profit in nearly a decade. In a sign that JLR\u2019s customers are not cutting back, the auro maker has reported \u00a329bn revenues in the year to March, over a quarter higher than the previous year. This was driven by record sales of its Range Rover vehicles. Around 133,000 vehicles had been ordered at the end of the financial year, three quarters of which were for Range Rover, Range Rover Sport and Defender models. The group\u2019s pre-tax profit hit \u00a32.2bn, the highest amount since 2015, it said. Customers clearly weren\u2019t put off by a wave of thefts of Range Rovers, which has pushed up the cost of insuring the cars. Inded, JLR reports that there is strong interest in its Range Rover Electric, with over 28,700 sign ups to the waiting list since opening in December 2023. With less than 90 minutes trading to do, the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 share index is on track to post its second-best week of the year. It\u2019s gained around 2.8% this week, rising to a new alltime high of 8,455 points today, its best weekly gain since a fortnight ago. George Lagarias, chief economist at Mazars, sees plenty of positive signs from UK large caps (companies with a high market capitalisation), saying: For one, the rally was broad-based, with only a handful of stocks underperforming. Even more important, the outperformers centred largely around the consumer discretionary sector. Following this morning\u2019s positive Q1 GDP print, on the back of a strong services sector, the stock market seems even more confident that British consumers will manage to bring the UK economy back towards trend growth.\u201d Today\u2019s UK GDP report shows that the economy is \u201cfinally catchig up a bit\u201d, says Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank. Schmieding explains: After years of self-inflicted Brexit turmoil, the UK economy can \u2013 from a somewhat depressed level \u2013 expand at a pace at least in line with that of its biggest trading partner, the Eurozone. The solid gain in GDP reduces the need for an immediate rate cut. Schmieding adds that the UK economy has underperformed the US and the Eurozone since the start of the pandemic, telling clients: The slump in 2020 was deeper and the subsequent recovery levelled off in 2022 even more so than in the Eurozone in the wake of the surge in energy and food prices. The strong Q1 GDP data partly correct an unexpectedly weak finish to 2023 Richard Walker, the executive chairman of Iceland Foods, says it is \u201cimmeasurably wrong\u201d of the government to tell people to be grateful the recession is over. Speaking to Radio 4\u2019s The World At One, Walker explains that consumers are still suffering from the cost of living squeeze, even though the economy is growing. Walker \u2013 who quit the Conservatives last October \u2013 says: My customers are still paying the price of the Truss calamity. Inflation is still baked in and day-to-day living expenses are still very much affected. We\u2019ve had years of price rises now, and people do feel worse off, because they are. Walker adds that Iceland recently conducted a survey of 4,000 customers \u2013 it found that 94% said conditions are not getting any better. Many cited sub-par public services and unaffortable childcare. He adds: I think it\u2019s immeasurably wrong of the government to tell people to feel grateful that we\u2019ve exited recession. Rishi Sunak has insisted that \u201cthings are starting to feel better\u201d and that confidence in the economy is growing after the UK economy moved out of recession, PA Media report. On a visit to Siemens Healthineers factory in Eynsham, Oxfordshire, Sunak claimed that the Government\u2019s economic plan was working. Sunak told Siemens workers: \u201cAfter undoubtedly a difficult couple of years that the country has had, actually now things are starting to feel better. \u201cConfidence is returning to the economy and the country, and I hope that you\u2019re starting to feel that too.\u201d Sunak, and chancellor Jeremy Hunt, were shown Siemans machines at the factory and given a demonstration of the magnet technology being developed at Eynsham. The UK economy is likely to keep growing at a decent pace during the current quarter, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). They are predicting GDP will rise by 0.6% in April-June, matching the forecast-beating 0.6% expansion reported in January-March this morning. NIESR say: The fact that the UK\u2019s GDP growth transitioned into positive territory after experiencing the shallow recession in the second half of 2023 is encouraging. However, the UK economy has largely flatlined following the initial stages of post-pandemic recovery. To escape the low-growth trend into a new and sustained era of high output growth requires structural changes and public investment. We expect that monthly GDP will continue its momentum in April, growing by 0.1 per cent relative to March, driven by growth mainly in services and production, particularly Agriculture. Indeed, the S&amp;P Global/CIPS UK services PMI reported an optimistic balance of 55.0 in April up from 53.1 in March. In line with this positive sentiment, we now forecast GDP to grow by 0.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2024, mainly driven by services sectors. The European Central Bank is poised to start cutting its key interest rates next month, the record of their last meeting show. The minutes of the ECB\u2019s April meeting, where it left borrowing costs on hold, have been released \u2013 and show that policymakers were more confident that the \u201cdisinflationary process\u201d was continuing. This indicates that the ECB\u2019s governing council could vote for a rate cut next month, if new economic forecasts suggest inflation is indeed falling. The minute say: Members concurred that the most recent information had broadly confirmed the March staff projections, thus increasing their confidence that the disinflationary process was continuing At the same time, important new data \u2013 including new staff projections \u2013 would be released ahead of the June meeting, allowing the Governing Council to make a more comprehensive assessment. While progress had been seen, monitoring the triangle between wages, productivity growth and profits continued to be key. It was seen as plausible that the Governing Council would be in a position to start easing monetary policy restriction at the June meeting if additional evidence received by then confirmed the medium-term inflation outlook embedded in the March projections. Huw Pill also declines to say whether he was at the dovish, or hawkish, range of the seven MPC policymakers who voted to hold interest rates at 5.25% this week. Pill says the Monetary Policy Committee contains a healthy range of views, which are expressed fully and richly \u2013 a strength of the UK central bank, he explains. Pill also suggests it won\u2019t be hard to find out where he lies on the hawk-dove range\u2026. [the other six policymakers who voted for no change include governor Andrew Bailey, who was dropping dovish hints yesterday that rates might fall faster than expected. But noted hawks include Catherine Mann and Jonathan Haskel, who earlier this year both wanted to raise rates higher]. BoE chief economist Huw Pill also cautions that the Bank\u2019s medium-term inflation forecasts don\u2019t necessarily give a signal on rate moves at the next meeting (in June) or the one after (in August). Those forecasts suggest inflation will be below target at the end of the Bank\u2019s forecast horizon. Pill also refuses to be lured by a question on the impact of the upcoming UK election. He tells the Bank\u2019s agents that the central bank is independent, and makes its decisions without political influence. It\u2019s forecasts are conditional on the announced policy of the government of the day, he adds. The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Huw Pill, is briefing the Bank\u2019s agents now following yesterday\u2019s interest rate decision. Pill says the Bank has sent a \u201crelatively clear signal\u201d that it is comforted by recent falls in inflation, which do raise the prospect of reducing the amount of restrictive monetary policy in the system. But, if rates are to be cut, there needs to be sufficient evidence that the downward path of inflation is strong enough to justify it, Pill says. Pill explains that he is focused on the underlying components of inflation, not the headline rate \u2013 which dropped to 3.2% per year in March. He also suggests it\u2019s \u201ca little ill-advised\u201d to just focus on the June meeting \u2013 reminding agents that governor Andrew Bailey said yesterday a June rate cut was neither ruled out nor a fait accompli. Will Britain\u2019s strong recovery deter the Bank of England from cutting interest rates? Gabriella Dickens, G7 economist at Axa, thinks not \u2013 and is expecting the first cut next month. Following today\u2019s GDP report, Dickens told clients: More broadly, the recovery was the result of stronger households\u2019 spending amid the recovery in real incomes and stronger demand underpinning a rebound in the manufacturing sector. Momentum is strong, and the composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index remains consistent with growth of around 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in Q2. We have revised up our 2024 GDP forecast to 0.6%, from 0.4%. For now, we think the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee will largely look through the strength in activity, as long as inflation and labour market data evolve as it expects. We continue to forecast the first rate cut in June. The Bank should be focused on inflation, rather than GDP, as it\u2019s mandate is to get CPI to 2% in the medium term. Yesterday, its latest forecasts showed that CPI inflation is on track to fall to 1.6% in three years, based on the current market path of interest rates (suggesting rates may need to fall faster than expected\u2026). The first quarterly expansion in a year. Recession receding into the rear-view mirror. A stronger performance in recent months than the Bank of England and the City had thought likely. Faster growth in early 2024 than any other member of the G7 group of leading industrial nations. When you are in as deep a political hole as the current government you seize on any good news, and there was plenty for Jeremy Hunt to choose from in the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. The figures were proof that the economy was returning to \u201cfull health for the first time since the pandemic\u201d, the chancellor said. Yet when people look back on the early months of 2024 they will probably remember the relentlessly awful weather rather than a time when the economy was cooking with gas. Boom-boom Britain it certainly isn\u2019t. To be sure, the UK has emerged from recession but the downturn in the second half of 2023 was a much more modest affair than some of the monster downturns of the past 50 years. The hollowing out of manufacturing in the early 1980s was a genuine slump, as was the housing market crash in the early 1990s and the near collapse of the banks in the global financial crisis of 2008. The bigger picture is that Britain\u2019s growth performance during the current parliament has been extremely weak\u2026.. More here: City economists are likely to upgrade their forecasts for UK growth during 2024, following this morning\u2019s news of 0.6% growth in January-March. As Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway points out, this is a welcome return to \u2018trend growth\u2019 Simon French of Panmure Gordon predicts this will trigger some growth upgrades: With independent consensus for UK growth of 0.4% in 2024 - we are at 1.2% YoY - then Q1 24 growth of 0.6% means that economist upgrades will [begrudgingly] emerge over the coming days. James Smith of ING suspects growth will only be slightly slower in the April-June quarter: The bottom line is that the economy is entering a brighter period. The timing of the March bounce provides a nice starting point for the second quarter, where growth could easily come in at 0.4% or 0.5%. Professor Costas Milas, of the University of Liverpool, has crunched the data, and tells us: Today\u2019s first estimate of 0.2%, q-on-q4 growth for 2024Q1 is higher than yesterday\u2019s estimate of -0.1% produced by the Bank of England. This will create a momentum effect which is bound to lift next quarter\u2019s growth from q-on-q4 growth of 0% (as estimated by the BoE) to something considerably higher. Whether this momentum effect is able to generate additional inflation remains to be seen. As things stand, it is more likely than not that the Bank\u2019s MPC will keep interest rates on hold in June. Needless to say, things might change until then! The stock market rally in London today has helped to lift the pan-European Stoxx 600 share index to a new alltime high. Hopes of interest rate cuts in the eurozone in June, and a strong earnings season, are both lifting shares. In Paris, the French CAC 40 has also hit a fresh record high this morning too (jumping 0.8% to 8256 points). The broad picture is that the UK economy is entering a period of stronger growth, says ING developed markets economist James Smith: \u201cThe UK economy powered out of its technical recession in the first quarter, judging by the initial GDP figures released today. The economy expanded by a whopping 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. Admittedly the data underlying that number has been pretty volatile. Some caution should be taken when interpreting these figures, just like the weaker numbers at the end of last year. Still, it tallies with other economic indicators which suggest the economy is entering a period of stronger growth. The purchasing managers indices are the most obvious example, and these are consistent with continued momentum in the second quarter. Even here though, there is some debate over whether the numbers are being artificially boosted by \u201cresidual seasonality\u201d (i.e., not properly adjusting for seasonal trends after the pandemic). The 2023 drop in GDP, now consigned to history, is the third UK recession in 16 years. The contraction in the third-and fourth quarter of last year follows the slump in the first half of 2020 during Covid-19 lockdowns, and the contraction from spring 2008 to summer 2009 during the financial crisis. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, says the recent frequency of recessions is a concern. \u201cThe UK swiftly exited its latest recession in 2024 with the strongest economic growth since late 2021. \u201cBut the wider backdrop is still worrying. Britain is falling into recession twice as frequently as it did in the second of the 20th century, and it remains a stagnation nation. These all-too regular shocks and slumps in between are reducing living standards and straining the public finances. \u201cThe battle of ideas on how to change this record should be key during the election campaign.\u201d The odds of the Bank of England cutting interest rates next month have narrowed this morning. The money markets indicate that a June rate cut, to 5%, is now a 48% chance, while there\u2019s a 52% possibility that the BoE holds rates at 5.25%. Yesterday, the decision was almost a coin-toss too, with a 55% chance of no-change in June. On Thursday the BoE left rates on hold, with two policymakers voting for a cut but seven choosing not to ease policy. Derek Halpenny, head of research for global markets at financial group Mitsubishi UFJ, says the BoE is inching toward a June rate cut He told clients: Most of the key guidance comments from [governor Andrew] Bailey and [deputy governor Ben] Broadbent in the press conference and again from Bailey in a Bloomberg TV interview after the press conference were clear in signalling rate cuts are coming. Mostly notable was Bailey\u2019s Comment that the monetary stance would \u201clikely\u201d need to be made less restrictive and \u201cpossibly more so than currently priced into market rates\u201d. That comment really couldn\u2019t be much clearer in signalling where the bias is shifting within the MPC and in our view strengthens the prospect of a June cut. High interest rates are likely to weigh on growth this year, even if we do get the two quarter-point cuts which markets expect. Moody\u2019s Analytics senior economist David Muir explains: \u201cWith inflation moderating, the Bank of England is signalling that a rate cut is on the cards for the summer. But first the Monetary Policy Committee needs further evidence that wage growth and price pressures within services are easing sufficiently. If that evidence builds quickly, a rate cut could come as soon as June, but we think August is the more likely date. That said, even as rates are lowered, they will remain a constraint on the pace of economic growth through this year.\u201d Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is arguing that the UK\u2019s GDP growth shows that the Government\u2019s decisions are paying off. He told Sky News this morning: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that inflation is falling faster and I think people recognise it has been a very, very challenging period but they don\u2019t vote for Conservative governments for us to do popular things, they trust is to do the right thing for the long-term benefit of the economy.\u201d He told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that families who have been through \u201ca really tough time\u201d can see that the \u201cvery difficult decisions\u201d taken to get the economy back on its feet after the pandemic and the energ shock\u201d are working. Hunt also claims that the UK\u2019s longer-term prospects are strong \u2013 citing IMF forecasts for faster growth than France, Italy, Germany or Japan over the next six years. Hunt also disputed that the Conservative\u2019s reputation for economic competence had been crushed by Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget. Hunt, who replaced Kwasi Kwarteng after the markets reacted very badly to the Truss administration\u2019s package of unfunded tax cuts, concedes that mistakes were made, but that he corrected them within weeks. Hunt says: When interest rates and the prices people pay for mortgages have gone up all across the developed world following the energy shock caused by the invasion of Ukraine, it\u2019s just wrong to attribute that to the mini-budget. Hunt also predicted that mortgage rates are likely to start to fall, as inflation drops towards the UK\u2019s 2% target \u2013 which could allow the Bank of England to lower interest rates. Is Hunt right, though, that the mini-budget shouldn\u2019t take the blame for the UK\u2019s mortgage shock? It is true that morgage rates have risen in the US, and in the eurozone, as central banks have tightened monetary policy by raising interest rates. Looking back, the mini-budget triggered a massive selloff in government bonds \u2013 forcing the Bank of England to launch emergency action to halt a run on Britain\u2019s pension funds. More than two-fifths of Britain\u2019s mortgage deals were withdrawn in the week after the mini-budget, as lenders rushed to reprice them, higher. UK mortgage rates did fall in 2023, as the shock of the mini-budget subsided, but have been rising in recent weeks on concerns that interest rates might not be cut as soon as hoped (although the BoE suggested yesterday it could cut faster than expected). So, even if the Truss shock has now dissipated, some unlucky mortage-holders who had to refinance their loan shortly after the mini-budget ended up paying much more\u2026 Britain\u2019s blue-chip share index has soared to another all-time high in early trading in London, amid relief that the UK\u2019s recession is over. The FTSE 100 index has jumped over the 8400 point mark for the first time, hitting a new intraday high of 8425 points \u2013 up 45 points this morning. Mobile network operator Vodafone is the top riser, up 2%, after the UK cabinet office conditionally approved its merger with rival Three (although the competition authorities are yet to give their ruling). Mining companies are also in the top risers, along with luxury goods maker Burberry (+1.7%), airline easyJet (+1.4%) and housebuilder Berkeley (+1.3%) Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says today\u2019s growth report is lifting confidence: The 0.6% growth registered in the first three months of the year was higher than forecast, with the green shoots seen in January and February flowering into a stronger growth spurt in March. Confidence breeds more optimism, and with the economy showing signs of repairing and the FTSE 100 rallying higher, the glass half full sentiment is settling in. The blue-chip index has powered higher in early trade and set fresh records, after a sheen of positivity has descended on the UK. The FTSE 100 has been on a strong rally since mid-April, and is on track for its third weekly rise in a row. It\u2019s gained almost 9% so far this year. Hopes that the economy was strengthening, and that interest rates will be cut this year, have both pushed up share values in London in recent weeks. However, the FTSE 100 isn\u2019t really a barometer of the strength of the UK economy, rather it is an outward-looking index comprising largely of multinational conglomerates. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says: \u201cAfter the FTSE 100 hit a record high for the fourth straight session on Thursday, the UK index has opened higher yet again and is potentially on track to close at another all-time high. Shares in Anglo American are up on a report that Rio Tinto also considered a bid following BHP\u2019s rejected offer. M&amp;A speculation is helping to keep Anglo shares supported at the moment. The UK has grown faster than many of its major rivals at the start of this year, as it emerged from recession. The 0.6% growth recorded in January-March is faster than the US, where GDP rose by 0.4%, Germany (+0.2%), France (+0.2%) or Italy (+0.3%). Out of the remaining G7 nations, Canada is estimated to have also grown by 0.6% in Q1, while economists predict Japan will have grown by 0.2%. Since the pandemic, the UK is one of the slower-growing economies, today\u2019s GDP report shows: Although Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, reports that the UK is in bronze medal position since 2016: Britain\u2019s \u201cliving standards recession\u201d is also, finally, over, after a two year squeeze. Today\u2019s GDP report shows that real GDP per head is estimated to have increased by 0.4% in the first quarter. This measure of GDP per capita divides UK GDP by the total UK population, to get a more accurate view of how living standards are changing. GDP per head had fallen steadily through 2023, and indeed hadn\u2019t grown for seven quarters in a row. Even after rising by 0.4% in January-March, GDP per head is estimated to be 0.7% lower than a year ago. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak says: \u201cThe UK economy has stopped shrinking. But one quarter of decent growth won\u2019t make up for 14 years of lost living standards. The Tories are still presiding over the worst period for economic stagnation and livelihoods in modern history. Real wages are worth less than in 2008 and working people will end this parliament worse off than at the start. Workers would be over \u00a310,000 richer if pay had kept pace with its pre-crisis trend. The Conservatives have succeeded only in making families poorer.\u201d City experts are welcoming the news that Britain\u2019s economy has returned to growth. Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot, hopes that the UK\u2019s economic stagnation will subside this year: \u201cWith interest rate cuts seemingly pencilled in for the summer, the good news continues to flow for the UK as today\u2019s data shows the UK is out of recession. The first quarter saw GDP grow by 0.6%, better than expected, as inflation has eased and the worst of the cost-of-living crisis is behind us. The increase in GDP has primarily been driven by the UK\u2019s strong services sector, which it has come to rely on in recent years to help push the economy forward. \u201cWhile growth remains fairly lacklustre compared to the likes of the US, this data shows this should be the year that economic stagnation subsides in the UK and the economy returns to consistent, if unspectacular, growth. It is the unspectacular nature of the growth, however, that is likely to be focus. While the very shallow and short recession appears over, there is a clamour for interest rate cuts to begin in order to stimulate growth and get business moving again. Markets await the first interest rate cut with bated breath, so it will be interesting to see the economic reaction once those rate cuts begin feeding through. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, believes the worst is over, and that there will be continued growth for the rest of this year. Falling inflation and real pay increases should help repair some of the damage to household incomes and support households\u2019 consumption. Growth prospects have also improved in Europe, which could spur a recovery in exports. \u201cDespite the better near-term outlook, the improvement in GDP growth looks likely to be constrained by the ongoing weakness in productivity growth as well as reduced scope to increase employment levels. This could see annual GDP growth in the region of just 1% per year in the medium term. \u201cUK GDP grew by 0.4% in March, supported by a rise in services output which grew by 0.5%. Forward looking indicators point to further momentum in the coming months, consistent with our view that the worst is behind the UK economy.\u201d But\u2026 Suren Thiru, economics director of ICAEW, says the end of the recesion is a \u201crather hollow victory\u201d, which could encourage the Bank of England to keep interest rates high for longer\u2026 \u201cThese figures confirm an easy exit from the shallowest of recessions for the UK, as lower inflation helped return the economy to growth in the first quarter. The UK\u2019s escape from recession is a rather hollow victory because the big picture remains one of an economy struggling with stagnation, as poor productivity and high economic inactivity limits our growth potential. The economy could struggle to kick on further in the second quarter as the boost to people\u2019s incomes from weaker inflation is partly curtailed by renewed caution to spend and invest, amid higher unemployment and ongoing political uncertainty. The strong exit from recession may inadvertently keep UK interest rates higher for longer by giving those policymakers still worried about underlying inflationary pressures enough comfort on economic conditions to continue putting off cutting rates.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has posted that it\u2019s \u2018time for change\u2019. Following this morning\u2019s GDP report, Reeves says: From no growth to low growth - is that really the scale of the Conservatives\u2019 ambitions? Food prices are still high, families are paying more on their monthly mortgage bills and working people are worse off. Although most of the economy grew in the last quarter, there are some warning lights flashing in the construction sector. Construction output fell by 0.9% in January-March, for the second quarter in a row. That means construction is in recession; output is 0.7% lower than the same quarter a year ago. The fall reflects a decline in new work of 1.8% driven by private commercial new work, which fell by 5.3%. However, repair and maintenance increased 0.3%, which the ONS says may be due to housing associations re-directing their budgets towards repairs and upgrading \u201cto deal with problems such as damp arising from tenants using less heating because of the higher cost of living\u201d. Wet weather this year also dampened construction activity, as the swathe of storms kept workers off building sites. Nicholas Hyett, investment manager at Wealth Club, says: Construction remains the one area of weakness, particularly in the commercial sector. That\u2019s no surprise. Real estate is particularly exposed to the effect of higher interest rates, and the upheaval of the pandemic is still rocking the office and retail sector - with increased home working and online shopping permanently changing demand. That\u2019s not a trend that\u2019s unique to the UK. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has hailed the news that Britain\u2019s recession is over, saying: \u201cThere is no doubt it has been a difficult few years, but today\u2019s growth figures are proof that the economy is returning to full health for the first time since the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re growing this year and have the best outlook among European G7 countries over the next six years, with wages growing faster than inflation, energy prices falling and tax cuts worth \u00a3900 to the average worker hitting bank accounts.\u201d I hate to burst the chancellor\u2019s bubble, but the UK is also expected to be the worst-performing economy in the G7 next year. Still, these forecasts are there to be beaten\u2026. ONS director of economic statistics Liz McKeown has told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the 0.6% growth recorded in the last quarter is stronger than people expected. Compared to recent figures, we last saw growth this strong in the last quarter of 2021, McKeown explains. McKeown pointed to the pick-up in service sector growth, but also pointed out that construction shrank \u2013 due to a decline in new work. McKeown says: \u201cAfter two quarters of contraction, the UK economy returned to positive growth in the first three months of this year. \u201cThere was broad-based strength across the service industries with retail, public transport and haulage, and health all performing well. Car manufacturers also had a good quarter. These were only a little offset by another weak quarter for construction. \u201cIn the month of March the economy grew robustly led, again, by services with wholesalers, the health sector and hospitality all doing well.\u201d Growth in March alone was also stronger than expected. GDP rose by 0.4% in March, the ONS reports, beating City forecasts for 0.1% growth. The services sector had a good month, growing by 0.5% in March, while production output grew by 0.2%. Construction output fell by 0.4% in the month, though. February\u2019s GDP data has been revised higher too, to show growth of 0.2% (up from 0.1% first estimated). Newsflash: The UK\u2019s short, shallow, recession is over. The UK economy grew by 0.6% in the first quarter of this year, the Office for National Statistics has reported. That\u2019s stronger growth than expected. The ONS says the recovery was driven by the services sector, and industry: In output terms, services grew by 0.7% on the quarter with widespread growth across the sector; elsewhere the production sector grew by 0.8% while the construction sector fell by 0.9%. In expenditure terms, there were increases in the volume of net trade, household spending and government spending, partially offset by falls in gross capital formation. This rise in GDP means that the economy is no longer in a technical recession, after activity fell in the third and fourth quarters of last year. GDP is the standard measure of economic activity, but it has its critics too. It tracks what\u2019s happening across the economy, but does not distinguish between harmful and beneficial activity. Back in 1968, US presidential candidate Bobby Kennedy issued a magisterial rebuke, saying GDP \u2018measures everything except that which is worthwhile\u2019. Kennedy told the University of Kansas: It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman\u2019s rifle and Speck\u2019s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. You can hear the speech here; and here: In order to measure GDP, statisticians use three approaches: measuring the total value of goods and services produced; the total amount spent in the economy, and the total amount of income from profits and wages. All three methods should, in theory, give the same number. The Bank of England is confident that the UK recession has ended. Yesterday, the BoE said UK GDP is expected to have risen by 0.4% in the first quarter of this year, explaining: UK GDP growth had strengthened since the start of the year, reversing the fall in output that was estimated to have occurred in the second half of 2023. The [Monetary Policy] Committee expected the recovery in output to be underpinned by a pickup in household consumption, supported by higher real incomes. Good morning. We\u2019re about to discover if Britain\u2019s economy has clambered out of recession. New gross domestic product (GDP) figures for the first three months of this year are released at 7am, and City economists are hopeful that the economy expanded in the quarter. If so, that would mean that the shallow recession that began in the second half of last year has ended. A technical recession, in City jargon, is at least two quarterly falls in GDP in a row. As things stand (and data are often revised\u2026) the UK economy shrank by 0.1% in July-September 2023, and then by 0.3% in October-December as consumer spending slumped, triggering the technical recession declared earlier this year. Analysts are expecting to learn that UK GDP rose by around 0.4% in the January to March quarter, which would consign the recession to history. Recent falls in inflation, and hopes that interest rates will be cut this summer, are supporting the economy. Previous data has shown that GDP rose by 0.1% in February, and 0.3% in January. Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief UK economist, Sanjay Raja, says: The UK economy likely shrugged off the short and marginal technical recession it fell into last year. After contracting by 0.3% q-o-q in Q4-23, we expect the economy to bounce back, expanding by 0.4% q-o-q in Q1-24 with March GDP rising by 0.1% m-o-m. What\u2019s driving the recovery? In short, some positive payback with household spending bouncing back to start the year. Government investment too will have likely supported GDP through the first quarter. And we think some build up in inventories will have also helped push GDP higher in Q1-24. In short, we expect Q1-24 to signal a sustained recovery back to trend growth. Where to now? We expect 2024 GDP to expand by 0.5%. There are some upside risks to our projection, given the continued strength of business activity data.

            "content": "It seems that some people really want a recession. The estimates of inflation not falling below 3% until the end of next year has led some commentators to demand higher rates as though there is an ability to have inflation drop quickly while at the same time delivering the hoped for economic \u201csoft landing\u201d. After the RBA\u2019s decision on Tuesday to keep rates steady, you would be forgiven for thinking that a rate rise is imminent. Other than Peter Hannam, who maintained a level of calm, some media organisations were suggesting rate rises are now much more likely and that there is a sense of doom ahead for inflation. It might therefore be somewhat surprising to be told that the market\u2019s expectations for a rate rise are actually lower now than before the RBA\u2019s decision on Tuesday. A month ago, I suggested that it was unlikely we would see a rate cut soon. Back then the market was still predicting rate cuts this year; now they are not. Cuts are on the horizon, but probably not until next year: If the graph does not display click here This is not what those who believe rates need to rise want to hear. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Judo Bank chief economic adviser Warren Hogan has, for example, called for higher interest rates \u2013 as high as 5.1%. Hogan last year commented on a scenario in which the then newly appointed RBA governor, Michele Bullock, \u201cmust lead the bank in taking the cash rate to a level that will drive Australia into a disruptive recession\u201d. Meanwhile, one academic bizarrely suggested Australians should stop buying things in order to \u201cdrive the nation into a short, sharp recession\u201d. Calling for a short recession for the good of the economy is a bit like calling for a small war to teach another country a lesson. They never end up being small or short and the people calling for them invariably know they will not have to suffer. It\u2019s why the past year has focused around the desire for a \u201csoft landing\u201d. This essentially involves shifting from rising inflation to low, steady inflation without a recession, and without significant rises in unemployment. In essence we want to avoid what happened in the 1990s, when killing inflation involved destroying the economy. Generally, you want to avoid replicating the 1990s experiences, and yet inflation is falling pretty much in line with the pace of the falls during 1990-1992: If the graph does not display click here The 1990s was a stark lesson to anyone thinking we can just fine-tune inflation without having to worry about going too far. One of the oft-forgotten aspects of the 1990s recession is that when inflation was falling the RBA was madly cutting rates in a desperate (and failed) attempt to prevent a recession: If the graph does not display click here Throughout 1990, 1991 and 1992 the real problem wasn\u2019t slowing inflation but trying to stave off a deep recession. It failed. Inflation, rather than reaching 3% and realising \u2013 as though through osmosis \u2013 that it should stabilise, just kept dropping \u2013 hitting 0.3% at the end of 1992. The RBA at this point was cutting rates in the hope of raising inflation because inflation below 2% is hardly the sign of a strong economy (something we experienced from 2014-2019 when the RBA kept cutting rates in an attempt to get the economy going). There has been some commentary that the RBA has never before failed to raise rates when inflation has been this high. The problem with that history is that similarly the RBA has never raised rates before when the economy has been this weak. In November, when the RBA raised rates to 4.35%, GDP per capita fell 1%. Prior to last year, the slowest the economy had grown at a time the RBA raised rates was in June 2010 after the GFC. At that point GDP per capita was growing at 0.6% \u2013 a pace that is historically weak, but which is faster than Australia\u2019s economy has grown for nearly 18 months: If the graph does not display click here And is the economy about to rebound? Well, no. The latest statement on monetary policy issued by the Reserve Bank on Tuesday showed the second lot of downgrades for economic growth since it last raised rates in November: If the graph does not display click here Bullock in her press conference on Tuesday afternoon was also very careful to note that, while we do have historically low unemployment, many people are struggling. This was made clear by the weak retail trade figures released on Tuesday, which showed that the volume of retail trade fell for the fifth quarter out of the past six. If the graph does not display click here And while unemployment remains low, most economists believe wage growth has peaked. Certainly, the average wage growth obtained through enterprise bargaining agreements shows no signs of wages growing faster than last year: If the graph does not display click here We might be experiencing low unemployment and have avoided a recession despite very fast rising interest rates, but households are letting the government and the Reserve Bank know that they are feeling the pain. They are not spending money in a manner that would suggest there is a strong level of demand in the economy. Wages are also not rising at a speed that would suggest we are about to embark on the mythical \u201cwage-price spiral\u201d. Those calling for higher interest rates and for a faster drop in inflation should read about the 1990s recession and not cheer for that experience to be visited upon us again. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

            "content": "Labour\u2019s tanks roll relentlessly across Tory lawns, not pausing a heartbeat to celebrate phenomenal local election results in England. It treated the local polls as a military rehearsal for the general election, with ruthless focus on places that will deliver most seats: that includes the south, as well as the north and Midlands, and the party is heading for Scottish turf too. But the mesmerising ferocity of blue-on-blue abuse is the current news-making drama. Fighting bare-knuckle over post-election ideology, the Tory right are looking forward to an election defeat as long as one of their own isn\u2019t at the helm. Besides, they have Sunak in their grip, while the Mail calls Boris Johnson a \u201ccoiled mamba\u201d waiting \u201cto save the Tories from total annihilation\u201d. Mournful one-nationers echo the losing West Midlands mayor Andy Street\u2019s dignified call for moderation, unheeded. Sunak can stay or go: Labour relishes either equally. Before the winded government finds words that make any sense, Labour is out there pummelling them again. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, delivers a speech on Tuesday to nip any \u201cgreen shoots\u201d talk in the bud, ahead of the week when the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee may signal interest rate cuts soon, and ONS figures show a small rise from recession and April\u2019s inflation figures hitting the 2% target. Reeves is getting in first, pre-empting these results with a torrent of data that may feel far closer to people\u2019s real life experience. \u201cConservatives are gaslighting the British public,\u201d she says. \u201cThey say we\u2019ve turned a corner. But try telling that to the 6.4m households across England and Wales that saw their rent increase or had to re-mortgage in the last 18 months, at an additional \u00a3210 a month. Or the 950,000 families whose mortgage deal is due to expire between now and January.\u201d When Sunak says \u201cthe plan is working\u201d, she can show the UK is set for the slowest growth in the G7. This will be the first parliament \u201cwhere real disposable incomes are going to be lower at the end of it than they were at the beginning\u201d, she says. Had the UK economy grown at the average OECD rate over the past decade, it would be \u00a3140bn larger today: \u201cThe Tory legacy is a Britain that is poorer.\u201d Her litany of woe points to people worse off, with \u201ceconomic growth on the floor\u201d, taxes rising, \u201cyet public services in ever deeper crisis\u201d. She lands blow after blow. \u201cBy the time of the next election, we can, and should, expect interest rates to be cut, Britain to be out of recession and inflation to have returned to the Bank of England\u2019s target,\u201d she says, listing the last threads that Sunak\u2019s government hangs by. But Labour focus groups who are shown ministers\u2019 statements on \u201cfalling inflation\u201d laugh out loud, with people asking: \u201cWhere do they do their shopping?\u201d Told that inflation is falling while they see prices rising \u201cmakes them want to throw their butter at the TV\u201d, one Labour aide says. \u201cExcept it costs too much.\u201d When Reeves says the Tories are gaslighting voters, that\u2019s exactly what they think, when food prices remain 25% higher than two years ago. No \u201crecovery\u201d will bring them back down. People describe the economy as damaged, broken, tanked, even \u201ca pyramid scheme\u201d, their minds firmly made up, as they were in 1997, when living standards were genuinely improving. Average wages will not return to 2008 levels until 2026, says the Resolution Foundation. Telling people they should feel better when they only feel tightened belts and empty purses adds to political cynicism, as Reeves tries to counter the \u201cthey\u2019re all the same\u201d mindset. Households are slashing spending, even on basics, with grocery spending up 16% but buying 8% less in volume. Less is spent on appliances, hairdressing, travel, restaurants and recreation and less on culture \u2013 music venues and theatres attest to that. That squeeze will not be gone by election time. Reeves keeps asking that old question, \u201cDo you and your family feel better off than you did 14 years ago? Do our hospitals, our schools and our police work better than 14 years ago?\u201d No wonder the Tories strive to shift the battleground to Rwanda, trans issues or any \u201cwokery\u201d they can drum up. And they get it wrong: a YouGov survey has found that 59% think the government is taking too little action on climate change. Labour discontents might even be cheered by scares that Starmer is a closet Marxist, as the Telegraph\u2019s Camilla Tominey warns Tory defectors not to give \u201cbirth to a monster\u201d. Pay no attention to his \u201cbanging on about patriotism and the St George flag\u201d, as this \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d is \u201cno cuddly Blairite\u201d. But some may remember how the same red scare on \u201cdemon eyes\u201d Blair back in 1997 failed miserably. As for Reeves, her attacks on the wretched state of living standards turn that vital question back on her: will people feel better under Labour? In her Mais lecture in March, Reeves laid out her \u201csecuronomics\u201d programme, a smaller-scale Bidenomics to kickstart investment for growth. It relies on 1.5m homes to be built after a planning reform \u201cblitz\u201d. Her national wealth fund seeds investment to boost jobs with a \u201cskills revolution\u201d and a \u201cgenuine living wage\u201d. Her green prosperity plan still offers \u00a328bn by the second half of the next parliament, and an increase to the windfall tax on oil and gas. But none of that can quite answer the question. Extreme caution has gained Labour rare public trust on the economy: without that there\u2019s no chance of victory. What Reeves does in office is another matter and Labour will need to be bolder than she can say now. That\u2019s asking the impatient to take it on trust that she can conjure up enough growth to repair public services and restore incomes. But winning always has to come first.

            "date": "2024-05-06T14:50:10Z",
            "content": "As a Joe Biden v Donald Trump rematch looms, much is at stake. From the future of reproductive rights to the chances of meaningful action on climate change, from the strength of US support for Ukraine in its war with Russia, and Israel in its war with Hamas, to the fate of US democracy itself, existential issues are firmly to the fore. Here\u2019s a look at why. Economy \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d So said the Democratic strategist James Carville, in 1992, as an adviser to Bill Clinton. Most Americans thought stewardship of the economy should change: Clinton beat George HW Bush. Under Biden, post-Covid recovery remains on track. Unemployment is low, stocks at all-time highs. That should bode well but the key question is whether Americans think Biden\u2019s economy is strong, or think it is working for them, or think Trump was a safer pair of hands, forgetting the chaos of Covid. According to polling, many do prefer Trump. Cost-of-living concerns dominate. Inflation remains a worry. For Biden, Republican threats to social security and Medicare might offset such worries. For Trump, whose base skews older, such threats must be downplayed \u2013 though they are present in Republicans\u2019 own transition planning. Immigration House Republicans impeached Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden\u2019s secretary of homeland security. The Senate quashed that but at Trump\u2019s direction, Republicans sank a bipartisan border and immigration deal. One day in February, Biden and Trump both went to the southern border. Biden highlighted Republican obstruction but called on Trump to work with him, aiming to show voters which party wants to work on the issue. Since then, Trump has focused on denunciations of Biden and claims of border chaos stoked by sinister forces. Expect such contrasts on loop. Equality Ron DeSantis made attacks on LGBTQ+ rights a hallmark of his attempt to \u201cMake America Florida\u201d. The governor\u2019s failed campaign suggests how well that went down, but Republican efforts to demonize so-called \u201cwoke\u201d ideology should not be discounted. States have introduced anti-trans legislation, book bans and restrictions on LGBTQ+ issues in education. The US supreme court weighed in by ending race-based affirmative action in college admissions. Struggles over immigration, and Republicans\u2019 usual focus on crime, show race-inflected battles will play their usual role, particularly as Trump uses extremist \u201cblood and soil\u201d rhetoric. On the Democratic side, a worrying sign: Black and Hispanic support is less sure than it was. Abortion Democrats are clear: they will focus on Republican attacks on abortion rights, from the Dobbs v Jackson supreme court ruling that struck down Roe v Wade to the mifepristone case, draconian bans and candidates\u2019 support for such measures. It makes tactical sense: The threat to women\u2019s reproductive rights is a rare issue on which Democrats poll very strongly, fueling electoral wins in conservative states. This year\u2019s Alabama IVF ruling, which said embryos should be legally treated as people, showed the potency of such tactics again; from Trump down, Republicans scrambled to deny wanting to end treatment used by millions. Trump must balance boasting about ending Roe, by appointing three justices who voted to strike it down, with trying to avoid blame for attacks on reproductive rights even as his supporters call for, and implement, harsher abortion bans. Expect Biden and Democrats to hit and keep on hitting. Foreign policy For Biden, the Israel-Gaza war presents a fiendish proposition: how to satisfy or merely mollify both the Israel lobby and large sections of his own party, particularly the left and the young \u2013 those more sympathetic to the Palestinians. Spiraling and ongoing campus protests against Israel\u2019s pounding of Gaza show the danger of coming unglued from the base. So do protest votes against Biden in the Democratic primary. Republicans have no such worries: They are simply pro-Israel. Elsewhere, Biden continues to lead a global coalition in support of Ukraine in its fight against Russia, scoring a win at home in April as the Republican speaker of the US House, Mike Johnson, finally oversaw passage of a new aid bill despite fierce opposition from the right of his party. Throw in the lasting effects of the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan (teed up by Trump, fumbled by Biden), questions about what happens if China attacks Taiwan, and the threat Trump poses to Nato, and heavy fire on foreign policy is guaranteed. Democracy Biden is keen to stress the threat to democracy at home. After all, Trump refused to accept the result of the 2020 election, incited the deadly January 6 attack on Congress, is linked to plans to slash the federal government in a second term, and even says he wants to be a \u201cdictator\u201d on day one of re-election. Trump maintains the lie that his 2020 defeat was the result of electoral fraud even as his various criminal cases proceed: 14 of 88 charges concerning election subversion. The other 74 charges concern hush-money payments (34, now on trial in New York) and retention of classified information (40, going slowly in Florida). It should be easy to portray an 88-time indicted potential felon as a threat to constitutional order, particularly given Trump\u2019s clear need to win power as a way of avoiding prison. Accordingly, the issue has been profitable for Biden at the polls. But some doubt its potency. David Axelrod, a close ally of Barack Obama, told the New Yorker: \u201cI\u2019m pretty certain in Scranton [Pennsylvania, Biden\u2019s home town] they\u2019re not sitting around their dinner table talking about democracy every night.\u201d Climate From forest fires to hurricanes and catastrophic floods, it is clear climate change is real. Polling reflects this belief: 70% of Americans \u2013 strikingly, 50% of Republicans included \u2013 want meaningful action. But that isn\u2019t reflected in Republican campaigning. Trump says he doesn\u2019t believe human activity contributes to climate change, nor that climate change is making extreme weather worse, and is opposed to efforts to boost clean energy. Biden\u2019s record on climate may be criticized by campaigners but his record in office places him firmly and clearly against such dangerous views."

            "date": "2024-05-15T05:00:33Z",
            "content": "Ukraine\u2019s war-torn economy faces a renewed threat as Russia\u2019s intensifying war takes its toll on power plants and forces Kyiv to send key workers to the frontline, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has warned. In its latest economic update, the EBRD cut its growth forecasts and said more than two years of fighting in Ukraine was affecting not only the warring countries but also their neighbours. Beata Javorcik, the EBRD\u2019s chief economist, said the war was \u201ccasting a long shadow\u201d as she announced the bank had cut its growth forecast for the regions in which it operates from 3.2% to 3% this year. The EBRD was set up to help rebuild the economies of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe after communism collapsed in the early 1990s, but subsequently expanded to offer support to countries in the Balkans, the Middle East and north Africa. Interviewed by the Guardian after Russia\u2019s offensive towards Ukraine\u2019s second city, Kharkiv, Javorcik said: \u201cThe war has intensified. Mobilising additional men to fight will hit the economy, and the destruction of power generation is something that will have repercussions. The situation is challenging.\u201d Heavy bombing in March and April had cut Ukraine\u2019s electricity production by 40%, with many thermal and hydro plants destroyed, she said. Ukraine\u2019s economy contracted by almost a third in 2022 before rebounding modestly in 2023. The EBRD is expecting it to grow by 3% this year. Javorcik said the good news for Kyiv was that $61bn of US financial aid had covered the gap between government spending and revenue this year and that the Black Sea corridor was open for its exports. \u201cThe authorities have managed to keep the macro economy stable and that\u2019s a big achievement. \u201cThe war is the big unknown. In the initial phase of the war the military fighting took place in an area that generated 60% of Ukraine\u2019s economic activity. Subsequently, the fighting moved to a much smaller area. If the area affected by the fighting goes back to the early days of the war that would take its toll of the economy.\u201d The EBRD has revised up its 2024 growth forecast for Russia this year from 1% to 2.5% but Javorcik said the exodus of foreign firms and skilled workers would eventually be felt. \u201cWhile the short-term outlook for Russia has improved, in the medium term Russia is going to feel the effects of the war. Sanctions and the impact of the brain drain will affect its productivity growth.\u201d The EBRD said the weakness of the German economy, wariness among central banks about cutting interest rates and the running down of savings accumulated during the Covid pandemic had also contributed to weaker growth in its regions. \u201cGeopolitical tensions are having a profound impact on the EBRD regions and beyond, leading to rapid fragmentation of trade and investment and a notable rise in defence spending\u201d, it said. \u201cBridging\u201d economies that traded with both eastern and western blocs had been large recipients of foreign direct investment and stood to benefit from fragmentation. China accounted for half of greenfield inward investment by value in the EBRD regions, Javorcik said."

            "date": "2024-05-06T23:14:18Z",
            "content": "Rachel Reeves will draw the economic battle lines for the next general election on Tuesday, challenging the government\u2019s claims that the economy is turning a corner when millions are still struggling with the cost of living. The shadow chancellor will accuse Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt of \u201cgaslighting\u201d the public with over-optimistic statements about the UK economy that are \u201cout of touch\u201d with most people\u2019s lives. Labour will draw on \u201cnew economic thinking\u201d from leaders in Europe and America, Reeves will say, and she will claim that when it comes to Britain\u2019s finances the government has \u201ccrashed the car and left it by the side of the road\u201d. Sunak will this week attempt yet another reset of his government after a disastrous set of local elections for the Conservatives in which their vote collapsed in councils across the country and they lost the flagship West Midlands mayoralty. Sunak argued on Monday that the general election result was not a \u201cforegone conclusion\u201d despite the results, the Tories struggling to close the gap with Labour in the polls and many of his MPs privately conceding defeat was likely. Tory plotters had warned that a poor set of results could be a moment of high peril for Sunak, yet rebels laid down arms after admitting they had not persuaded enough MPs to join them to force a vote of no confidence in his leadership. The prime minister said he was \u201cabsolutely determined\u201d to fight on in the run-up to polling day, expected this autumn, to show that the government was making a difference on issues including the economy, citing tax cuts and falling inflation. As part of sweeping changes to the welfare system that have been criticised by disability groups, the government will announce on Tuesday that a plan to help the long-term sick back into work will be piloted in 15 areas of England. In a speech in the City of London, Reeves will argue that Sunak\u2019s message to voters that the economy is improving is \u201cdeluded\u201d, ahead of the release of a raft of economic data that the government hopes will help reverse its fortunes. The Bank of England\u2019s latest decision on interest rates comes on Thursday, with economists expecting the base rate to remain at 5.25% despite pressure from the government for rates to start falling before the election. Ministers may be more cheered by quarterly GDP data on Friday that is expected to show the UK has emerged from recession, while inflation figures later this month are expected to show the Bank hitting its 2% target. Reeves will tell business leaders: \u201cBy the time of the next election, we can, and should, expect interest rates to be cut, Britain to be out of recession and inflation to have returned to the Bank of England\u2019s target. Indeed, these things could happen this month. \u201cI already know what the chancellor will say in response to one or all these events happening. He has been saying it for months now: \u2018The economy is turning a corner,\u2019 \u2018our plan is working\u2019, \u2018stick with us\u2019. I want to take those arguments head on because they do not speak to the economic reality.\u201d Labour\u2019s internal research shows that Tory claims around the economy improving go down badly with the voters they need to win back at the next election, with people still feeling the pain of high inflation and mortgage rates. Focus group respondents described the economy as \u201cdamaged\u201d, \u201cfragile\u201d and \u201cunbalanced\u201d, and party strategists believe that even if people start to feel less worse off by the election, the government will not get the credit. \u201cDuring the local elections I travelled across the country. I spoke to hundreds of people. I listened to their stories,\u201d Reeves will say. \u201cAnd when they hear government ministers telling them that they have never had it so good, that they should look out for the \u2018feelgood factor\u2019, all they hear is a government that is deluded and completely out of touch with the realities on the ground. The Conservatives are gaslighting the British public.\u201d Labour plans to fight the election on the economy, believing that the government\u2019s response to global pressures and Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget have destroyed the Tories\u2019 reputation for economic competence, while Keir Starmer\u2019s party now offers a more stable alternative. Reeves will highlight Labour\u2019s plans to boost the economy, including a national wealth fund to deliver private and public investment, changes to planning laws to build 1.5m homes, and creating 650,000 jobs in the UK\u2019s industrial heartlands. Yet the shadow chancellor, whose ambitions for the economy have tended to be laced with caution, will add: \u201cI know warm words are not enough. I do not underestimate the challenges we face.\u201d Economists have said that whoever wins the general election will face some very tough choices on tax and spending if they want to make sure the public finances do not deteriorate further. The Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Resolution Foundation have said the economic inheritance facing the next government will arguably be one of the bleakest any has faced since the second world war. But Reeves will insist the constraints holding back Britain\u2019s potential \u201care not immutable forces\u201d and can be overcome with \u201cvision, courage and responsible government\u201d, pointing to the more active approaches of other countries. \u201cVision \u2013 to pursue a different approach, drawing on new economic thinking shaping governments in Europe, America and around the world \u2013 but which this Conservative government resists,\u201d she will add. Labour has sought inspiration from Joe Biden\u2019s plan to tackle inflation and create jobs in the US, as well as a bigger role for government in running the free-market economy, with a focus on supply-side reforms and green industrial strategy. Tory party chair Richard Holden said: \u201cLabour have no plan and would take us back to square one with higher taxes, higher unemployment, an illegal amnesty on immigration and a plot to betray pensioners.\u201d The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, will seek to put pressure on Sunak to call a June general election by tabling a motion of no confidence in the government when parliament returns on Tuesday, although this has no chance of passing."

            "date": "2024-05-19T18:09:45Z",
            "content": "International far-right leaders, including France\u2019s Marine Le Pen, Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Italy\u2019s Giorgia Meloni and Argentina\u2019s Javier Milei, came together in Madrid to rail against socialism and \u201cmassive illegal migration\u201d three weeks before hard-right parties are expected to see a surge in support in June\u2019s European elections. Sunday\u2019s \u201cgreat patriotic convention\u201d, which was organised by Spain\u2019s far-right Vox party, offered conservatives and far-right populists a chance to congregate and take aim at a variety of familiar targets, from the welfare state to \u201cwokeness\u201d and the agendas of Brussels-based bureaucrats. The event was also attended by Amichai Chikli, Israel\u2019s minister for diaspora affairs and combating antisemitism, Andr\u00e9 Ventura, the leader of Portugal\u2019s far-right Chega party, and the Chilean far-right leader Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast. The US hard right was represented by Matt Schlapp, the Donald Trump ally who chairs the American Conservative Union, and Roger Severino, vice-president of the powerful conservative Heritage Foundation thinktank. Orb\u00e1n, who sent a video message, said it was time \u201cfor patriots to occupy Brussels\u201d, adding that those in the Belgian capital were \u201cunleashing massive illegal migration\u201d and \u201cpoisoning our children with gender propaganda\u201d. Meloni, who also appeared via video, urged Europe\u2019s far-right parties to work together as EU citizens prepare to head to the polls. \u201cWe\u2019re at the eve of decisive elections,\u201d said the Italian prime minister. \u201cIt\u2019s time to mobilise, to get out on to the streets. It\u2019s time to raise the stakes; it is our duty to fight to the last day.\u201d Vox\u2019s leader, Santiago Abascal, used the event to call for like-minded groups around the world to vanquish the threat posed by the left. \u201cWhile all defend our national sovereignty, we also know that we can\u2019t do it alone,\u201d he told the 10,000-strong crowd at the Vistalegre arena in the Spanish capital. \u201cFaced with globalism and its socialist soul, we must respond with a global alliance that will defend common sense, because this is a shared threat.\u201d Le Pen, whose National Rally party is leading the polls in France, said she knew she could count on Vox\u2019s support in the European parliament to \u201cbegin to reorientate\u201d the EU. Milei, who began his speech with a song, eulogised the power of capitalism. \u201cDespite all the left\u2019s whingeing, the free market brings prosperity to everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cSocialism has always been an economic and social failure. Opening the door to socialism means inviting death. It\u2019s more important than ever to point that out.\u201d The controversial Argentinian president \u2013 who was in Spain to attend the event, promote his latest book and meet with business leaders from Spanish multinationals such as Iberia, Santander, Telef\u00f3nica and BBVA \u2013 had already made his thoughts on socialism plain at an event on Friday. \u201cSocialism is the cancer of humanity,\u201d he said. \u201cSocialism is the enemy. Instead of being so worried about the differences we may have on this side in life, let\u2019s not let the dark, black, satanic, disgusting, atrocious, carcinogenic side \u2013 which is socialism \u2013 defeat us.\u201d He also used his appearance at the rally to reignite the war of words that began earlier this month after \u00d3scar Puente, Spain\u2019s outspoken transport minister, suggested that Milei\u2019s eccentric media appearances could be down \u201cto the ingestion of substances\u201d. Milei hit back on Sunday, referring to the corruption allegations relating to the wife of Pedro S\u00e1nchez, Spain\u2019s socialist prime minister. S\u00e1nchez, who has called the allegations baseless and the brainchild of his political and media opponents, recently took five days out of the public eye to reflect on whether he wished to continue in office because of the ferocity of the personal attacks on his family. The Argentinian president said: \u201cThe global elites don\u2019t understand how destructive implementing socialist ideas can be because they\u2019re too far away from it all. They don\u2019t know what kind of society and country socialism can produce, what kind of people cling to power and what levels of abuse it can bring. Even with a corrupt wife, he debases himself and takes five days to think about it.\u201d The Spanish government \u2013 which described Milei\u2019s words as an unprecedented \u201cfrontal attack on our democracy, on our institutions, and on Spain itself\u201d \u2013 said it would be recalling its ambassador in Buenos Aires. Speaking on Sunday afternoon, Spain\u2019s foreign minister, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares, said the government expected a full public apology from Milei. \u201cIf such an apology is not forthcoming,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will take all the actions we deem necessary to defend our sovereignty and our dignity.\u201d S\u00e1nchez himself said Sunday\u2019s far-right summit was indicative of an \u201cundercurrent\u201d vehemently opposed to social justice which denies both science and women\u2019s rights. \u201cWhy have all these people chosen Spain as the place to meet?\u201d he said in a speech in Barcelona on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence. They\u2019ve chosen Spain because we, as a society \u2013 not as a government; as a society \u2013 represent everything that they hate and detest: feminism; social justice; dignified employment; a strong welfare state, and democracy. \u201cIn democracy, as in life, forgiveness is far stronger than bitterness, coexistence is far stronger than confrontation, and union is far stronger than division.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-30T16:07:55Z",
            "content": "Political parties across Europe, including the UK, should be forced to publish the names of their private funders before elections, not after, the president of the Council of Europe\u2019s anti-corruption body has said. Unveiling the annual report of the Group of States Against Corruption (Greco), Marin Mr\u010dela, who is the justice of the supreme court of Croatia, also called on the European Union to stop using \u201cexcuses\u201d not to join the body. Joining would allow the body to monitor low- and high-level corruption in the European Commission and the European parliament, which is embroiled in several scandals, including allegations of Russian and Chinese interference. Parliamentary oversight bodies are struggling to get to grips with the scandals because most of the regulatory power lies with the member states, not the EU institution. The Belgian president, Alexander De Croo, has questioned whether the powers of the European Commission\u2019s anti-fraud unit, Olaf, need to be broadened to include foreign interference via disinformation or payments to MEPs. Mr\u010dela said that by joining Greco, the EU would \u201cshow that their opinions and actions about fighting corruption are serious\u201d and enable it to receive expert help from evaluators and rapporteurs. The EU has observer status in Greco, but refuses to become a full member. \u201cWe see their arguments,\u201d Mr\u010dela said. \u201cThey are not reasons, but excuses not to join.\u201d Asked if there should be centralised rules across the EU over transparency of party funding, he said: \u201cWe have this rule about transparency of party funding: everything should be published before the election.\u201d Greco said it was \u201cconcerned that in some countries progress is still limited concerning the application of codes of conduct for MPs, the transparency of systems for declaring assets, and the regulation of lobbying\u201d. A Guardian and Follow the Money investigation into the financing of political parties across the EU has revealed how some of the oldest democracies in Europe are the least transparent in relation to fundraising, while newer members from eastern Europe have some of the highest standards of accountability. France, which overthrew its monarchy and became a republic in 1792, does not require parties to publish the names of any donors, on the grounds of privacy, while Latvia, considered the gold standard of transparency in the EU, requires parties to publish names 15 days after funds have been received. On the general issue of corruption, Mr\u010dela said research showed that overall \u201cjudges and the prosecutors have a better understanding of the ethical issues in politics, particularly parliamentarians\u201d. He said progress in anti-corruption in some countries was \u201cvery slow\u201d and it would take years to implement Greco\u2019s recommendations on changes to laws or constitutions. He singled out Finland for \u201cvery good practice\u201d. \u201cWithout any law about financing of political parties, in 11 months they managed to implement all of the recommendations they received,\u201d he said. Hungary, he said, had come out of the non-compliance category in relation to prevention of corruption of members of parliament, judges and prosecutors, but still had a long way to go. The annual report showed Ukraine, which has applied for EU membership, had completed just over 51% of the Greco anti-corruption recommendations and partly completed a further 32%, leaving just 17% of a total of 41 recommendations yet to be incorporated into law or practice. \u201cThat is something Ukraine should be commended for, because when you are in a war it is very hard to fight [corruption] because you are fighting for your life. We are commending Ukraine on that,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2024-05-29T06:56:59Z",
            "content": "South Africans are voting in what are expected to be the most competitive elections since the end of apartheid, which could result in the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party losing its majority for the first time since Nelson Mandela led it to power 30 years ago. The national mood is grim owing to some of the world\u2019s highest rates of unemployment and inequality, power cuts, water shortages and violent crime. Younger generations do not feel the same gratitude and loyalty to the ANC as many of their parents and grandparents do, for leading the successful fight for multi-racial democracy. Polls have consistently shown the ANC getting less than 50% of the national vote, down from 57.5% in the last elections in 2019. This raises the prospect of South Africa\u2019s first coalition government since the \u201cgovernment of national unity\u201d during Mandela\u2019s single presidential term, when the country was seen as a beacon of hope for Africa and the world. \u201cI certainly think the ANC is not going to make 50% \u2026 The best case seems to be 46-47%,\u201d said David Everatt, a professor at the University of Witwatersrand who conducted polls for the party from 1993 until South Africa\u2019s most recent regional elections in 2021. \u201cThe mood is very, very low and many people attribute their unhappiness directly to the ANC.\u201d Millions more South Africans now have access to quality housing with electricity and running water than in 1994 when the ANC came to power. But rising unemployment, along with corruption scandals and rolling power cuts that have lasted up to 10 hours a day in recent years, have contributed to a sense for many that the government no longer works for them. Even Mandela\u2019s home village of Qunu in the rural Eastern Cape no longer has piped water. More than 80% of South Africans said the country was going in the wrong direction in a 2022 poll by pan-African survey organisation Afrobarometer. Four in 10 adults are out of work. Joy Reabetswe, who sells funeral insurance, accused ANC politicians of hoarding state resources for themselves Reabetswe, 18, who is saving money to pay for a law degree, said voting had not crossed her mind. President Cyril Ramaphosa \u201ccould do better,\u201d she said, speaking outside a supermarket on the outskirts of Diepsloot, a poor township bordering verdant golf courses on Johannesburg\u2019s northern fringes. The Democratic Alliance (DA), the largest opposition party and more pro-business than the ANC, can help South Africans, she said, but was not appealing either due to the oft-levelled accusation that it favours the interests of white people (which it denies). The DA is led by John Steenhuisen, who is white and took over the party leadership in 2019 when his black predecessor, Mmusi Maimane, resigned, claiming that his efforts to win over more black voters had been stymied. It was formed after a merger agreement between the Democratic party, whose roots were in opposing apartheid in the former white-only parliament, and the New National party, the renamed National party that had ruled South Africa during apartheid. The DA\u2019s relationship with the NNP broke down after a year, and the NNP formed an alliance with the ANC instead. \u201cHow do we trust them?\u201d Reabetswe asked of the DA. \u201cHow do we know they won\u2019t take us back to apartheid?\u201d The economically liberal DA got 20.8% of the vote in the 2019 elections and few analysts think it will achieve far above that this year. Nor is there any confidence that the Multi-Party Charter, a loose alliance that the DA formed with 10 other much smaller parties, only four of which now have any elected representatives, will get a majority. Among the other opposition parties that could score double digits in Wednesday\u2019s vote are the Marxist-inspired Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), led by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema, which got almost 11% of the vote in 2019. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely vote EFF,\u201d said Petronella, a 19-year-old colleague of Reabetswe. \u201cThey stand for people and they keep their word.\u201d She had seen the EFF and the ANC campaigning around her home in Hillbrow, a central Johannesburg district with a reputation for having been hollowed out by gang crime. \u201cI am not a fan,\u201d she said, of the ANC. \u201cI have not seen their work.\u201d Meanwhile, a new party, uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), named after the ANC\u2019s armed wing during apartheid, has further complicated the political landscape for the elections, which also include provincial ballots. This is especially the case in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), the second-most populous province and stronghold of MK leader, former president Jacob Zuma, who was last week barred by South Africa\u2019s top court from running for parliament himself. Zuma, 82, was president from 2009 to 2018, but was forced to resign amid corruption allegations that he denies. He has since continued to feud with his successor, Ramaphosa, something that could benefit his new MK party. \u201cKZN is definitely the battlefield,\u201d said Mbali Ntuli, a former DA politician in the province who now runs the non-partisan Ground Work Collective, which ran voter registration drives among young people and will field about 2,500 election observers. \u201cThere are a lot of people who are doing a grudge vote against the ANC by voting for the MK. You hear them quite openly \u2026 saying they want to vote against Ramaphosa\u2019s ANC.\u201d However, the possibility of the ANC scraping a slim majority can\u2019t be counted out \u2013 thanks in part to its formidable electoral machine, liberation history and the power of incumbency, according to some experts. \u201cThe ANC has what we call \u2018struggle credentials\u2019,\u201d said Kealeboga Maphunye, a professor of African politics at the University of South Africa. Many polls in South Africa typically underestimate the ANC vote, due to surveying fewer of the harder-to-reach rural voters that make up a large segment of its support base, Maphunye said. There is also still a high degree of uncertainty around voting intentions, he added. A third of registered, likely voters had not decided who they were going to vote for or refused to say, according to a phone poll conducted from 27 April to 11 May by Afrobarometer (it noted, though, this survey method excluded poorer voters that do not have mobile phones). \u201cThe advantages of incumbency are also very important,\u201d said Maphunye. The ANC has \u201cgot all these state resources at their disposal and they are able to influence certain sections of society, especially vacillating or undecided voters, especially at the very last minute\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 May 2024. A earlier version correctly said that the Democratic Alliance was formed after a merger between the Democratic party and the New National party; however, it should have added that the latter left the alliance a year later to join with the ANC."

The elections, in more than 2,600 seats across 107 English councils, are seen as a key test of whether the Conservative party is as unpopular with voters as the polls suggest. They are also the prime minister\u2019s final chance to stem speculation of a Labour landslide at the general election \u2013 and to quash any potential rebellion from Tory plotters keen to oust him before it. His first big test will be the parliamentary byelection in Blackpool South, where the former Tory MP Scott Benton resigned after being found guilty of breaching standards rules in a lobbying scandal. Labour said it was hopeful of taking back the seat, which Benton won with a majority of 3,690 in 2019, but the race for second place could be problematic for Sunak if the Tories are outflanked on the right by the Reform party. There are also concerns in No 10 that Sunak may face a leadership challenge if the Tories lose the West Midlands and Tees Valley mayoralties. Their candidates seeking re-election \u2013 Andy Street and Ben Houchen, respectively \u2013 have distanced themselves from the party. Polling before voting opened suggested the West Midlands contest was on a knife edge, with YouGov putting the Labour candidate, Richard Parker, two points behind Street. Houchen was seven points ahead of his Labour rival, Chris McEwan, in Tees Valley, but was expected to win as he started from a high bar, taking 73% of the vote last time. If either of them lose, some Tory insiders fear Sunak could face a confidence vote \u2013 just 52 Tory MPs need to feel despondent enough about the state of their party to trigger one. The experiences of Theresa May and Boris Johnson with such votes suggests that even prime ministers who win them can see their authority drain away. Ten metro mayoralties in England including London are being contested, as are 37 police and crime commissioner roles in England and Wales. There were no elections in Scotland or Northern Ireland, and no local council elections in Wales. Labour will be keeping a close eye on the contest for the north-east mayor, where the polls suggest that the incumbent, Jamie Driscoll \u2013 who was barred from running as the party\u2019s candidate amid accusations of factionalism \u2013 could run the Labour candidate Kim McGuinness close. The Tories could face an upset in a newly created mayoralty, York and North Yorkshire, which had been assumed to be a safe Tory seat but now looks in play for Labour. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, is expected to win a record third term in the capital after a bitterly fought contest with his Tory rival, Susan Hall, who has faced criticism for pushing the party to the right. Some psephologists have predicted the Conservatives could lose 500 council seats \u2013 about half of those the party is defending this time around \u2013 but Labour sources have said the figure is too ambitious. This set of local council seats was last contested in May 2021, when the Conservatives under Johnson were at a high point after the UK\u2019s Covid vaccine rollout, and the party enjoyed its strongest performance since 2008. Sunak has faced months of often frenzied conjecture over his leadership but before polling day his aides said he was feeling more secure. During the past two weeks he has made a series of policy announcements aimed at securing his base \u2013 welfare reform, the Rwanda deportation plan and defence spending increases \u2013 with more expected in the days ahead. The Commons leader, Penny Mordaunt, who is seen as a future leadership contender, responded to speculation about her ambitions on Thursday by saying: \u201cI too have read that I\u2019m to be installed rather like a new boiler into No 10 next week \u2026 But let me say again, I support our prime minister and I will continue to support him after this weekend and beyond.\u201d The results for all the contests will be declared from the early hours of Friday through to Saturday afternoon, when the West Midlands result is declared."

            "content": "Dozens of rivers and streams in Alaska are turning rusty orange, a likely consequence of thawing permafrost, a new study finds. The Arctic is the fastest-warming region in the globe, and as the frozen ground below the surface melts, minerals once locked away in that soil are now seeping into waterways. \u201cIt\u2019s an unforeseen impact of climate change that we\u2019re seeing in some of the most pristine rivers in our country,\u201d said Brett Poulin, study author and assistant professor of environmental toxicology at University of California Davis. The permafrost thaw is exposing minerals to oxygen in a process known as weathering, which increases the acidity of the water and dissolves metals like zinc, copper, cadmium and iron \u2013 the most apparent metal that gives the rivers a rusty color visible even from satellite images. The study highlights the potential degradation of drinking water and risk to fisheries in the Arctic. \u201cWhen mixed with another river, it can actually make the metals even more potent [in its] impact to aquatic health,\u201d Poulin said. The phenomenon was first observed in 2018, when researchers noticed the milky orange appearance of the rivers across northern Alaska\u2019s Brooks Range, a stark contrast to the crystal clear waters seen the year prior. Within the year, a tributary of the Akillik river in Kobuk Valley national park saw the complete loss of two local fish species: the dolly varden and the slimy sculpin. \u201cOur data suggests that when the river turned orange, we saw a significant decrease in macroinvertebrates and biofilm on the bottom of the stream, which is essentially the base of the food web,\u201d Poulin said of the rusting phenomenon. \u201cIt could be changing where fish are going to be able to live.\u201d The rusting is a seasonal phenomenon, occurring in the summer typically during July and August, when the soil is thawed the deepest. The researchers at the National Park Service, US Geological Survey and University of California Davis now want to better understand the long-term implications of the changing water chemistry in places with continuous permafrost, which includes Arctic regions such as Alaska, Canada, Russia and parts of Scandinavia. \u201cIt\u2019s an area that\u2019s warming at least two to three times faster than the rest of the planet,\u201d said Scott Zolkos, an Arctic scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center who was not involved in the study. \u201cSo we can expect these types of effects to continue.\u201d The research group shared that they were working closely with tribal liaisons in Alaska to ensure local communities get accurate information on the developing phenomenon."

            "date": "2024-05-17T14:00:37Z",
            "content": "The economic damage wrought by climate change is six times worse than previously thought, with global heating set to shrink wealth at a rate consistent with the level of financial losses of a continuing permanent war, research has found. A 1C increase in global temperature leads to a 12% decline in world gross domestic product (GDP), the researchers found, a far higher estimate than that of previous analyses. The world has already warmed by more than 1C (1.8F) since pre-industrial times and many climate scientists predict a 3C (5.4F) rise will occur by the end of this century due to the ongoing burning of fossil fuels, a scenario that the new working paper, yet to be peer-reviewed, states will come with an enormous economic cost. A 3C temperature increase will cause \u201cprecipitous declines in output, capital and consumption that exceed 50% by 2100\u201d the paper states. This economic loss is so severe that it is \u201ccomparable to the economic damage caused by fighting a war domestically and permanently\u201d, it adds. \u201cThere will still be some economic growth happening but by the end of the century people may well be 50% poorer than they would\u2019ve been if it wasn\u2019t for climate change,\u201d said Adrien Bilal, an economist at Harvard who wrote the paper with Diego K\u00e4nzig, an economist at Northwestern University. \u201cI think everyone could imagine what they would do with an income that is twice as large as it is now. It would change people\u2019s lives.\u201d Bilal said that purchasing power, which is how much people are able to buy with their money, would already be 37% higher than it is now without global heating seen over the past 50 years. This lost wealth will spiral if the climate crisis deepens, comparable to the sort of economic drain often seen during wartime. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear that the comparison to war is only in terms of consumption and GDP \u2013 all the suffering and death of war is the important thing and isn\u2019t included in this analysis,\u201d Bilal said. \u201cThe comparison may seem shocking, but in terms of pure GDP there is an analogy there. It\u2019s a worrying thought.\u201d The paper places a much higher estimate on economic losses than previous research, calculating a social cost of carbon, which is the cost in dollars of damage done per each additional ton of carbon emissions, to be $1,056 per ton. This compares to a range set out by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that estimates the cost to be around $190 per ton. Bilal said the new research takes a more \u201cholistic\u201d look at the economic cost of climate change by analyzing it on a global scale, rather than on an individual country basis. This approach, he said, captured the interconnected nature of the impact of heatwaves, storms, floods and other worsening climate impacts that damage crop yields, reduce worker productivity and reduce capital investment. \u201cThey have taken a step back and linking local impacts with global temperatures,\u201d said Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia University who wasn\u2019t involved in the work and said it was significant. \u201cIf the results hold up, and I have no reason to believe they wouldn\u2019t, they will make a massive difference in the overall climate damage estimates.\u201d The paper found that the economic impact of the climate crisis will be surprisingly uniform around the world, albeit with lower-income countries starting at a lower point in wealth. This should spur wealthy countries such as the US, the paper points out, to take action on reducing planet-heating emissions in its own economic interest. Even with steep emissions cuts, however, climate change will bear a heavy economic cost, the paper finds. Even if global heating was restrained to little more than 1.5C (2.7F) by the end of the century, a globally agreed-upon goal that now appears to have slipped from reach, the GDP losses are still around 15%. \u201cThat is still substantial,\u201d said Bilal. \u201cThe economy may keep growing but less than it would because of climate change. It will be a slow-moving phenomenon, although the impacts will be felt acutely when they hit.\u201d The paper follows separate research released last month that found average incomes will fall by almost a fifth within the next 26 years compared to what they would\u2019ve been without the climate crisis. Rising temperatures, heavier rainfall and more frequent and intense extreme weather are projected to cause $38tn of destruction each year by mid-century, according to the research. Both papers make clear that the cost of transitioning away from fossil fuels and curbing the impacts of climate change, while not trivial, pale in comparison to the cost of climate change itself. \u201cUnmitigated climate change is a lot more costly than doing something about it, that is clear,\u201d said Wagner. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 May 2024 because an earlier version misquoted Gernot Wagner in the last sentence."

            "date": "2024-05-16T12:42:17Z",
            "content": "Climate change will be a lesser priority in Florida and largely disappear from state statutes under legislation signed on Wednesday by the state\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, in a move which experts say ignores the reality of Florida\u2019s climate threats. The legislation, which comes after Florida had its hottest year on record since 1895, also bans power-generating wind turbines offshore or near the state\u2019s lengthy coastline. Florida is facing rising seas, extreme heat, flooding and increasingly severe storms. The legislation takes effect on 1 July and also boosts expansion of natural gas, reduces regulations on gas pipelines in the state, and increases protections against bans on gas appliances such as stoves, according to a news release from the governor\u2019s office. \u201cThis purposeful act of cognitive dissonance is proof that the governor and state legislature are not acting in the best interests of Floridians, but rather to protect profits for the fossil fuel industry,\u201d said Yoca Arditi-Rocha, executive director of the non-profit Cleo Institute, which advocates for climate change education and engagement. DeSantis, who suspended his presidential campaign in January and later endorsed his bitter rival Donald Trump, called the bill a commonsense approach to energy policy. \u201cWe\u2019re restoring sanity in our approach to energy and rejecting the agenda of the radical green zealots,\u201d DeSantis said in a post on the X social media platform. Florida is already about 74% reliant on natural gas to power electric generation, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Opponents of the bill DeSantis signed say it removes the word \u201cclimate\u2019 in nine different places and moves the state\u2019s energy goals away from efficiency and the reduction of greenhouse gases blamed for a warming planet. Greg Knecht, director of the Nature Conservancy in Florida, told the Washington Post the new measure was \u201cvery much out of line with public opinion\u201d, with polls showing that a majority of Floridians believe in climate change and want action. Knecht said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing flooding and we\u2019re seeing property damage and we\u2019re seeing hurricanes \u2026 [and] we\u2019re turning around and saying, \u2018Yeah, but climate change isn\u2019t really real, and we don\u2019t need to do anything about it.\u2019\u201d The legislation also eliminates requirements that government agencies hold conferences and meetings in hotels certified by the state\u2019s environmental agency as \u201cgreen lodging\u201d and that government agencies make fuel efficiency the top priority in buying new vehicles. It also ends a requirement that Florida state agencies look at a list of \u201cclimate-friendly\u201d products before making purchases. In 2008, a bill to address climate change and promote renewable energy passed unanimously in both legislative chambers and was signed into law by then governor Charlie Crist, at the time a Republican. Former governor Rick Scott, now a Republican US senator, took steps after taking the governor\u2019s office in 2011 to undo some of that measure and this latest bill takes it even further. The measure signed by DeSantis would also launch a study of small nuclear reactor technology, expand the use of vehicles powered by hydrogen and enhance electric grid security, according to the governor\u2019s office.

Steve MacLaughlin of WTVJ in Miami addressed viewers on Saturday amid rising heat records across the state, saying: \u201cOn Thursday, we reported \u2026 that the government of Florida was beginning to roll back really important climate-change legislation and really important climate-change language.\u201d MacLaughin condemned DeSantis\u2019s position on the matter, saying that it came \u201cin spite of the fact that the state of Florida over the last couple of years has seen record heat, record flooding, record rain, record insurance rates, and the corals are dying all around the state\u201d. He said: \u201cThe entire world is looking to Florida to lead in climate change, and our government is saying that climate change is no longer the priority it once was. \u201cPlease keep in mind the most powerful climate change solution is the one you already have in the palm of your hands \u2013 the right to vote. And we will never tell you who to vote for, but we will tell you this: we implore you to please do your research and know that there are candidates that believe in climate change and that there are solutions. And there are candidates that don\u2019t.\u201d McLaughlin delivered his comments after DeSantis recently signed several bills the governor claimed sought to \u201crestore sanity in our approach to energy and rejecting the agenda of the radical green zealots\u201d. \u201cRadical green zealots want to impose their climate agenda on people through restrictions, regulations and taxes,\u201d a notice posted by DeSantis said. In addition to prohibiting windfarms offshore and near coastlines, the bill prioritizes the expansion of natural gas and bolsters protections against gas appliance bans and repeals climate policies enacted during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. The gas industry has helped drive climate change and its resulting effects, including severe weather becoming more commonplace. Over the weekend, south Florida saw record temperatures, with Fort Lauderdale and Miami each reaching record highs of 95F (35C) on Sunday. Typical highs for this time of year are about 86F (30C), the Palm Beach Post reported. Since McLaughlin shared his segment on X on 18 May, it has been viewed nearly 407,000 times on the platform, with more than 3,300 likes and 1,400 reshares. Many were quick to praise McLaughlin for speaking out, with one user saying: \u201cI know there\u2019s often pressure on meteorologists not to speak. Thank you for speaking.\u201d Another user wrote: \u201cThank you, Steve, for giving us the facts.\u201d Someone else said: \u201cSo needed. Thank you for this.\u201d Meteorologists across the US have faced harassment over their climate crisis reporting. Speaking to the Associated Press last year, Sean Sublette, a former TV meteorologist who now works at Virginia\u2019s Richmond Times-Dispatch newspaper, said: \u201cMore than once, I\u2019ve had people call me names or tell me I\u2019m stupid or these kinds of harassing type things simply for sharing information that they didn\u2019t want to hear.\u201d Meanwhile, last July, meteorologist Chris Gloninger announced he was stepping down from Des Moines\u2019s CBS TV station affiliate KCCI due to post-traumatic stress disorder that he developed as a result of threats over his climate-crisis coverage."

            "date": "2024-05-23T15:12:43Z",
            "content": "We are told the focus groups are clear as a bell. No, Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer is not exhilarating. No, the economy is not screaming for new management. Yes, the world is a mess. But one message for sure was splashed across Starmer\u2019s lectern on Wednesday: give us \u201cchange\u201d. Rishi Sunak has not been a signally worse prime minister than his recent predecessors. Eighteen months ago he was handed a tougher job than that of possibly any postwar holder of his office. The closest parallel was Douglas-Home\u2019s year-long inheritance of the wreck of Macmillan\u2019s government in 1963. Sunak confronted a second-rate cabinet, a crippled economy and a destitute public sector. It would have taken a political titan to have succeeded. He has struggled at least to be responsible, sincere and well-meaning. The definition of a democracy is not that it votes its leaders into office. Russia and China pretend to do that. Democracy requires that they also be voted out. Most constitutions impose term limits on rulers to ensure regime refreshment. The issue is not the quality of government but its openness to renewal. It is Tennyson\u2019s plea to \u201cLet the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change.\u201d No one could accuse the political clubland that is Westminster of failing change. After 10 years, two of Britain\u2019s longest-serving recent prime ministers, Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair, simply lost the public\u2019s patience without a vote. The trauma of Brexit later supplied the country with five leaders in just eight years. Unlike the US, Britain\u2019s constitution at least allows mistakes to be swiftly corrected. Boris Johnson was toppled by a few opinion polls. Truss lasted 49 days. Trump enjoyed four years. Sunak is gambling against change. In announcing the election he pleads that state security requires continuity. He professes to be \u201cthe strongest possible protection\u201d against a world \u201cmore dangerous than it has been since the end of the cold war\u201d. He also hopes that the electorate will see him as a restorer of \u201ceconomic stability\u201d. To this, Starmer could hit back not with different policies but only with a change of leader, a promise to end \u201cpolitical chaos feeding decline\u201d. This illustrates just how lost the days are when Labour and Conservative fought elections from divergent ideological platforms. There is now little talk of public sector versus private, of privatisation versus nationalisation, or free markets versus price controls. Ministers and shadow ministers speak the same language, as if they had both just stepped out of the same PPE course. The only criticism they can level at each other is an exchange of tame abuse. Politics thus offers the electorate an empty intellectual discourse. Public services and institutions are governed by a consensus that appears to be failing on all sides. Competence matters more than ideology, which means that politics is less about policy than about the people to whom we entrust it. Since voters cannot tell how competent a minister is likely to be, they can only fall back on trial and error, wait and see. When Gordon Brown entered No 10 as prime minister in June 2007, he muttered to the cameras: \u201cLet\u2019s get on with change.\u201d Yet he had been chancellor of the exchequer for 10 years. What was the change he had in mind? The answer could not be policy, only that of prime minister. Boris Johnson took office in 2019 and swiftly won an election on a tide of personal popularity. He brought to British politics something it had long lacked: charm and even a sense of humour. It turned out he could not run a whelk stall. Having been given no choice of policy between him and Labour, the electorate had to judge their new leader on his performance in office. The result was lethal. Johnson\u2019s popularity plummeted from nearly 70% to under 30%. Populist politics is the politics of whimsy. It cried out for another change. Change is both Starmer\u2019s opportunity and his burden. His slogan is starkly negative. It is to be not Sunak, not Tory, not the past 14 years. It is to be a relief from years of Tory backbiting, splitting and disloyalty. Like Blair in 1997, Starmer is likely to inherit an improving economy and the possibility of better times ahead. But his chief handicap, as after a long period in opposition, is a lack of ministerial experience. Blair\u2019s cabinet disastrously backed Thatcher\u2019s privatisation of water, trains and care homes for lack of cabinet colleagues who knew any better. Starmer may find that chaos in public services is the result not of Tory incompetence, but of structural failure that he needs to put right, and fast. Or his criticism of Sunak will return to haunt him: that the country needs change. Initially Starmer will expect a honeymoon and a sense of a new dawn. We saw it in the \u201cfirst hundred days\u201d of Blair\u2019s administration, and even Cameron\u2019s coalition. There was a brief respite from political vituperation and blame. It was a period of new faces on the television screen and a new political discourse. Every government announcement no longer required the BBC to add an abusive opposition put-down. Politics was eerily happy. Of course the challenges will remain the same, but the personalities will be different. A new club will be in power. We have only to gaze at the world as it is today to realise that this is democracy\u2019s most precious gift.

            "date": "2024-05-31T14:23:32Z",
            "content": "The Kremlin has said Joe Biden\u2019s decision to allow Ukraine to use US-supplied weapons against targets in Russia demonstrates Washington\u2019s deep involvement in the conflict, as some of Vladimir Putin\u2019s allies increased their nuclear threats against the west. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told journalists on Friday that Moscow was already aware of attempts by Ukraine to strike targets on Russian territory with weapons provided by the US. Biden\u2019s decision on Thursday to allow Kyiv to use US weapons for counter-fire purposes inside Russia near the border with the Kharkiv region marked an important shift, after warnings from Moscow that the move could trigger a global conflict. The approval came after days of growing pressure on Biden from western allies and the Ukrainian president, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, who argued that the delay in the use of western weapons had cost lives. \u201cI think it is absolutely illogical to have [western] weapons and see the murderers, terrorists, who are killing us from the Russian side. I think sometimes they are just laughing at this situation,\u201d Zelenskiy told the Guardian in an interview published on Friday. The German government announced on Friday that it would also give Ukraine permission to use weapons it supplied against military targets in Russian territory bordering the Kharkiv region to defend itself against Moscow\u2019s attacks. During a visit to Uzbekistan earlier this week, Putin warned against western countries allowing Ukraine to use their weapons to strike Russia. \u201cThis constant escalation can lead to serious consequences,\u201d the Russian president said on Tuesday, without giving further detail. Putin also issued a thinly veiled threat against Nato\u2019s smaller European members, saying they \u201cshould be aware that they are playing with fire\u201d because they had small land areas and very dense populations. In the lead-up to Biden\u2019s decision on Thursday, other western allies including the UK, France and the Netherlands, and the Nato secretary general, also said Ukraine should be able to use western weapons against military targets in Russia. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish former Russian president and current deputy chair of the country\u2019s security council, called Biden\u2019s decision a \u201cserious escalation of the conflict\u201d. \u201cRussia regards all long-range weapons used by Ukraine as already being directly controlled by servicemen from Nato countries. This is no military assistance, this is participation in a war against us,\u201d he said, adding that Russia would destroy any western weaponry used to attack it \u201cboth in Ukraine and in the territory of other countries\u201d. Medvedev said it would be a \u201ccrucial mistake\u201d on the part of the west to believe that Russia was not ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine. He also spoke of the potential to strike unnamed hostile countries with strategic nuclear weapons. \u201cThis is, alas, neither intimidation nor bluffing,\u201d he said. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, dismissed warnings by Moscow that the decision to allow Ukraine to use western weapons to strike inside Russian territory might lead to an escalation. \u201cThis is nothing new. It has ... been the case for a long time that every time Nato allies are providing support to Ukraine, President Putin is trying to threaten us to not do that,\u201d Stoltenberg told reporters on Friday on the sidelines of a Nato foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in Prague. \u201cAnd an escalation \u2013 well, Russia has escalated by invading another country.\u201d Western countries\u2019 approval for the use of their weapons comes amid reports that France is planning to send military trainers to Ukraine, making it the first to publicly deploy troops on the ground. The country\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, could announce the move next week during a visit by Zelenskiy, who will attend a ceremony in Normandy to mark the 80th anniversary of D-day. Putin has said the French move would escalate the situation toward a global conflict, and some senior officials in Moscow have said French trainers would become legitimate targets for Russian troops. In the early days of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Putin frequently invoked Moscow\u2019s nuclear arsenal, pledging to use all means necessary to defend his country. He later seemed to moderate his rhetoric, reportedly after Chinese officials persuaded him to abandon his nuclear threats, but he has recently returned to them. Russian forces started military drills near Ukraine last week that simulated the use of tactical nuclear weapons, in a move that Moscow said was a warning to the west not to escalate tensions further. Since the start of the war, Washington has voiced fears of provoking Putin into a nuclear response and drawing the US and Nato into direct conflict with Moscow. It has reportedly expressed anger over two Ukrainian drone strikes in the last week against Russian radar stations that provide warning of nuclear launches. At least one of the strikes in the south-eastern Krasnodar region appeared to have caused some damage, according to images circulating on social media. \u201cThey are sensitive locations because Russia could perceive that its strategic deterrent capabilities are being targeted, which could undermine Russia\u2019s ability to maintain nuclear deterrence against the United States,\u201d an unnamed US official told the Washington Post."

            "content": "A planned nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk has been granted the first site licence in more than a decade as investors and government officials race to finalise a deal for the multibillion-pound project this year. The licence from the nuclear regulator is considered a milestone for EDF, which plans to build Sizewell C as a replica of its Hinkley Point C project in Somerset, which has been dogged by delays and cost overruns. The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) has granted only two site licences to build new nuclear plants in more than 35 years: the first for Hinkley Point C in 2012, and the second for Sizewell. It was granted as EDF works to reach a final investment decision on the Sizewell C project by the end of this year, depending on a government framework to finance the project and fresh investment to cover its construction costs. EDF holds just under 50% stake in the project, while the UK government holds just over 50%. They are searching for further investment after EDF\u2019s partner at Hinkley Point, China\u2019s CGN, was barred from the successor project over security concerns. Mina Golshan, a director at Sizewell C, said the licence was a \u201cshow of confidence\u201d from the UK\u2019s nuclear regulator that the company had a suitable site and was ready to begin large-scale construction work on a safe design replicated from Hinkley Point C. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge milestone and demonstrates that this project is firmly on track,\u201d Golshan said. EDF has blamed inflation, Covid and Brexit for a four-year delay and cost overruns at the Hinkley Point C site. It believes that by learning the lessons from Hinkley it will be able to build Sizewell C in about nine years. Mark Foy, the ONR chief nuclear inspector and its chief executive, said the licence was granted after \u201cextensive engagement and review\u201d by the ONR team and would allow the regulator to take greater regulatory oversight and challenge the company as it progressed its plans. \u201cThe licensing process is fundamental in confirming that operators of a nuclear site are ready and able to meet their obligations under the nuclear site licence, to protect their workforce and the public,\u201d Foy said. A group campaigning against the nuclear plant, Stop Sizewell C, said it was \u201cappalled that a nuclear site licence has been issued when matters critical to the future safety of the site remain unresolved. \u201cThere isn\u2019t even a final design of the sea defences, which will be necessary to keep this vulnerable site safe for the next century and a half, at the very least. This seems to us like kicking the can down the road, on the assumption that some future generation will be able to clear up the mess,\u201d the group said."

            "date": "2024-05-21T17:17:43Z",
            "content": "Russian forces have started military drills near Ukraine simulating the use of tactical nuclear weapons in response to what Moscow deems threats from western officials about increased involvement in the conflict. Vladimir Putin ordered the drills earlier this month in a move Russian officials said was a warning to the west not to escalate tensions further. The Kremlin has particularly been angered by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who floated the possibility of sending European troops to fight Russia in Ukraine, and by remarks from the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, who said Ukraine had the right to use weapons supplied by London to target sites in Russia. The Russian defence ministry published footage on Tuesday showing trucks carrying missiles to a field where launch systems had been prepared and troops at an airfield readying a bomber to carry a nuclear warhead. The drills are taking place in Russia\u2019s southern military district, headquartered in Rostov-on-Don, which borders Ukraine and includes parts of the country which Russia occupies. The ministry said it was the first stage of the drills, which involved practising the loading of launch vehicles, driving to launch sites and loading planes with hypersonic Kinzhal missiles. Russia has numerous weapons systems capable of delivering tactical nuclear warheads, meaning those designed for battlefield use, as opposed to strategic warheads that could wipe out whole cities. Unlike strategic weapons, which have been subject to arms control agreements between Russia and the US, tactical weapons have never been limited by any such pacts, and Russia has not released their number or any other details about them. Putin frequently evoked Moscow\u2019s nuclear arsenal in the early days of its invasion of Ukraine, repeatedly pledging to use all means necessary to defend Russia. He later seemed to moderate his rhetoric, reportedly after Chinese officials persuaded him to abandon his nuclear threats, but he recently warned Nato countries they risked provoking a nuclear war if they deployed troops to Ukraine. In a recent speech to mark the Soviet Union\u2019s victory in the second world war, he said the country\u2019s nuclear weapons were \u201calways at combat readiness\u201d. Also on Tuesday, a Russian general fired last year after complaining about problems his troops faced in Ukraine was arrested on bribery charges. Maj Gen Ivan Popov, who commanded the 58th Combined Arms force, which is fighting on the frontline near Zaporizhzhia, said last summer that he had been fired after he brought up problems on the battlefield, including the lack of counter-battery fire, and deaths and injuries the army was suffering from Ukrainian attacks. Without naming them, Popov appeared at the time to attack the head of the army, Valery Gerasimov, and the then defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, two of the country\u2019s most powerful military men, accusing them of stabbing the country in the back. Popov\u2019s arrest came amid the largest reshuffle in the defence ministry and the army since the war in Ukraine began over two years ago, raising expectations of possible further purges. Putin removed his longtime ally Shoigu from his role as defence minister earlier this month. Two other senior defence officials have also been arrested on corruption charges."

            "date": "2024-05-29T01:54:07Z",
            "content": "The CSIRO says it stands by its analysis on the costs of future nuclear power plants in Australia after the Coalition attacked the work, which contradicted its claims reactors would provide cheap electricity and be available within a decade. The opposition\u2019s energy spokesperson, Ted O\u2019Brien, claimed on Tuesday in the Australian newspaper that the CSIRO should re-run its modelling to account for longer life-spans and running times of nuclear generators in other countries with nuclear programs. Last week the CSIRO released its GenCost report on the costs of different generation technologies, saying nuclear would be at least 50% more expensive than solar and wind and would not be available any sooner than 2040. The Coalition has yet to reveal any detail on its nuclear plan, including what type of reactors it would build, how large they would be and where they would put them. A CSIRO spokesperson told Guardian Australia: \u201cCSIRO provides impartial and independent advice and does not undertake modelling for specific policy directions. \u201cWhile we stand by the data provided, any alternative scenarios assessed by others would not carry CSIRO\u2019s endorsement.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup O\u2019Brien pointed to an assumption used in the GenCost report that nuclear plants would have a \u201ccapacity factor\u201d \u2013 how often they are generating electricity relative to their maximum capacity \u2013 of between 53% and 89%. O\u2019Brien wanted the CSIRO to use a higher figure of 92.7% for nuclear based on the performance of plants in the US. But the GenCost report discusses the reasons for setting capacity factors, saying new baseload generators such as nuclear \u201care expected to struggle to present the lowest cost bids to the dispatch market\u201d and would, therefore, likely be generating less often. O\u2019Brien also wanted the CSIRO to model the full lifespan of nuclear plants \u2013 which could be as long as 80 years \u2013 and to add a start date of 2035 to its modelling. The report provides cost estimates for power from different generation technologies, including both large and small reactors, for the years 2023, 2030 and 2040. The CSIRO spokesperson said: \u201cSpecific issues in regard to economic life of generation assets and capacity utilisation, including large scale nuclear, have been assessed by the GenCost team as part of the consultation process for the 2023-24 report.\u201d Australia has never built a nuclear reactor for electricity and the technology has been banned since 1998. The CSIRO report said if a decision was made in 2025 to adopt nuclear power, it would be at least 15 years until a reactor was producing power. The report said: \u201cNuclear technologies need to undergo more extensive safety and security permitting, nuclear prohibitions need to be removed at the state and commonwealth level and the safety authorities need to be established.\u201d The report estimated if Australia could establish a nuclear industry, then a 1,000MW plant would cost $8.6bn, but the first reactors could cost double that amount \u2013 more than $17bn. The report said: \u201cGiven the lack of a development pipeline and the additional legal and safety and security steps required, the first nuclear plant in Australia will be significantly delayed. Subsequent nuclear plant could be built more quickly as part of a pipeline of plants.\u201d"

            "content": "Ministers have earmarked north Wales as the site of a large-scale nuclear power plant, which is part of plans to resuscitate Britain\u2019s nuclear power ambitions. Wylfa on Anglesey (Ynys M\u00f4n) has been named as the preferred site for the UK\u2019s third major nuclear power plant in a generation, coming after EDF\u2019s Hinkley Point C nuclear plant, which is under construction in Somerset, and its Sizewell C nuclear project planned for Suffolk. The government added that it is already in discussion with major energy companies interested in building a nuclear power plant at Wylfa, which could help the UK reach its goal of sourcing a quarter of its electricity from nuclear power by 2050. South Korea\u2019s state-owned nuclear developer has reportedly held early-stage discussions with Westminster officials about building a multibillion-pound power plant using its APR1400 reactor technology at Wylfa alongside the UK government. Meanwhile, the American nuclear developer Westinghouse and the construction group Bechtel have also proposed building the plant, using Westinghouse\u2019s AP1000 reactor technology. EDF said it was for the government to determine which nuclear reactor type is used at Wylfa but two more of its own reactor units would \u201cbe the surest choice\u201d by \u201cbuilding on the skills and experience being developed at Hinkley Point and Sizewell\u201d. Claire Coutinho, the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, said the government was \u201cpowering ahead with the biggest expansion of nuclear energy in 70 years\u201d. The UK set out a plan to increase Britain\u2019s nuclear power capacity fourfold to reach 24 gigawatts (GW) by 2050. So far the Hinkley Point project has faced delays and rising costs, and the Sizewell project has yet to make a final investment decision. Coutinho said: \u201cAnglesey has a proud nuclear history and it is only right that, once again, it can play a central role in boosting the UK\u2019s energy security. Wylfa would not only bring clean, reliable power to millions of homes \u2013 it could create thousands of well-paid jobs and bring investment to the whole of north Wales.\u201d A deal would revive Wylfa\u2019s nuclear hopes after Japanese developer Hitachi dropped plans to build two reactors on the site in early 2019 because of rising costs, throwing the site\u2019s future into doubt. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: \u201cA large-scale project at Wylfa would be the single biggest inward investment in Welsh history, and a huge step towards both energy security and net zero for the whole country.\u201d Sue Ferns, the senior deputy general secretary of Prospect union, said: \u201cGigawatt scale new nuclear power stations are vital to hitting net zero and for our energy security. But they also maintain well-paid and highly skilled jobs, meaning this project would be a major boost to the Welsh economy.\u201d \u201cNow we need a laser-like focus on delivery of new nuclear to make sure skills and experience are not lost, and costs are reduced as we progress,\u201d Ferns said. The decision on the nuclear developer, and what type of technology should be used at Wylfa, will be made by Great British Nuclear, which was launched with the aim of providing new power stations, including a fleet of small modular reactors."

            "date": "2024-05-14T08:58:20Z",
            "content": "The TUC boss, Paul Nowak, could be accused of exaggeration when he says \u201cthe Tories are presiding over a rapidly deteriorating jobs market\u201d. The UK has experienced many periods when unemployment has deteriorated more quickly and the number of people out of work reached greater peaks. The union leader is concerned after the latest labour market figures showed unemployment rising by 166,000 over the last quarter to 1,486,000 to reach 4.3% of the workforce. Emphasising the noticeable deterioration in the jobs market, the number of vacancies fell and the amount of workers in employment also dropped, indicating that firms are neither looking for as many workers as they were previously, nor are they prepared to hang on to as many as they once did. Joe Nellis, the professor of global economy at the Cranfield School of Management, expects the rise in the unemployment rate to continue towards the end of the year, peaking at about 5%. Yet, the numbers are not huge in a historical context and the economy is growing, as we found out last week when the Office for National Statistics produced figures for national output, or gross domestic product (GDP), covering the first quarter. The 0.6% rise in GDP between January and March this year marked a turnaround from last year\u2019s recession and indicated businesses were more optimistic about the year ahead. Pay growth is also consistently strong, allowing Jeremy Hunt to boast that wages have risen faster than inflation for the past 10 months, easing the cost of living pressures on households. Still, Nowak\u2019s analysis not only gathers up the evidence of a slowdown from the current figures, but also looks ahead to the summer and autumn, when one of the biggest costs facing businesses and homeowners, namely interest bills, is likely to remain high. The Bank of England seems determined to keep interest rates painfully onerous for those with debts to service, even if it slices a few tenths of a percentage point off the 5.25% total before the end of the year. Almost 1 million homeowners will need to remortgage this year, adding an average \u00a31,800 to their bills. Combined with the extra interest costs paid by businesses, it is a sizeable amount of money to take out of the economy. A steeper fall in interest rates could keep consumer spending higher and save many businesses from going under. As it is, thousands of firms will suffer from this loss of cash in circulation, especially in the hospitality industry, laying off even more workers. The end result is unlikely to send unemployment shooting back to levels last seen in the 1980s and early 1990s \u2013 when rates hit double digits \u2013 but the effect will stall the recent economic rebound before it has even really got going."

The news cheered investors hoping that a cooling labor market will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates \u2013 which have been driven to a 20-year high as the US fights stubbornly high inflation. All the major US markets rose on the news. Last month, the labor department reported the US added a revised 315,000 jobs in March, far higher than the 192,000 jobs economists had forecast. April\u2019s figure was lower than forecast and the unemployment rate ticked up from 3.8% to 3.9% over the month but the figures underlined the continuing strength of the jobs market. It was the 40th straight month of job gains in the US and the 27th consecutive month with the unemployment rate below 4% \u2013 the longest such streak since 1953. Gains were broad-based, with healthcare, social assistance, transportation and warehousing, manufacturing and construction all adding jobs. The growth in the jobs market has continued even as the Fed has maintained its rates policy. The Fed said this week that inflation remained high and that it did not plan to cut interest rates until it has \u201cgreater confidence\u201d that price increases are slowing to the goal of 2%. Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said the slowdown in price increases was taking longer than expected, but that he expected inflation to \u201cmove back down\u201d this year. Wage gains in April \u2013 which are also closely watched by the Fed \u2013 were also lower than forecast, increasing 3.9% from a year earlier after rising 4.1% in March. \u201cDespite missing expectations, signaling an economic cooldown, the labor market has still maintained a pattern of growth and consumers can be cautiously optimistic that the Fed will be able to successfully lower inflation while also avoiding a recession,\u201d said Steve Rick, chief economist at TruStage. ADP, the US\u2019s largest payroll supplier, reported this week that private sector employment was up 192,000 jobs in the month of April and that annual pay was up 5% year-over-year. \u201cHiring was broad-based in April,\u201d said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. \u201cOnly the information sector \u2013 telecommunications, media, and information technology \u2013 showed weakness, posting job losses and the smallest pace of pay gains since August 2021.\u201d"

            "content": "The level of real pay for UK workers is rising at its fastest rate in more than two years despite a cooling of the labour market that has led to rising unemployment and falling job vacancies, the latest official figures show. Fresh data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the mild recession in the second half of 2023 has had an impact on demand for workers but has been slower to affect wages. The ONS said unemployment rose by 166,000 between the final three months of 2023 and the first three months of 2024, pushing up the jobless rate from 3.8% to 4.3%. Employment fell by 178,000 over the same period, while further evidence of a cooling labour market came from a drop in job vacancies, down by 26,000 to 898,000 in the three months to April. The UK\u2019s economic inactivity rate jumped to 22.1% in January to March, up from 21.9% in the final three months of 2023. The number of people inactive because of long-term health problems rose by 20,000 to 2,820,000 in the first quarter of 2024 \u2013 a new record high. ONS figures for earnings showed total pay \u2013 including bonus payments \u2013 was 5.7% higher in the three months to March than a year earlier, unchanged on February. Regular pay, which strips out bonuses, was also unchanged, recording growth of 6%. Annual inflation as measured by the consumer prices index stood at 4% in January, but fell to 3.4% in February and 3.2% in March. Earnings growth and the demand for workers are two of the indicators being closely watched by Bank of England interest-rate setters and the latest figures will provide a mixed message for Threadneedle Street as it considers whether to cut borrowing costs next month. Speaking on Tuesday, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Huw Pill, said it was \u201cnot unreasonable\u201d to think the central bank could consider cutting interest rates \u2013 currently at 5.25% \u2013 over the summer. Financial markets are pricing in a roughly 50% chance the Bank will start cutting rates at its meeting next month. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cThis is the 10th month in a row that wages have risen faster than inflation, which will help with the cost of living pressures on families. And while we are dealing with some challenges in our labour supply, including pandemic impacts, as our reforms on childcare, pensions tax reform and welfare come online, I am confident we will start to increase the number of people in work.\u201d Alison McGovern, Labour\u2019s acting shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cThe morning after Rishi Sunak told us his plan was working, these damning new figures prove that things are just getting worse: employment down, economic inactivity up and unemployment rising. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder there are now a record number of people locked out of work due to long-term sickness, given NHS waiting lists are spiralling and the Tories have pushed our NHS to its knees.\u201d Liz McKeown, an ONS director of economic statistics, said: \u201cWe continue to see tentative signs that the jobs market is cooling, with both employment from our household survey and the number of workers on payroll showing falls in the latest periods. \u201cAt the same time the steady decline in the number of job vacancies has continued for a 22nd consecutive month, although numbers remain above pre-pandemic levels. With unemployment also increasing, the number of unemployed people per vacancy has continued to rise, approaching levels seen before the onset of Covid-19. \u201cEarnings growth in cash terms remains high, with the recent falls in the rate now levelling off while, with inflation falling, real pay growth remains at its highest level in well over two years.\u201d"

US GDP rose at an annualized pace of 1.3% in January-March, below the previous estimate of 1.6%, fresh Bureau of Economic Analysis data shows. The data shows America\u2019s economy had less momentum than expected at the start of the year. But in Europe, the jobs market remains solid. Eurozone unemployment fell to a new alltime low last month, at 6.4%.

Over on Wall Street, shares in enterprise software maker Salesforce have plunged by 19% after it disappointed analysts last night. Salesforce reported revenues of $9.13bn for the first quarter of this year, below forecasts of $9.15bn. It also predicted that second quarter revenue would be between $9.2bn and $9.25bn, below analyst forecasts of $9.35bn. Analysts at Saxo say: [Salesforce\u2019s] revenue outlook came in lower-than-expected highlighting that the current demand for AI workloads is not currently translating into higher revenue growth for Salesforce. Top brass at Burberry have paid the price for a disappointing year for the luxury goods maker. Burberry\u2019s annual report, released, today, shows that chief executive Jonathan Akeroyd had not earned a bonus for last year. This pulled Akeroyd\u2019s total pay for the year to 31 March 2024 down to \u00a31.3m, from \u00a34.3m the previous 12 months (when he had received a \u00a31.3m bonus and \u00a31.7m to buy him out of bonus and share awards for leaving his position as boss of rival Versace). Danuta Gray, chair of Burberry\u2019s Remuneration Committee, explains: The Committee judged that progress was made on refining our brand image, evolving our product and strengthening distribution, resulting in some of the strategic objectives being partially met. However, in light of the business performance and broader shareholder experience, the Committee and Jonathan Akeroyd agreed that it would not be appropriate for him to receive an annual bonus for FY 2023/24. CFO Kate Ferry would receive an annual bonus for FY 2023/24 of \u00a3121,500, representing 9% of her maximum bonus. Burberry\u2019s profits fell by 40% last year; in the last 12 months, its share price has halved. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits has risen slightly, but still remains low on historical terms. There were 219,000 fresh \u2018initial claims\u2019 for jobless support last week, an increase of 3,000. The initial claims data is a proxy for the number of workers laid off by US companies and has been low in recent years as firms have held onto labo(u)r. Today\u2019s US GDP report also shows that disposable personal income by 5.3% in the first quarter Inflation took quite a bite out of that increase; real disposable personal income increased 1.9%. Both figures have been revised higher. Newsflash: The US economy grew more slowly than first thought at the start of this year. US GDP increased at an annualized rate of 1.3 percent in the first quarter of 2024, according to the second estimate of gross domestic product, just released. That\u2019s the equivalent of quarterly growth just over 0.3%. Previousl, the Bureau of Economic Analysis had estimated that GDP rose at an annualized rate of 1.6%, or 0.4% quarter-on-quarter, which was already the weakest rate in almost two years. Today\u2019s update primarily reflected a downward revision to consumer spending, says the BEA. Today\u2019s report shows that consumer spending, exports, and state and local government spending all decelerated in the January-March quarter; a downturn in federal government spending also weighed on growth. But, this was partly offset by an acceleration in residential fixed investment. Speaking of fiscal rules (see previous post), Oxford economics professor Sir Dieter Helm last week published a very interesting blog post about the fiscal rules, looking at how both parties are pledging to be responsible. But, he warns, this involves the \u201cfudge\u201d of relabelling capital maintenance as investment. Prof Helm writes: Both claim that the days of having the cake of tax reductions and the cake of higher spending are over. Tax cuts will mean spending cuts and spending increases will mean higher taxes. No more Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. The sinners have apparently repented. Confronted by the promise of a miracle, here are several possible responses. The first is simply to believe them. The sinners have repented. \u201cOh Lord, I promise to be a good and a trustworthy steward of state finances. I won\u2019t sin, I promise, even if I/my Party has repeatedly done so in the past. This time will be different, here are my fiscal rules and I promise to stick to them.\u201d The second is to assume that, when the inevitable expenditure pressures become irresistible, taxes are going to go up. The pressures on health spending, more defence, net zero, and workers\u2019 rights in the public sector will simply overwhelm the next government, and possibly as early as spring 2025. Tax cuts will prove unsustainable. Tax increases will be inevitable. The third is to assume that more borrowing will be resorted to, and that it will be the bond markets that bite back, imposing ex post discipline in response to ex ante breaking the new rules. The trick will be to continue pretending that current spending can be relabelled as \u201cinvestment\u201d. The next government must revise the fiscal framework in order to raise living standards and unlock spending on health, infrastructure and housing, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. In January, Keir Starmer ruled out breaking Labour\u2019s fiscal rules to meet its green investment targets if it wins the election. But the current rules are arbitrary, NIESR said, and must be broken or redesigned if the government\u2019s aim is higher growth and higher living standards. The UK fiscal framework was set up with the aim of making public debt sustainable, in other words to ensure that the government is borrowing at a level that means it can meet its payment obligations while having the room to respond to economic shocks. The current framework states that the debt-to-GDP ratio should be falling in the fifth year of forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility, and that net government borrowing should not exceed 3% of GDP. NIESR said that such fiscal targets are arbitrary. The Institute for Government has said that successive governments have gamed the fiscal rules, by claiming to be adhering to fiscal discipline while announcing short term giveaways and longer term tax rises or spending cuts that never materialise. Many long-term public investment projects do not make returns within five years, NIESR said, which stymies public investment that could help improve the debt to GDP ratio. To revitalise the economy, NIESR is proposing three pillars of fiscal policy reform. First, including the net worth of the public sector as a target, which provides a broader measure of the sustainability of public debt. Second, discounting public infrastructure investment from the deficit measure, separating it out from day-to-day spending. Third, the government could establish fixed dates for fiscal events like the budget, in the same way that interest rates are decided by the monetary policy committee at set dates in the calendar. This would insulate budget announcements from short-term political goals, like winning elections, at the expense of long-term economic strategy, NIESR said. Britain\u2019s manufacturers have also issued a manifesto for the warring political parties to digest. Make UK are hoping for a \u201cbold economic vision\u201d that puts the importance of the economy across every Ministerial portfolio. That, they say, would spur growth and help the UK compete with the US and China in the race to develop green technologies. Make UK are calling for five specific measures in the first 100 days of the new government \u2013 including a focus on where to stay aligned with Europe, and where to diverge\u2026. Announce a long-term modern Industrial Strategy to underpin all economic policymaking which has cross Government commitment. This should be backed by the re-introduction of an Industry Strategy Council and a new Cabinet Office backed Committee to ensure the implementation of the Strategy across Government Align the UK CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism) with the EU CBAM in terms of timescale and design to provide a level playing field with the EU Commence a root-and-branch review of the Apprenticeship Levy as a funding mechanism, as well as the wider apprenticeship system Re-establish an updated, modern Manufacturing Advisory Service Establish a mechanism for ongoing and active consultation with industry to decide where it is appropriate to maintain alignment with EU regulatory changes or, where opportunities for divergence might apply. A Bank of England facility which gives commercial banks cheap access to funds has seen record demand, again, amid worries that the money markets are running short of cash. The BoE allocated over \u00a317bn of one-week funds in its latest short-term repo operation this morning, the largest take-up since the facility was launched in October 2022. The repo operation allows banks to borrow from the BoE at Bank rate, in return for handing over high-quality assets as collateral. It is meant to keep short-term market interest rates in line with Bank Rate by ensuring banks don\u2019t need to pay more to access reserves in the money markets. But there are concerns that banks are tapping the short-term repo because market liquidity which is being drained as the BoE continue to sell bonds acquired through years of quantitative easing (QE). This \u201cquantitative tightening\u201d (QT) scheme involves the Bank selling bonds back to the market, leading to a drop in liquidity. The Financial Times reported yesterday that analysts at Barclays, Bank of America and NatWest believe this scarcity of cash could cause the BoE to slow down the process of shrinking its balance sheet when it reviews its QT policy in September. In another boost for Europe\u2019s economy, euro-area economic confidence has improved this month. The European Commission\u2019s monthy sentiment indicator has risen to 96 this month, up from 95.6 in April. However, economists had expected a larger rise. Readings for industrial confidence also ticked up. Europe\u2019s \u201cstrong job market\u201d is driving its economic recovery, says Bert Colijn, senior economist for the eurozone at ING: Following this morning\u2019s drop in the eurozone unemployment rate, Colijn says: Unemployment was already sitting near historic lows during the period of stagnation. In April, unemployment dropped from 6.5 to 6.4%, once again reaching the lowest point since the eurozone was founded in 1999. The strong job market is helping the economic recovery as it keeps wage growth elevated, and has allowed purchasing power to recover after the inflation spike. The question is whether the economic pickup will result in lower unemployment from here. We doubt it. Expectations for employment for both services and industry have actually trended down despite better economic prospects and we expect that the modest economic recovery will largely result in productivity gains. Newsflash: unemployment across the eurozone has fallen to a new record low, a week before Europeans head to the polls for the European Parliament elections. Statistics body Eurostat reports that the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate across the euro area fell to 6.4% in April, down from 6.5% in March. That\u2019s the lowest since the single currency was created, Eurostat data shows. In the wider EU, the jobless rate remained at 6%. This suggests that the higher interest rates imposed by the European Central Bank to fight inflation is not hurting the labour market. Eurostat estimates that 13.149 million persons in the EU, of whom 10.998 million in the euro area, were unemployed in April, adding: Compared with March 2024, unemployment decreased by 103 thousand in the EU and by 100 thousand in the euro area. Compared with April 2023, unemployment increased by 95 thousand in the EU and decreased by 101 thousand in the euro area. Across the EU, unemployment was highest in Spain (at 11.7%) and Greece (10.8%) in April, and lowest in Czechia (2.7%) and Poland (3%). At its peak, during the eurozone crisis in 2013, eurozone unemployment rose over 12%, but then fell steadily \u2013 before a brief spike in the Covid-19 pandemic. The Bank of England has been doing its best to keep out of the general election campaign. Earlier this week it cancelled all speeches by its policymakers for the duration of the upcoming 4 July General Election, meaning we shouldn\u2019t hear any public statements from central bank officials until the public has voted. That would prevent the Bank committing news, by commenting on the state of the economy, or hinting when it might lower borrowing costs. Now, though, Rishi Sunak has piled into the void by claiming that a vote for the Tories is a vote for cuts to interest rates. Sunak told The Times: \u201cOf course it is, because we are the party who has committed to bringing down inflation, which is a necessary condition for bringing down interest rates. And I think people can see we have delivered that. And that allows us to think about the future in a more positive and confident way.\u201d Inflation is a funny beast \u2013 politicians are desperate to blame global factors when it\u2019s going up, but rush to take the credit when it falls. And either way, as the Bank of England is independent, it gets the credit for controlling prices (and the blame for losing control). Anyway, Labour are warning that they would be starting from a difficult position if they win the election. Darren Jones, Labour\u2019s shadow Treasury minister, ruled out rises to income tax, national insurance or VAT, adding: The fiscal inheritance is going to be really hard, it\u2019ll be the worst that any party has inherited since the second world war. A \u201cdo not travel\u201d alert has been issued after a freight train derailed on a major route between England and Scotland, PA Media reports. Services are being cancelled and delayed because of the incident on the West Coast Main Line between Carlisle and Oxenholme Lake District on Wednesday night, National Rail Enquiries added. National Rail says: A derailed freight train between Carlisle and Oxenholme Lake District means some lines are blocked. Trains may be cancelled, revised or severely delayed by up to 60 minutes. Major disruption is expected until 14:00. Train operators Avanti West Coast and TransPennine Express issued the \u201cdo not travel\u201d alert, urging passengers not to attempt to use their services for journeys between Preston and Scotland on Thursday. Ticket holders can delay journeys until Friday or travel with other operators. The cost rises hammering UK households has slowed in the last quarter. The Office for National Statistics reports that UK household costs, as measured by the Household Costs Index (HCI), rose 4.4%, slowing from the annual rate of 5.3% in January 2024. That chimes with the latest inflation data, which showed a slowdown in price rises this year. Interestingly, higher income households saw the highest inflation rate. Here\u2019s the details: By comparison, household costs rose 5.0% for high-income households (decile 9) and 3.9% for low-income households (decile 2). By tenure type, mortgage and other owner occupier households had the highest annual inflation rate of 5.5%, reflecting rising mortgage interest payments; by contrast, the rate for outright owner occupiers was the lowest at 3.3%. Private renters\u2019 HCI inflation rate was higher than social and other renters, at 4.6% and 4.3% respectively; this follows a period between October 2023 and January 2024 where the two groups had similar inflation rates. Non-retired households continued to experience a higher annual rate of inflation (4.8%) than retired households (3.4%). Households with children\u2019s annual inflation rate fell to 4.8% while households without children fell to 4.2%. In the property sector, the number of homes for sale in the UK is at the highest level in eight years, according to website Zoopla. Zoopla reports that the supply of homes for sale is 20% higher than this time last year, with \u00a3230bn worth of housing for sale, up \u00a345bn on this time last year. This is likely to keep a lid on house price rises this year, Zoopla suspects, even though the upcoming general election could slow the pace of new sales in the coming weeks. Zoopla also reports that there were modest house price falls across Southern England, as the north/south divide in annual house price growth continues. They say: This split in house price inflation is most evident at a city level with the the strongest house price growth in Belfast (+3.6%), Burnley (+2.5%) and Bolton (2.4%), and the highest house price falls in Ipswich (-3%), Hastings (-2.7%) and Norwich (-2.4%). Those IT problems at TSB appear to be solved! A TSB spokesperson tells us: \u201cWe\u2019re aware some customers had issues logging into our app and online banking this morning. This issue is now resolved and we\u2019re sorry for any inconvenience it caused.\u201d Another day, another problem with Britain\u2019s banking apps. Today it\u2019s TSB whose customers are reporting problems accessing their accounts. According to Downdetector, there was a spike in reports of glitches at TSB Bank this morning. Many customers are posting on social media that they can\u2019t get their app, or internet banking, to work: TSB is telling customers that it\u2019s aware they are experiencing issues with its digital services, and working hard to resolve it. A TSB spokesperson says: \u201cWe\u2019re aware that some customers have had difficulty logging into the app and online banking. We\u2019re sorry for any inconvenience and are working hard to resolve it as soon as possible.\u201d They added that the issues were \u201cintermittent\u201d meaning that in some cases, customers were blocked but later able to get through on subsequent login attempts. On Tuesday, NatWest\u2019s banking app crashed for several hours, leaving thousands of frustrated customers across the UK without access to their accounts. TSB customers are used to technical problems; in 2018, a planned IT upgrade turned into a full-scale crisis, with up to 1.9 million customers locked out of their accounts for days. City regulators later fined TSB \u00a348m for \u201cwidespread and serious\u201d failings in its IT migration. Banknote and passport printer De La Rue is in talks with suitors interested in buying each of its core divisions following a strategic review. The Basingstoke-based group, which prints banknotes for the Bank of England and other central banks across the world, said it has spoken with \u201ca number of parties who have made proposals\u201d related to either its currency or authentication operations. Nevertheless, it stressed that there is no certainty that interest will result in any deal. Clive Whiley, chairman at De La Rue, told shareholders this morning: \u201cSince my appointment a year ago, the board has considered a broad range of possible strategic alternatives including transactions with multiple parties which may involve a combination with, or the sale of, the group\u2019s divisions. \u201cThe board confirms that the discussions with the relevant parties are advancing, and we expect to update further at the time of the full year results in July.\u201d De La Rue shares have jumped 5% this morning. Shares in online car marketplace Autotrader are roaring ahead, after it reported a jump in sales and earnings for last year. Autotrader\u2019s revenues increased by 14% in the year to 31 March, while operating profits increased by 26%. Autotrader benefited from a \u201crobust\u201d market for used cars, which are selling faster than before the pandemic as supplies gradually improved. The new car retail market has been more challenging, though, with discounting starting to return to the market. Autotrader\u2019s share have jummped 12% this morning, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100 share index. Keith Bowman, equity analyst at interactive investor, says: High interest rates mean it can still be expensive for people to finance the purchase of a vehicle, and it\u2019s interesting to see Google taking an interest in the UK motoring market. Costs generally for businesses also remain elevated, while potential for forecourt consolidation persists as operators such as Cargiant and Motorpoint look to grow. On the upside, Auto Trader is still the dominant market player and continues to spend on innovation. More and more dealers are trialling its \u2018Deal Builder\u2019 product, which allows car buyers to value their part exchange vehicle, apply for finance, and reserve a vehicle online. Group net bank debt has also reduced significantly. In London, the FTSE 100 index has opened in the red, down 16 points at 8167 points, the lowest since 2 May. European markets are also sagging, with the Stoxx 600 down 0.2% in early trading. South Africa\u2019s rand has fallen over 1% against the US dollar today, as early results from the South African general election come in. Early results from yesterday\u2019s poll in South Africa\u2019s election suggest the governing African National Congress (ANC) party could lose its majority, although it is still expected to remain as the largest party. Reuters has the details: With results in from 10% of polling stations, the ANC\u2019s share of the vote in Wednesday\u2019s election stood at 42.3%, with the pro-business Democratic Alliance (DA) on 26.3% and the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) on 8.1%, data from the electoral commission showed. If the final results were to resemble the early picture, the ANC would be forced to make a deal with one or more other parties to govern - a situation that could lead to unprecedented political volatility in the coming weeks or months. The rand is down 1.2%, at 18.67 to the US dollar. Baroness Martha Lane Fox, president of the BCC, is urging politicians to focus on helping businesses: \u201cIn the frenzy of the election campaign, it\u2019s crucial that all politicians focus on the power of British business. \u201cAs I travel across the UK meeting Chambers and their businesses, I hear amazing stories of people determined to grow their businesses and make a difference in our remarkable country. But time and again businesses tell me they want to see a long-term vision for the economy.\u201d \u201cOur manifesto showcases practical ideas on how politicians can help companies successfully navigate the challenges and opportunities our economy faces. It\u2019s a blueprint for boosting productivity and a pathway to higher growth. \u201cWhichever party is in power after July 4th the immediate focus must be on implementing our five-point-plan for business. The stakes for business from the next government could not be higher.\u201d UK businesses are urging the next government to make improving relations with the European Union a key part of its drive to revive the economy. The British Chambers of Commerce Election Manifesto, published today, cites improved relations with the EU as one of its five priorities, saying this would help lower costs and boost trade. The BCC, which operates over 50 UK Chambers across the country, is calling for: An Industrial Strategy with green innovation at its heart. Better skills planning, bringing businesses and training providers together. Business rates reform to encourage growth and investment. Improved relations with the European Union to cut the costs for business. A Government appointed AI champion for SMEs to spearhead uptake of new technology. Shevaun Haviland, director general of the BCC, says this isn\u2019t about reversing Brexit, explaining\u2026. \u201cThe EU is the UK\u2019s biggest market, so we urgently need to get a better trading relationship with our closest neighbour. It\u2019s not about rewriting the referendum result, it\u2019s about cutting red-tape and promoting trade. Both the Conservatives and Labour have been criticised for not focusing on the impact of leaving the EU in this referendum, with former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine warning the election campaign will be the \u201cmost dishonest in modern times\u201d. UK food importers of food from the EU have warned that new post-Brexit checks introduced this spring will push up costs, and create painful delays at the border. Jamie Dimon, the head of JP Morgan, has caused further jitters by warning yesterday that the US economy risks stagnation \u2013 the toxic mix of rising prices and slow growth. Speaking at a Wall Street conference yesterday, Dimon warned that the past five years of massive fiscal and monetary stimulus risked tipping the US into deflation. Dimon said: \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s going to happen, I just give the odds much higher than other people,\u201d Dimon added. \u201cI look at the amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus that has taken place over the last five years\u2014it has been so extraordinary, how can you tell me it won\u2019t lead to stagflation?\u201d \u201cIt might not\u2026.But I, for one, am quite prepared for it.\u201d Dimon also explained that JP Morgan is prepared both for a soft landing, and something rather bumpier, saying: \u201cIf we have a soft landing and rates stay where they are, come down a little bit\u2014which is what the world expects, everyone\u2019s fine. If you have a harder landing with stagflation you\u2019re going to see a lot of stress and strain in the system from banks to leveraged companies to real estate to a whole bunch of stuff.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Fears over sticky inflation \u2013 and even the dreaded stagflation \u2013 are hitting the markets this week. Investors are growing more anxious that global interest rates will stay higher for longer, a worry that has knocked shares in recent days, as the yields \u2013 or rate of return \u2013 on government bonds push higher. Last night, the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index fell for the sixth day in a row and traders are bracing for further losses today. Central banks are attempting to slow growth through high interest rates to dampen inflation, but without cooling their economies so much that unemployment jumps. But with US inflation running at 3.4% last month, still well over the 2% target, confidence that this soft landing can be achieved is faltering. Yesterday, inflation in Germany came in higher than forecast. As Mizuho Bank said in a commentary: \u201cHotter and stickier than expected global inflation appears to be taking the air out of asset markets. In other words, \u201cGoldilocks\u201d coming undone. And worries about adverse demand impact from higher rates seeping through.\u201d Yesterday, a surpringly weak auction of US debt sent fresh jitters through trading floors, with buyers demanding higher rates as they bid for the bonds. Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at capital.com, explains: A rise in global yields is forcing a re-rating in global equity prices, with Wall Street falling further overnight. Upward pressure on yields was compounded by a weak seven-year auction, reigniting fears about how the US will fund its rising deficit. Although the European Central Ban seems certain to cut interest rate next week, both the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are expected to delay their first cuts until the autumn.

            "date": "2024-05-16T01:45:47Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s jobless rate rose more than expected last month as more people looked for work, easing risks of another Reserve Bank rate hike. The unemployment rate in April was 4.1%, seasonally adjusted, compared with a revised 3.9% for March, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. Economists had predicted the jobless rate would edge higher for a third consecutive month to 3.9%. The economy added a net 38,500 positions with full-time roles down 6,100 while part-time positions rose 44,600. Economists had forecast employers would add 23,700 jobs in April. The participation rate \u2013 a measure of those looking for work \u2013 ticked higher to 66.7% last month. Economists had expected it would hold steady at 66.6%. Hours worked, meanwhile, were little changed for the month. The labour market can be volatile, such as February\u2019s shock 116,500 jobs increase. The federal government\u2019s budget this week predicted the unemployment rate would be 4.25% by June and 4.5% a year later. The RBA, which sets its cash rate according to its own forecasts for employment and inflation, earlier this month predicted the jobless rate would be 4% by June, then 4.2% by year\u2019s end and 4.3% in June 2025. The government has forecast inflation would be back to the RBA\u2019s target 2-3% band by December, a result that would increase the chances of a cut in interest rates and eliminate the risk of a 14th rate increase in this cycle. The jobless rate was also 4.1% in January. Before then the last time the unemployment figure was this high was in January 2022. Investors said the labour data suggested another rate rise was less likely \u2013 with the dollar easing a tenth of a US cent to about 66.9 US cents. The stock market, where lower interest rates boost many firms\u2019 profits, had a more notable uptick. Already up about 1.4% for the day, the benchmark ASX200 share index increased its advance to about 1.7%. Bjorn Jarvis, ABS\u2019s head of labour statistics, said the economy needed to add about 30,000 jobs a month to keep the jobless rate steady given population increases. \u201cThe employment-to-population ratio remained steady at 64% in April, indicating that recent employment growth is broadly keeping pace with population growth,\u201d Jarvis said. \u201cThis suggests that the labour market remains tight, though less tight than late 2022 and early 2023.\u201d The timing of Easter \u2013 falling entirely within April \u2013 could also factor in the results. \u201cIn contrast to what we saw last year, when fewer people than usual took time off around the Easter holidays in April 2023, the proportion of people working reduced hours in April 2024 was more similar to what we saw before the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d Jarvis said. All states and territories posted a rise in the unemployment rate except Queensland, which remained steady at 4.1%. NSW\u2019s rate was up to 4% from 3.8%, Victoria rose to 4.2% from 4.1% and Western Australia jumped to 3.9% from 3.4%. The ACT, which had the lowest jobless rate at 2.9% in March, saw its figure pick up to 3.8%, still the lowest in the nation."

            "date": "2024-05-16T00:43:36Z",
            "content": "The Ukraine peace summit planned by Switzerland has so far drawn delegations from more than 50 countries, the Swiss president, Viola Amherd, has said. Russia has not been invited, but Switzerland says it might be if Moscow had not repeatedly stated it is not interested. The Ukrainian government has said Russia does not negotiate in good faith anyway. Amherd said she was in discussion about whether Switzerland might step aside from receiving a Patriot missile defence system that is due from the US, so Ukraine can get one sooner. The Ukrainian presidential office has said additional reinforcements were being deployed in the Kharkiv region, including army reserve units. Heavy enemy fire prompted repositioning of some troops in the Kupiansk direction to the east of Kharkiv city, the general staff said on Wednesday. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president, has postponed all his upcoming foreign trips, underscoring the seriousness of the threat his soldiers are facing. The Ukrainian military said troops fell back from areas in Lukyantsi and Vovchansk near Kharkiv \u201cto save the lives of our servicemen and avoid losses\u201d, Peter Beaumont writes. Vovchansk \u2013 5km (three miles) from the Russian border \u2013 has been the focus of much of the recent fighting, and Ukrainian and Russian troops battled in its streets on Wednesday. Oleksii Kharkivskyi, head of the city\u2019s patrol police, said Russian troops were taking up positions there, while the Ukrainian general staff said its forces were trying to flush them out. Russia\u2019s gains in the Kharkiv region must be a \u201cwake up call\u201d, the British defence secretary, Grant Shapps, has said, adding that allies had become \u201cdistracted\u201d from the war. \u201cWe must back [the Ukrainians] all the time, not just periodically,\u201d Shapps said, adding that a $60bn US military package \u201ctook too long to get through Congress\u201d. Visiting Kyiv, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has announced a $2bn arms deal, with most of the money coming from the package approved by Congress last month. Blinken said the US does not encourage Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with US-supplied weapons but believes it is a decision Kyiv should make for itself. The US was focused on providing Patriot missile systems and other forms of critical air defence, he said. The Russian defence ministry claimed its troops have retaken the village of Robotyne in the southern Zaporizhzhia region. The claim was unconfirmed. Ukrainian forces regained control of the village last August. Elsewhere in Ukraine\u2019s southern regions, an aerial attack on the central district of Kherson wounded 17 civilians, the regional prosecutor\u2019s office said. A Russian missile attack injured six people in Mykolaiv, according to Ukraine\u2019s rescue service. Vladimir Putin arrived in China on Thursday to meet with his counterpart Xi Jinping as he seeks greater support from Beijing for his war effort in Ukraine and his isolated economy. Putin, in an interview published in Xinhua ahead of his visit, hailed Beijing\u2019s \u201cgenuine desire\u201d to help resolve the Ukraine crisis. Blinken, who met Xi in Beijing last month, said China\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s \u201cbrutal war of aggression\u201d in Ukraine had helped Russia ramp up production of rockets, drones and tanks \u2013 while stopping short of direct arms exports. European Union ambassadors agreed in principle on Wednesday to add four Russian media outlets to the EU sanctions list, accusing them of propaganda: Voice of Europe, RIA Novosti, Izvestija and Rossiyskaya Gazeta. The EU also banned Russian funding of EU media, non-governmental organisations and political parties. It has previously imposed sanctions on Russian state-owned Russia Today and Sputnik."

            "date": "2024-05-28T15:02:20Z",
            "content": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Vladimir Putin will give a standing ovation to Joe Biden if the US president fails to attend a peace summit in Switzerland next month. On a visit to Brussels where he signed a 10-year security pact with Belgium, the Ukrainian leader said it would not be \u201ca strong decision\u201d if Biden failed to attend the talks scheduled for 15-16 June near Lucerne. \u201c[The] peace summit needs President Biden and so do the other leaders who look at the reaction of the United States. Putin will only applaud his absence, personally applaud it \u2013 and standing, at that,\u201d Zelenskiy said. The conference is being organised at Zelensky\u2019s request to secure \u201ca just and lasting peace\u201d but Russia has not been invited, so it remains unclear what it can achieve. More than 160 delegations have been invited, including members of the G7, G20, the EU, the Council of Europe and the UN. Zelenskiy said he was also expecting a reply from China and Brazil, and stressed that all participation mattered. \u201cBelieve me every voice is important.\u201d Belgium has pledged to send 30 F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine by 2028, with the first deliveries scheduled to arrive later this year. Zelenskiy said the delivery of jets in 2024 would \u201cmake our stance stronger\u201d but voiced frustration with western allies\u2019 restrictions on weapons being used against targets on Russian soil. He said Ukrainian troops were being killed or forced to retreat as Russian forces attacked them from the border near Kharkiv. At the weekend at least 12 people were killed and dozens injured when Russians attacked a DIY store in a residential district of Kharkiv. Referring to that attack, Zelenskiy said: \u201cEverything was blown up, children, people, civilians and you cannot answer [Russia]. You receive the satellite images from your intelligence but there is nothing you can do to respond. I think this is unfair. But \u2013 and this is a fact \u2013 we cannot risk the support of our partners. That is why we are not using our partners\u2019 arms to attack the Russian territory. That is why we are asking please give us the permission to do that.\u201d Hours later, Putin claimed that the west had provoked Russia\u2019s latest offensive into the Kharkiv region by ignoring Moscow\u2019s warnings not to allow Ukraine to strike the adjacent Russian region of Belgorod. Strikes on Russian territory by weapons supplied by the west to Ukraine were only possible with the help of specialists from western countries, Putin said, according to Reuters, and he added that this could lead to serious consequences. Zelenskiy\u2019s plea to end the limits on western weapons was supported by the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, who said it was time for EU member states to lift restrictions on Ukraine striking Russian territory. Pointing out that some allies had not imposed restrictions on weapons sent to Ukraine, Stoltenberg said: \u201cI believe the time has come to consider those restrictions, not least in light of the development in the war, the evolution into a war which now is actually taking place along the borders and that makes it even harder for them to defend themselves.\u201d Allowing Ukrainians to attack military sites on the other side of the frontline in Russia was legitimate, Stoltenberg said, echoing remarks from the EU\u2019s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, who said it was within the rules of war as long as it was within humanitarian law. Under the terms of the F-16 agreement with Belgium, Ukraine will not be allowed to use the Belgian jets to attack targets inside Russia. The Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said Belgium was working to deliver the first F-16s as soon as possible, without specifying how many would arrive this year. \u201cThe fact that we can add our planes ourselves already this year is a very important signal to make absolutely clear that Ukraine will have a full-blown capacity based on fighter jets in the months to come and in the years to come,\u201d De Croo said. Belgium promised jets last October and Zelenskiy said this was the first time that the exact number of F-16 fighter jets to be delivered to Ukraine by 2028 had been specified. Zelenskiy was in Brussels to sign a long-term support and security agreement between Ukraine and Belgium, which he said was worth \u20ac977m this year. Under the agreement Belgium will provide equipment for air forces and defences, naval security, mine clearance, military training and ammunition. The agreement touches on strengthening sanctions against Russia, justice, compensation and economic recovery. The two sides will also deepen cooperation on intelligence, cybersecurity and countering disinformation. On Monday Zelenskiy was in Spain where the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, pledged \u20ac1bn in military aid for Ukraine in a decade-long deal that Madrid said would strengthen Ukrainian air defences. The F-16, originally built by the US in a consortium with Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway, has become the most popular military aircraft of all time. Ukraine asked for 200 F-16 aircraft in January 2023 but it took months to persuade western allies to back a plan to train Ukrainian pilots to fly the jets. Switzerland\u2019s upper house of parliament has backed a motion to toughen measures to expel spies, taking aim at Russian intelligence agents before the peace summit. Voting 32 in favour and nine against late on Monday, legislators supported the motion entitled \u201csystematically expel Russian spies and other foreign spies\u201d. The Swiss president, Viola Amherd, said: \u201cForeign states should feel Switzerland is reacting to violations of its security and defending itself.\u201d"

            "content": "\u201cTech bros\u201d such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are \u201cthe largest dictators\u201d, Maria Ressa, who won the Nobel peace prize in 2021 for her defence of media freedom, has said. The American-Filipina journalist has spent a number of years fighting charges filed during then president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s administration, but said Duterte \u201cis a far smaller dictator compared to Mark Zuckerberg, and now let me throw in Elon Musk\u201d. Speaking at the Hay literary festival in Powys, Ressa said Zuckerberg and Musk have \u201cproven that we all, regardless of culture, language, or geography, have far more in common than we have differences because we\u2019re all being manipulated the same way\u201d. Social media platforms have the ability to \u201cchange the way we feel\u201d, she said, which in turn \u201cchanges the way we see the world and changes the way we act\u201d. Ressa said conversations about identity politics online have caused similar instances of polarisation across the world. These debates encourage \u201cthe kinds of questions that we think are our free will\u201d \u2013 but they are not, Ressa said. \u201cIn the Philippines, it was rich versus poor. In the United States, it\u2019s race,\u201d she said. \u201cBlack Lives Matter \u2026 was bombarded on both sides by Russian propaganda. And the goal was not to make people believe one thing. The goal was to burst this wide open to create chaos.\u201d The way tech companies are \u201cinciting polarisation, inciting fear and anger and hatred\u201d changes us \u201cat a personal level, a societal level\u201d, she said. She suggested two ways to lessen the control tech companies have over us. Firstly, she said, the US should get rid of section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, \u201cwhich is what gives these companies impunity\u201d. The section protects internet companies from lawsuits over content posted by their users. \u201cAnd the other one is, if you have kids, don\u2019t let them on [social media] until they\u2019re old enough,\u201d she said, because it is \u201cmildly addictive\u201d. While she thinks attempts to ban Chinese-owned TikTok in the US and Italy are \u201cgreat\u201d, it \u201cisn\u2019t just TikTok\u201d we should be worried about, but all social media \u2013 and the internet as a whole. \u201cWith generative AI, the quality of information you\u2019re getting is already getting crappier,\u201d she said, citing a study published earlier this year that showed a \u201cshocking\u201d amount of the web is generated by poor-quality AI. \u201cThat\u2019s before generative AI really was kicking in, and you know, at a certain point, it will drive us out,\u201d she said. She urged the audience at Hay to \u201cwalk into the real world\u201d and organise with their families and friends, \u201cbecause the information operations target you. And when you become a broadcast arm, you become part of the information test team\u201d."

            "date": "2024-05-08T05:45:34Z",
            "content": "Good morning. Israel has threatened to expand its military operation in Rafah after it seized control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing \u2013 which was the key remaining land route to get desperately needed aid into Gaza, where millions of people are suffering an escalating humanitarian crisis. The Israeli military said it had taken \u201coperational control\u201d of the border with Egypt in a \u201cprecise and limited operation\u201d, but gave notice that it will soon be followed by an \u201cextreme force\u201d ground offensive that the UN warns could lead to the \u201cslaughter of civilians\u201d. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has begun dropping flyers on relief camps in Rafah, ordering Palestinians \u2013 many of whom have already fled the conflict, sometimes several times \u2013 to immediately evacuate. The United States, the United Nations and the European Union have repeatedly warned Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, against attacking Rafah, but he has vowed to defy international pressure. \u201cWe\u2019ll go there,\u201d he said in an interview in March. \u201cYou know, I have a red line. You know what the red line is? That October 7 doesn\u2019t happen again. Never happens again.\u201d For today\u2019s newsletter I spoke to Peter Beaumont, a senior Guardian international reporter who has worked extensively in the region for decades, about the significance of the Rafah crossing and what the latest Israeli offensive means for the prospect of peace in a conflict that was ignited by the deaths of more than 1,100 Israelis and after seven months has resulted in at least 34,000 deaths among Palestinians. That\u2019s after the headlines. Five big stories Israel-Gaza war | Joe Biden\u2019s administration paused a shipment of weapons to Israel last week in opposition to apparent moves by the Israelis to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah, a senior administration official has said. Israel has launched a major military offensive against Hamas forces in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city, seizing control of a key border crossing and cutting off most aid a day before indirect talks on a ceasefire deal are due to restart. US | Donald Trump\u2019s criminal trial entered a new stage on Tuesday with testimony from Stormy Daniels, an adult film star at the center of his hush-money scandal. Daniels told jurors that she had a sexual liaison with Trump in 2006 that left her nervous and ashamed. Scotland | The new Scottish National party leader John Swinney will become Scotland\u2019s seventh first minister after winning the backing of MSPs. Swinney won the vote eight days after Humza Yousaf announced his departure. Health | The Cass review \u201cabsolutely\u201d did not set an unfairly high bar for evidence, its author has said, as she addressed \u201csignificant misinformation\u201d about her assessment of healthcare provision for gender-questioning young people in England and Wales. Garrick Club | The men-only Garrick Club in London has finally voted to allow women to become members, 193 years after it first opened its doors. 562 members (59.98%) voted in favour and 375 (40.02%) against, in a private meeting where several hundred members spent two hours debating whether to permit women to join. In depth: \u2018God knows where we will go now\u2019 \u201cRafah was the one border crossing not directly under Israel\u2019s control,\u201d says Peter. \u201cAnd they have long vowed to take control of it, as they see it as key to stopping Hamas as they can try to cut off their supplies.\u201d Peter says that if you think of the Gaza Strip as an oblong, Israel borders it to the north and the east. On the west is the Mediterranean, which is patrolled by Israeli gun boats enforcing a naval blockade. \u201cThat leaves the small southern border with Egypt, and the Rafah crossing, which was very tightly controlled by Egypt as the only release valve allowing aid in and people on the evacuation list to get out.\u201d The release \u2013 or apparently authorised leak \u2013 of clips of soldiers raising Israeli flags and using a tank to destroy a concrete \u201cI Love Gaza\u201d sign at the crossing also suggest a symbolic purpose to the offensive, the Guardian\u2019s Jason Burke says in his analysis from Jerusalem. \u201cThis may be to frame the operation as the final \u2013 and so far elusive \u2013 victory ahead of concessions in negotiations,\u201d he writes. The nearby Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza, which was also a route for getting aid into Gaza, has been shut since Sunday after four Israeli soldiers stationed there were killed in rocket attacks. It led Jens Laerke, the United Nations humanitarian spokesperson, to warn that the crisis in Gaza will now rapidly escalate. \u201cThe two main arteries for getting aid into Gaza are currently choked off,\u201d he said. \u201cIf no fuel comes in for a prolonged period of time it would be a very effective way of putting the humanitarian operation in its grave.\u201d The European Union\u2019s chief diplomat Josep Borrell said: \u201cThe Rafah offensive has started again in spite [of] all the requests of the international community, the US, the European Union member states, everybody asking Netanyahu not to attack. I am afraid that this is going to cause again a lot of casualties, civilian casualties. Whatever they say.\u201d *** Where are the people in Rafah being evacuated to? IDF leaflet drops, mass text messages and social media posts warn that the military will \u201cact with extreme force against the terrorist organisations in the areas where you live\u201d. It orders that \u201cfor your safety, the Israel Defence Forces calls on you to evacuate immediately to the humanitarian zone\u201d. The leaflets, in Arabic, show a map with nine blocks in south-eastern Rafah where it says IDF forces will be operating, and instructs about 100,000 people living or sheltering there to immediately evacuate to al-Mawasi, a strip of land along the Mediterranean coast. In social media posts, the IDF said it had expanded the al-Mawasi area with more \u201cfield hospitals, tents and increased amounts of food, water, medication and additional supplies\u201d. However, aid agencies warned that the area does not have the infrastructure to cope with a fresh influx of people. \u201cAl-Mawasi has been designated a so-called \u2018safe humanitarian zone\u2019, but it is not safe,\u201d Islamic Relief said. \u201cCivilians sheltering there say they continue to face attacks and severe shortages of food, water and other vital aid. Forcing more people there will make the humanitarian crisis even worse.\u201d Tjada D\u2019Oyen McKenna, chief executive of humanitarian aid charity Mercy Corps, said al-Mawasi was already \u201cuninhabitable\u201d before the evacuation order. \u201cOur team members report tents stretched endlessly under scorching sun with no relief in sight and no electricity, water, or aid.\u201d Among families leaving Rafah with their possessions piled up on pickup trucks and donkey carts was Abdullah Al-Najar, who told Reuters it was the fourth time his family had been displaced since the war began in October. \u201cGod knows where we will go now,\u201d he said. *** What does the Rafah offensive mean for prospects of a ceasefire? The IDF\u2019s seizure of the border yesterday morning came just hours after Hamas said it had accepted a three-stage ceasefire-for-hostage deal brokered by Egypt, Qatar and the US. It would have led to an initial 42-day ceasefire and the release of the remaining Israeli hostages seized by Hamas during the 7 October attacks in exchange for the release of Palestinians held in Israeli jails. But, on Monday night \u2013 shortly before the offensive on the Rafah crossing \u2013 Netanyahu rejected the Hamas proposal, which he said was \u201cfar from Israel\u2019s requirements\u201d. He said his negotiators would continue to engage in talks \u201cto exhaust the possibility of reaching an agreement under conditions acceptable to Israel\u201d. Netanyahu is under pressure from his far-right coalition partners not to accept a deal that leaves Hamas in charge of any part of Gaza. They have told him that if he is seen to have gone too soft on Hamas they will resign and collapse the government. Finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has said the government would have \u201cno right to exist\u201d unless Israel invades Rafah. At the same time, Netanyahu is also facing growing pressure from Israelis to agree to a ceasefire. On Monday night protesters marched towards his residence in Jerusalem with a banner reading: \u201cThe blood is on your hands\u201d. Peter says that while the Rafah offensive has ratcheted up the pressure of the war, it does not necessarily make the signing of a ceasefire deal less likely. \u201cJust because people are killing each other doesn\u2019t mean a ceasefire can\u2019t happen,\u201d he says. \u201cWars often finish with extreme violence. You can have two things going on at the same time \u2013 a military track and negotiation track \u2013 right up to the wire.\u201d The US last night expressed optimism that a ceasefire deal was still within reach. \u201cA close assessment of the two sides\u2019 positions suggests that they should be able to close the remaining gaps,\u201d White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we can to support that process and achieve that outcome.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading No corner of Gazan society has escaped the crushing devastation of the war.

            "date": "2024-05-05T06:00:05Z",
            "content": "This year\u2019s Cop29 UN climate summit will be the first \u201cCop of peace\u201d, focusing on the prevention of future climate-fuelled conflicts and using international cooperation on green issues to help heal existing tensions, according to plans being drawn up by organisers. Nations may be asked to observe a \u201cCop truce\u201d, suspending hostilities for the fortnight-long duration of the conference, modelled on the Olympic truce, which is observed by most governments during the summer and winter Olympic Games. Cop29 will be held in November in Baku, the capital city of Azerbaijan, amid two big wars \u2013 the Ukraine invasion and the Israel-Gaza conflict \u2013 raging in neighbouring regions and worsening geopolitical tensions. But the host country\u2019s top national security adviser said that the climate summit, which 196 governments are expected to attend, could become an engine for peace, by finding common ground among countries in the urgent need to tackle global heating. \u201cAzerbaijan continues and will exert additional efforts to make Cop yet another success story with regard to peace, and to make Cop29 a Cop of peace alongside the climate action issue,\u201d said Hikmet Hajiyev, foreign policy adviser to the president, Ilham Aliyev, in an interview with the Observer in Baku. \u201cWe are working on the advancement of the peace agenda.\u201d The climate crisis is likely to exacerbate food and water shortages, and could increase migration, adding to pressures on states and potentially sparking border issues, he warned. \u201cSecurity isn\u2019t about hardware \u2013 it has many elements, and you cannot deny climate action, environment change or environmental problems [are relevant to national security and peace],\u201d he said. \u201cWe are affected by climate change \u2013 it\u2019s part of national security and global security.\u201d Hajiyev would like to see nations observe a \u201cCop truce\u201d, but conceded this would be difficult. \u201cWe are discussing with different partners about a Cop truce, like in the Olympics. But it is at an early stage of thinking. It will require additional consultations and discussion,\u201d he said. Until late last year, Azerbaijan was locked in a 30-year conflict with neighbouring Armenia over disputed territory and ethnic differences. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, hostilities between the majority Muslim Azerbaijanis and the Christian majority in neighbouring Armenia had been partially resolved in a 1994 ceasefire. But the simmering tension flared into violence in 2020, leading to more than 7,000 deaths and the displacement of tens of thousands of people. Each side has accused the other of ethnic cleansing. In December 2023 the countries negotiated a peace deal, which has held. However, there are still disputes over the status of some detainees. At the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai in December last year, Armenia supported Azerbaijan\u2019s campaign to hold this year\u2019s climate conference, the first international gesture of support between the two longtime antagonists. Hajiyev said that this experience was what led Azerbaijan to focus on global peace at Cop29. \u201cOur approach to the peace agenda is living by example.\u201d It is understood that there is nervousness in some quarters at the UN over tying the issues of the climate crisis and national security too closely together. The fear is that bad feeling over global conflicts could spill over to affect the climate negotiations, and it could be safer to keep them as separate issues. Putting peace on the agenda at Cop29 also throws a spotlight on Azerbaijan\u2019s conduct in the war with Armenia, and its human rights record, which has attracted strong criticism. Mary Robinson, a former president of Ireland and UN high commissioner for human rights, who has also twice served as a UN climate envoy, is now chair of the Elders group of former world political and business leaders. She said she welcomed the intention to focus on peace, noting there were precedents in the work of environmental activists who linked their work with healing conflicts. But she voiced concern over Azerbaijan\u2019s stance. She said: \u201cI think the idea is a good idea. If we could make more of climate and security and peace, that would be a good step.\u201d But she added: \u201cI\u2019m not sure the peace with Armenia is a perfect peace, to say the least. There are very big issues. There are political prisoners, I am part of a campaign to try to get them released. We should hold [Azerbaijan] to account for their own human rights record.\u201d Hajiyev told the Observer that NGOs and civil society groups would be \u201cmost welcome\u201d at Cop29."

            "title": "Sunak dashed for July election because hopes of UK economic recovery are fading",
            "date": "2024-05-26T05:00:46Z",
            "content": "There was an economic logic to Rishi Sunak\u2019s election dash, a decision that defied earlier predictions of a vote in the autumn or even winter. The prime minister could see that hopes of a recovery were fading, and with them his chances of redemption as the architect of Britain\u2019s future prosperity. Unemployment was going to continue rising. Inflation, after falling steadily over the past year, could bounce back in the autumn. And interest rates, which are a burden for mortgage payers and indebted businesses alike, looked like remaining stubbornly high. This all meant an economy that had looked set a few months ago to be gathering strength without generating higher inflation \u2013 and with flat prices allowing the Bank of England to reduce the cost of borrowing \u2013 would be at best a neutral factor in the election, and at worst a stick for Labour to beat the government with. A vote-enhancing outcome was still possible, but the balance of risk had shifted \u2013 and not in Sunak\u2019s favour. Crucial to this outlook for the economy were less-than-sunny reports from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). They both predicted that, after a modest bounceback from last year\u2019s recession, the momentum to drive growth would be lacking until at least next year. The OECD was especially pessimistic: it poured buckets of cold water on Sunak\u2019s aspirations by suggesting that annual growth this year would be just 0.4%. The IMF pitched in with a slightly higher increase of 0.7%. Official figures published after these reports showed that in the first three months of the year the economy grew by 0.6%, but privately many economists thought this would be revised down at a later date, and that with the Conservatives still in charge, growth would not climb above 1% for 2024. Some Tory strategists, keen on playing a longer game, focused their hopes on a bigger drop in inflation through the year than was expected by the major international forecasters. If inflation fell below the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2% and stayed there, these insiders believed, the central bank would be duty bound to reduce interest rates. Three or four cuts could, they thought, see the rate drop from its current 5.25% to nearer 4%, generating a feelgood factor that could disguise stagnation in the wider economy. The Capital Economics consultancy has predicted that inflation will follow this path, falling dramatically over the next few months and staying low, triggering a series of interest rate cuts. However, some forecasters sit firmly on the other side of the fence, arguing that inflation could return, as it has in the US. One of the reasons Joe Biden has failed to benefit from an economic bounce can be found in the inflation figures that dropped earlier this year to almost 3% before rising back to 3.5% in March and staying at about that level in April. The US central bank has made it clear that interest rates are on hold until there are clear signs of inflation dropping back consistently to 2%. UK inflation dropped to 2.3% in April, but that was a smaller-than-expected fall, and once analysts dug into the data, they found signs of persistently high price rises in the services sector that were likely to prevent overall inflation falling much further. This persuaded the financial markets that the UK was likely to follow the Federal Reserve and push back the first interest rate cut, possibly to November. Sunak was also shocked by the IMF\u2019s assessment of the public finances and its view that a \u00a330bn gap had appeared between what the government expected to spend and its forecast revenues over the next five years. The IMF said that, to be certain of stabilising debt by 2029-30, the government would need to increase borrowing, raise taxes or make savings equivalent to 1% of GDP \u2013 roughly \u00a330bn. Deficit figures from the Office for National Statistics supported this view, showing that the government was off to a poor start in April, the first month of the financial year. A July election allows Sunak to boast about figures that register a modest return to growth in the first quarter, low unemployment and rising consumer confidence. He can say inflation is falling, and there is every sign it will have dropped again when figures for May appear \u2013 on 19 June, two weeks before polling day. Such bragging is unlikely to win favour with a public battered by waves of unnecessary economic shocks, from Boris Johnson\u2019s hard Brexit to Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget fiasco. The millions of people barely able to cope with shop prices 20% higher than they were in 2021 will also need a more substantial recovery before they can smile again. The logic for Sunak of going to the polls early is clear. What is more difficult to discern is how it changes the outcome."

            "title": "Jeremy Hunt accused of exaggerating Tories\u2019 economic record",
            "date": "2024-05-17T17:04:34Z",
            "content": "Jeremy Hunt has been accused of exaggerating the Conservatives\u2019 economic record and presenting a \u201cdodgy dossier\u201d on Labour\u2019s spending plans, as he moved to put low tax at the heart of his party\u2019s offering at the next election. The chancellor gave a speech in central London on Friday, pitching the Conservatives as having helped the UK recover from economic troubles more quickly than expected. He also signalled a further cut to national insurance in the autumn, having already reduced the tax from 12p in the pound to 8p. \u201cIf we can afford to go further, responsibly, to reduce the double tax on work this autumn, that is what I will do,\u201d he said, arguing the economy had already \u201cturned a corner\u201d. In contrast, he painted Labour as a party of high tax and released a dossier claiming it had \u00a338bn of unfunded policies, from spending on more GP appointments to extra mental health support teams. The costings were carried out by civil servants at the request of the government, but were based on interpretations of Labour\u2019s policies provided by Conservative special advisers. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, described the document as a \u201cdesperate and cheap political stunt with a flawed dodgy dossier to distract from the Tories\u2019 record in government\u201d. \u201cBut if the Tories want to play that game, we\u2019re happy to play it because we are confident our plans are fully funded and costed,\u201d he said. Labour said there were at least 11 serious flaws in the Conservatives\u2019 claims about the opposition\u2019s spending on policies and that the Tories had stated they wanted to abolish national insurance, which would cost \u00a346bn, without saying how they would pay for that. Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government and a former Treasury civil servant, said such costings from Whitehall should be \u201ctaken with a very large pinch of salt\u201d as they were commissioned by government ministers and relied on their political advisers\u2019 assumptions. Economists also questioned Hunt\u2019s claims that the Conservatives had managed the economy well over the last 14 years. In his speech, Hunt acknowledged families had been \u201cbattered by the global shocks\u201d of the Covid pandemic and the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine but argued the Conservatives had sheltered people\u2019s finances. He also insisted the economy was doing well, with inflation down to 3% and the country emerging from a shallow recession with a \u201csoft landing\u201d. Dario Perkins, a former Treasury official who now heads global research at the economics consultancy TS Lombard, said Hunt\u2019s claim that Conservative policies had benefited the UK economy was \u201cbizarre\u201d. He said: \u201cWe have had the worst decade of productivity growth since the Industrial Revolution and shockingly low levels of public and business investment. And this has led to an enormous squeeze on living standards. \u201cThe Conservatives had an obsession with austerity after the financial crash [in 2008] at a time when businesses and households were also cutting back on borrowing, which was a calamity for the economy. \u201cIt is hard to see how, if you are looking at the long-term health of the economy, you pull anything positive out of the last 14 years.\u201d Carys Roberts, the executive director at the IPPR thinktank, also questioned Hunt\u2019s interpretation, saying: \u201cThe economic story of the last 14 years has been one of turbulence. \u201cWithout a doubt the financial crisis, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine have put external pressures on the UK economy. However, the UK has experienced meagre productivity growth, stagnant incomes and deepening regional inequalities, and these have deeper roots than the recent pressures. There is much to be proud of in the UK but our recent economic record is not one of them.\u201d Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said Hunt was \u201cquite right to draw attention\u201d to the pandemic and energy shock, which were \u201cnot the fault of the government\u201d. He said it was certainly the case that \u201creal earnings are rising at the moment but our expectation is that household incomes will be no higher at the end of this year than they were at 2019, which is pretty remarkable\u201d. He added: \u201cWhat we have had is a long period of stagnation and if you look over a year or 18 months, we are still in a period of stagnation. \u201cThe first quarter\u2019s numbers, we will have to wait until they are repeated two or three times before we are really confident that things are turning round. But if you look at the last two years, it is basically a picture of stagnation, with what might be the beginning of a more significant uptick now, but too early to start getting excited.\u201d In his speech, Hunt also hit out at Labour for claiming the Conservatives\u2019 ambition to get rid of national insurance would lead to the end of the state pension in its current form. The chancellor said it was \u201cfake news\u201d and a lie intended to scare older people, and that pensioners should trust the Conservatives to cut taxes. However, pensioners\u2019 tax levels are not lowered by cuts to national insurance as it is a tax on earnings from employment. Hunt\u2019s speech is the fourth major press conference held by a senior politician in the past two weeks. He followed the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer, as the parties move into election campaign mode. No date has been announced yet."

            "date": "2024-05-20T15:00:12Z",
            "content": "A device that stimulates the spinal nerves with electrical pulses appears to boost how well people recover from major spinal cord injuries, doctors say. An international trial found that patients who had lost some or all use of their hands and arms after a spinal cord injury regained strength, control and sensation when the stimulation was applied during standard rehabilitation exercises. The improvements were small but were described by doctors and patients as life-changing because of the impact they had on the patients\u2019 daily routines and quality of life. \u201cIt actually makes it easier for people to move, including people who have complete loss of movement in their hands and arms,\u201d said Prof Chet Moritz, in the department of rehabilitation medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle. \u201cThe benefits accumulate gradually over time as we pair this spinal stimulation with intensive therapy of the hands and arms, such that there are benefits even when the stimulator is turned off.\u201d Rather than being implanted, the Arc-Ex device is worn externally and uses electrodes that are placed on the skin near the section of the spinal cord responsible for controlling a particular movement or function. The researchers believe that electrical stimulation helps nerves that remain intact after the injury to send signals and ultimately partially restore some communication between the brain and paralysed body part. More than half of patients who suffer spinal cord injuries still have some intact nerves that cross the injury site. Melanie Reid, a journalist and writer who was left with very little function below her armpits after breaking her neck aged 52 when she fell of a horse 14 years ago, took part in the UK section of the trial in Scotland. After the trial, which involved two months of rehabilitation and a further two months of rehabilitation with stimulation, she got some grip back in her left hand which had been \u201cuseless\u201d. \u201cMy left hand is much stronger,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got some grip back in it. I can scroll a tablet or a phone in my left hand, I can release a seatbelt with it, and I can \u2026 put my hair in a ponytail again, which I couldn\u2019t do before,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone thinks that [with a] spinal injury, all you want to do is be able to walk again. But if you\u2019re tetraplegic or a quadriplegic, what matters most is working hands. There are no miracles in spinal injury, but tiny gains can be life-changing.\u201d The Up-Lift trial, reported in Nature Medicine, enrolled 65 tetraplegic patients in 14 countries. Of 60 who completed the trial, 43 showed improvements in strength and function and 52 reported improvements in quality of life. The device, produced by Onward Medical, a firm co-founded by a researcher on the study, Gr\u00e9goire Courtine, could be approved in the US this year and in Europe soon after. Dr Mariel Purcell, who led part of the Up-Lift trial at the Queen Elizabeth national spinal injuries unit in Glasgow, said the treatment had been proved safe and \u201cof some benefit\u201d to patients who experienced their injuries more than a year ago. \u201cIn newly injured patients with standard rehabilitation, non-invasive spinal cord stimulation may have profound benefit,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no other treatment like this.\u201d Another patient, Sherown Campbell, who took part in the trial at Craig hospital in Colorado, was paralysed by a neck injury while wrestling a friend in 2014. He regained some movement through rehabilitation soon after the accident, but experienced more gains in the trial. He improved his typing speed from 25 to 33 words a minute and can now help more around the house with cooking and doing activities with his children. \u201cTo see benefits at this point in my injury is really huge,\u201d he said. Prof Courtine said the trial \u201cdemonstrated the principle\u201d and that the researchers would now investigate whether it could help other functions such as walking. \u201cThis is not a cure, it\u2019s important to stress that, but we\u2019re at the beginning of a journey that makes recovery from spinal injury a real possibility,\u201d he said."

            "content": "Hospital surgical teams that include more female doctors improve patient outcomes, lower the risk of serious complications and could in turn reduce healthcare costs, according to the world\u2019s largest study of its kind. Studies show diversity is important in business, finance, tech, education and the law not only for equity but for output. However, evidence supporting the value of sex diversity in healthcare teams has been limited. Now researchers who examined more than 700,000 operations spanning a decade report that hospitals with more women in their surgical teams provide better outcomes for patients. The findings were published in the British Journal of Surgery. \u201cCare in hospitals with greater anaesthesia-surgery team sex diversity was associated with better postoperative outcomes,\u201d the researchers concluded. \u201cThe main takeaway for clinical practice and health policy is that increasing operating room teams\u2019 sex diversity is not a question of representation or social justice, but an important part of optimising performance. \u201cHealthcare institutions should intentionally foster sex diversity in operating room teams to potentially reduce major morbidity, which, in turn, can enhance patient satisfaction and reduce costs.\u201d In the study, led by the University of Toronto, researchers analysed 709,899 elective operations that took place in 88 hospitals in Ontario, Canada, between 2009 and 2019. Of those surgeries, 90-day major morbidity \u2013 serious complications within three months of the operation \u2013 occurred in 14.4% of cases. The median proportion of female anaesthesiologists and surgeons a hospital a year was 28%. Overall, female surgeons performed 47,874 (6.7%) of the operations. Female anaesthesiologists treated patients in 192,144 (27%) of operations. Hospitals with teams comprising more than 35% female surgeons and anaesthesiologists had better postoperative outcomes, the study found. Operations in such hospitals were associated with a 3% reduction in the odds of 90-day postoperative major morbidity in patients. The researchers noted that the 35% threshold they observed echoed findings from research in other industries in various countries, including the US, Italy, Australia and Japan, that also showed better outcomes once teams had 35% female members. \u201cCare by a female surgeon increased the association of higher team sex diversity with outcomes, whereas this was not observed for care by a male surgeon,\u201d the researchers added. \u201cThis indicates that having higher team sex diversity and care by a female surgeon had a greater association with outcomes than the sum of each. The same was observed for care by female anaesthetists.\u201d Dr Julie Hallet, the lead author of the study at the University of Toronto, said: \u201cThese results are the start of an important shift in understanding the way in which diversity contributes to quality in perioperative care.\u201d \u201cEnsuring a critical mass of female anaesthesiologists and surgeons in operative teams isn\u2019t just about equity; it seems necessary to optimise performance.\u201d Previous studies have suggested that patients who are operated on by women are less likely to experience complications or need follow-up care than when treated by men. However, Hallet said her research team wanted to challenge \u201cthe binary discourse of comparing female and male clinicians\u201d and instead \u201chighlight the importance of diversity as a team asset or bonus in enhancing quality care\u201d. Improving sex diversity in surgical teams will require \u201cintentional effort\u201d to ensure systematic recruitment and retainment policies for female doctors, she added."

            "date": "2024-05-24T12:47:02Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak\u2019s slim chance of pulling off a victory against the odds in July\u2019s general election depends on voters buying the argument that tough decisions taken since he became prime minister are paying off. That claim will be tested over the next six weeks \u2013 with every piece of economic news more closely scrutinised than usual for evidence that the UK\u2019s tentative economic recovery is gaining momentum or has started to falter. There are five key dates \u2013 crammed into a 10-day period in the middle of the campaign \u2013 to look out for. 11 June: labour market figures This could be one of the trickier pieces of economic news for Sunak to cope with since the last set of official data showed unemployment rising and job vacancies declining. Despite this evidence that the labour market is cooling, earnings growth remained strong, rising at an annual rate of 5.9%. In better news for the prime minister, wages have been rising more strongly than prices for the past 10 months, resulting in rising living standards. The Conservatives will say: four million jobs have been created since 2010 and workers are becoming better off. Labour will say: for the first time in recent history, voters will be worse off at the end of a parliament than they were at the start. 12 June: growth figures for April One factor behind Sunak\u2019s decision to call an election was the unexpectedly strong growth figures for the first three months of 2024, which showed national output 0.6% higher than in the final three months of 2023 and brought to an end the UK\u2019s short and shallow recession. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, expects gross domestic product to rise by 02% between March and April, pushing up the quarterly growth rate from 0.6% to 0.8%. The Conservatives will say: Britain is growing faster than other leading developed economies. Labour will say: over the past 14 years Britain\u2019s growth and productivity record has been dismal. 19 June: annual inflation in the year to May This is probably the most important single piece of economic news during the campaign, given Sunak\u2019s claim that the UK\u2019s cost of living problem has now been cracked. The all-items annual inflation rate came down from 3.2% in March to 2.3% in April and is set to fall further in May. In part, that\u2019s because consumer prices rose by 0.7% last May, a hefty increase that is unlikely to be repeated this year. Bruna Skarica, the chief UK economist at Morgan Stanley, sees the headline inflation rate falling to 2% \u2013 smack on the government\u2019s target. Services inflation, which is closely watched by the Bank of England, should fall from 5.9% to 5.4%, Skarica says. The Conservatives will say: our tough action has brought stability to the economy. Labour will say: prices are 20% higher than they were at the start of the cost of living crisis and are still going up. 20 June: Bank of England interest rate decision The Bank of England raised interest rates 14 times between December 2021 and August 2023 \u2013 a jump from 0.1% to 5.25% \u2013 and there had been growing speculation that its monetary policy committee might start reducing borrowing costs at its June meeting. In theory, there is nothing to prevent the Bank cutting rates during an election campaign, but it would need to have strong evidence to do so. The City now sees little chance of a rate cut next month, with attention focused on whether the Bank will cut rates at its first post-election meeting in August. The Conservatives will say: interest rates are coming down soon because we have fixed the economy. Labour will say: homeowners are paying for Tory mismanagement through higher mortgage rates. 21 June: retail sales and public finances The last of the big five economic events between now and the election, and, while less significant than the other four, it is not without interest. A strong retail sales number would chime with recent evidence that consumers are feeling more confident about the state of their own finances and the economy more generally. Falling retail sales would suggest the absence of a feelgood factor. The poor state of the public finances helps explain why Sunak called an early election because had they been in better shape Jeremy Hunt would now be planning to cut national insurance contributions for a third time in an early autumn statement. The size of the May deficit will have little bearing on the election but will provide a guide to the difficult choices either a Conservative or Labour chancellor might be faced with in the next parliament. The deficit in May 2023 was just over \u00a314bn. The Conservatives will say: life is getting better, so don\u2019t let Labour wreck things. Labour will say: you are paying higher taxes because the Tories crashed the car. Take away the keys. Dales says overall the economic news over the next six weeks will be \u201creasonably positive\u201d but suspects it will not have much of an impact. \u201cPeople\u2019s views on the economy are formed and baked in,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are not going to change that much.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-01T09:00:53Z",
            "content": "No soccer league in the world is experiencing a boom comparative to the NWSL in 2024. Last month, the world\u2019s first purpose-built stadium for a women\u2019s sports franchise opened in Kansas City, marking the new home of the Current. San Diego Wave broke its NWSL home opener attendance record with over 32,000 fans, while the NWSL was listed at No 5 on the World\u2019s 50 Most Innovative Companies of 2024. \u201cAt the NWSL we are working to drive innovation, growth and increased investment in women\u2019s soccer,\u201d Jessica Berman, the NWSL\u2019s commissioner, tells the Guardian. \u201cI\u2019m excited about the 2024 season and to see what else we can accomplish in the women\u2019s soccer space.\u201d The NWSL\u2019s recent accolades are another reminder of the growth of not just women\u2019s soccer, but women\u2019s sports as a whole. The 2023 headlines focused on the Women\u2019s World Cup, which was the most attended and generated the most revenue in tournament history. That was a precursor for the start of 2024, which has already seen unprecedented numbers for women\u2019s sport (the final of the Women\u2019s NCAA Tournament this month averaged 18.7 million viewers in the US, and was the most watched basketball game since 2019). Deloitte estimates that in 2024 women\u2019s elite sports will generate over $1bn for the first time, at least 300% higher than 2021. And with the NWSL\u2019s two expansion teams, Bay FC and the Utah Royals, arriving alongside a massive new broadcasting deal, it\u2019s clear that the investment in women\u2019s sports is paying off. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that the NWSL has a pervasive geographical footprint as we think about growing the game and all of the national revenue streams from a media and sponsorship perspective,\u201d Berman says. \u201cGoing from 12 to 14 NWSL teams is significant. We\u2019re also selling an expansion team for 2026, so we will have 16 teams for the 2026 season which will be another level up.\u201d Since Berman became the NWSL commissioner in 2022, she\u2019s been working to elevate women\u2019s soccer by growing the league and increasing the value of its teams. Before Berman\u2019s reign, NWSL franchises were sold for somewhere between $2m and $5m. In March, however, San Diego Wave\u2019s principal owner Ron Burkle agreed to sell the team for around $113m. These rapidly rising valuations, combined with the league\u2019s growing audience, are key markers of growth \u2013 and a new precedent for women\u2019s sports. \u201cAs the business grows there will be additional mechanisms that investors will analyze as a way to get a return on their investment,\u201d Berman says. \u201cSo you can think of players as assets \u2026 We are investing in athletes and their wellbeing because that\u2019s the product we put on the pitch, and there becomes a buyer and seller market for transfer players, which exists on the men\u2019s side.\u201d The NWSL is different from leagues in Europe, where women\u2019s teams sometimes come second to the men\u2019s \u2013 which is why the NWSL has implemented minimum standards across the league regarding staffing and resources. In the last two years, the size of the league office has tripled. Berman has also worked to bring some of the world\u2019s best players to the NWSL (notably Bay FC signing Nigeria international Asisat Oshoala in January) and to create an ecosystem for players to thrive. \u201cThese are things like medical and coaching staff, and other tools and resources that are available not just directly to players, but to the people around the players whose job it is to maximize and optimize their performance as professional athletes,\u201d Berman says. \u201cThis is sort of expected and taken for granted on the men\u2019s side, because candidly it\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been done. For women\u2019s sports, it requires specific policies so everyone understands the expectations of how we\u2019re going to take our product to the next level, and ensure the players feel like they\u2019re getting the support they need to thrive.\u201d One area of focus is injuries. The league is working to prevent injury, promote recovery amid increasing workloads and \u201cschedule squeezes\u201d from international matches. While the NWSL cannot change the Fifa calendar, the league has decided to minimize midweek games and use technology and experts to collect data and assess player wellbeing day-to-day. \u201cThinking differently about what we can directly control in our schedule allows the NWSL to provide the best possible playing experience for our players, but also the best viewing experience for our fans,\u201d Berman says. \u201cThe best experience for our fans also comes with having healthy, top talent.\u201d But with top talent comes top pay. In order to maintain quality and attract the best players, the NWSL has doubled its salary cap from 2023 to 2024. According to Berman, the NWSL has \u201ca handful of players\u201d who are making close to $500,000 a year, a figure that seemed impossible a few short years ago, which also results in more competitive matches for fans and thus, more sold out stadiums. \u201cAll the games, absolutely all of them, are like a Champions League game at the highest level,\u201d Esther Gonz\u00e1lez, a World Cup winner with Spain and a current NJ/NY Gotham forward, said in 2023. Berman believes these factors have allowed the NWSL to become a world leader and to help influence other leagues and women\u2019s sports globally. \u201cThe NWSL is trying to help the entire ecosystem think differently about how decisions in the sport impact the entire landscape. It\u2019s crucial to get these decisions right. And it\u2019s going to require a lot of different constituents and stakeholders to come together and decide how to do that most effectively,\u201d Berman says. The next big event for women\u2019s soccer is this summer\u2019s Olympics \u2013 which, like the World Cup, will have more eyes on female athletes than ever before. For Berman, events like the Olympics, W Gold Cup, World Cup are positive ways to showcase and follow players on a global stage, almost an exclamation point for how the game has grown. However, Berman says there needs to be more intentionality when it comes to supporting these players year-round. \u201cIf you\u2019re watching your favorite player on the world\u2019s stage, know that they are employed and paid by their professional clubs. And so if you enjoyed seeing Christine Sinclair play for Canada for example, know that she\u2019s employed and paid by the Portland Thorns,\u201d Berman says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to wait to watch these players once every four years. You can watch them every week in the NWSL. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to support and grow women\u2019s soccer.\u201d"

            "content": "When digital computers were invented, the first task was to instruct them to do what we wanted. The problem was that the machines didn\u2019t understand English \u2013 they only knew ones and zeros. You could program them with long sequences of these two digits and if you got the sequence right then the machines would do what you wanted. But life\u2019s too short for composing infinite strings of ones and zeros, so we began designing programming languages that allowed us to express our wishes in a human-readable form that could then be translated (by a piece of software called a \u201ccompiler\u201d) into terms that machines could understand and obey. Over the next 60 years or so, these programming languages \u2013 with names such as Fortran, Basic, Algol, COBOL, PL/1, LISP, C, C++, Python \u2013 proliferated like rabbits, so that there are now many hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of them. At any rate, it takes quite a while to scroll down to the end of the Wikipedia page that lists them. Some are very specialised, others more general, and over the years programmers created libraries of snippets of code (called subroutines) for common tasks \u2013 searching and sorting, for example \u2013 that you could incorporate when writing a particular program. For more than half a century, therefore, an arcane, exclusive priesthood evolved, of people who had mastered one or more of these specialised languages and were able to make computers do their bidding. Membership of the priesthood gave one an intoxicating feeling of absolute power. In software, remember, you can program a set of pixels to move endlessly in a circle, say, and they will continue to do that for ever if you leave them to it. They need neither fuel nor food, and they will never complain. \u201cIn that sense,\u201d I once wrote when writing a history of this technology, \u201cbeing a programmer is like being Napoleon before the retreat from Moscow. Software is the only medium in which the limits are exclusively those set by your imagination.\u201d This is why, when large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT emerged, many people were flabbergasted to discover that not only could these machines compose coherent English sentences, but they could also write computer programs! Instead of having to master the byzantine intricacies of C++ or Python in order to converse with the machine, you could explain what you wanted it to do and it would spit out the necessary code. You could program the machine in plain English! How was this possible? Essentially because, in its training phase, the machine has ingested a lot of published computer code \u2013 just as it has also ingested virtually every examination paper that has ever been published. And although the computer code that it produces often has flaws in it, they can often be ironed out in successive iterations. The technology is already pretty good, which is why programmers have been early adopters of it as a kind of \u201cco-pilot\u201d. And it will get steadily better. So are we seeing the twilight of the software priesthood, as some of the more apocalyptic reactions to LLMs claim? Personally I doubt it, if only because we always overestimate the short-term impact of tech change, while underestimating its longer-term effects. What these AI \u201cco-pilots\u201d really do is take the grunt work out of programming, freeing those who understand software to do more interesting and productive things. When GitHub, the programmers\u2019 repository owned by Microsoft, quizzed more than 2,000 professional software professionals about the technology, the results supported that view: 88% said that it made them more productive; 59% said it made the job less frustrating; 74% said that it had enabled them to focus on \u201cmore satisfying work\u201d; 96% found that it made them faster when doing repetitive tasks; and 77% said that they now spent less time searching. This is the image not of Armageddon, but of something more positive. And already, AI co-pilots are beginning to change how programming itself is taught. Most introductory computer science courses tended to focus on code syntax and getting programs to run, and while knowing how to read and write code is still essential, testing and debugging now need to be taught more explicitly. Academics are finding that the fact that students are using AI tools frees up time \u201cto teach higher-level thinking \u2013 for example, how to design software, what is the right problem to solve, and what are the solutions? Students can spend more time on optimisation, ethical issues and the user-friendliness of a system rather than focusing on the syntax of the code.\u201d Mario Fusco, a great software developer, once said: \u201cThe code you write makes you a programmer. The code you delete makes you a good one. The code you don\u2019t have to write makes you a great one.\u201d So maybe, for once, AI is on to something.

Some things resonate with you, sometimes you\u2019re desperately looking for a window in. But Lived Fiction offers many windows into the world of Stopgap, a company of Deaf, disabled, neurodivergent and non-disabled dancers that has spent two decades making works that are poetic and subtly political.

We\u2019re inviting you to ours instead.\u201d It\u2019s a show where everyone\u2019s needs have been thought of: there are guides in large print and braille, ear defenders, fidget toys, a quiet space, captions and a live audio describer, Lily Norton, who tells the audience they can leave the auditorium any time they like, make noise, stim, whatever makes them comfortable. Norton is as much a performer as any of the dancers, describing the actions as they happen and displaying a nice way with words: the \u201ccrosshatch\u201d of the dancers\u2019 movement, the \u201cpuzzle of muscle and metal\u201d between dancers and wheelchair. Each dancer has their voice, their individuality and their moments of tenderness, like Hannah Sampson, who swizzles her hips with joy, or Nadenh Poan, strapped into his wheelchair so that it follows him into headstands and rolls. As a non-disabled viewer, it\u2019s fascinating to process all the different inputs: the dance itself, the description plus its text on screen and some wryly knowing voiceover too. The description not only itemises the movement but also elevates small things you might not see \u2013 in an intimate, atmospheric duet between Poan and Emily Lue-Fong, for example \u2013 into something quite beautiful. And quietly revolutionary. Elsewhere in this year\u2019s Brighton festival, L\u00eela Dance are asking for a different kind of revolution. Climate change can feel an esoteric subject when transposed into dance, but the Bournemouth-based company do a good job of making its potential effects distressingly real in Fault Lines (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606) at the Dance Space. \u201c2045. Desert land. 50 degrees,\u201d the projection reads. \u201c2050. Low lying cities. 48 degrees.\u201d The music shimmers like heat haze, its pulse ticking, loose-limbed but precise dancers propelled by its thrum. It\u2019s as if the movement is pushing them and the momentum is out of their control. People must flee, and we see bodies struggling with shrinking space, or weakly writhing, panicked voices. It\u2019s an evocative picture, the imminence brought home by visualising these scenarios, even in a fairly abstract way. But Fault Lines refuses to lose hope, and offers an alternative view of the future too in this sincere and well-crafted piece. Lived Fiction tours until 15 November. Fault Lines tours until 14 June and is at Assembly @ Dance Base, Edinburgh, 20-25 August"

            "date": "2024-05-07T20:00:23Z",
            "content": "This year\u2019s Sydney film festival program has just been announced and, as usual, it is bulging with treats from around the world. The event kicks off on 5 June with a screening of Paul Clarke\u2019s documentary Midnight Oil: The Hardest Line, and runs until 16 June at various venues across the city. Here are 10 films you might want to check out \u2013 in addition to three others on the program that I\u2019ve written about previously: The Moogai, Every Little Thing and Mozart\u2019s Sister. Kinds of Kindness Director: Yorgos Lanthimos Country: Ireland/UK/US Many of us are still drunk from the fumes of Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 intoxicatingly strange Poor Things. Not much is known about his latest collaboration with Emma Stone: a triptych described by the director as \u201ca contemporary film\u201d with \u201cfour or five actors who play one part in each story, so they all play three different parts\u201d. Stone\u2019s co-stars include the reportedly highly slappable Willem Dafoe. Sasquatch Sunset Directors: Nathan Zellner and David Zellner Country: US Despite old mate Bigfoot being rather camera shy, we get to watch not one but four sasquatch up close and personal in this zany comedy from David and Nathan Zellner. The film is set in the California wilderness and follows a year in the life of a very hairy family, played by a prosthetics-lathered cast including Riley Keough and Jesse Eisenberg. Peter Bradshaw described it as a \u201cbrilliant and radical\u201d production comparable, in non-verbal cinema, to Planet of the Apes, Watership Down and early silent films. Sold! Crossing Director: Levan Akin Country: Sweden/Denmark/France/Turkey/Georgia Among cinema\u2019s greatest pleasures is the absorption of other cultures and different aspects of human experience. In Crossing, the writer-director Levan Akin focuses on Istanbul\u2019s trans community in a story that follows Mzia Arabuli\u2019s Lia, a former high school teacher searching for her missing trans niece. Fionnuala Halligan from ScreenDaily described it as \u201can elegy of travel and trans life\u201d that\u2019s \u201cdream-like even as it cruises through a purposefully shaped narrative\u201d. Otto by Otto Director: Gracie Otto Country: Australia Otto by Otto is the perfect title for this portrait of the great Australian actor Barry Otto, given that it was directed by his daughter Gracie, whose oeuvre includes Bump, Deadloch, The Artful Dodger and Heartbreak High. The film reflects on Otto senior\u2019s long and wonderful career. Among my favourite Otto characters is his crumpled adman Harry Joy in the extraordinarily strange and surreal Bliss. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The Outrun Director: Nora Fingscheidt Country: UK/Germany The latest performance from the excellent Saoirse Ronan has been described by the Guardian\u2019s Adrian Horton as \u201can incredibly effective portrait of a reeling mind\u201d that\u2019s \u201ctitanic and quiet, and utterly convincing even in the very difficult art of acting drunk\u201d. The four-time Oscar nominee plays Rona, a 29-year-old who returns home to the Orkney islands while battling the throes of addiction. The Cars That Ate Paris Director: Peter Weir Country: Australia The great Australian auteur Peter Weir has confirmed what many of us suspected: he\u2019s retired from film-making. Weir\u2019s stunning body of work can of course be revisited, including his first feature The Cars That Ate Paris \u2013 one of the pioneering productions in the genre of bat-shit-crazy Aussie car movies. It\u2019s set in a small town that economically relies on a steady supply of wrecked vehicles, created by locals who force visitors off the road. Soundtrack to a Coup d\u2019Etat Director: John Grimonprez Country: Belgium/France/Netherlands Was the legendary trumpeter Louis Armstrong\u2019s visit to the Congo in 1960 engineered by the US to distract the population from clandestine political machinations? The Belgian film-maker John Grimonprez unpacks a twisty stranger-than-fiction story integrating US imperialism, African politics and great music. His long (150 minutes) and ambitious documentary won Sundance\u2019s world cinema documentary special jury award for cinematic innovation. We Were Dangerous Director: Josephine Stewart-Te Whiu Country: New Zealand This year Sydney film festival launches its First Nations award, which is reportedly the world\u2019s largest cash prize for Indigenous film-making. Our friends from across the Tasman have a few films in competition, including Josephine Stewart-Te Whiu\u2019s 1950s period piece about two M\u0101ori teenagers (Erana James and Manaia Hall) who are caught escaping an institution for delinquents and sent to a remote island complex run by a domineering matron (Rima Te Wiata). The film was executive-produced by Taika Waititi and co-stars Nathalie Morris from Bump. I Saw the TV Glow Director: Jane Schoenbrun Country: US The trans film-maker Jane Schoenbrun\u2019s queer horror-thriller has been generating some great reviews, described by this masthead as \u201ca buzzy, brilliant new film\u201d about two teenagers addicted to a Buffy-like TV show. The plot reportedly involves strange occurrences that evoke questions around the nature of this show and how it connects with the two leads. In another Guardian article Veronica Esposito described the film as \u201cvery much about what it\u2019s like to be queer before you\u2019re even in the closet\u201d. Explanation for Everything Director: G\u00e1bor Reisz Country: Hungary/Slovakia Political polarisation and the culture wars are key themes in this social satire centred around a Hungarian high school student who unwittingly instigates a national scandal when he forgets he\u2019s wearing a jacket pin that has become a symbol of rightwing nationalism. Turning heads at last year\u2019s Venice international film festival, Explanation for Everything takes issues specific to Hungary to make broader comments about the left-right divide and political divisiveness. Reisz will be a guest of the festival. Sydney film festival 2024 runs 5-16 June"

The Global Footprint Network says we are in ecological overshoot, with humanity using the resources of 1.7 Earths. The UN has made clear that our unsustainable demand for resources is driving the triple planetary crisis: climate change, biodiversity loss, and increasing levels of pollution and waste. And despite the rhetoric of Silicon Valley, technology is not our saviour; it is found to mitigate global extraction by only 5%. It\u2019s time pronatalists recognised that nothing in nature exists independently. The impacts of climate change are already endangering millions of lives, yet they ignore the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s data citing population growth and per capita consumption as the biggest drivers of emissions. The environmental crises cannot be ignored when their effects shape our world; instead we must act now to rein in our resource demand to solve these interconnected crises. Madeleine Hewitt Population Matters \u2022 Libertarians and pronatalists like Elon Musk and the Collinses conflate the established link between innovation driving a rising standard of living and population growth. They argue that more people (conveniently, the children of other rich white pronatalists) are required to maintain the pace of innovation, or we enter a death spiral of declining population and productivity. But this argument is thrice flawed. First, many of the problems we need to solve are perversely the result of the growing population itself \u2013 we waste precious innovation cycles addressing pollution, hunger and water shortages that only arise due to population pressure. When we include the negative externalities of population growth on the demand for innovation, a stable equilibrium is possible. More importantly, there are billions of innovative people mired in poverty \u2013 unleash their potential first, instead of seeking more people like \u201courselves\u201d to carry the burden. And then there is artificial intelligence, still far from truly self-aware but more than capable of enhancing human creativity. Processors, not people, will amplify our ability to innovate. And global standards of living will rise in concert. Greg Blonder Visiting researcher, Boston University \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

            "date": "2024-05-17T09:32:18Z",
            "content": "The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, has announced a big expansion of its operations in Leeds, with one in 10 officials to be based in the West Yorkshire city within three years. Bailey said the 70-strong team at the central bank\u2019s northern hub would swell sevenfold to 500 by 2027 through a combination of voluntary relocation and local recruitment. The Bank said its increased presence in Leeds was aimed at improving trust and wider understanding of its work across the UK, ensuring it better represented the public, and would help tap into wider talent pools across the country and retain talented colleagues. Threadneedle Street\u2019s links with Leeds stretch back 200 years, and it was among the earliest locations proposed when the Bank began considering establishing a network of branches in the 1800s. Three years ago, it announced plans to open a northern hub in the city, which is already one of the UK\u2019s biggest financial centres outside London. Bailey said: \u201cCommitting to a permanent, expanded Leeds office is a fantastic opportunity for us better to represent the public, build stronger links with the local business community and help promote the work of the Bank to a wider pool of talented workers.\u201d The Bank will aim to maintain its overall headcount \u2013 which stood at 4,971, according to its 2023 report and accounts \u2013 while expanding its numbers in Leeds. The councillor James Lewis, the leader of Leeds city council, said: \u201cWe are delighted that the Bank of England has chosen to expand their office space in Leeds. \u201cLeeds is the UK\u2019s second largest city for financial services, and a major hub for related professional services; this move further reinforces the city\u2019s progress and influence and showcases the strength of Team Leeds and the partners across the private and public sectors, that come together to deliver brilliant results in a truly collaborative way, for the best impact on our residents.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-27T12:49:30Z",
            "content": "Major League Cricket has announced ambitious new expansion plans for the sport in the US. In a move that will have significant implications for the landscape of the professional sport in England, MLC, which began with a 19-game season, has confirmed it will expand to 34 games by 2025. The US league now has six franchises but plans to launch two more in the near future, and two more soon after that. The announcement comes just after MLC has been fully legitimised by the news that its matches have been awarded List A status by the International Cricket Council. \u201cIt was always intended to be a 10\u2011team league,\u201d the MLC chief executive, Vijay Srinivasan, told the Guardian. \u201cStudies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support 10 teams, so that\u2019s our plan. We had 19 games in our first season, will have 25 in our second. I think we want to get to 34 next year, and just gradually keep expanding.\u201d The second season, which starts at the end of the men\u2019s T20 World Cup, runs for 23 days and overlaps with the Hundred. The US tournament next year will be significantly longer and start earlier. Srinivasan said MLC is keen to play in June. \u201cUltimately for us our ideal calendar is to start much earlier, in the late spring or early summer,\u201d Srinivasan said. The tournament was pushed back this year because of the T20 World Cup, which is using the MLC\u2019s stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas. \u201cWith the Indian Premier League ending in late May, I think our sweet spot would be to start in early June, which is when we have the school holidays in the US, and go into July. That\u2019s how we would like to establish our window.\u201d That would clash with the T20 Blast season but leave the Hundred to run from late July through August. English cricket has already had to adapt to sharing its summer with a competing league. Last year Jason Roy gave up his England contract so he could take a job with LA Knight Riders, while Surrey\u2019s Sunil Narine skipped the county side\u2019s appearance on Blast finals day because he was also playing for LA. Alec Stewart, Surrey\u2019s director of cricket, said at the time it was \u201cdisappointing and frustrating\u201d to \u201close a player of Narine\u2019s quality at late notice\u201d. Narine\u2019s decision was a sobering reminder of the status of English domestic cricket. MLC\u2019s expansion plans will also increase pressure on the English game to decide whether or not to bring private investment into the Hundred. The England and Wales Cricket Board, the 18 counties and Marylebone Cricket Club agreed that it was the \u201cdirection of travel\u201d for the game on 10 May, but there is frustration about slow progress. MLC boasts a formidable array of investors, including four IPL sides \u2013 Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals \u2013 as well as significant business figures such as Microsoft\u2019s CEO, Satya Nadella. \u201cAll of these people who came on board with us when we started five years ago have been immensely successful in other walks of life,\u201d Srinivasan said. \u201cYou know they understand that this is not one of those things where you can just turn a switch. The expectation was never that this would be an overnight transition. They\u2019ve been immensely patient and they\u2019ve backed us all the way through.\u201d MLC has already established a series of academies and a minor league system to develop local players. It is now working on developing more List A venues. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to play a league and go away every year,\u201d Srinivasan said. \u201cWe feel like it is our role is to build the infrastructure for cricket in the US. MLC is the means to an end, if you will. I think 10 years from now, I think you\u2019ll see a very different landscape for cricket in the US. We\u2019ll have a very robust set of venues around the country, we\u2019ll have a home-and-away sort of format for MLC, and we\u2019ll have a much larger pool of players as a result in the system. Hopefully that means we will also have a very strong sort of USA team. Those are all our ambitions.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-31T06:00:31Z",
            "content": "The market for carbon offsets shrank dramatically last year, falling from $1.9bn (\u00a31.5bn) in 2022 to $723m in 2023, a new report has found. The drop came after a series of scientific and media reports found many offsetting schemes do nothing to mitigate the climate crisis and biodiversity loss. The research by Ecosystem Marketplace, a nonprofit initiative that collects data about the carbon market from brokers and traders, found the market had shrunk 61%. It attributed the contraction to a flurry of scientific studies and media reports that concluded millions of offsets were \u201cworthless\u201d, with some projects linked to human rights concerns. Each carbon credit is meant to represent the reduction or removal of one tonne of CO2 emissions removals or reductions, and they have been used by leading companies to label their products \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d, or to tell consumers they can fly, buy new clothes or eat certain foods without making the climate and biodiversity crises worse. Offsets generated by schemes protecting rainforests, the most popular type, lost 62% of their value between 2022 and 2023. These schemes were the focus of a joint investigation by the Guardian, which found more than 90% of rainforest carbon offsets from a large sample of projects from Verra \u2013 the world\u2019s leading certifier \u2013 are worthless, and uncovered potential human rights abuses at a flagship project. Verra disputed the findings. Julia Jones, a co-author on one of the studies in the investigation and a professor at Bangor University, said urgent reforms were necessary so carbon markets could work as intended. \u201cThe media scrutiny revealing that many projects issuing Redd+ credits to the voluntary carbon market have sold more credits than justified is important,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, I am deeply concerned that some of the recent coverage of the issue gives the impression that the very idea of tackling climate change by slowing tropical deforestation is a scam \u2013 this is not true and the idea could harm forests. \u201cDramatically more finance is urgently needed to stop the ongoing loss of forests and the vital services they provide \u2013 a reformed voluntary carbon market could play a key role in providing that finance,\u201d she said. On Tuesday, the White House held an event to support industry-led efforts to reform carbon markets, backing initiatives to help companies avoid greenwashing and ensure credits represent actual environmental impact. The US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said companies should be prioritising cuts to emissions, but the Biden administration still wanted carbon credits \u201cto succeed\u201d. The move comes amid deep divisions between environmental groups about the role of carbon credits in helping companies meet net zero targets. Stephen Lezak, a programme manager at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, University of Oxford, said people should not turn away from carbon markets. \u201cThe current market for carbon offsets is a bit like a burning building. We need folks to be firefighters and run toward it, rather than walk away and let it burn to the ground. Limiting global warming to 1.5C simply isn\u2019t feasible without having a functioning market for this sort of climate finance,\u201d he said. Kaya Axelsson, a research fellow at Oxford Net Zero, said: \u201cThis is a critical transition moment. Carbon markets will lose relevance unless they radically reform in line with net zero aims.\u201d Rene Velasquez, managing partner at the carbon markets consultancy Valitera, disputed the size of the fall reported by Ecosystem Marketplace and said there were problems with the methodology. \u201cAs with previous years, their report is incomplete and relies on a survey of market participants to provide confidential trade data,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is fewer and fewer institutional respondents participate. While I will concede the market retreated, this skews the numbers.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features"

            "content": "Shares in GameStop and AMC Entertainment doubled again on Tuesday, before losing ground, as a turbulent market frenzy surrounding top meme stocks took hold for a second day. Retail traders\u2019 interest in GameStop, the struggling video games chain, has been reignited by the re-emergence of an influencer known as Roaring Kitty. GameStop soared by as much as 98% during early trading on Wall Street, before losing steam in volatile trading, after rallying 74% on Monday. AMC, the world\u2019s largest cinema chain, climbed by as much as 120%. By the time markets closed in New York, GameStop was up 60% and AMC was up 31%. Meme stocks \u2013 boosted by memes on social media \u2013 first emerged as a force three years ago, when amateur traders mobilized on platforms including Reddit to boost shares in GameStop. Their bids triggered an extraordinary, but fleeting, increase in GameStop\u2019s stock market value. It also left hedge funds that had bet against the company nursing heavy losses. Earlier this week Keith Gill, the influencer known as Roaring Kitty, posted on X for the first time since the height of the meme stock frenzy in 2021. He shared a sketch of a gamer leaning forward, as if things were getting serious \u2013 and followed up with a string of clips from movies and TV shows. Three years ago Gill\u2019s videos on YouTube, and posts on Reddit, where he is known as DeepFuckingValue, placed him at the front of an army of meme-toting day traders who tried to mount a rebellion against Wall Street \u2013 and the financial titans dominating the market. The story of the initial meme stock rallies has already been transformed into a Hollywood movie. Paul Dano played Gill, the central character in Dumb Money, which was released last year. Gill himself has largely kept his head down, however \u2013 and steered clear of social media \u2013 until now. His posts on Sunday evening and Monday unleashed a torrent of speculation around his plans. Other meme stocks including BlackBerry and Tupperware also rallied on Tuesday. Shares in GameStop have fallen dramatically since their extraordinary peak in early 2021. Questions have been raised, too, about the strength of GameStop\u2019s business, which has reported falling sales and endured a series of high-profile departures from its management team. Institutional investors were quick to condemn the latest rally. \u201cIt is gambling,\u201d Cole Smead, a fund manager, told CNBC. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember these are young people, these are 40-year-old people like me, who are going out and doing stuff that is just frankly stupid.\u201d AMC, which also owns the Odeon chain of cinemas in Europe, was quick to capitalize on its stock\u2019s latest rally \u2013 raising $250m by selling shares."

While the average family may not be able to spring for the costly fruit, the expensive pineapple is a visible reminder of the demand among wealthy customers for luxurious produce. The Rubyglow pineapple is a rarity, with only a few thousand produced each year, the local news station KTLA reported. The fruit is being made available at Melissa\u2019s Produce, a speciality produce shop in Vernon, California. The rare fruit is known for its ruby color \u2013 similar to the precious gemstone \u2013 and sweet, yellow interior. It was created in Costa Rica after 16 years of research, according to the fruit wholesaler Del Monte Foods. \u201cAs the leaders of pineapple innovation, we\u2019re excited to debut our latest creation, the Rubyglow pineapple,\u201d Del Monte announced on its website. \u201cNamed for the ruby and its rich red color, scarce supply and association with luxury, this exceptional fruit offers a special experience to those who appreciate uniqueness.\u201d The pineapple was previously available only in China. But Del Monte decided to introduce the luxury fruit to North America for the first time. The Rubyglow pineapple is the latest high-end fruit to make a splash in the US. Oishii strawberries, widely known as the world\u2019s most expensive strawberries, have gone viral across social media for their sweeter taste. A pack of six strawberries can cost more than $10 in some areas. Other pricy produce, such as Sumo Citrus, has similarly captured hearts and stomachs across the US. Though many have publicly aired grievances about the rising costs of certain common grocery items, luxury fruits continue to entice some American shoppers. \u201cConsumers are willing to pay for something that\u2019s special,\u201d Cindy van Rijswick, a global strategist for fruit, vegetable and floriculture sectors with Rabobank, told CNN.

            "date": "2024-05-14T09:26:59Z",
            "content": "Vodafone has said its turnaround plan is starting to show results as Germany, its largest business, returned to growth last year after the sale of its Italian and Spanish operations. The telecoms company has been undergoing a transformation programme under its chief executive, Margherita Della Valle, who has sought to simplify the group and taken action in three underperforming markets where Vodafone\u2019s returns were below the cost of capital. Vodafone sold off its Spanish division for \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.3bn) as well as announcing an \u20ac8bn sale of its operations in Italy and a proposed merger with CK Hutchison\u2019s Three in the UK which is being considered by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the anti-trust regulator. The telecoms company reported a 74% fall in operating profits for the year ended 31 March 2024 to \u20ac3.7bn against \u20ac14.4bn because results in the previous year were bolstered by exceptional gains including an \u20ac8.6bn gain on the sale of its Vantage Towers business as well as sales of Vodafone Hungary and Vodafone Ghana. Vodafone is pressing ahead with cost-cutting measures. It has shed 5,000 roles and is cutting a further 2,000 as part of a \u20ac1bn cost reduction target; its aim is to axe up to 11,000 jobs by 2026. Della Valle said that underlying performance in Germany was expected to improve so that by 2026 the country \u201cwill come back to being an important growth engine for the group\u201d. She added that Vodafone was holding \u201cdeep conversations\u201d with the CMA in the UK as the regulators examine the Three deal. The CMA has warned mobile customers could face higher prices and reduced quality as a result of the potential merger. Della Valle said: \u201cMuch more still needs to be done in the year ahead. We will step up investment in our customer experience, improve our underlying performance in Germany and accelerate our momentum in business, while also continuing to simplify our operations.\u201d Vodafone has already said it will rebase its dividend and plans share buy-backs over two years, with \u20ac2bn from the proceeds of the Spanish business in 2025 and a further \u20ac2bn proceeds from the Italian arm in 2026. The telecoms group faces questions about the 14.6 % stake held by its largest investor Emirates Telecommunications, which the UK government has identified as a national security risk. Ministers have ordered a national security committee to be set up at Vodafone to help oversee sensitive work. However a recent report authored by three barristers including Sir Robert Buckland KC, a former lord chancellor, concluded that the UAE\u2019s stake in Vodafone raised serious concerns given UAE\u2019s intelligence gathering apparatus and poor human rights record. The barrister Ben Keith, who co-authored the report, has urged that the planned national security committee should be independent of Vodafone and include national security experts. There should also be enhanced data security and audits and also Vodafone should collaborate with human rights organisations and conduct regular assessments, the barristers suggested. Vodafone said of the report: \u201cVodafone has extensive data security and privacy measures in place. Sensitive customer data is not visible to anyone \u2013 including the group CEO \u2013 outside our specific, security-vetted customer teams. Vodafone has a long-established human rights policy, which is developed in line with international standards as well as industry-specific principles.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-13T11:30:23Z",
            "content": "In the 20th century, the definition of progress seemed clear. It was growth, measured in terms of national income, or gross domestic product (GDP). And that growth was to be endless, an ever-rising curve. No matter how rich a nation already was, its politicians and economists would consistently claim that the solutions to its problems \u2013 from poverty to pollution \u2013 depended on yet more growth. But this promise has not been delivered on. It is clearly time to reimagine the shape of progress and, with it, the policies that could bring about prosperity for a fractured humanity on a destabilised planet. First, it\u2019s useful to recognise the appeal of growth. It is, after all, a wonderful, healthy phase of life, which is why people the world over love to see children, gardens and trees grow. No wonder the western mind so readily accepted it as the shape of economic progress, too, and simultaneously adopted the very 20th-century mantra that \u201cmore is better\u201d, both personally and nationally. Yet if we look to nature, it\u2019s clear that nothing succeeds by growing for ever: anything that seeks to do so will, in the process, destroy itself or the system on which it depends. Things that succeed grow until they are grown up, at which point they mature, enabling them to thrive, sometimes for hundreds of years. As the biomimicry pioneer Janine Benyus reminds us, a tree keeps growing only up to the point that it is still capable of sending nutrients to the leaves at the outermost tips of its branches, at which point it stops. Its pursuit of growth is bounded by a greater goal of distributing and circulating the resources that nurture and sustain the health of its whole being. Although we can easily appreciate the limits of growth in the living world, when it comes to our economies, we have a harder time. Thanks to the availability of cheap fossil fuel-based energy in the 20th century, rapid economic growth came to be seen as normal and natural, indeed as essential. Its continuation over many decades led to the creation of institutional designs and policies \u2013 from credit creation to shareholder dividends to pension funds \u2013 that are structurally dependent on growth without end. In other words, we have inherited economies that need to grow, whether or not they make us thrive. This requirement has become so locked into economic theories, political narratives and public expectations that, over recent decades, we\u2019ve witnessed desperate and often destructive measures designed to reboot growth when it becomes elusive. Governments deregulate finance in the hope of unleashing new investment, but often end up unleashing speculative bubbles, house price hikes and debt crises instead. They promise corporations that they will \u201ccut red tape\u201d but end up dismantling legislation that was put in place to protect workers\u2019 rights, communities and the natural world. They privatise services \u2013 from water to hospitals \u2013 turning public wealth into private revenue streams that often undermine the very services they claim to provide. They add the environment into the national accounts as \u201cecosystem services\u201d and \u201cnatural capital\u201d, assigning it a value that looks dangerously like a price. And, despite committing to keep global heating \u201cwell below 2C\u201d, they open up new avenues for fossil fuel exploration, while failing to make the scale of transformational public investment needed for a renewable energy revolution. Instead of pursuing endless growth, it is time to pursue wellbeing for all people as part of a thriving world, with policymaking that is designed in the service of this goal. This results in a very different conception of progress: in the place of endless growth we seek a dynamic balance, one that aims to meet the essential needs of every person while protecting the life-supporting systems of our planetary home. And since we are the inheritors of economies that need to grow, whether or not they make us thrive, a critical challenge in high-income countries is to create economies that enable us to thrive, whether or not they grow. Tackling and reversing inequality needs to be at the heart of a new eco-social contract. Not only does this bring benefits in terms of improving life satisfaction; it helps us reduce the size of our national ecological footprints, via the well-documented links between greater fairness and more moderate consumption. It\u2019s also important politically: one of the most damaging consequences of growth-driven inequality is the concentration of wealth and economic power in the hands of a few. This power can all too easily be converted into influence over elections and the policymaking process, ensuring the preservation of a system that advantages the already wealthy. When we turn away from growth as the goal, we can focus directly on asking what it would take to deliver social and ecological wellbeing, through an economy that is regenerative and distributive by design. There are many possibilities \u2013 such as driving a low-carbon, zero-waste industrial transformation, with a green jobs guarantee, alongside free public transport, personal carbon allowances, and progressive wealth taxes.

            "date": "2024-05-22T22:49:10Z",
            "content": "The UK is leading an international effort to test the most advanced AI models for safety risks before they hit the public, as regulators race to create a workable safety regime before the Paris summit in six months. Britain\u2019s AI Safety Institute, the first of its kind, is now matched by counterparts from around the world, including South Korea, the US, Singapore, Japan and France. Regulators at the Seoul AI Summit hope the bodies can collaborate to create the 21st-century version of the Montreal Protocol, the groundbreaking agreement to control CFCs and close the hole in the ozone layer. But before they do, the institutes need to agree on how they can work together to turn an international patchwork of approaches and regulations into a unified effort to corral AI research. \u201cAt Bletchley, we announced the UK\u2019s AI Safety Institute \u2013 the world\u2019s first government-backed organisation dedicated to advanced AI safety for the public good,\u201d said Michelle Donelan, the UK technology secretary, in Seoul on Wednesday. She credited the \u201cBletchley effect\u201d for prompting the creation of a global network of peers doing the same thing. Those institutes will begin sharing information about models, their limitations, capabilities and risks, as well as monitoring specific \u201cAI harms and safety incidents\u201d where they occur and sharing resources to advance global understanding of the science of AI safety. At the first \u201cfull house\u201d meeting of those countries on Wednesday, Donelan warned the creation of the network was only a first step. \u201cWe must not rest on our laurels. As the pace of AI development accelerates, we must match that speed with our own efforts if we are to grip the risks and seize the limitless opportunities for our public.\u201d The network of safety institutes have a hard deadline. This autumn, leaders will again meet, this time in Paris, for the first full AI summit since Bletchley. There, if conversation is to progress from how to test AI models to how to regulate them, the safety institutes will have to demonstrate that they have mastered what Donalan called \u201cthe nascent science of frontier AI testing and evaluation\u201d. Jack Clark, the co-founder and head of policy at AI lab Anthropic, said that simply setting up a functional safety institute places the UK \u201ca hundred miles\u201d further along the road to safe AI than the world was two years ago. \u201cI think what we now need to do is to encourage governments, as I\u2019ve been doing here, to continue to invest the money required to set up the safety institutes and fill them with enough technical people that they really can create their own information and evidence,\u201d he said. As part of the investment into that science, Donelan announced \u00a38.5m in funding to \u201cbreak new grounds\u201d in AI safety testing. Francine Bennett, interim director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, called that funding a good start and said it would need to \u201cpave the way for a much more substantial programme of understanding and protecting against social and systemic risk. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see the safety institute and the government taking steps towards a broader view of what safety means, both in the State of the Science report and with this funding; we\u2019re recognising that safety isn\u2019t something you can sufficiently test for in a lab,\u201d Bennett added. The summit was criticised for leaving key voices out of the conversation. No Korean civil society groups were present, with the host country representing itself only through academia, government and industry, while only the largest AI businesses were invited to take part. Roeland Decorte, president of the AI Founders Association, warned that the discussions risked \u201cfocusing only on flashy large-scale models, of which only a handful will come to dominate and which can only be created currently by the biggest players at a financial loss\u201d as a result. \u201cThe question is, in the end, do we want to regulate and build for a future mature AI economy that will create a sustainable framework for the majority of companies operating in the space,\u201d he added."

            "content": "Policymakers at the Federal Reserve have expressed concern over stalling progress in their fight to bring down inflation. Although price growth has fallen sharply since peaking at its highest levels in a generation two years ago, it has remained stubbornly above where officials want it to be. The closely watched consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 3.4% in April, according to official data released last week, down from an annual pace of 3.5% in March, but still significantly higher than the Fed\u2019s medium-term goal of 2%. Having raised interest rates to their highest point in more than two decades in an effort to suppress inflation, officials at the Fed have been mulling their next steps. At its latest meeting, on 3 April and 1 May, the central bank decided to keep rates on hold. Policymakers at the meeting \u201cobserved that while inflation had eased over the past year, in recent months there had been a lack of further progress toward the [Fed policy] committee\u2019s 2% objective\u201d, according to minutes released on Wednesday. While they \u201cnoted that they continued to expect that inflation would return to 2% over the medium term\u201d, officials acknowledged that \u201cdisinflation would likely take longer than previously thought\u201d, the minutes said. A majority of Americans wrongly believe the US is in recession, according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. A majority also believe that inflation is still rising. While the US is not in recession, and inflation has been falling back for some time, the Fed is now considering its next steps as price growth lingers. While the central bank has been widely expected to start cutting rates later this year, some officials at its most recent meeting even mooted raising rates if inflation continues to loom large. \u201cVarious participants mentioned a willingness to tighten policy further should risks to inflation materialize in a way that such an action became appropriate,\u201d the minutes said. As November\u2019s presidential elections creep closer, Joe Biden has tried to highlight how inflation has retreated from its peak \u2013 as Donald Trump attempts to pin the blame on the president, and his policies."

            "date": "2024-05-15T05:01:32Z",
            "content": "Discriminatory family laws across parts of Africa are stalling progress on women\u2019s rights in some countries, according to new research. The human rights organisation Equality Now studied family law and practices in 20 African countries and found progress in recent decades, but said inequalities persisted in marriage, divorce, child custody and inheritance and property laws. The report pointed to issues with pluralistic legal systems, where statutory legislation sits alongside customary and religious laws and can make interpretation and application difficult. The majority of countries have ratified two protocols that guarantee strong rights and protections for women, the Protocol to the African Charter on the Rights of Women in Africa (the Maputo protocol) and the UN\u2019s Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. However, in some countries, as in other parts of the world, rape is not outlawed in marriage; in others, women are unable to petition for divorce and have no guarantee of inheriting property on the death of a partner. In nations including Algeria, Cameroon and Nigeria, women receive less inheritance than men. Those advocating for change say that family laws have not kept up with the social shifts of the times, including changes in family responsibilities and increased divorce rates. There has been some success across the continent, including raising the legal age for marriage to 18, said the report. Countries including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya and Mozambique have banned child marriage. However, Cameroon, Senegal and Tanzania still allow it. Countries such as Nigeria outlawed child marriage in 2003, but the practice continues in the north of the country, where approximately 50% of girls are married before the age of 18. Esther Waweru, report co-author and a senior legal adviser at Equality Now, said: \u201cCulture and religion frequently act as major impediments in the struggle for family law equality, stalling reforms. Claw-back clauses water down the full impact of some progressive laws, and we are now witnessing backlash from anti-rights movements seeking to reverse hard-won gains made in ending harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation. \u201cStagnation is also a problem, with governments pledging to reform discriminatory laws but failing to take meaningful action. In some instances, progressive family codes have remained in limbo for decades, awaiting enactment.\u201d Hadiza Dauda, 37, from the northeastern Nigerian city of Bauchi, has had first-hand experience of discriminatory customary laws. Married as a child of 12, which exposed her to early motherhood, her husband later died in 2020. Her in-laws then put pressure on her to marry her brother-in-law, threatening to take custody of her children and evict her from her matrimonial home if she refused. Dauda got her land back with the help of Women for Women, which trains the marginalised on their rights, and she now works as a community activist, advocating against forced marriage and widow evictions in her home town. \u201c[These practices] really affect women negatively,\u201d she said. \u201cThose that don\u2019t know what to do fall into poverty, doing all sorts of menial jobs to feed their families. Others go into depression, not knowing where to start from. I didn\u2019t have a choice on when to get married, or when and how to give birth, but we are saying women must have a say, and [this needs to change].\u201d"

            "content": "Remittances sent home by people who have migrated abroad have outstripped foreign direct investment in developing nations for the first time, a new report has found. The International Organization for Migration found that international transfers increased 650% from $128bn (\u00a3102bn) to $831bn (\u00a3662bn) between 2000 and 2022. \u201cThe growth continued despite predictions from many analysts that remittances would decrease substantially because of Covid-19,\u201d IOM said in its World Migration Report 2024. Money sent home by those who have emigrated from their home countries has long represented a greater source of revenue than international development aid to low- and middle-income countries. But the sharp rise in remittances recorded by the World Bank and other data researched by IOM underlines just how significant migration has become for poorer economies. The report shows that in 2020, India, China, Mexico, the Philippines and Egypt were, in descending order, the top five remittance recipient countries, although India and China were well above the rest, with total inward remittances exceeding $83bn and $59bn, respectively. The US has consistently been the top remittance-sending country with total outflow of $68bn in 2020, followed by UAE ($43bn), Saudi Arabia ($34.6bn), Switzerland ($28bn), and Germany ($22bn). In Europe, where migration has been one of the hottest political topics before the EU parliament elections, home affairs ministers have already started working on new migration laws aimed at curbing the flow of irregular migration. The IOM\u2019s director general, Amy Pope, said the report also highlighted the need to strengthen legal pathways for migrants from poorer nations. She said research of Cuban, Haitian and Nicaraguan migration to the US showed an \u201cimmediate decrease in numbers of irregular migrants\u201d when legal pathways were created, whether through family reunion or a boost in asylum places. \u201cWhen people know that there\u2019s a credible way to get to safety or to get a job, that decreases what the smugglers are selling,\u201d she said. In Europe, the \u201cGreeks, the Portuguese, the Italians, the Spanish, they\u2019re all really thinking about that at this moment, because their populations are ageing\u201d, she said after a meeting with home affairs ministers a week ago. \u201cThe anti-migration sentiment we\u2019re hearing from so many different parts of Europe suggests that Europe needs to stop migration, where the evidence shows that Europe needs migration. \u201cBut because of the politics around it, there is sometimes a reluctance to try to engage in a system to create a way for people to come in safely, to come in with dignity, and, frankly, to come in and get a job.\u201d The IOM report notes that people from countries with very high levels of human development can travel visa-free to about 85% of all other countries worldwide. \u201cHowever, the visa restrictions in place for countries with very low levels of human development indicate that regular migration pathways are problematic for citizens,\u201d the report says."

            "date": "2024-05-24T18:03:01Z",
            "content": "Crystal Palace\u2019s co-owner John Textor has confirmed he is attempting to sell his stake in the club and would consider investing in Everton. The US businessman, who also has shareholdings in Lyon, Botafogo and Molenbeek via his Eagle Football Holdings company, has been exploring the sale of his 45% stake in Palace for some time and has appointed the investment banking firm Raine to find a buyer. Textor said in a statement on Friday that he wanted out of Palace because it was \u201cnot a perfect fit\u201d for a multi-club ownership model. He would be interested in investing in another Premier League club, providing he sells the Palace shareholding, with Everton a possible but complicated option. Everton\u2019s owner, Farhad Moshiri, has extended a share purchase agreement with 777 Partners until 31 May, despite problems at the Miami-based investment firm and its inability to conclude a deal after eight months. Moshiri told Everton\u2019s fan advisory board this week that he had received approaches from other interested parties. Textor claims to be among them. The Palace co-owner told the Athletic: \u201cYes [he has discussed Everton]. With the existing constituents \u2013 different groups, different lenders, different equity holders. I\u2019ve asked them: \u2018Is there a way to solve all this confusion and address everyone\u2019s problems?\u2019 I\u2019m very open-minded to it but I don\u2019t want to come into a situation where I\u2019m not really welcome. I\u2019m watching it but 777 still has a contract.\u201d Everton\u2019s need for a resolution to their takeover uncertainty is pressing, and Textor cast doubt over any investment on his part. He is also understood to be interested in buying another unnamed Premier League club and has shown an interest in clubs in the Championship, with his Eagle Football group said to be eager to find a collaborative partner in English football as soon as possible. Textor said: \u201cWe\u2019re also looking at other opportunities and we don\u2019t need to jump right out of Palace right into something. That\u2019d be a mistake. I suspect that the problem with Everton is it won\u2019t be available by the time we would be ready for it. You can\u2019t own two clubs in one league and we\u2019re not going to rush the situation at Palace, no matter how good another opportunity looks.\u201d Textor is believed to be reluctant to depart Selhurst Park but has become frustrated about the lack of influence he has at the south London club despite being its biggest shareholder. He fell out with the chairman, Steve Parish, who now owns less than 10% of Palace but retains the casting vote in the boardroom, last year when completing the purchase of Lyon. Textor is understood to have played a key role in the appointment of Oliver Glasner as manager in February and has enjoyed a close relationship with sporting director Dougie Freedman, who rejected an approach from Newcastle United this week."

            "date": "2024-05-16T09:00:03Z",
            "content": "Profiteering is nothing new. Stanley Baldwin had a pithy description for the new intake of Conservative MPs at the 1918 general election, noting that they were \u201ca lot of hard-faced men who look as if they had done very well out of the war\u201d. The future Tory prime minister was right. Many companies had found a war economy greatly to their liking, securing lucrative government contracts and making a mint in the process. Profiteering was rampant. Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the Unite union, says something similar has been happening since the war on Covid began in 2020. A study of the reports and accounts of almost 17,000 firms \u2013 big and small \u2013 showed that pre-tax profit margins were, on average, 30% higher in 2022 than they were in the years immediately before the pandemic began. The UK\u2019s inflation rate peaked at just over 11% in 2022 and, judging by the Unite research, many companies took the opportunity to increase their prices by more than was necessary to cover rising costs, on the basis that consumers wouldn\u2019t notice that they were being gouged. Workers have fared less well. For the past few months, as the annual inflation rate has come down, real incomes have been going up because wages have been rising faster than prices. But this welcome improvement in living standards cannot make up for the deep real wage cuts earlier in the cost of living crisis and, in any event, is likely to be a brief interlude unless there are changes to the way the economy operates. As Graham notes, companies can get away with fattening their profit margins because they have the power to do so. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened in the last three years is, underneath it all, a major redistribution of wealth away from workers\u2019 wages to corporate profits.\u201d Unions think companies have too much power while they have too little, and that\u2019s one reason they took such a hard line this week with Keir Starmer over Labour\u2019s new deal for workers. The planned expansion of workers\u2019 rights promises to shift the balance of power between labour and capital modestly in favour of the former, but no more than that. After unions made clear this was a totemic issue for them, Starmer said Labour was sticking with the planned reforms. There are three counter-arguments to the points made by Unite in its profiteering report, and by the unions more generally. The first is that different profit numbers can be arrived at using different methodology, so there is nothing really to see here. The second is that corporate profits are vital, because they are the source of investment that creates the jobs of the future. The third is that handing more power to unions threatens to wreck Britain\u2019s flexible labour market and will cost jobs. The first argument would be more convincing if Unite\u2019s report was a one-off, but the same picture emerges from elsewhere in the world. In 2021, US profit margins for non-financial companies reached their highest level since the second world war. The European Central Bank\u2019s president, Christine Lagarde, said last year that companies in the eurozone were taking advantage of high inflation to plump up their profit margins. At the very least, there is a case for UK plc to answer. Nor is there any real evidence of a link between profits and investment. Rather, as a paper by the left-of-centre thinktank Common Wealth points out, the bulk of the profits are finding their way to shareholders through dividends, rather than into new capital spending. Back in the 1970s, when unions had considerably more power than they enjoy today, private non-financial corporations paid out 20p in dividend payments for every \u00a31 of gross fixed-capital formation. In the second half of the 2010s, this figure was 95p. Payouts to shareholders rose two and a half times faster than total employee compensation between 1988 and 2019. Meanwhile, business investment over that period has been consistently lower than the average for leading industrial nations. The original justification for putting restrictions on unions and boosting corporate power was that it would boost growth by stimulating entrepreneurship and create more, better-paid jobs. In practice, a lack of union protection left workers wide open for exploitation. Companies were always able to find people to work for low wages, particularly once they found they could tap into global pools of migrant workers. Real wages \u2013 even after the recent small increase \u2013 have flatlined since the time of the global financial crisis in 2008. So the idea that Britain\u2019s flexible labour market represents some sort of gold standard for international best practice is a nonsense. The fact that labour is so cheap discourages firms from investing in new kit and in developing the skills of their workers so that they are truly flexible rather than \u2013 as they all too often are \u2013 easily dispensable. Graham\u2019s assessment is that life is sweet for those at the top but tough for workers, and it is hard to disagree with her. The UK has a poor record for investment, a poor record for productivity, a poor record for real wage growth and, since the pandemic, a poor record for employment. Britain\u2019s workforce is 900,000 smaller than it was before the pandemic, in part due to inactivity caused by long-term sickness and ill health. The \u201cflexibility\u201d model is based on fear, insecurity and poverty pay, and it has failed. After 40 years, it is time to try something different.

The government has prioritised the solar supply chain on economic security grounds, with $1bn in production credits; and segments of the battery supply chain ($523m in similar credits). Does this make sense? Global battery demand is surging, but manufacturing capacity has surged far faster. We may well find profitable niches but will need to be astute. Meanwhile solar manufacturing has chewed up and spat out many global contenders. This is not a simple story. Two more priorities get money for studies and consultation to inform future budget decisions on further production incentives: Green metals. Alumina, aluminium, iron and steel will remain vital to a net zero world and need to be made cleanly using clean energy, green hydrogen and other technologies. Early clean production will be substantially more expensive than conventional product but Australia could have a very large global role as demand grows. This is potentially the biggest clean economy opportunity, but we will need very cheap power and strong international partnerships to make it happen. Low carbon liquid fuels. Decarbonising aviation is very hard, and the best bet for long-haul flights looks like \u201csustainable aviation fuel\u201d, most likely made from waste biomass and energy crops. While other transport applications are possible, SAF could easily soak up whatever spare biomass Australia can throw at it. Dollars are eye-catching but facilitation is vital. Most of the Future Made policy depends on deploying vast amounts of renewable energy and transmission at competitive cost. Slow, unpredictable approvals (as in the US) threaten that. Australia\u2019s national environmental approvals reforms remain unsettled (in part over fights about accelerating good projects versus blocking bad ones), but a welcome $183m will improve consultation and speed up assessments under the existing process. Money for skills will help too, and so will improvements in foreign investment review and a strong skilled migration program. Overall the Future Made in Australia policy has decent priorities, a strong analytical basis and enough money to move the needle. What matters now is quality of implementation, maintenance of discipline in future decisions, and readiness to adjust course in light of successes and failures. Finally, this budget was almost silent on energy upgrades to help households and business save costs, cut emissions and shore up the grid. The pressure to address this in future budgets will surely grow as short-term bill relief payments end. Tennant Reed is director of climate change and energy at the Australian Industry Group"

            "content": "And that\u2019s where we\u2019ll leave you this evening. Here\u2019s a small sample of what we learned today: Labor MPs, including the home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, defended the immigration minister, Andrew Giles, over visa cancellations, saying the government was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by some of the AAT\u2019s decisions to reinstate some visas under ministerial direction 99. Peter Dutton and the opposition continued to attack Giles over the ministerial direction. Adam Bandt moved to suspend standing orders to debate his motion that the House recognise the state of Palestine, which lost in an 80-5 vote. Home affairs department officials revealed that 4,614 Palestinians have been denied visitor visas to Australia. Annual inflation in April rose to 3.6%, up from 3.5% in March. Legislation establishing a new national Environment Protection Authority was introduced into federal parliament. Environment groups called the government\u2019s new Environment Protection Australia bill \u201ca waste of time\u201d and \u201cnot good enough\u201d. The Greens said Labor \u201csold out the environment\u201d in the new bill. Eleven public servants who are paid an average salary of $400,000 charged taxpayers almost $2,000 for dinner and alcohol at a Canberra restaurant in February. The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, backed an investigation into the claims made by Ariel Bombara that WA police ignored her warnings about the danger her father posed to her family. The head of the Office of National Intelligence told Senate estimates that the agency \u201cfirst wrote on fossil fuels and the greenhouse effect in 1981\u201d. Thanks so much for your company today. Politics Live will be back again early tomorrow morning for another day of fun. Until then, look after yourselves. About 40% of Asio caseload is violent extremists, estimates hears The Greens senator David Shoebridge is back in the chair and is asking Asio about whether its violent extremism caseload has changed in recent months. At its peak, the broad group of extremists, which includes neo-Nazis, took up half of Asio\u2019s counter-terrorism caseload, the director general, Mike Burgess, said: It\u2019s less than that today, but it\u2019s still a significant issue. They\u2019re active. They\u2019re actively trying to recruit new members to the fold \u2026 we have a handle on the people we know about and we\u2019re interested in discovering those other people that such an ideology and violence is the answer. Burgess said about 40% of the agency\u2019s caseload was taken up by violent extremists while 60% focused on religiously motivated extremism. You can get some background on this issue here: Woman charged with murder after man stabbed in Sydney home A woman will face court charged with murder after an alleged stabbing in the Sydney suburb of Matraville yesterday. According to a statement from NSW police, emergency services responded to a report of a domestic incident at a Matraville residence at about 6.15pm on Tuesday. Paramedics treated a 37-year-old man but he died at the scene. Police commenced an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident. A 31-year-old woman was arrested nearby and taken to hospital. After inquiries, she was taken to Maroubra police station and charged with murder. She was refused bail and will appear in court tomorrow. Most terms for the role of Asio director general are for five years and Mike Burgess has been in the role for around four-and-a-half years. So naturally, the Liberal senator James Paterson asks whether he\u2019s keen to be reappointed for another term as the top spy. Paterson says: I just want to know whether or not you are open to and willing to serve in this role for another five years? Burgess, along with others in the committee, chuckle at the question. He then answers: Senator, the next director general is a matter for government and me telling you what I would or would not like to do is not appropriate and it\u2019s something we would only share with the government of the day. Paterson replies: I thought I\u2019d try. Greens senator questions Asio boss about \u2018nest of spies\u2019 The Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (Asio) is now up at Senate estimates and the Greens senator David Shoebridge is questioning the top spy about his \u201cnest of spies\u201d comments from years earlier. In May, the Washington Post reported two officers from the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), India\u2019s foreign intelligence service, had been expelled from Australia in 2020 for spying. The report said the expulsion of RAW agents had been the subject of warnings from the Asio director general, Mike Burgess, of a \u201cnest of spies\u201d in a 2021 speech. At the time, Burgess had said the spies came from a \u201cforeign intelligence service\u201d but did not name their origin, saying Australia was facing espionage and foreign interference attempts \u201cfrom multiple countries\u201d. Burgess added, \u201cand before you jump to conclusions \u2026 I want to point out that the foreign intelligence service was not from a country in our region\u201d. On Wednesday evening, Shoebridge accused Burgess of giving an \u201cactive misdirect\u201d in that speech, accusing him of lying because India was in the region. Burgess said he would not comment on media reporting to confirm whether his \u201cnest of spies\u201d example was indeed based on Indian espionage. Shoebridge suggested he was not telling the truth when he said the country responsible for the \u201cnest of spies\u201d wasn\u2019t from the Indo-Pacific region. Burgess said: I told you the intent of saying that statement. I think I\u2019ve got nothing more to say about it. Shoebridge continues to press so things get a bit tense and the committee chair, Labor senator Nita Green, chimes in to say: You cannot continue to put \u2026 accusations like that in repetitive questions and expect a different answer. The committee moves on. The independent member for Kooyong, Monique Ryan, has urged her parliamentary colleagues not to use the conflict in Gaza as an \u201copportunity to gain votes\u201d. Earlier today, right after opening prayers, the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, moved to suspend the standing orders in order to debate a motion to recognise the state of Palestine. Other countries around the world have made steps to officially recognise Palestine, including Spain and Norway. The motion went down, 80 noes to 5 ayes, but not without criticism from the major parties. The Liberal MP Julian Leeser said the motion ran \u201ccontrary to the traditions of Australian foreign policy\u201d while the assistant foreign affairs minister, Tim Watts, said \u201csimplistic wedge motions in the house do nothing to advance the cause of peace\u201d. Ryan, who is seeking re-election in the Melbourne seat once held by the former Liberal treasurer Josh Frydenberg, released a statement on Wednesday describing the motion as \u201cdivisive\u201d. Ryan said: When Australia has announced recognition of a new state in the past, this has been by means of a statement by the foreign minister. Australian standing on the international stage requires a high degree of unity. We have always respected the government of the day\u2019s right to recognise foreign powers. A resolution to this effect by the House cuts across that practice \u2026 All around the world, people are looking to their leaders in good conscience, to do what they can to work for peace and end this senseless and tragic conflict. I urge all members of the house to stop seeing this unspeakable situation as an opportunity to gain votes. Instead of divisive motions, we should all stand in unity against antisemitism and Islamophobia. Instead of rhetoric that raises the temperature of our discourse and exacerbates tensions in our communities, we should focus on alleviating the extreme distress, sadness, anxiety and loss experienced by Jewish and Muslim Australians. These debates and motions do not help them, any more than they help the people of Gaza or of Israel. The international community must do what it can to end the tragedy in Gaza. I ask my colleagues to work towards that aim together \u2013 with empathy and clear mindedness \u2013 instead of stoking social division and tension. Inquiry says NSW government should set up \u2018in-house\u2019 consulting service The New South Wales government has been urged to set up an \u201cin-house\u201d consulting service and ban bureaucrats from taking on relevant consulting jobs for six months after they leave the public service. A parliamentary inquiry into the use of private consulting services by government made the recommendations after it found the former Coalition government was too reliant on consultants and paid for work normally designed for the public service when it was in power. The inquiry, which was led by a committee dominated by Labor MPs, was launched after a report by the NSW auditor general found the Coalition had spent more than $1bn on consultants between 2017 and 2022. It was also revealed that more than 25% of consultancy fees were concentrated with the \u201cbig four\u201d firms, including the scandal-hit PwC. In a scathing report released on Wednesday, the inquiry found the Coalition had been overly reliant on PwC, Ernst &amp; Young, Deloitte and KPMG. Read the full story here: Earlier today we brought you some debate on the government\u2019s Environment Protection Australia bill, which was tabled in parliament. In a joint statement, the Wilderness Society, Environmental Justice Australia, and the Conservation Council of WA have said the proposed bill \u201clacks accountability\u201d and \u201cwill be vulnerable to continued interference from vested interests\u201d if it does not have an independent board. The groups want the bill to include an independent board, which would appoint the EPA\u2019s chief executive; clear duties and objectives; provisions for public participation in decision-making and strong civil enforcement provisions; and adequate funding. Victoria Jack, a campaigner for the Wilderness Society, said: The Albanese government promised its reforms will improve trust and confidence in decisions about developments and the environment. But the trees are still being bulldozed, and the community\u2019s demands that forests are protected are continuously ignored, including some First Nations\u2019 requests that forest Country is protected from logging. At a minimum, the EPA must be unambiguously charged with ensuring the integrity of consultation. The public must be able to have a fair say about environmental decisions that will affect them. Transparency, genuine consultation, and the ability to challenge bad decisions are not only internationally recognised rights, but are also integral to the protection of nature for the benefit of all \u2013 not just for the benefit of vested interests. Time for some First Dog on the Moon, I reckon. Half of students in years 6 and 10 are falling behind in science, survey finds Almost half of year 6 and 10 students are falling behind in science, rising to six in 10 Indigenous students, a new Acara report shows. The National Assessment Program Science Literary Report, released on Wednesday, surveyed students\u2019 general science literacy skills and knowledge across a sample of schools in 2023. It found there had been little national improvement in outcomes since the tests began in the early 2000s, while significant gaps among disadvantaged cohorts had also remained stubbornly high. Some 57% of year 6 students attained the proficient standard in 2023, compared with 58% when the last test was completed in 2018. Some 54% of year 10 students reached the standard, compared with 50% in the previous round. Among Indigenous students, 34% in year 6 and just 28% in year 10 attained the proficient standard. There were also significant differences between students with parents from the highest and the lowest occupational and educational groups. Acara\u2019s acting CEO, Stephen Gniel, said science was \u201cone of the cornerstones\u201d of 21st century society: It\u2019s critical we are arming Australian students with the science literacy necessary not only to be able to participate as active citizens in our ever-advancing technological society, but also to help overcome its challenges, minimise its risks and contribute to its development. Engagement with science inside and outside the classroom also had a link to outcomes. Less than half of students surveyed said they had \u201cin-depth discussions about science ideas\u201d in their lessons, while in year 6 just two in 10 (22%) students learned science more than once a week. The House business is starting to wind down (although estimates is continuing and we will continue, of course, bring you those updates), so I will hand the blog over to Steph Convery, who will guide you through the evening. Keep checking back for regular updates, as well as news on the site. Politics Live (and me) will be back with you from early tomorrow morning for the last House sitting day this week (but don\u2019t worry, there is another session next week), so until then, take care of you. Ax Victorian government donates $125,000 to help Palestinian arrivals You may remember the Victorian government\u2019s annual Iftar dinner was cancelled after the Muslim community rejected invitations to attend, over the government\u2019s response to what was happening in Gaza. The Allan government has just announced it will be donating $125,000 to Palestine Australia Relief and Action (Para) to \u201csupport people who have arrived in Victorian since October 2023\u201d. Para provides tailored support to Palestinians who are granted visas to Australia, helping with access to culturally appropriate legal and accommodation support and access to finance and education programs. The state\u2019s multicultural affairs minister, Ingrid Stitt, said: The conflict in Israel-Gaza continues to have a devastating humanitarian impact and Palestinians fleeing the conflict are arriving in Victoria to be supported by their families. Many of these people have experienced the trauma of war \u2013 it\u2019s only right that we provide them with culturally appropriate support and services to help them feel welcomed, safe and connected in Victoria. Questions raised over independence of proposed EPA \u2018independent CEO\u2019 Back to the legislation issues today, and the Centre for Public Integrity has weighed in on the EPA bill. Board member Michael Barker KC says: If the Albanese Government\u2019s intention in introducing the EPA legislation is to create an independent CEO to advise the minister on a range of Commonwealth environmental functions and to exercise a number of regulatory functions, the question must be asked how independent the new CEO will be. Under the bill the CEO will be a ministerial appointment without any required candidate assessment processes or transparency in respect of how the appointment is made. Furthermore, once appointed, the minister may give the CEO Statements of Expectation as to the performance of functions that are not obviously distinguishable from ministerial directions. These are not features compatible with independence. Does Andrew Giles believe that he owes anyone an apology? Giles: [What I owe the Australian community] is to work day and night to keep the community safe, to do everything I can do with strong laws and resources, including more than a quarter of a billion dollars invested in supporting the cohort required to be released by the high court in NZYQ. On these issues, I owe the Australian community and my colleagues my absolute focus on continuing to do my job, which of course involves fixing the mess left with by Mr Dutton. Did Andrew Giles consider stepping down as minister? Giles: My focus has been and will continue to be focusing on fixing the mess that was left by Peter Dutton. A mess that has been revealed in three damning reviews: Nixon, Parkinson and Richardson. As we have seen, particularly today, in many reports, in the Sydney Morning Herald and parliament, today, we\u2019ve seen so many examples of decisions made by delegates of Mr Dutton when he was minister to release people in these circumstances. Decisions not by a court, not by a tribunal. Decisions made by delegates of the minister. This is something that is absolutely shocking \u2026 he is yet to account for his actions there. Is there a timeline on those six cases? Andrew Giles: The six are with the experts at the moment and we hope to get advice from those experts, the psychiatrists, as soon as possible to progress these matters at the earliest possible time and making sure, as we are required, that these are high-quality applications. Rushed applications won\u2019t keep anyone safe. We recognise also that there is a high threshold to be met here because, of course, is the very essence of preventive detention. Because we are in uncharted waters with community safety orders, what is the nature of the psychiatric advice that is sought in this review? The experts are there to provide advice around the propensity for reoffending and community safety. When it comes to the cohort of people who were released by the high court decision which made indefinite detention illegal, Andrew Giles says \u201cthat six cases have been referred for expert review\u201d. I can also say 26 cases, a further 26, in an advanced stage of preparation. This is a process that is extremely resource-intensive. The former government\u2019s high-risk terrorism scheme, upon which this was modelled, took three years for the first matter to proceed, so we are moving much more quickly because this is an absolute focus for me and for my department. Putting together one of these cases for expert review requires the consideration of thousands and sometimes tens of thousands of pages of documents and engaging with many state as well as commonwealth authorities, so I\u2019m very pleased to see this progress already under way. Does the revised ministerial directive 99 mean that Australia is walking back its commitment to the New Zealand government over the deportation issue that led to the creation of the directive in the first place? (The directive was created to try to have tribunals consider ties to the Australian community in making visa decisions, along with community safety, after New Zealand-born citizens who had spent most of their life in Australia were being deported back to NZ, despite having little connection with the country.) Andrew Giles says: I don\u2019t agree with your characterisation. We make all our decisions in Australia\u2019s national interest and what we are seeing here is something that has not been producing the commonsense and community safety focused results the Australian government and the Australian community expects. That is my focus, what I am intending to pursue. Was the directive a mistake to begin with? It has not produced in the administrative appeals tribunal decisions the outcomes we expected, nor produced the intended all the matters we were advised would flow from the direction, which is why we are pursuing a new revised direction. Does Andrew Giles feel \u201clet down\u201d by the AAT decisions? I am deeply concerned that these cases are very serious offenders having their visas granted back to them by the administrative appeals tribunal were not brought to my attention and the fact is some of these cases had been decided some time ago. That is unacceptable. My focus is now on ensuring I can consider the cancellation of any of these cases straightaway. My focus is on community safety but we need to have the protocol I put in place more than a year ago around, as minister, being alerted to any such decisions, for that to be in place, and I have instructed my department to advise me and my office within 24 hours now of any such decision of the administrative appeals tribunal. When did he make the decision to revise the ministerial direction 99? Andrew Giles: I sought urgent advice when these matters came to light late last week and I have met with my senior officials today to go through the approach I have outlined in the House. Q: Can you say when rewritten, there will be zero possibility of any tribunal member granting or restoring a visa that you have cancelled? Giles: What I can say is the direction, the new, revised direction, will make it abundantly clear community safety is a consideration that outweighs all other considerations. And beyond that, as I said, we will introduce further mechanisms to enable the perspective of victims and their families to be more clearly brought to bear and also to deal more effectively with the scourge that is family violence - and making sure that is effective is obviously something I am approaching with a laser-like focus. Pressed on whether that means he is confident there is \u201czero possibility\u201d, Giles says: I am focused in the first instance in ensuring a person who does not meet the requirements of the character test and is in Australia has their visa cancelled, something I have been focused on doing as minister. In terms of decisions of the tribunal, and you would be well aware yesterday we abolished the administrative appeals tribunal and putting in place an independent administrative tribunal, an independent body. We have to give it the clearest possible guidance to ensure its members\u2019 decisions meet the expectations of the Australian community. To be fair, it is very hard for a minister to guarantee that an independent process won\u2019t act in any particular way. The immigration minister, Andrew Giles, is appearing on ABC TV (from his dimly lit office in Parliament House, not the ABC parliamentary studio) and he is being asked about the \u201crevised\u201d ministerial direction 99: What we have seen in the administrative appeals tribunal decisions is the original intent of ministerial direction 99 was not being followed. We have seen that. We have not seen the commonsense approach Australians should expect, nor are we seeing the focus on community safety, and this was made clear in question time today. This was clearly a problem under previous directions under the former government too with many examples illustrated there. We are focused on a new, revised direction that will put a high weight on community safety, but also deal specifically with additional concerns we see around victims and their families being heard and, of course, around redoubling our focus on family violence prevention. Giles continued: Some of the administrative appeals tribunal decisions are very hard to reconcile with any sense of the expectations of the Australian community, no, frankly, commonsense. These are very concerning, which is why I have also rushed to consider cancellation submissions in respect of some cases brought to light, and already cancelled six visas having done so. Growth in funding for public schools lagging behind private schools in last decade, data shows Government funding for private schools grew at a faster rate than the public system in the past decade, new data reveals, despite 98% of public schools continuing to be underfunded to the minimum standard. The Productivity Commission\u2019s latest report on government services, released today, shows real per-student government spending on private schools grew by 3.7% a year in the decade to 2022 \u2013 a growth rate 60% higher than public schools, which only increased by 2.3%. The Greens say Australian governments have continued to fail public school students by topping up fee-charging private schools to the expense of the underfunded sector. The report also showed one in three (31.4%) public school students had low socio-educational advantage status, compared to 13.2% of private school students. The Greens spokesperson on primary and secondary education, senator Penny Allman-Payne said the school funding model was \u201ccatastrophically broken\u201d. The private sector is favoured above the public system, and poorer, regional and remote and First Nations kids are the ones who suffer. It is now beyond debate that public schools need to be funded to 100% of the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) as a matter of urgency. Greens ask Labor to negotiate with them on religious discrimination bill The Greens senator David Shoebridge and the Brisbane MP Stephen Bates have written to the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, asking for the government to negotiate with the Greens on religious discrimination legislation. The legislation is stalled because the government wants bipartisanship support, but Labor and the Coalition cannot agree on what the legislation should contain. The Greens say they are willing to work with the government to pass legislation in the senate, given that pathway to reform with the Coalition is, in their words \u201cuntenable\u201d: As we made clear in our meeting with you in March this year, the Australian Greens are ready, willing and able to work with the Government to urgently implement the recommendations of the ALRC report into religious discrimination. In that meeting we also requested a copy of the government\u2019s draft bill to enable us to actively progress the reforms. To our continuing frustration, and that of many engaged stakeholders, you have instead chosen to only provide the draft bill to the Coalition. We reiterate our request for a copy of the bill to allow this matter [to] progress. This reform is critically important and urgent. It is surely a matter where we can work across party lines to deliver a reform that is desperately needed to protect LGBTIQA+ students and their teachers and support staff, from active discrimination. Murray Watt says Dutton has had issue of released immigration detainees \u2018completely blow up in his face\u2019 The Labor senator Varun Ghosh at 2.35pm in Senate estimates asked a series of questions about criminal offenders released from immigration detention from 2014 to 2022, under the Coalition government. Strangely, a backbench senator already had the statistics his questions were seeking, while the Home Affairs and Australian Border Force officials did not and had to take the questions on notice. About 45 minutes later, officials were able to give answers that, yes: four murderers, alleged murderers or accessories to murder were released from immigration detention under the Coalition; 64 child sex offenders; and 40 domestic violence offenders. Officials confirmed that none of these were subject to electronic monitoring or curfews, as these conditions only passed parliament after the NZYQ high court decision in November 2023. Labor\u2019s Murray Watt, representing the immigration minister, said: This is a really extraordinary development in this entire story. What we\u2019ve seen today is Mr Dutton\u2019s political campaign on this issue completely blow up in his face. Mr Dutton and others in the Coalition have waged a political campaign demanding ministers resign, demanding all sorts of standards we now learn they have never complied with themselves. Watt said this had happened on Dutton\u2019s watch as home affairs minister, and not as a result of a high court decision. For about 15 minutes the website legislation.gov.au went down (it is back now). People trying to access it (including our own Elias Visontay) received a \u201cThis service is unavailable\u201d message. So either everyone is quite desperate to look up legislation, or gremlins are afoot. We\u2019ll let you know if there is something to know. Dutton hits back on social media Peter Dutton (or a staffer using Dutton\u2019s X account) has responded to some of the things Andrew Giles raised in QT (Giles cited SMH reporting) on social media: These are the full quotes provided to [David Crowe] I cancelled more than 6,300 visas \u2013 more than any Minister since Federation. The cancellation power was exercised within the limits of the Constitution. Mr Albanese watered down the law under Direction 99 and that\u2019s why you are seeing the complete failure by this Government and the hapless Andrew Giles. (He also then includes a personal attack against Crowe and a senior journalist not at all involved in any of this, because \u2026 Dutton.) No progress on improving speed of Canberra-Sydney rail despite priority listing Senior infrastructure public servants have revealed there has been no progress on improving the speed of the snail-like Canberra-Sydney train line, despite the proposal being identified as a priority project for the past four years. Speeds on the Canberra-Sydney train line have not progressed in decades, with the more than four-hour trip comfortably outpaced by cars, buses and planes, to the ire of the ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, who has repeatedly pleaded for either the commonwealth or New South Wales government to invest in modest upgrades that could significantly hasten the service. During Senate estimates on Wednesday, the independent senator David Pocock asked Adam Copp, the CEO of Infrastructure Australia \u2013 a commonwealth body that provides independent research and advice to governments on projects \u2013 about the status of the proposed upgrade, which had received submissions from the ACT and NSW governments. Copp said there had been \u201cno particular progress on that proposal\u201d, despite it being listed as a national significant \u201copportunity\u201d on Infrastructure Australia\u2019s priority list \u2013 described as a menu of options for governments to invest in \u2013 that could be delivered within 0-5 years. Copp, referring to either the NSW or federal government, said: It would need a proponent to take it forward. Barr has long pushed for either the NSW or the commonwealth to upgrade the list, given that just a handful of kilometres of the track lie within the ACT\u2019s borders, as well as the territory\u2019s comparatively smaller budget. Barr has been discussing cheaper, modest upgrades to the track to make it similar or slightly faster than the drive, as opposed to the high speed rail plan outlined by the Albanese government, a decades-long project for which Labor has chosen Sydney-Newcastle as the starting stretch. Sussan Ley wants Clare O\u2019Neil kicked out for interjections: She has repeatedly interjected since being warned. The standing orders should apply equally to both sides of the house and with respect, opposition members have been ejected. I ask that you similarly treat the minister for home affairs. Milton Dick moves on. And question time ends. Another question for Andrew Giles on visas and direction 99 There is another question around direction 99 being used by the AAT to reinstate a visa and Andrew Giles says: As I\u2019ve previously said in question time today, I will be issuing a new revised ministerial direction. And part of that is to ensure that visa decisions are guided by those two principles: protection of the community and common sense. And as I said in an answer to an earlier question, there will be a higher focus on these than has been the case in the past. And I\u2019m sure the leader of the opposition, when he was listening to the examples that the prime minister put to him, was reflecting on how previous ministerial directions might, under him, might have been improved too. These are changes that will improve decision making. Now, on the specific question, I can say that I have already briefed senior officials of my department. So that these changes can progress expeditiously. Dan Tehan goes to make a point of order, but Milton Dick pre-empts him by saying that Giles is being directly relevant and it would be a very long bow to say he is not and Tehan sits back down. \u201cSmart move,\u201d says Dick. Giles: \u2026 And I note again a report in today\u2019s Sydney Morning Herald, which begins: \u2018Two men convicted of accessory to murder were released from federal detention when opposition leader Peter Dutton was the minister in charge of immigration and home affairs.\u2019 Released by him \u2013 not by the AAT, by his delegate when he was responsible. Wilkie asks PM whether government is \u2018kicking the can down the road\u2019 on gambling reforms Andrew Wilkie asks Anthony Albanese: Prime minister, it\u2019s almost a year since the standing committee on social policy and legal affairs released its report on online gambling and its impacts on those experiencing gambling harm. So why hasn\u2019t the government implemented the committee\u2019s recommendations including a gambling advertising ban? And when will the government implement the recommendations? Or are you just kicking the can down the road until after the next election? Albanese: The government has done more in our two years than those opposite did in their almost decade in office. This is what we have done. We\u2019ve launched Betstop, the national self-exclusion register. We\u2019ve mandated customer verification for all new online wagering accounts to prevent children from gambling and strengthen protections for Australians who have registered for bet stop. We\u2019ve agreed with the states and territories for new minimum classifications for video games with gambling like content. We\u2019ve implemented new evidence-based taglines to replace the gambling taglines that were previously there that were ineffective. And we\u2019ve introduced nationally consistent staff training. We\u2019ve required online wagering companies to send their customers monthly activity statements outlining wins and losses. We\u2019ve legislated a ban on the use of credit cards for gambling. What we know, though, is that there is more to do, and the minister for communications and the minister for social services are working diligently through all of the recommendations that were contained in the report. \u2026 I think of our dear friend, I think we can say in this chamber, Peta Murphy, the report that she did; we\u2019re working through it in an orderly way. We\u2019re consulting all the appropriate groups, including gambling groups. I\u2019ve met with a range of stakeholders, including people like Tim Costello and others about these issues. We want to make sure there\u2019s a comprehensive approach to tackling gambling harm. Australia has raised with Japan targeting of large fin whales in future hunting, official says The Australian government has raised directly with the Japanese government that country\u2019s recent widening of its whale hunting programs. In a Senate estimates hearing, the Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson asked an official from the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water if the government was aware of Japan\u2019s recent decision to add large fin whales to its list of whale species it would target in future hunts. An official said: We are aware and have raised it directly with the Japanese government. They added that a secretary from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had raised the issue verbally with the Japanese government. The issue had been raised verbally, the official said. TikTok\u2019s use of tracking pixel not a breach of law and \u2018sadly not unique\u2019 to platform: privacy commissioner The Australian privacy commissioner has decided against investigating TikTok for using a tracking pixel that collects information about its users on pages across the internet, noting that while invasive, it is not a breach of the law or unique to TikTok. The pixel collects information about users based on the websites they visit where the pixel is embedded, sending it back to the companies that use the pixel information about what they were doing on those sites. It is a tool used by a number of organisations, but the focus on TikTok\u2019s use comes amid moves both here and abroad to ban the app due to its Chinese parent company. The Nine newspapers reported on the matter in December last year, prompting the initial inquiries from the OAIC, and for the shadow cybersecurity minister, James Paterson, to claim it was a potentially mass breach of privacy. The privacy commissioner, Carly Kind, said in a statement on Wednesday that there was \u201cno clear and obvious breach of Australian privacy law that would warrant opening an investigation and the issues \u201care sadly not unique to TikTok\u201d: Pixels are one of many tracking tools, including cookies, that permit granular user surveillance across the internet and social media platforms. Many of these tracking tools are harmful, invasive and corrosive of online privacy. We urgently need reform of the Privacy Act. It is the best way to tackle the most harmful aspects of the digital ecosystem. Kind said the OAIC was considering how to address issues raised by the proliferation of online tracking tools, including better disclosure by sites using them. Giles points to reports of offenders released into community while opposition was in government Dan Tehan is back again! Didn\u2019t the minister mislead the parliament when he said each of the 153 hardened criminals would be continually monitored, given that evidence in Senate estimates advises that 26 sex offenders, including child sex offenders, no longer have electronic monitoring order? Andrew Giles: This is a question I\u2019ve answered previously, relying on the evidence given to Senate estimates that the detainees who were required to be released are being continuously monitored. But in relation to the last aspect of this question, I am deeply concerned by reports just in, in the Sydney Morning Herald, that refer to 102 convicted sex offenders released into the community when the leader of the opposition was responsible, and 64 child sex offenders not brought by order of the court or tribunal members released by his [ministerial orders]. Tehan tries to raise a point of order but Giles has finished his answer, so no point of order! Milton Dick issues a Barnaby Joyce-specific warning, that anyone who is the member for New England should shut it, or be kicked out. He\u2019s been here in the parliament for almost 20 years and will cease interjecting for the remainder of question time and \u2026 is now on a warning. I know he\u2019s never been thrown out of parliament before. It is not a competition. The member for New England will remain silent for the remainder of question time. Imagine having that power for just general life. \u2018The location of every individual is known\u2019, says Giles after question on released immigration detainees Dan Tehan is back (hashtag blessed) with another question which has similar vibes to the previous questions, but is in relation to a different cohort. (Every time a Coalition MP says \u201chardened criminals\u201d, they mean the cohort who were released after the high court ruled that indefinite detention was illegal. The cohort does include people who served sentences for crimes, but it also includes people who were not convicted of crimes, or not charged. It is also worth remembering that Australian citizens who commit crimes are released into the community once they have served any custodial sentence ordered by a court.) Tehan: Can the minister for immigration confirm, of the 153 hardened criminals that were released into the community, at least two of the murderers [are] in the community without electronic monitoring, and if we know it is at least two, what is the number of murderers out in the community without electronic monitoring? Andrew Giles: I thank the shadow minister for his question and I do say that it was the leader of the opposition sitting there who let someone out of immigration detention, his [direction] that [got] that person a visa with no monitoring and no reporting obligations, and that person than went on to allegedly commit a crime, and he doesn\u2019t seem interested in talking about it. Because he and the shadow minister always play politics. This group of people are constantly being monitored. As the ABF have advised, the location of every individual is known. The decisions made by delegates are informed by the work of the community protection board which is comprised of a range of expert people with deep experience in these areas who consider each case on its merits as the law requires. As Paul Karp reported earlier, this was also ranged in estimates and the ABF commissioner, Michael Outram, said that the delegates\u2019 decisions on curfews and ankle bracelets are made \u201cjudiciously and studiously\u201d and consider a range of information, disputing the approach of looking at a criminal conviction and assuming they\u2019re \u201call the same\u201d. Each case revolves on its own merits. Milton Dick deals with the points of order: He takes Monique Ryan\u2019s point, but says no one is identified and it is up to the member to make sure the details are accurate. He wants silence when people raise their points of order. No matter who it is. Andrew Giles then gets to answer: The government continues to cancel visas on character grounds as it appears to have been the case here. I continue to cancel visas from set-asides [tribunal decisions] where appropriate. As I outlined an in the prime minister outlined, we are issuing a new direction that is revised and we will be focused on \u2026 Dan Tehan has a point of order. Milton Dick points out Giles has been speaking for just 15 seconds and it would be virtually impossible to have a point of order on relevance at this point of the answer. Tehan, though, has always seemed to believe that \u201cfools rush in where angels fear to tread\u201d is political career advice, and says: The question is, when will they revoke ministerial order 99? Dick points out that members need to say what their point of order is actually on, but is assuming it is relevance and therefore, there will be no more points of order on relevance with this answer. Giles: As I was saying, the new revised direction will ensure the two principles that have always been at the heart of these ministerial directions in commonsense decision making will take place at the \u2026 new ART. It will make sure that community protection outweighs other considerations and, particularly going to the case that the member referred to, we will strengthen the principles of community safety including the impact [on] victims and their families, and strengthen the family violence provisions. Monique Ryan accuses opposition of \u2018dog whistling\u2019 in questions Kooyong independent Monique Ryan has had enough and raises a point of order on one of the standing orders which says \u201cquestions must not contain statements of fact unless they are strictly necessary to make the question is intelligible\u201d. The opposition all week has provided us with unnecessary country of origin and the alleged crimes \u2026 There are a lot of interjections from the Coalition and Milton Dick has to call for order. Ryan continues: The parliament does not need to hear the details of the alleged or prosecuted crimes of these individuals imposing these questions. It is unparliamentary and it is dog whistling. Tony Burke also has a point of order about the interjections during Ryan\u2019s point of order: Particularly when members of the crossbench raise points of order, there is a level of aggression and shouting led by the leader of the opposition that is quite different to what I just got [when raising a point of order]. \u2026 The level of direct anger and aggression from the leader of the opposition is just out of control, every time there is a point of order from the cross bench. They have a right to raise these points of order. Paul Fletcher is very cranky as he makes his OWN point of order, which is that the details in the questions are VERY relevant. Firstly, everyone in this situation, certainly can be authenticated because they can be taken from decisions of the administrative appeals tribunal and are they necessary to make the question intelligible? Absolutely they are, in each case we have seen appalling acts of violence and it is going to the public policy question which needs to be determined. Dan Tehan is the latest on the direction 99 carousel and he again gives details (country of origin, crime etc) before ending with the same kicker we have heard for the past two days: The Albanese Labor government is watering down the law and allowing criminals to stay in Australia making the country less safe. When will the Labor government apologise for this catastrophic mistake and revoke direction 99? Giles: \u2018We have not been seeing common sense\u2019 at AAT on visa decisions There is another question about someone whose visa had been cancelled by Andrew Giles, who had it reinstated by the administrative appeals tribunal (AAT) and who had committed or was alleged to have committed crimes (the crimes or alleged crimes being focused on here are violence against women and children). Andrew Giles says: All of us here are concerned for the victims in these circumstances. That is why as the prime minister has said, and I have just outlined at some length, that we are introducing a new revised ministerial direction to ensure clear principles we have held for some time, protection of the community and common sense, will make decisions consistently at the AAT where we have not been seeing common sense. Yesterday, members opposite had a say about that. They chose to vote to keep the AAT. You may have noticed there is a sharpening of the messages when it comes to the AAT\u2019s role in this. It started this morning with Clare O\u2019Neil saying the tribunal\u2019s decisions went against the government and community\u2019s expectations, and now Giles have said those decisions did not contain \u201ccommon sense\u201d. Each one of the dixers are around veteran affairs and what has been done for veterans since the Albanese government came to power, in case you were wondering. And it is across portfolios \u2013 even the PM has got in on the dixer action. Plibersek fields question from Katter on air quality and reduced carbon-based fuels Bob Katter has just asked a question, and truly, I am at a complete loss as to what it was about. There was some sort of walking stick involved, I think? Brazil was mentioned, I know that much. Tanya Plibersek, match-fit from her regular \u201cdebate\u201d with Barnaby Joyce on breakfast television, is a little more across what the member for Kennedy was asking about. I understand the member for Kennedy is asking about air quality [and] the better air quality we would get with reduced carbon-based fuels. The first thing I would say to him is, of course, that is exactly why [we] have introduced the vehicle emission [standards] \u2026 It is about cheap and efficient fuel use in vehicles, but also about air quality. Sussan Ley hasn\u2019t had too many opportunities to Sussan Ley lately, but she takes one here: I move an extension of time to give the minister time to apologise for the horrific abuses that have been described by the individual that he has let out on the streets. Andrew Giles does not take up the offer. Giles targeted again with questions on visa cancellations We are back to the non-government questions and it\u2019s about \u2026 you guessed it, direction 99. Andrew Giles is asked much the same question he was asked yesterday. (The Australian newspaper ran each of the questions from the opposition and the response from Giles (it was the same response said in slightly different way), in a snazzy infographic if you need a catchup.) Giles seems a little over all of it today: Time after time [I] get questions from those opposite; one remains unanswered. The leader of the opposition is still yet to tell us why he, here, not a court or a tribunal, he released a detainee from detention who went on to allegedly commit a violent crime. When will he answer that question? The government continues to refuse and cancel visas on character grounds. I continue to cancel AAT set-asides, section 501 has not changed. The Albanese government has always said that visa decisions need to be guided by two clear principles. Firstly the protection of the Australian community. Secondly, common sense. A number of recent AAT \u2026 decisions have not shown common sense. Yesterday, the parliament passed legislation to abolish the AAT and replace it with a new Administrative Review Tribunal. \u2026 I will be updating ministerial direction 99, as the prime minister has just said. The new direction will ensure that all members of the ART will adopt a commonsense approach to visa decisions, consistent with the intent of ministerial direction 99. First and foremost, this means ensuring that the protection of the community outweighs other considerations. This is always been the Albanese government\u2019s highest priority. Consistent with this, Mr Speaker, and I hope members opposite will be interested in this, the revised direction will also strengthen the principles of community safety in the making of decisions. Including the impact that the decisions on the victim of crime and their family members. And it also strengthen the family violence provisions to reflect the government\u2019s and Australians more broadly commitment to end violence against women and children. Veteran affairs minister defends budget\u2019s increase to number of public servants One of the criticisms from the opposition about the budget is that it set out an increase to the number of public servants. The minister for veteran affairs, Matt Keogh, is running a defence on that in this dixer, where he explains how the veterans\u2019 affairs department did not have enough staff to help veterans. He said when Labor came to government, there was a backlog of claims stretching to more than 42,000 former ADF personnel. It\u2019s the processing of these backlog of claims that we inherited that means we are spending an additional $6.5bn over five years to give veterans the benefits that they deserve. It\u2019s why it is so concerning that some say the government should be cutting back on the staff it has, which would result in veterans getting benefits. This is not about politics. It\u2019s about doing the right thing. ABF tells Senate at least two non-citizens convicted of murder or attempted murder do not have ankle bracelets In Senate estimates, Australian Border Force officials have revealed that at least two people convicted of murder or attempted murder from the 153 non-citizens released by the high court ruling are not required to wear electronic monitoring ankle bracelets. In February, it was revealed seven of the non-citizens in the NZYQ cohort had been convicted of murder or attempted murder. The shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, asked how many of these seven were subject to electronic monitoring. Vanessa Holben, the deputy commissioner regional operations, replied \u201cless than five\u201d. Paterson said it was \u201cextraordinary\u201d that this meant at least two people convicted of murder or attempted murder didn\u2019t have electronic monitoring. Holben noted there were \u201ca range\u201d of other conditions to monitor them. ABF commissioner, Michael Outram, said that the delegates\u2019 decisions on curfews and ankle bracelets are made \u201cjudiciously and studiously\u201d and consider a range of information, disputing the approach of looking at a criminal conviction and assuming they\u2019re \u201call the same\u201d. \u201cEach case revolves on its own merits.\u201d Outram said ankle bracelets and curfews are not \u201ca panacea\u201d and the law does not require everyone with a particular type of offence must be subject to those conditions. Paterson said \u201ca murder is a murder\u201d and demanded to know what possible extenuating circumstances could justify them not having ankle bracelets. Outram said the offences \u201ccould be years ago\u201d, and there was a \u201cbig difference between some murders and other murders\u201d, differences in the \u201crehabilitation\u201d or prospects of rehabilitation of the person, and the potential risk of reoffending. Outram said he worried about the independence of decision-making, warning against putting decision-makers under such \u201cexternal scrutiny that they cannot make decisions\u201d, rejecting a \u201cstraw poll\u201d of public input. Earlier, Murray Watt said that it \u201cmight be easy\u201d to quibble with the fact that less than half of the 153 now have curfews and electronic monitoring: The way we have designed this regime is to ensure the best possible chance of [the regime] not being overturned by further high court challenge. We are straight into the questions and the theme of the opposition\u2019s pursuit today is immediately clear with Peter Dutton\u2019s first question: does Anthony Albanese have confidence in his immigration minister, Andrew Giles? I do [is Albanese\u2019s short answer]. Albanese: The government continues to refuse and cancel visas on character grounds. Section 501 has not changed and I make this point: since coming to government we [have] deported over 4,200 individuals from immigration detention. In our first year of government the number of individuals we deported from immigration detention was almost double the number the previous government deported the year prior. The AAT made a decision independently of government to overturn visa cancellations. As the minister has said he will be reviewing the recent AAT decisions. Parliament yesterday passed legislation abolishing the AAT and replacing it with a new administrative review tribunal. The only effective way of ensuring the tribunal members are making better decisions is to issue a new revised direction which the minister will be doing. The new directive will ensure that the protection [of the community] outweighs any other consideration. There are heaps of interjections and then Anthony Albanese moves on to Peter Dutton\u2019s history and everyone gets even louder. The Office of National Intelligence was ordered by the Albanese government to conduct a climate threat assessment shortly after the election, but the government has refused to release a declassified version of that report. At the estimates hearing, David Shoebridge asked a series of questions about a recent report by the Australian Security Leaders Climate Group, called Too hot to handle: the scorching reality of Australia\u2019s climate-security failure. He asked whether rapid climate change would have an impact on how northern bases operate as extreme heat and weather made itself felt across the region. ONI boss, Andrew Shearer, said he accepted it was \u201cpotentially a significant issue\u201d, adding: The impact of climate on our northern bases is a matter for Defence, senator. We are monitoring the climate change issue in its complexity. It\u2019s a priority for us, as I said, and it has many implications for national security and extending beyond national security. Shearer said he had a team of analysts who worked on climate and energy issues, but he declined to reveal the size of that team. Asked about ONI\u2019s resources, Shearer said his agency \u2013 like other agencies in the national intelligence community \u2013 was \u201cstretched by the number and the complexity of the threats and challenges we\u2019re facing, including climate change\u201d. The head of the Office of National Intelligence, Andrew Shearer, has been questioned at Senate estimates about the security threats posed by the climate crisis. Shearer made mention of ONI\u2019s predecessor agency, the Office of National Assessments. He said he was \u201cquite proud of our track record on the climate issue\u201d, saying that the agency first \u201cfirst wrote on fossil fuels and the greenhouse effect in 1981\u201d. That prompted the Greens senator David Shoebridge to observe \u201cif only people had listened \u2013 the government had listened\u201d to that advice. Shearer said: I can\u2019t comment on how our product is received. Update: My colleague, Graham Readfearn, wrote the following piece about this 1981 work: The 90-second statements (airing of the grievances/\u201caren\u2019t community groups great?\u201d statements) are under way in the house, which means QT is just about to begin. We\u2019ll head into the chamber. Eastern and northern suburbs of Sydney to account for 41% of new homes by 2029, Minns announces Councils in Sydney\u2019s eastern and northern suburbs will be responsible for delivering 41% of new homes in the city over the next five years under \u201cfairer\u201d housing targets announced by the Minns government. The government needs to build 377,000 new homes across the state by 2029 in order to meet its obligations under the national housing accord. The premier, Chris Minns, is speaking at an event in Sydney hosted by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, where he released each council\u2019s share of the new homes and a \u201croadmap\u201d towards meeting the targets. Minns said: They\u2019re going to be hard to meet. The map is an important exercise because it starts to rebalance Sydney from greenfield to almost exclusively brownfield development. For a long time, western Sydney has accepted the overwhelming burden of new growth and as a result social infrastructure has had to stretch. Under the targets, 82% of new homes would be built in established infill areas and 18% would be built in undeveloped greenfield locations. Under the targets, 107,100 new homes would be built in Sydney\u2019s east and north, 97,200 homes built in the city\u2019s \u201ccentral\u201d local government areas such as Parramatta and 59,100 homes built in western suburbs LGAs such as Penrith. On the Central Coast, 9,400 new homes would be built, while there would be 18,880 homes built in the Illawarra-Shoalhaven, 30,400 homes in Greater Newcastle and 55,000 across the rest of regional NSW. Minns has also announced a $200m incentive scheme for councils that meet and beat the new housing targets. Australia faces \u2018serious and sustained threat\u2019 from foreign spies, intelligence boss says The head of the Office of National Intelligence, Andrew Shearer, has told a Senate estimates hearing that Australia faces \u201ca serious and sustained threat\u201d from foreign spies, including but not exclusively from China\u2019s intelligence services. Shearer was asked about a claim made by one speaker at a defence conference organised by the Australian newspaper yesterday about the number of spies from China potentially operating in Australia. Shearer \u2013 a former adviser to conservative prime ministers who retained his role at the head of the intelligence community when Labor took office \u2013 said the question was better directed to the domestic spy agency Asio and he couldn\u2019t get into \u201cclassified details\u201d. But Shearer told the Senate committee: It is clear that there is a serious and sustained threat to us from foreign intelligence services including China\u2019s \u2013 but not only China\u2019s, but a number of others \u2013 as outlined in the director general for security\u2019s annual threat assessment. Asked by the Coalition\u2019s Simon Birmingham to describe the tempo of military activity across the Indo-Pacific region by China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army, Shearer said: PLA military activity continues across the Indo-Pacific region at a high tempo. We certainly see a significant PLA military and paramilitary presence around Taiwan as part of Beijing\u2019s pressure campaign to cow Taiwan into compliance, and we also see a concerning range of interception activities both at sea and in the air of Australian and other ships and aircraft. And finally we see a continuing heavy military and paramilitary presence by the PLA, both naval and air forces, in the South China Sea, for sample at Second Thomas Shoal, where they have been interfering with the Philippines\u2019 legitimate resupply operations. Shearer said the PLA was bringing more and more military platforms into service, and also coastguard and other paramilitary vessels, \u201cand there are more of them, operating in our region, on a more sustained basis\u201d. There is less than 30 minutes until question time, so get what you need to be comfortable. Or whatever it is you need to endure it. Same thing, really. Eleven public servants who are paid an average salary of $400,000 charged taxpayers almost $2,000 for dinner and alcohol at a Canberra restaurant in February. The $1,889 restaurant bill claimed by executives of Airservices Australia \u2013 the government agency charged with air traffic control in Australia and which has come under intense scrutiny in recent years for workplace bullying, staff shortages and related delays and cancellations to flights \u2013 was revealed during Senate estimates on Wednesday. CEO Jason Harfield, who endured hours of grilling on Wednesday in what are his final days in the role after the government decided not to renew his term, responded to questions from Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie about the dinner. Harfield said that while the dinner on 7 February was to farewell one of the agency\u2019s managers, it was standard practice in that the executives routinely held a dinner at a restaurant after their monthly meetings where managers meet in Canberra, and that claiming alcohol at these dinners was also standard. McKenzie noted that the average spend per head at the dinner was about $171, and asked Harfield \u2013 who has previously told estimates his salary has been about $950,000 \u2013 what the average salary of his fellow diners would have been. He replied: \u201cLet\u2019s just say an average of $400,000.\u201d McKenzie replied: \u201cOn average, 11 people earning over $400,000 a year having a free dinner thanks to the taxpayer, thank you.\u201d Earlier on in the estimates appearance, Harfield conceded that staffing shortages at Airservices Australia had been responsible for \u201ca major portion\u201d of cancellations that airlines had been forced to make, but that the agency had been improving so far in 2024. EU invites Australia to attend peace summit on Russia-Ukraine conflict AAP has reported that the European Union wants Australia to attend a peace summit in Switzerland to discuss Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Ambassadors from the EU and member states issued the call to Australia\u2019s foreign affairs department on Tuesday, a European official confirmed. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is yet to decide on attending the mid-June summit, his department\u2019s deputy secretary Graham Fletcher told a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday. \u201cThe invitation has been received and it\u2019s under consideration,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cAn announcement will be made in due course.\u201d The Department of Foreign Affairs has been contacted for comment. Ups and downs of parliamentary life revealed For a little bit of light relief, we will take you to the Parliament House foyer, where former deputy prime minister Michael McCormack is speaking to schoolchildren who are touring the building. Paul Karp stopped to listen and heard McCormack impart the sort of knowledge you can only learn from someone who has spent 14 years in the parliament, learning its secrets intimately. Elevators generally go to the next floor or, dare I say, down to the basement and car park. There is just something about the tours former National leaders give to school children visiting Parliament House \u2013 I remember Daniel Hurst reporting Barnaby Joyce asking a group of tiny children in December 2022: Who used to be the deputy prime minister of Australia? Me! They looked as impressed as you could imagine, from memory. Pocock says new environment bill \u2018bureaucracy for bureaucracy\u2019s sake\u2019 Back to the government\u2019s coming battle over its environment legislation (and a little inception blog moment), key Senate crossbencher David Pocock has also announced his reservations, agreeing with the Climate Council\u2019s assessment of the bill. Without first fixing our broken environmental laws, the new EPA will just be bureaucracy for bureaucracy\u2019s sake with no added protection for nature. Angus Taylor expresses himself on inflation Shadow treasurer Angus Taylor has responded to the inflation numbers, and he also has thoughts, feelings, emotions: This is the consequence of the Albanese Labor government\u2019s confused economic priorities. Under Labor, we\u2019ve seen a collapse in Australians\u2019 standard of living and productivity. Australian households are in a recession. But instead of reining in spending and getting government out of the way, the Albanese Labor government has been doing the opposite. Our economy is suffering from a weak prime minister and weak treasurer who have no vision for Australia\u2019s future. (It is worth pointing out that the ABS noted that without some of that spending (the energy rebate) energy prices would have been even higher. It is also worth keeping an eye on the sluggish economy and what further spending cuts could mean for the spending habits of an already under pressure working population.) The CSIRO has no doubts that its numbers on nuclear power are correct. As Graham Readfearn reports: The CSIRO says it stands by its analysis on the costs of future nuclear power plants in Australia after the Coalition attacked the work, which contradicted its claims reactors would provide cheap electricity and be available within a decade. This will no doubt create lots of thoughts for the Coalition\u2019s nuclear spokesperson, Ted O\u2019Brien, whose feelings for nuclear could power this nation into 2050 and beyond, if only they could be harnessed as an energy source. Just in light of some of the debate in the House of Representatives today, with Spain, Norway and Ireland recognising Palestinian statehood overnight that makes 145 of the 195 UN member states that have recognised Palestine. Here is German new outlet DW News showing what that looks like on a map: The Greens have officially responded to Labor\u2019s latest environment legislation and as expected, the party is not impressed. If the Coalition say no to negotiations on this (which looks like happening), Labor will have to convince the Greens and the crossbench to come to the Senate voting party with them, and so far that is also not looking like happening. Sarah Hanson-Young: It\u2019s a terrible day for nature as the Labor government has sold out the environment in favour of the bulldozers, the chainsaws and the fossil fuel polluters. Today the Albanese government confirmed that from now until the election they will continue to approve the destruction and pollution that threatens koalas and puts our kids\u2019 future of a safe climate at risk. What\u2019s been put on the table won\u2019t save our wildlife, won\u2019t stop native forest logging and won\u2019t stop the expansion of climate-wrecking coal and gas mines. The reason mining corporations are crowing and environment groups are furious today is because Labor has caved-in to the logging and mining lobby who want faster and easier approvals for their destructive projects. Our environment will pay the price. The Greens are now also running a tally on fossil fuel approvals and say: Since coming into office the Albanese government has approved five new coal mines. Eight gas mines have also been approved on their watch. There are currently 148 proposals to destroy koala habitat in the pipeline. There are about 117 fossil fuel mines in the pipeline. 740 fossil fuel projects have been approved under the current laws GetUp has created what it is calling a \u201ccost of living map\u201d with the aim of highlighting what the inflation figures actually mean to people\u2019s lives. The group\u2019s chief campaigns officer, Amy Gordon, said CPI wasn\u2019t just numbers. Every day, Australians are making heartbreaking decisions about whether to pay the rent, buy groceries or keep the lights on. These aren\u2019t just statistics \u2013 they are real stories of hardship and resilience. Dozens of detainees released after high court ruling charged, ABF says At Senate estimates the shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, has confirmed with Australian Border Force (ABF) officials that 10 people charged with visa breaches before a fault in Bridging Visa Rs was discovered on 12 March have had charges against them dropped. Since then, the ABF reveals that five people in the NZYQ cohort (non-citizens released as a result of the high court\u2019s ruling on indefinite detention) have been charged with breaches of harsh new visa conditions (curfews and electronic monitoring). Vanessa Holben, the deputy commissioner regional operations, revealed that 29 individuals in the NZYQ cohort had been charged with alleged breaches of state and territory offences. Holben said the offences included: 19 alleged thefts 11 alleged assaults Nine alleged drug possession offences Seven alleged breaches of bail conditions Five alleged breach of child protection orders Categories with fewer than five charges included alleged: act of indecency, blackmail, breach of domestic violence order, breach of police order, breach of state monitoring, criminal damage, driving while unlicensed, drug driving, impersonating a police officer, kidnapping, outstanding warrant, resist arrest, robbery, stalking, threat to kill, threat to sexual offence, trespass and weapon possession. Education minister quizzed on Giles Jason Clare had an earlier press conference which was meant to be about the commonwealth prac payment (where students in nursing and education will receive pay while completing the practical elements of their degrees) but all the questions were about Andrew Giles. Q: Why shouldn\u2019t Andrew Giles be fired? Clare: The minister has made it clear that the decision of the AAT doesn\u2019t meet community expectations. Serious criminals to be deported. And it\u2019s worth making the point that ministers in this government, in the first two years of this government, have cancelled the visas of more serious offenders than the previous government did in their last two years. The AAT made the decision to overturn the cancellation of visas. I can\u2019t speak to individual cases here but do want to underline the point that the minister\u2019s made, that he\u2019s asked the department to quickly review those decisions. Q: The department has admitted responsibility, but doesn\u2019t the buck stop with the minister? Clare: The department recognised they didn\u2019t brief the minister properly and that they will correct that. That\u2019s the right thing to do. Q: The case of the foreign criminal stating this is a direct result of minister Giles\u2019 Direction 99. Does that direction meet community standards? And wouldn\u2019t you think it\u2019s time for minister Giles to stand aside? Clare: That direction sets out a number of things that the tribunal needs to consider, including the seriousness of the offence. The minister has made the point. Let me make the point again that the decision of the tribunal does not meet community expectations. If you\u2019re a serious offender, you\u2019d want them deported out of Australia. The minister\u2019s made that point. I make that point as well. Q: So why not revoke that direction? Don\u2019t you think he should? Clare: The minister has said that the decision of the tribunal doesn\u2019t meet community expectations. He\u2019s now working with his department on reviewing those decisions. Ayres jousts with Birmingham at hearing A heated encounter in Senate estimates just now, as assistant minister Tim Ayres and opposition senate leader Simon Birmingham square off over migration \u2013 with the government claiming the opposition was seeking \u201ccontroversy\u201d as its tactic. The prime minister\u2019s department is currently appearing before the finance and public admin committee. Birmingham asked whether PM Albanese had been briefed, or sought briefings, on the controversial \u201cministerial decision 99\u201d made by immigration minister Andrew Giles, which is at the centre of visa cases where serious criminals got their visas back. Ayres was unhappy at the line of questioning from Birmingham, who questioned why the PM hadn\u2019t sought such briefings on the matter currently engulfing the government in controversy. Ayres pointed to the Labor government\u2019s record and statistics on deportations, saying: I understand the political, partisan, relentlessly partisan approach, as you just indicated. Controversy is a victory for this opposition. It all comes undone when you\u2019re subject to any level of scrutiny, Mr Dutton\u2019s\u2026\u201d Birmingham then cut across, sternly advising: \u201cIf you want the day to blow out, you\u2019ll conduct yourself like you\u2019re conducting yourself now. Will we have this kind of answer every time?\u201d Ayres: My mother used to say, \u2018Tim, I can read you like a book, and a bloody boring book it is too.\u2019 You could see yesterday, the behaviour of this group dragging proceedings out. You could see it all through the day. If it\u2019s going to happen again, we\u2019ll deal with it the same way. Birmingham: Can I seek an answer to the question I asked? Which through the many minutes of Labor talking points you completely dodged around. Ayres answered that the government would \u201ccontinue to work through the issues\u201d on migration. For those who didn\u2019t have the chamber on this morning, here is what Adam Bandt said in the Greens\u2019 bid to have the house recognise the state of Palestine. (Along with some of Tim Watts\u2019 response.) National parks chief to plead guilty over Kakadu sacred site damage The director of National Parks has confirmed he will plead guilty to criminal proceedings before the Northern Territory\u2019s local court on behalf of the organisation over damage caused to a sacred site in Kakadu national park in 2019. It comes after the high court ruled that the commonwealth government can be held criminally liable for damages to Indigenous sacred sites. Ricky Archer, the first First Nations man to take the role of director of National Parks, wrote in a statement announcing that he would plead guilty that since taking the role in November last year he had been committed to resolving the matter and repairing relationships with Traditional Owners. The case centres on damage to Gunlom Falls in Kakadu national park after a walkway was built too close to a sacred men\u2019s site. The damage occurred in 2019, before Archer took on the role. Archer said he was deeply sorry for the wrongs of the past, adding Parks Australia\u2019s focus now was to work with Traditional Owners, the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority (AAPA), and the Northern Land Council (NLC) on next steps for the site. He said work had been done over the past two years to realign the walking track.. Archer said in a statement: Again, I regret and am sorry for the upset caused to Traditional Owners. I would like to reassure all of Kakadu\u2019s Traditional Owners, the Gunlom Aboriginal Land Trust, and the Kakadu National Park Board of Management, that the lessons learned from this situation will improve how Parks Australia plans and executes projects. This includes how Parks Australia works with the NLC and AAPA to facilitate consultation around projects, to ensure something like this never happens again. More on the high courts decision here: Food, housing, power prices on the rise You may have read some of the economists\u2019 predictions on inflation going down and thought \u2013 well that doesn\u2019t feel right, because it still feels like everything in the essentials basket is going up. If you did have those thoughts, it is not in your head. The ABS also reports: Housing rose 4.9% in the 12 months to April, down from 5.2% in March. Rents increased 7.5% for the year, reflecting a tight rental market and low vacancy rates across the country. New dwelling prices rose 4.9% over the year, with builders passing higher costs for labour and materials on to the consumer. Annual price growth for new dwellings has been around 5% since August 2023. Electricity prices rose 4.2% in the 12 months to April. The introduction of the energy bill relief fund rebates from July last year has mostly offset electricity price rises from annual price reviews in July 2023 due to higher wholesale prices (although without the rebates from the government, that increase would have been 13.9%). Annual inflation for food and non-alcoholic beverages rose to 3.8% in April, up from 3.5% in March. All food categories except meat and seafood contributed to the annual rise. Fruit and vegetable prices have recorded their largest annual rise since April last year. This reflects unfavourable weather conditions leading to a reduced supply of berries, bananas and vegetables, such as lettuce and broccoli. Annual inflation had been at 3.5% in March, but in April it rose to 3.6%. Michelle Marquardt, the head of ABS head of prices statistics, said it was the second month in a row where there had been a slight increase. (Economists had expected a slight decrease.) Marquardt said: CPI inflation is often impacted by items with volatile price changes like automotive fuel, fruit and vegetables, and holiday travel. It can be helpful to exclude these items from the headline CPI to provide a view of underlying inflation. When excluding these volatile items from the monthly CPI indicator, the annual rise to April was steady at 4.1%. Annual inflation excluding volatile items remains higher than for the monthly CPI indicator. The ABS has reported on the monthly inflation figures \u2013 inflation increased by 0.1% The monthly CPI indicator rose 3.6% in the 12 months to April. The most significant price rises were housing (up 4.9%), food and non-alcoholic beverages (3.8%), alcohol and tobacco (6.5%) and transport (4.2%). Norway parallels in house debate on Palestinian state Back to the parliament and revisiting this morning\u2019s issue of Palestinian recognition - in responding to the government\u2019s claim the attempt to suspend standing orders was a \u201cstunt\u201d - the Greens argue the motion would have sent an important signal and build momentum. The Greens point out that Norway\u2019s formal recognition of Palestine yesterday followed a parliamentary vote to that effect last November. In that case, the Norwegian parliament\u2019s motion was framed in a way that left it in the hands of the government. It asked the Norwegian government \u201cto be ready to recognise Palestine as an independent state when recognition could have a positive impact on the peace process, without making a final peace accord a condition\u201d. It was reported at the time that this motion was drafted by the ruling coalition to counteract a proposal by smaller parties to call for immediate recognition. The Greens\u2019 attempted motion today was definitive: \u201cThat this House [of Representatives] recognise the State of Palestine.\u201d The Greens argue that the government\u2019s stalling on the issue is contrary to the Labor party platform line that recognising Palestine would be \u201can important priority\u201d for a Labor government. WA Labor moves to tighten gun laws In Western Australia, the police minister, Paul Papalia, says the legislation before the WA parliament to change the state\u2019s gun laws will have immediate impacts: When that law becomes effective, we will remove 1,000 firearms licences from people who currently have them. We would take them off them. It is part of what we are doing. It would not have impacted [Mark Bombara] on Thursday because he had not at that point done anything to allow us to apply the law. But it would allow us to apply to [take guns from] around 100 [family and domestic violence] offenders. They still have their guns under the current laws. The gun laws passing through parliament right now will make the community safer. They will not necessarily stop every incident, will not necessarily have stopped that [Bombara\u2019s] incident, but we were not writing this law for Friday. This law began to be written two years ago. If you consider what has happened in just the last seven years since we have been in government \u2026 there have been, on average \u2013 this is on average \u2013 four people a year shot dead, murdered with a gun in WA over the last seven years. A number of those murders are committed by licensed firearms owners. Australian aid team lands in PNG after deadly landslide AAP has an update on the Australian disaster assistance team which has been sent to Papua New Guinea to help in the aftermath of the devastating landslide that may have killed up to 2,000 people in the country\u2019s remote north. An Australian disaster assistance team has landed in Papua New Guinea after a devastating landslide believed to have killed thousands. An RAAF Hercules plane transported the Australian team, which specialises in incident control and logistics, Pacific Minister Pat Conroy said. I\u2019m afraid to say we\u2019re mainly in the territory of retrieving bodies rather than saving people,\u201d he told Sky News on Wednesday. What we\u2019ve got is 160 buildings across a few villages are wiped out under a landslide that\u2019s buried them six to eight metres deep. The site is still very unstable with more landslides occurring.\u201d Around 8000 people have been displaced due to the landslide, Mr Conroy said, as he confirmed 750 large family shelters had been transported up to the province along with food, water and sanitation. We\u2019ve got 77 pallets going on RAAF aircraft that we\u2019ve transported from our emergency warehouse in Port Moresby up to Mount Hagen today as well,\u201d he said. So we are pouring huge resources into this to support what is a very grim situation.\u201d The WA police minister says he was not aware of everything which Ariel Bombara had raised in her statement yesterday: We had not heard some of the things in the statement. He [the police commissioner] has directed an investigation, which is the right thing to do. What we saw on Friday was a horrific double homicide and suicide. The immediate response of police and the focus [following that] was to make it safe, secure the crime scene and commence an investigation. They did that. What happened prior to the event and seven weeks in advance of the event will be subject to further inquiries now, an investigation, and that is right, the normal process. but in light of what the statement says, the commissioner has directed a specific investigation into contact between the police and Ariel Bombara and her mother, but we should wait and see what that finds. The WA police minister, Paul Papalia, is speaking to media about the review into the police response to Ariel Bombara\u2019s and her mother\u2019s warnings over Mark Bombara, ahead of a double murder in Perth last week. Papalia says: As I understand it, the police were approached by Ariel Bombara and her mother and what they reported did not meet the threshold for application of a police order. I have said, and as a consequence, as I said on Monday, the premier has asked the police commissioner and me to look at that. My personal view is there is a need to lower the threshold and move into the space of where there is an acrimonious breakup and there are known to be guns involved, move very quickly to remove those guns. We need to change the law because the current low is what dictates the process. That is what dictated what happened here and it is inadequate. I have acknowledged and why we have new laws but in this particular case, with respect to removal of firearms in an acrimonious breakup, I think we need to move earlier. I\u2019ve asked the police to provide us with a submission to potentially move amendments to the current going through the parliament, so while in the parliament we can amend it to specifically target that challenge. It will upset some people because we will be moving very early, at the very first contact potentially by someone in an acrimonious breakup where there are firearms involved \u2026that will remove any discretion or concern around subjectivity around the process from the police. Given the swift condemnation of the latest environmental protection bills the Labor government has introduced into the parliament, it\u2019s worth having a re-read of Adam Morton\u2019s recent column on what is happening in Australia at the moment when it comes to climate and environment. Labor\u2019s environment bill prompts fierce debate at hearing As the government introduces legislation to create Environment Protection Australia - a national EPA - there have been fiery exchanges in a Senate estimates committee over Labor repeatedly delaying the introduction of new environment laws. The Coalition\u2019s Jonno Duniam and the Greens\u2019 Sarah Hanson-Young criticised the government for failing to deliver on a commitment by the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, that new laws would be introduced last year. The overhaul of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act has since been delayed indefinitely, with no guarantee it will happen before the election. Officials told the environment estimates hearing the law reform that everyone involved - politicians, conservationists, business, scientists - agree is needed would happen \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Duniam quoted Plibersek at the National Press Club in July 2022, when she said the country couldn\u2019t \u201cwaste another minute\u201d in improving failing environmental laws. He said this was an admirable goal but the commitment had \u201cproven to be utterly worthless\u201d. Hanson-Young said \u201cas soon as possible\u201d was not a timeframe, and that the government had effectively \u201cdumped\u201d its commitment to rewrite the laws and re-branded part of the environment department as an EPA. Labor\u2019s Jenny McAllister, representing Plibersek, said environmental law reform had been broken into three stages. The first stage - including strengthening a water trigger applied to fossil fuel proposals - was introduced last year. The second stage - creating an EPA - was introduced today. McAllister said timing of the third stage - re-writing the laws - would depend on \u201csome level of agreement\u201d between business and environment organisations during ongoing consultation. Let\u2019s briefly analyse what happened in the House of Representatives this morning, from a procedural perspective. The vote was not directly about whether Australia, in principle, will recognise the state of Palestine (the Australian Labor government\u2019s position is that it is prepared to do so when it judges it will best contribute to peace and give momentum to a two-state solution; the government no longer views recognition of Palestinian statehood as something that can only be done at the very end of a peace process). The 80-5 vote was about whether to suspend standing orders, in other words interrupt the normal business of parliament, in order to debate the Greens\u2019 motion on the topic. The motion that the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, wanted to move was very tightly worded: \u201cThat this house recognise the State of Palestine.\u201d Apart from anything else, it\u2019s worth noting that it is normally the government of Australia that would be responsible for deciding on diplomatic relations with other countries, not something for one chamber of parliament to declare. Earlier this month, Australia voted in favour of a motion at the UN general assembly to extend observer rights to the Palestinian mission and in principle for it to be given full UN membership status (although this can only occur with the UN security council\u2019s approval, where it faces a US veto). The Australian government said one reason it took this step was because the UN general assembly resolution reaffirmed the international community\u2019s unwavering support for a two-state solution of Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security within recognised borders. But the Australian government does not appear to be in a rush to follow Ireland, Spain and Norway, which formally recognised Palestine yesterday, as it is holding out for further reforms of the Palestinian Authority (which exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and is dominated by Fatah, a rival to Hamas). Labor also says more immediate priorities are the release of hostages held in Gaza and achieving a ceasefire. Nonetheless, Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s declaration in January that he would not compromise on full Israeli security control west of the Jordan River has been a trigger for western countries including Australia to consider new approaches to try to kickstart momentum for a two-state solution. At the very end of his speech to the lower house this morning, assistant foreign minister Tim Watts had a message for two audiences. In addition to saying the Palestinian Authority must reform and show a commitment to peace, Watts warned that \u201cIsrael cannot continue to take unilateral actions to entrench the occupation and to prevent a viable Palestinian state\u201d. Home affairs department officials have revealed that 4,614 Palestinians have been denied visitor visas to Australia. David Shoebridge notes this is a significant increase on statistics in March, which officials explained is because they prioritised those with family in Australia, and the more recent applications being processed are therefore from those with no significant links to Australia. Shoebridge suggests people are seeking temporary refuge from an alleged genocide and are being denied it. Officials note requirements include that they must be satisfied the stay is genuinely temporary, which we reported in April is the main reason for these refusals. The Australia Palestine Advocacy Network president, Nasser Mashni, said at that time it \u201cbeggars belief\u201d that the Australian government was rejecting some visa applications \u201cwhile implying that it believes people won\u2019t leave Australia because of how unbearably oppressive and dangerous the Israeli government has made life for Palestinians\u201d. Murray Watt said the government was obliged to do health and security checks and apply the usual probity around them being genuinely temporary visitors. Shoebridge said visitors shouldn\u2019t have to \u201cfalsely assert they are a tourist\u201d to seek refuge in Australia, calling for a \u201cgenuine humanitarian visa option for Palestinians fleeing the genocide in Gaza\u201d. He called for the same deal for Gazans as Ukrainians. Correction: a previous version of this post said 14,614 visas had been rejected. There was a typo which added an additional digit. It is 4,614 visas. We apologise for the confusion. Community groups pan Labor\u2019s environment bill Community groups, including Lock the Gate, 350.org and the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, are also less than impressed with the government\u2019s new environmental protection bills. A joint statement said the new EPA would \u201cdo nothing to prevent coal and gas expansions and is a cynical distraction from Labor\u2019s reneging on a promised overhaul of Australia\u2019s John Howard-era environment laws\u201d. The groups don\u2019t like what they describe as the EPA\u2019s limited powers, lack of influence over decision making and what they call \u201cworrying provisions\u201d where project proponents could prevent the government \u201cstopping the clock\u201d on decisions even when not enough information has been provided. Australian Youth Climate Coalition spokesperson Grace Vegesana said Most of our members weren\u2019t even born when Australia\u2019s current environment laws were drafted. Ironically, it\u2019s our generation that is going to have to clean up the mess that the fossil fuel-driven climate crisis already has in store for us. This EPA bill is yet another distraction the Albanese government is using to delay real action on climate change. For those who missed it yesterday, this is what Penny Wong had to say in estimates about the Israeli assault on the Rafah refugee tent camp: And right on cue \u2013 the Climate Council has responded to Tanya Plibersek\u2019s new legislation \u2013 and it is not a fan either. The council\u2019s head of policy and advocacy, Dr Jennifer Rayner, said: Establishing the new Environment Protection Agency without fixing our broken national environment law is like planting seeds in barren soil \u2013 a waste of time. The EPA will be administering the same broken law that has waved through at least 740 fossil fuel projects to date; the same law that has overseen the clearing of millions of hectares of precious habitat. If our national environment law isn\u2019t fixed, we\u2019ll just see the same bad decisions announced on a different letterhead. Rayner said Plibersek\u2019s announcement of \u201cyet more consultation\u201d means the reform is \u201ctreading water\u201d. To make consultation constructive and meaningful, the government needs to be clear about where it is heading - will they finally put climate in this law? NSW and Queensland are showing how it\u2019s done by putting climate pollution front and centre in their project assessments, and making companies explain how they\u2019re dealing with their harmful climate pollution. The Albanese government can and must do this too. To protect our environment and a safe future for our kids, we need a stronger national environment law \u2013 not a better rubber stamp for more coal and gas. Here is the official statement on the legislation Tanya Plibersek has just introduced in the house which will establish an environment protection agency: Delivering on our election commitment, Environment Protection Australia will be a tough cop on the beat. It will be able to issue stop-work orders to prevent serious environmental damage and proactively audit business to ensure they\u2019re doing the right thing. The Nature Positive (Environment Protection Australia) Bill 2024 is the heart of the second stage of our Nature Positive plan \u2013 delivering reforms that benefit both nature and business. Environment and water minister Tanya Plibersek will ask the new EPA to examine illegal land clearing and offset conditions as a priority, after a recent audit found one in seven developments could be in breach of their offset conditions. Penalties will be increased to align maximum fines with punishments for serious financial offences. Courts would also be able to impose fines of up to $780 million or send people to prison for up to seven years for extremely serious intentional breaches of federal environment law. Getting this through the parliament is not going to be smooth. The Coalition are not fans, and the Greens don\u2019t think it goes far enough, meaning negotiations are going to be a little tense when it comes to the Senate. And as always, the Senate is where all the action is on bills like this. The Greens have already signalled they will be getting very serious about things like the gas strategy when it comes to talking to the government about legislation, as the party sees it all as one big package \u2013 meaning the Greens believe the government can not seperate environmental protection measures from support for fossil fuel projects. Incoming GG to meet King Charles at Buckingham Palace today Incoming governor general Sam Mostyn is meeting King Charles today in London, the GG\u2019s office has told Senate estimates. Liberal senator Dean Smith is asking the GG\u2019s official secretary, Paul Singer, about the governor general-designate. Mostyn, the respected business leader and gender equality advocate, will begin in the role on 1 July. Singer said Mostyn was meeting Charles at Buckingham Palace today, and that outgoing GG David Hurley would meet the King in July after he leaves office. Smith joked that Mostyn should discuss the official photo of King Charles in their meeting. Singer said \u201cplanning continues for a possible royal visit\u201d later this year, but could not reveal any specific details and referred more questions to the prime minister\u2019s department. He said issues around Charles\u2019 health were a factor in planning and there should be no \u201cexpectations\u201d placed on any forthcoming visit. Singer praised the David Hurley as providing a \u201ccalm, reassuring and compassionate presence\u201d over his five years as governor general. Hurley has conducted more than 3,600 official engagement, delivered 762 speeches and welcomed 133,000 visitors to Government House and Admiralty House. Singer said Hurley had also experienced \u201ccountless quiet moments with Australians in time of need\u201d, noting his visits to communities such as Kangaroo Island and Lismore after natural disasters. That discussion went a little bit further there: Paterson: Process broke down in 2023 was due to a policy change in 2014. Why for many years was it able to notify in usual way, but in 2023 it broke down? Foster: That was not my evidence. My evidence was about the pressures that were in that area and it was not specific to this particular process. It was a team that had been under significant pressure for a long time, because it had been operating with a budget not suited to functions it needed to fulfil. Home affairs chief suggests Coalition policy shift strained department Shadow home affairs minister James Paterson has asked how the home affairs department prioritised its resources after departmental secretary Stephanie Foster explained that when she joined the department in 2022, it didn\u2019t have enough money to fulfil what was being asked of it. Foster says when she joined the department in late 2022, she found there was \u201ca quite significant mismatch between allocated budgets, people actually working in the areas and the overall budget that we had to work within\u201d. Paterson presses her to explain what was more important than notifying the minister of cases of people whose visas were about to be cancelled by the AAT. Foster then suggests a policy change of the then Coalition government was what put the department under so much strain. One of the issues which put this team under significant pressure was the policy change in 2014 towards mandatory cancellations, which I understand was done at the time. Paterson doesn\u2019t like this response. What, nine years prior is the cause of this problem in 2023? Surely not, secretary? Foster asks him to please let her finish, and says: The pressure that this area was under in a resource sense actually stemmed from that time when that policy change was made, as I understand it, without additional resources allocated either at a government or a departmental level. Paterson is not satisfied with her answer and says the department had managed to prioritise cases for eight years and asks what changed in 2023 to prompt the new protocol about triaging cases to the minister. But committee chair and Labor senator Nita Green pulls him up. She\u2019s been trying to tell him his time is up but he asked another question, so he gets a reprimand. Do not speak over me today,\u201d Green says. And she says his allocated time is up for now, and begins asking her own questions. Labor\u2019s Murray Watt, representing the immigration and home affairs minister, has confirmed the government is considering amending ministerial direction 99 on visa cancellation. Watt told Senate estimates that cases where non-citizens with serious criminal convictions got their visas back were \u201cnot in line with the government\u2019s intention\u201d. Watt noted the government was advised it \u201cwould be unlikely that this change to the direction would result in people committing serious offences being able to have their visa cancellation overturned\u201d. That\u2019s what has happened \u2013 it\u2019s not in line with government policy, and not in line with community expectations either. The shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, grilled him about whether the government would amend direction 99. Watt said he was confident that ministers \u201care giving it active consideration\u201d. I\u2019m confident ministers will be considering these issues now that they\u2019ve come to light. I know they\u2019ve been considering it over the last couple of days, now that they know what the situation is. Australia still waiting for official portrait of King Charles Alas, it seems the Palace hasn\u2019t issued the official portrait of the regent, so no one has received their free King Charles portrait as yet. Australia is still waiting for an official portrait of King Charles, Senate estimates has heard, further delaying a little-known federal program which distributes free photos of the monarch to interested citizens. The governor general\u2019s office is before the finance and public administration committee this morning. Straight off the top, LNP senator James McGrath asked the GG\u2019s official secretary, Paul Singer, about whether Australia has yet received its official portrait of King Charles. Earlier this year we reported that the photo hadn\u2019t yet come through. There had been an interim portrait provided, which could be used at public events as needed, but the government was still waiting for the official one to arrive. Constituents can request \u201capproved official portraits\u201d of the monarch, which they can get from their local MP \u2013 but the absence of the official photo means that program has been backed up. McGrath, the Queensland senator, said he was \u201cgetting a number of requests for the portrait\u201d from his constituents. Singer said there had been engagements with Buckingham Palace \u201cin very recent times\u201d about getting the new Charles photo taken. It\u2019s unclear why the process has taken so long. Its been pressed upon the palace the importance of the nationhood material program and the interest of having a photo of his and her majesty being available to the public for that purpose. Singer believed the photos would be scheduled \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, expecting it to be \u201cimminent\u201d. The vote went as predicted \u2013 80 noes to five ayes. Andrew Wilkie voted with the Greens. The chamber has moved on to Tanya Plibersek introducing the nature positive legislation, which will set up an environmental protection agency. Bob Katter wants to have his say. But under the standing orders, the time for the suspension of standing order debate is up and the division must be held. The chamber divides. \u2018This motion runs contrary to the traditions of Australian foreign policy\u2019 \u2013 Leeser Liberal MP Julian Leeser says the Coalition is also against the motion and launches into the Greens: The member for Melbourne\u2019s motion undermines the work of peacemakers on the ground and rewards those who choose violence over negotiation. The motion comes at a time that sends a message that Hamas violent terrorist attacks, it\u2019s murderers, it\u2019s abductions, it\u2019s gang rapes, it\u2019s dismemberment of innocent children, it\u2019s torture of people should somehow be rewarded. This motion means recognising a Palestinian state and Palestinian leaders continue to refuse the right to recognise Israel\u2019s right to exist. This motion means recognising a Palestinian state when Hamas still has not released 130 Israeli hostages. This motion runs contrary to the traditions of Australian foreign policy. Australia just simply doesn\u2019t recognise countries that have yet to come into existence. In some respects, this Greens motion shouldn\u2019t amaze me, but it does \u2013 why is a party that spends so much time talking about the rights of women and LGBTI people so keen to advocate for the cause of organisations like Hamas which are among the greatest abusers of women and LGBTI people in the world? But the Greens are content to ignore these inconvenient facts. Paterson grills home affairs over direction 99 Heading into a Senate estimates committee room now, and the home affairs secretary, Stephanie Foster, is back in the hot seat in the legal and constitutional affairs estimates committee this morning and they\u2019ve gone straight to questions. Shadow home affairs minister James Paterson inquires whether any answers have been produced overnight to the questions he lodged yesterday. But Foster says no, not yet. Paterson is continuing with questions about immigration minister Andrew Giles\u2019 direction 99, which is the direction that people challenging the cancellation of their visas can have their extent of their ties to Australia considered. Paterson asks about the departmental protocol introduced early last year that the minister be notified of priority cases. The departmental officer, Jacob McMahon, has clarified that it wasn\u2019t a formal protocol but a proposal the department put to the minister. It was our way of trying to manage the backlog,\u201d he says. Paterson presses him on whether the minister asked for the triaging process to be set up because he was being swamped. McMahon says the department is always looking for ways to be more efficient. Paterson asks: I don\u2019t want a hypothetical of what it could\u2019ve been. What was it? And we\u2019re off. The vote will be held, but the government will not support the motion, and so it will fail. Labor sees \u2018no role\u2019 for Hamas in a Palestinian state \u2013 Watts Tim Watts goes through the official government position on recognition of the Palestinian state: On the question of recognition, we have made clear that we will be guided by whether recognition will advance the cause for peace. Like many countries, Australia has been frustrated by the lack of progress in this regard. Like Germany and the UK, staunch friends of Israel, Australia no longer sees recognition as only occurring at the end of the process, it could occur as part of a peace process. And only once there\u2019s progress on serious governance reforms and security concerns. Hamas is a terrorist organisation. We see no role for them in this. A Palestinian state cannot be in a position to threaten Israel\u2019s security. We want to see a reformed Palestinian governing authority that is committed to peace, that disavows violence and is ready to engage in a meaningful peace process. We want to see a commitment to peace and how the Palestinian Authority leads its people. The final status of core issues such as Jerusalem, and the borders of a future Palestinian state, should be defined through direct negotiations. The assistant minister for foreign affairs, Tim Watts, is officially announcing that the government will not be supporting the motion to suspend standing orders. The member for Melbourne knows pretty well that he is not moving the motion today to recognise Palestine, he is moving a procedural question about dealing with the parliaments agenda. The member from Melbourne knows full well that procedural motions like this are always opposed. Why? Why would he be deliberately setting up a vote on Palestinian recognition to fail? It\u2019s something that only he can answer. The Greens party had an opportunity to select this motion for debate and an allocated time on Monday, but they chose not to. The reason, only the Greens leader could explain. The prime minister and Penny Wong has made clear statements in the last month about the government\u2019s approach to Palestinian recognition. This is the same approach that the Greens are trying to exploit the war of votes. Simplistic, wedge motions in the house do nothing to advance the cause of peace. Wedge politics only divides the community. We gain nothing from the Greens seeking to reproduce this conflict in our own community. Palestinians have endured \u2018displacement and suffering for far too long\u2019 \u2013 Bandt Adam Bandt is continuing his plea for the house to support his motion to suspend standing orders to debate his motion for the house to recognise Palestine. What this motion is about is about recognition and recognition only. And this isn\u2019t just a political question, it is a deeply moral question as well. Because the people of Palestine have endured displacement and suffering for far too long. This motion is about saying the values that we hold dear, the right to live in freedom and exercise self-determination, and to wake up every day thinking about how am I going to make my life better, rather than how am I going to avoid another bomb that is going to fall on me \u2013 those simple values about wanting to live in peace and security. This is about saying those values should be enjoyed equally by everyone around the world. Those values of peace and security and self-determination should be enjoyed equally by Palestinians and Israelis alike. And this is about saying, as a matter of morality, we will not stand by as others rights to self-determination and to live in peace and security and freedom destroyed. Bandt says \u201chand-wringing tweets\u201d from the Labor government are no longer good enough. His colleague Max Chandler-Mather is seconding the motion. Bob Katter can be herd interjecting once again. The government will not support this, on the ground it does not (unless there is prior agreement) support motions to change up the business of the day. Greens leader Adam Bandt has taken the floor after the prayers and acknowledgements to move to suspend standing orders to debate his motion that the house recognise the state of Palestine. \u201cThis is not just a symbolic move,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a critical step towards peace and towards ending the slaughter that we are seeing with the invasion of Gaza right now. It is a concrete step towards peace and as the prime minister of Norway said last week, there cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition. It is critical that we debate this now, just as other countries have interrupted what they were doing to recognise Palestine now because of the scale \u2026 and the genocide that we are witnessing is now topping 36,000 people, or 36,000 civilians, who have been slaughtered. A health system has been destroyed. There are mass graves in hospitals. Aid has been blocked. Children are now dying because they did not have enough to eat or drink. We are seeing right now a human engineered famine that is taking a toll on a civilian population that amounts to collective punishment of these people. And it is time for countries including Australia to step in and do something and just as other countries have made it a priority to recognise the state of Palestine. So should this government today, right now, by backing this motion now. Bob Katter can be heard shouting something at Adam Bandt and is told to stop interjecting by speaker Milton Dick. The bells have rung and the House of Representatives sitting is about to begin (the Senate isn\u2019t sitting this fortnight, and instead is holding budget estimates hearings). First up in government business \u2013 the \u201cnature positive\u201d legislation Tanya Plibersek has announced. Australia Institute calls for fast fashion tax and garment levy hike The government should implement a fast fashion tax and increase the proposed garment levy from 4c to 50c, the Australia Institute says. Nina Gbor, the circular economy and waste program director at the Australia Institute, said new research showed Australia had surpassed the US as the world\u2019s biggest consumer of textiles per capita. Australians buy an average of 56 new clothing items a year, more than the US (53), UK (33 items) and China (30). According to the report, Australians are also buying the cheapest, spending on average $13, compared to $40 in the UK, $24 in the US and $30 in Japan. Gbor: Australians are the world\u2019s biggest consumer of clothes, shoes and bags per capita. We\u2019re addicted to stuff that is harming our health and the environment. We need to drastically reduce waste at the source by penalising brands for mass-producing incredibly cheap and poor-quality clothing that is often worn just a handful of times or never sells and goes straight to the tip. The Seamless scheme, run by the Australian Fashion Council (AFC), has proposed a levy of 4c on signatory retailers, with big brands such as Big W, Cotton On Group, the Iconic and David Jones already signing up. The AFC has said the money will go to sustainability projects, with the levy starting between 2024-25. It has federal government backing. Gbor said it needed to be 50c for it to be meaningful change. She also called for a French-style tax on fast-fashion garments, and a ban on fast-fashion advertising. The French government is set to bring in a new tax that will trace the eco-footprint of a garment and tax companies if it is rated poorly. Gbor: We\u2019re walking around in plastic clothes made from petroleum. Many of these items end up in landfill or are dumped in countries in the global south, where they fill up their landfills, pollute beaches and oceans and contribute to more emissions. Shein and Temu are expected to make more than $2 billion in sales this year combined. The federal government could redirect some of their profits to cut clothing waste and fund a domestic recycling and a circular textiles industry. Greens push for Palestinian state recognition in parliament The House of Representatives will sit from 9am and as we reported yesterday, the Greens will be moving a motion that \u201cthis House recognise the state of Palestine\u201d. As Daniel Hurst reported yesterday, Greens leader Adam Bandt wants Labor to make good on \u201can election promise to support Palestinian statehood\u201d. (Quick analysis: The party platform certainly called on Labor in government \u201cto recognise Palestine as a state\u201d and said this should be \u201can important priority\u201d - but it did give cabinet ministers a level of flexibility because it did not set an actual deadline for that step to be taken.) Bandt said the Labor government should go beyond \u201chand-wringing statements\u201d and take meaningful steps: Recognition alone won\u2019t stop the invasion or end the occupation, but it will be a big step towards ensuring that Palestinians have the same rights as Israelis to live in peace and security with full rights under international law. The government has already jumped ahead on this one, with a spokesperson saying Bandt is actually moving a procedural motion \u201cabout not dealing with the Parliament\u2019s agenda\u201d. (That is standard \u2013 in order to move a motion in the parliament, you must first move a motion to suspend standing orders to change the house agenda (which is set by the government) so this is a bit of a technicality the government is arguing on here). But procedural motions to switch up the agenda are always opposed by the government (unless agreed upon in advance), so the government will be saying no to the Greens motion. Although it says it is saying no to changing up the agenda, not the substantial motion the Greens have telegraphed. A government spokesperson said: The foreign minister Penny Wong has made clear statements in the last month about the government\u2019s approach to Palestinian recognition. OK, well that has been quite the morning! The Senate estimates hearings are about to get under way and on today\u2019s agenda is: Environment and communications committee \u2013 where it is all about the environment department today (expect the nature repair market bill to feature in this, as well as the Environmental Protection Authority legislation Tanya Plibersek has announced this morning) Finance and Public Administration committee \u2013 the prime minister and cabinet department is under the microscope here, and it will essentially be Penny Wong v Simon Birmingham in a committee room, rather than the Senate. Legal and constitutional affairs committee \u2013 that will be a continuation of home affairs and immigration and direction 99 and the response to the high court decision which made indefinite detention illegal. Rural and regional affairs and transport committee \u2013 planes, trains and automobiles. Q: But are you not concerned that Palestinians are living in a war zone at the moment, that many of them are fleeing for their lives? James Paterson: Absolutely. There are no doubt genuine, innocent people in Gaza, who want to flee, and Australia has a role to play. But we have to do it carefully, by protecting our own national interests and our own national security. The safety of the Australian people must come first. And we must do adequate checks. We know adequate checks weren\u2019t done because, after many of these visas were granted, they were subsequently cancelled. So why would you cancel a visa that you initially granted if all the adequate checks were done in the first place? It\u2019s very clear this was a rushed process and as a result things were missed and visas had to be subsequently cancelled. Australia\u2019s security agencies are involved in background checks when these visas are approved and more is often known about Palestinians than people in similar situations (such as when Ukrainians applied in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of their country) because of the occupation. Previously, when the visa cancellation issue was examined, it was for a range of reasons, including concerns they would not stay in Australia \u201ctemporarily\u201d, not that security checks were not carried out. The interview moves on: Q: Senator Paterson, we also heard in a Senate estimates last night that a fifth of almost 10,000 Palestinians who have sought a temporary Australian visa since October 7 have had their applications rejected. So that\u2019s just over 2,300 approved. At the same time, more than 3,300 visas have been approved for Israelis. Is there an imbalance here? James Paterson: I am concerned that 2,300 visas have been granted to Palestinian document holders in a very quick period of time after 7 October. Let\u2019s remember that this is a war zone controlled by a terrorist organisation and on average these visas were granted in 24 hours. In some instances, they were granted in as little as a few hours. I don\u2019t know how you can do an adequate identity check, let alone a proper background check, on people like that. We have a serious enough problem with antisemitism in this country, with social cohesion, before we go in bringing people with attitudes that are problematic. I\u2019m very concerned the department and the government has rushed this process unnecessarily. On the departmental secretary Stephanie Foster taking responsibility for the department not raising the issue with minister Andrew Giles, James Paterson says: It\u2019s very hard to understand how this happened, and the department had no good answers about how this occurred. I\u2019ll be re-prosecuting that issue with them today. Frankly, the minister and the minister\u2019s office should have noticed they were no longer being notified about these cases. It\u2019s utterly routine to be notified about this. If all of a sudden you stopped being notified, wouldn\u2019t you ask questions? What happened to the referrals? What happened to the notifications? Something a minister for immigration does on a daily basis, if not weekly basis. When it didn\u2019t happen, it appears Andrew Giles asked no questions at all. James Paterson said a future Coalition government would scrap the direction entirely: [Former NZ prime minister] Jacinda Ardern lobbied Anthony Albanese and he gave in. Instead of standing up for Australia, instead of protecting Australia, he gave in to Jacinda Ardern. My view is, if you are a guest in our country, if you are a non-citizen, regardless of how long you have been here, if you commit a serious, horrific crime, you have broken all the principles of your stay in this country and you should be deported \u2013 no ifs, no buts. I don\u2019t care if you came here when you were five. In some cases, these are people who came to Australia in their late teens, in their 20s, and even their 30s. So the idea these people should not be deported from our country I think is completely wrong. And a future Liberal government, if we\u2019re elected at the next election, will begin deporting these dangerous criminals again. The direction was brought in because of issues with deporting people who had been born in New Zealand but had spent almost their entire lives in Australia. At the time, Anthony Albanese said it was a \u201ccommon sense\u201d change, which meant that tribunals needed to consider someone\u2019s ties to Australia (along with other things, including community protection). But the direction was meant to address the issue of New Zealand-born but Australia-raised people who had not applied for citizenship being deported to a country where they had no links (it was a diplomatic bugbear between Australia and New Zealand under the Coalition government). Asked if the tribunals were to blame, given how they are interpreting the direction, James Paterson said: If it was just one rogue tribunal member or one decision, maybe you could blame the AAT. But now we have dozens \u2013 in fact, more than 30 cases that the media has uncovered \u2013 of serious violent criminals who have been allowed to stay in our country. And what those decisions have in common is they all point to this ministerial direction and the new primary consideration that Andrew Giles inserted into that direction, that considerable weight should be given to a person\u2019s ties to Australia regardless of their level of offending if they have been here for a long time. And so, really, the only person who can take responsibility for this is ultimately Andrew Giles, and if he refuses to do so, then the prime minister should do so. We think Andrew Giles should be sacked and we think Direction 99 should be immediately repealed and replaced with the previous direction to the department and the AAT, which required other factors to be weighted much more highly than someone\u2019s ties to Australia. James Paterson fires at Giles over directive 99 Shadow home affairs minister James Paterson spoke to ABC News Breakfast where he was making the opposite argument to Clare O\u2019Neil about the review into directive 99 and some of the visas in question: Well, it\u2019s the logical thing to do but, frankly, is too little too late. It was over a year ago now - in January 2023 - that the minister issued a new ministerial direction, which had the effect of requiring decision-makers, including the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, to put greater weight on someone\u2019s ties to Australia. And the result of that, as the department warned him at the time, is that fewer people who committed serious crimes who are non-citizens would be deported. And we\u2019ve seen that in the most horrific detail over the last few days, including a new case uncovered this morning by The Australian newspaper of a man who offended, in terms of rapes and sexual assaults against 26 women and girls, who came from Scotland, who is not an Australian citizen, who has been allowed to just stay in our country as a result of this direction. The directive does ask that ties to Australia be considered, along with four other \u201cprimary considerations\u201d, including protecting the community and \u201cwhether the conduct engaged in constituted family violence\u201d. Clare O\u2019Neil continued: what minister Giles did was create a new ministerial direction how cancellation decisions should be considered. \u2026 What he did not do is reduce the importance of community safety in that direction. As I said to you, there are decisions that are made by this independent tribunal that I find very disconcerting and that I do not think meet community expectations, or at least [don\u2019t] at face value. Minister Giles now has the opportunity to review some of those decisions. As I understand it, some of those visas has been cancelled as a result of him stepping in and recalling those decisions. There is a lot of commentary around how much longer Andrew Giles will remain in his position as immigration minister. It started with the high court decision to end indefinite detention and claims Giles and the immigration department did not act quickly enough or anticipate the court\u2019s ruling, and subsequent release of people, under the decision. The latest issues around the ministerial directive 99, which has been cited in some AAT tribunal decisions to reinstate visas cancelled by Giles, despite some having committed serious crimes, has elevated the ministry reshuffle chatter. Home affairs minister Clare O\u2019Neil defended Giles on the Seven network this morning that the government was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by some of the tribunal\u2019s decisions to reinstate some visas: It does appear that the decisions made by this independent tribunal are not meeting community expectations and not putting proper stead on the importance that we place on community safety. So actually minister Giles has stepped in here. He\u2019s taking action as a good minister would do. He\u2019s demanded answers from the department about why these visas were not bought to his attention. He\u2019s actively reviewing about 30 cases that we\u2019re concerned about indeed he\u2019s already cancelled some of those visas. So he\u2019s doing the right thing. He stepped in at the right moment. It\u2019s important that this action is taken. Peter Malinauskus continued: We\u2019ve been having migration in this country for a long period of time, and we haven\u2019t seen thoughtful policy effort applied to how we extend our housing stock, how we get more green fields, pastures and lands online, how we get the trunk infrastructure that is required. I mean, let\u2019s be clear about this. I mean, Stefanovic, Albo, Malinauskas, these aren\u2019t names that came out on the First Fleet. Migration is part of who we are as a country. And I\u2019m saying rather than focusing on a debate that is driven by politics, let\u2019s have a considered discussion, particularly when it comes to the housing crisis, which I think is the main concern on people\u2019s minds at the moment. Dial down migration debate, SA premier says Peter Malinauskas wants the temperature turned down over the political migration \u201cdebate\u201d. The South Australian premier told the Nine network breakfast program that politics shouldn\u2019t decide migration levels \u2013 need should. We believe that the commonwealth, whoever\u2019s in charge, Liberal or Labor, has the right and should be able to control levels of migration. I\u2019m just simply arguing that we shouldn\u2019t have a politically driven debate around migration in levels at the very same time that we necessarily know as a country we need more skilled migrants, particularly given the size of the challenge we\u2019ve got before us in undertaking the Aukus program, which is a truly national endeavour. It is the single biggest industrial undertaking in the history of our federation, so we\u2019re just going to make sure we think it through very carefully. But but more than that, I mean, one of the reasons why I think we\u2019re having a debate around migration in our country at the moment is because we\u2019ve got a housing supply crisis. And my assertion is that if we have a housing supply crisis, well, let\u2019s focus on building more homes rather than having, you know, what can be an insidious debate around migration numbers. Overnight a podcast interview that former US president and current Republican nominee Donald Trump did with Tim Pool was released \u2013 and its an answer he gave about whether or not he would pardon Wikileaks founder Julian Assange which has created a few headlines. Trump said: Well, I\u2019m going to talk about that today [at a later speech], and we\u2019re gonna give it very serious consideration. And we\u2019re gonna have a couple of other things to say in this speech that I think you\u2019re gonna love. (It does not seem he did speak about Assange in his later speech, though.) Current US president Joe Biden had previously been asked much the same thing last month and said he was also \u201cconsidering\u201d it. Amanda Rishworth was also asked about the Pope apologising over reports he used a homophobic slur. Rishworth said: Well, firstly, I would say that, you know, we should call out homophobic behaviour, homophobic slurs. I am pleased to see that there\u2019s been an apology \u2013 that\u2019s an important part of it. But my message to the LGBTQI+ community is that you are supported here in Australia, you do not deserve to be discriminate or vilified, and we back you, and back your right to live and love whoever you want. Family violence must be \u2018front of mind\u2019 in visa decisions \u2013 Rishworth The interview moves on to ministerial direction 99, which has been used by the administrative appeals tribunal in making visa reinstatement decisions. As Paul Karp reported earlier this morning, home affairs departmental secretary Stephanie Foster took responsibility for immigration minister Andrew Giles not being made aware of the AAT\u2019s decisions so he could consider re-cancelling visas. The directive asks the strength, nature and duration of ties someone has to Australia are considered in visa decisions, alongside four other \u201cprimary considerations\u201d including protecting the community and \u201cwhether the conduct engaged in constituted family violence\u201d. The directive is now under review, after a number of people found guilty of serious crimes had their visa reinstated by independent tribunals with directive 99 cited as one of the reasons. Amanda Rishworth is asked about the directive and says: Well, let\u2019s be clear \u2013 the ministerial direction says that family, domestic and sexual violence needs to be absolutely front of mind when the AAT is making these independent decisions. I am always shocked by incidents of domestic, family and sexual violence, and people that perpetrate that need to face the full force of the law, which, indeed, I understand a number of these people have. But in terms of the elevation of family and domestic violence, it\u2019s my understanding that that has been elevated, as well as other serious offences that must be taken into account when these decisions are being made. And minister Giles has asked for a review to ensure that that is the case. Asked about Ariel Bombara\u2019s point that she was another woman and victim survivor apologising for the actions of a man and that it should be on governments to act, Amanda Rishworth said: She\u2019s absolutely right that victim-survivors should not shoulder the blame, and this was a very clear messages that victim-survivors sent. That the responsibility actually sits with the perpetrators, with the men that perpetrate violence. And governments - across both state and commonwealth - have an important role to play in making sure that, firstly, that we make it clear that violence against women is not OK, make sure that the programs and the support is available, but our systems are responding. Whether it is our police systems, whether it\u2019s our justice systems. We all have a role to play across society, across the community. So, it shouldn\u2019t shoulder on victim-survivors to have to raise this response. The focus does have to be on those perpetrating violence and making sure that the programs and the systems and the investment that government make are there to support women, but importantly hold perpetrators - well, first, prevent perpetration and then hold perpetrators to account. Amanda Rishworth was asked about the statement on ABC News Breakfast and said: What Ms Bombara expressed was incredibly powerful, as you said. I think it requires an enormous bravery, particularly at a time when she would be grieving, to speak up and make these comments. And, you know, her urge for action is also very powerful. I think she has highlighted a number of areas where she didn\u2019t get the response she needed from police, and so it is very right that the Western Australian police commissioner is investigating this, to look at where it went wrong. WA shooter\u2019s daughter says police \u2018ignored\u2019 warnings Social services minister Amanda Rishworth has been asked about the powerful statement Ariel Bombara released yesterday, claiming Western Australian police had \u201cignored\u201d warnings from her and her mother that their lives were under threat. Ariel said she spoke with WA police on three different occasions about her concerns over her father, Mark Bombara, ahead of his murder of Jenny and Gretl Petelczyc on Friday. \u201cWe were ignored by five different male officers across three occasions of reporting,\u201d Ariel said in her statement. By that point we felt completely helpless and I had to focus on getting mum to safety. I did everything I could to protect my mother, and when my father couldn\u2019t find us he murdered her best friend and her best friend\u2019s daughter. WA police have launched an investigation into the response. Affordable rental properties disappearing Surging rents over the past year have seen the number of affordable rentals vanishing across the country, with the share of capital city rentals under $400 dropping by half in a single year, according to a new PropTrack Market Insight Report . The report found that the national share of rental properties listed on realestate.com.au for less than $400 per week has plummeted to a record low of just 10.4%, which is a third lower than April 2023 levels. Key findings: Rents have surged in Australia\u2019s capital cities, with only 5.9% of city overall rentals now costing less than $400 a week. At the start of the pandemic, one in five house rentals in Sydney cost less than $400 a week \u2013 that figure is now one in 50. In Melbourne, one in 25 house rentals now costs less than $400. The national share of rentals available under $400 dropped by one third annually to just 10.4%. ACT had the smallest share of properties listed to rent under $400 at 2.1%, followed by Sydney (3.8%) and Perth (5.6%). Melbourne saw the largest annual decline in the share of houses listed for less than $400 a week, followed by Adelaide and Sydney. In regional markets, only 16.3% per cent of houses were advertised for under $400 a week in April. Regional WA (14.8%) had the smallest portion of homes listed to rent below $400 of the regions, followed by regional Queensland (15.8%) and regional NSW (21.5%). Labor may target offenders\u2019 visa restorations The home affairs department has given the government \u201coptions\u201d to reform a ministerial direction that has resulted in some serious offenders having their visas restored by an independent tribunal. Evidence from home affairs officials to Senate estimates on Tuesday evening is the first indication the government is preparing to reform the controversial direction that appears to have resulted in dozens of visa restorations for non-citizens with serious criminal convictions. On Tuesday the home affairs department secretary, Stephanie Foster, took responsibility and expressed \u201cregret\u201d for a failure to inform the immigration minister, Andrew Giles, of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal decisions, to allow him to consider re-cancelling their visas. Labor\u2019s Murray Watt, representing the immigration minister, told Senate estimates that AAT members were \u201cinterpreting this direction in a way that no minister in this government intended\u201d. Asked if the government had sought advice on revoking or amending the direction Emma Cassar, the associate secretary for immigration, told Senate estimates \u201cwe have given some advice on options for ministerial direction 99\u201d. Cassar said the options were \u201coperational in nature\u201d, and took the question on notice. Changes could include \u201cpolicy and potentially legal changes to it\u201d, she said. Bogged Snowy 2.0 machine faces another rescue delay Experts have been working for almost two weeks to free Florence, a tunnel-boring machine wedged deep underground at Snowy 2.0, the project\u2019s boss says (and Australian Associated Press reports). Bogged a year ago, and the survivor of a surprise sinkhole, the latest partial collapse of a tunnel at a so-called pinch point prompted concerns at a late-night Senate estimates session about another delay. The cost of the nation-building project may have doubled in the past six years to $12bn but its value has also increased in a changing electricity market, Snowy Hydro chief executive Dennis Barnes told the environment committee on Tuesday. Barnes said the project\u2019s completion was critical. The role of Snowy 2.0 in the market is to facilitate the delivery of the lowest-cost form of energy ... solar and wind. Defending the machine nicknamed Flo, Barnes said the rock had proved to be too soft and too hard over the years, which was not unusual for a mega project with geological risk. Flo recently encountered very hard and abrasive rock that, when coupled with a curve in the tunnel, halted operations as the rock pinched the machine shield. Very high-pressure water jets are being used to remove the rocks before restarting Flo can be considered, he said. According to an updated business case, the targeted total cost of Snowy 2.0 remains $12 billion, with commercial operation of all units expected by December 2028. \u201cSome people would say we could do nuclear for the same price,\u201d Nationals senator Perin Davey told the committee as the coalition puts the finishing touches on its nuclear energy plans. Snowy 2.0 is now 57% complete and our workforce of 3000 is achieving good progress across the many construction fronts. Tunnelling across the project was 30% complete. Hello and welcome to the second house sitting and estimates hearing day of the latest parliament session. A very big thank you, as always, to Martin for starting us off and getting us all up to date this morning. You have Amy Remeikis with you to help take you through the parliamentary day. It\u2019s looking set to be another big one, so I hope you have grabbed your coffee(s). (We are on number three over here.) I hope it is at least warmer where you are. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it. Yesterday\u2019s weak retail turnover weakened the case for another Reserve Bank rate hike and today\u2019s inflation figures will give another clue. The inflation rate is forecast to fall from 3.5% in March to 3.4% in April \u2013 probably not enough to convince the RBA to start cutting the cost of borrowing. The retail sales figures for April yesterday underscored what most of us knew already: inflation and higher mortgage repayments are forcing households to skimp where we can. Last month, retail turnover eked out a 0.1% increase but not enough to erase the 0.4% decline in March, the Australian Bureau of Statistics says. According to Moody\u2019s Analytics, retail sales have been stagnant since December. From a year earlier, turnover was 1.3% higher. However, inflation was running at an annual pace of about 3.5%, so it\u2019s firmly negative in real terms. (We\u2019ll get April CPI figures tomorrow, and expectations are that the figure will land close to March\u2019s 3.5% pace.) Anyway, discretionary spending is wilting, particularly for clothing and footwear (though presumably some of that would be non-discretionary). If you\u2019re a retailer in Victoria you might be doing it particularly tough just now. (NSW bounced back from worst to first on a monthly basis.) Since consumption is the largest part of the economy, such a weak retailing result will bolster the \u201ceconomic doves\u201d who want to see an RBA rate cut soon. (Today\u2019s figures would tend to undermine the view of those wanting to see the central bank lift the cash rate from 4.35% to stymie inflation.) The stage-three tax cuts and energy rebates will start to ease households\u2019 squeeze from 1 July. Retailers will be hoping for some of extra spending to head their way (but presumably not too much, too soon to disturb the cultivated wa in the RBA board room). Emergency department visits hit record high Ambulance call-outs and emergency department visits have reached a record high in New South Wales as people face increasingly long waits or give up and leave the state\u2019s strained public hospitals, AAP reports. Some 810,201 people attended NSW emergency departments from the start of January to the end of March, an increase of more than 5% compared with the same period last year. Attendances reached the highest of any quarter since the state\u2019s Bureau of Health Information began reporting in 2010. The figures were revealed in a quarterly report released by the bureau on Wednesday. Just over two-thirds of those who attended emergency departments had their treatments start on time, but only 55.9% of patients left within the targeted four-hour period \u2013 a record low. One in 10 people spent nearly 11 hours in emergency departments, while more than 74,000 patients left either without treatment or with incomplete care, an increase of almost 17% on a year earlier. The health minister, Ryan Park, said public hospitals were under unprecedented pressure due to past underfunding, which remained a significant challenge. But we are undertaking the structural reforms to our health system to ensure our community receives the care they need and deserve by delivering the single largest boost to our workforce in the history of our health system, and creating more pathways to treatment and care outside the hospital. More from Karen on the proposed environment law: Another new agency, Environment Protection Australia, will police development activity. It will be empowered to issue stop-work orders to prevent serious environmental damage and to audit businesses to ensure they are not breaching regulations. The government had already foreshadowed legislation to establish the two new bodies but not the new definition. Environment minister Tanya Plibersek says establishing the two new agencies and properly defining \u201cnature positive\u201d is an important step in accurately measuring the state of the environment. \u201cIf you don\u2019t measure it, you can\u2019t manage it,\u201d Plibersek told Guardian Australia. That\u2019s why today we will legislate a definition of \u2018nature positive\u2019 \u2013 a world-first for any government. Without this data and reporting, managing our environment would be like going hiking without a map. Defining and measuring being \u2018nature positive\u2019 against a baseline will mean that we can be accountable for our collective efforts to halt and reverse environmental decline. The foreshadowed legislation does not include promised measures to address Australia\u2019s extinction crisis, including new national environmental standards for development proposals. Those measures have been delayed to an unspecified date. Australia will soon have an official measure of whether the nation\u2019s environment is advancing or declining. Legislation establishing a new national environment protection authority, to be introduced into parliament today, will include a definition of what \u201cnature positive\u201d looks like. \u201cNature positive\u201d will be defined as \u201can improvement in the diversity, abundance, resilience and integrity of ecosystems\u201d from an established benchmark. It will also include a reporting mechanism to ensure Australia is striving to better that baseline every year. The office of Environment Information Australia, a new body being created under the legislation, will be responsible for determining whether Australia is going forwards or backwards under that definition. To make that judgment, the head of the new agency will be able to consider \u201cwhether there has been an improvement in the diversity, abundance and resilience of species that form part of ecosystems\u201d. Good morning and welcome to our rolling news blog, majoring on the political events of the day in Canberra. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and, before my colleague Amy Remeikis comes along for the main action, I\u2019ll get you up to speed with a few overnight and breaking stories. Australian comedian Dan Ilic has dropped his plan to broadcast Vincent Namatjira\u2019s contentious portrait of Gina Rinehart to thousands of tourists and New Yorkers in Times Square despite raising $30,000 for the stunt. Ilic told Guardian Australia yesterday lunchtime that, after exceeding his crowdfunding target, his stunt would go live in Times Square at 8pm on Friday night. But he abandoned the plans last night, citing lack of support for the idea from the National Gallery of Australia where the picture is on display. For farmers like Brent Finlay, the turbines of the MacIntyre windfarm dotted across his part of Queensland\u2019s Southern Downs are a financial lifeline. It\u2019s the largest windfarm in the southern hemisphere and graziers can earn up to $40,000 a year for each turbine they host on their land. But, as is usual in the case of renewable power, not everyone is convinced. Our feature on the changing face of Australian energy comes as the Albanese government presents new legislation today to set up a new national environment protection authority to measure whether the nation\u2019s environment is advancing or declining. More coming up. Developers have yet to begin work on almost 40,000 homes across Australia despite being granted building approvals, with stubbornly high interest rates and construction costs being blamed. A report by KPMG said Sydney and Melbourne made up almost half of all \u201capproved but not yet commenced\u201d projects, about four-fifths of which were townhouses and apartments. We should get another clue today about the future direction of rates when the ABS releases inflation figures for last month. A lower rate could mean a cut but, if it remains sticky, then there\u2019s no chance. More coming up on the economy through the morning. Plus: Florence the tunnel boring machine has now been stuck for two weeks at the Snowy 2.0 project. And new figures show a record high for ambulance call-outs and emergency department visits in NSW. More on these stories, too, soon."

            "date": "2024-05-10T12:06:52Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden is expected as early as next week to announce fresh tariffs on Chinese trade, with levies focused on strategic sectors including electric vehicles, in a review of measures first put into place under Donald Trump. An announcement planned for Tuesday will keep the blanket tax rises introduced by the president\u2019s predecessor but supplement them with targeted levies on industries connected to EVs, including batteries and solar cells, according to reports. The plan, first reported by Bloomberg, would be the culmination of a review of the sweeping tariffs on Beijing that began in 2018. During his presidency, Trump imposed a 27.5% tax on imports of Chinese EVs that Biden has since extended, which has kept the number of Chinese-made cars on US roads extremely low. If introduced, the EV tariffs would represent one of Biden\u2019s biggest moves in the trade war with China. Last month, the president launched an investigation into the Chinese shipping industry alongside a call for higher levies on Chinese steel and aluminium as part of an appeal to union workers before the presidential election in November. While China does not directly sell EVs in the US, it has majority stakes in other overseas firms that sell Chinese-made cars. Political leaders fear Chinese EV imports because China is able to undercut American manufacturers on price, while including more powerful batteries and advanced technology. The Alliance for American Manufacturing, an advocacy group, has said the introduction of Chinese cars to the US market would be an \u201cextinction-level event\u201d for US carmakers. The EU and the US are reeling from a deluge of cheaper imports from China off the back of President Xi Jinping\u2019s strategy to ramp up manufacturing as he attempts to turn around the economy. The restrictions on imports of Chinese \u201csmart cars\u201d would also address security concerns, since many have modems that could be hacked. The White House has said that cars connected to the internet could use cameras and sensors to collect details on and interact with critical US infrastructure. In March, Trump said that if elected as president later this year he would put a 100% tariff on \u201cevery single car that comes across the line\u201d from Chinese-owned manufacturing plants in China. \u201cThey are not going to sell those cars,\u201d he said. He has promised to raise taxes on all Chinese imports by 60%, an approach critics say would raise prices for US consumers already grappling with inflation. In April, Biden said he was \u201cnot looking for a fight with China\u201d but that the US needed to stand up to China\u2019s \u201cunfair economic practices and industrial overcapacity\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m looking for competition, but fair competition,\u201d he said. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. In October last year, the EU said it was investigating evidence that the Beijing government provides illegal financial assistance to the Chinese EV industry. The inquiry may result in the introduction of additional tariffs by July. Similar investigations found that Chinese e-bikes and fiber optic cables were also being subsidised by a margin of between 4% and 17%."

            "date": "2024-05-14T17:13:28Z",
            "content": "Labour has reached agreement with the unions on its flagship workers\u2019 rights proposals after general secretaries demanded the party commit to no further weakening of the original plans. One of the key critics of changes, the Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, said the unions had \u201cbeen listened to and the workers\u2019 voice heard in what she described as a \u201cred line\u201d summit with Keir Starmer on Tuesday. The Labour leader and his senior team met union leaders for the crunch meeting to thrash out a deal on the plans, which were originally agreed last July. One union source told the Guardian the general secretaries had presented a united front and told the Labour leader he should agree to return to the language agreed at the national policy forum last summer. Another meeting will take place in three weeks\u2019 time to confirm the changes. In a joint statement after the talks, Labour and the unions said: \u201cLabour and the affiliated unions had a constructive discussion today. \u201cTogether we have reiterated Labour\u2019s full commitment to the \u2018New deal for working people\u2019 as agreed in July. We will continue to work together at pace on how a Labour government would implement it in legislation.\u201d It means the deal agreed last July, which already represented what critics described as a \u201cwatering down\u201d of several of the original proposals, is now the party\u2019s agreed position. Unite and the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) had been among the unions to have publicly criticised what they termed a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the previous promises to overhaul rights at work. The Guardian understands that concerns about the draft document extended well beyond those unions which had been openly critical. Senior Labour figures are also understood to have been bruised by the leaking of the internal draft to newspapers including the Guardian. The general secretaries convened on Tuesday morning before the lunchtime meeting with Starmer, the deputy leader, Angela Rayner, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, party chair, Anneliese Dodds, shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds, and the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones. The majority of unions affiliated to Labour had privately raised concerns about the latest draft of the document that included several changes to the proposals, including the speed and methods of the changes. \u201cWe believed that the party had agreed all of these measures with us at the national policy forum last summer,\u201d one union source said. \u201cWe are trade unionists and we know when we make an agreement \u2013 we don\u2019t expect to be then given a different draft months later and be told, actually this is what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Another union official said: \u201cThere are those who want to make their case publicly, but the concerns are shared privately by most unions. It\u2019s not only about consultations, which is how the Labour party have tried to frame this; there are promises that were made, such as on sick pay, which have gone completely.\u201d Dave Ward, the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, told LBC the deal \u201cwill be implemented as we agreed previously. Keir\u2019s made it very clear how transformational that will be for working people. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the position we all want \u2026 this will be the biggest difference in rights the country has ever seen in decades; it will be a flagship policy for the general election. We need to shift the balance of forces in the world of work back towards working people, that\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to grow the economy.\u201d Labour has proposed sweeping overhauls of workers\u2019 rights, including maternity and sick pay, day-one protection against unfair dismissal, bans on zero-hours contracts and fire and rehire practices, fair pay agreements and union access. One of the subsequent changes that angered unions was allowing workers to stay on zero-hours contracts if they preferred \u2013 which they said would be a loophole for exploitation. A key point of contention was over changes to the language on fire and rehire, which Labour had committed to banning in law. The leaked draft shared with unions says Labour would \u201creplace the inadequate statutory code brought in by the government with a strengthened code of practice and reform the law to provide effective remedies against abuse\u201d. But the document also says it is \u201cimportant businesses can restructure to remain viable \u2026 when there is genuinely no alternative\u201d. A Labour source said before the meeting the party defended those changes. \u201cIf a company is faced with changing terms and conditions or mass redundancies then there needs to be an exception to protect jobs,\u201d the source said. \u201cProtecting jobs is always the final priority. Even Barry Gardiner in his private member\u2019s bill [on fire and rehire practices] had similar exemptions.\u201d"

            "content": "This adaptation of Jamila Gavin\u2019s award-winning children\u2019s novel about 18th-century foundlings plays out under an aspic glow. But beneath the handsome, period-drama optics lie ugly Georgian attitudes to poverty and dispossessed children. Orphans are sold for a shilling, babies are buried alive and desperate mothers give up their infants to a criminal posing as a philanthropist\u2019s assistant. But the potency of this central theme becomes buried itself under a bulging plot and inconsistent pacing. The story revolves around the landed Ashbrook family and interweaves below-stairs drama. Young Alexander Ashbrook (Louisa Binder) wants to pursue a career in music after falling in love with Handel\u2019s compositions but is expected to take over the estate and is disinherited by his father for his disobedience. His fate is tied to the central intrigue of the criminal baby racket, led by the villainous Otis Gardiner (Samuel Oatley). Helen Edmundson\u2019s adaptation (first staged in 2005) also incorporates a Houdini-like evasion of the gallows, a far-fetched disguise, sex trafficking and action hinging on unlikely coincidence. Anna Ledwich\u2019s production feels both ponderous and rushed, albeit with beautiful live music and choral song, but the cogs of the plot turn to such an extent that it overshadows all else. Even Handel pops up, his presence under-explained, and it is only by reading the programme notes that you discover he was a governor at Thomas Coram\u2019s Foundling Hospital. Multiple scenarios are enacted on the spare set, designed by Simon Higlett, and there are swerves into dream-like expressionism, promisingly cutting through the naturalism. But these moments are rendered melodramatic as well with flashes of jagged light and sound. There is one thought-provoking scene in which the criminal housekeeper, Mrs Lynch (Jo McInnes), strikes out at her superiors and claims, accusingly, that \u201call wealth is built on the suffering of others\u201d, but this idea is unexplored and stranded amid the action. As characters run on and off the stage at speed, it is not always clear which elements are real or imagined. To add to the confusion, actors also double up. The performances are strong and Binder is especially effective as young Alexander. When he reappears eight years on, the character is played by Will Antenbring. This frees Binder to play a foundling who might be linked to Alexander, but you lose the connection with the character whom Binder has carefully crafted. There is great effort made here, but it is a convoluted production: too much story, not enough effect. At Chichester Festival theatre until 15 June"

            "content": "Your editorial (22 May) is an important contribution to a major global event. But the article misses one point. Over the last 200 years free trade has been demanded by the dominant world power. All the major powers today in Europe and North America protected their infant industries in the 19th century at their development stages of growth. Once these powerful and imperial nations had developed their new technologies, they demanded free trade from weaker nations. After the second world war free trade was managed by the dominant powers through the IMF. The shift in American politics to protect its industries is a major indicator that the days of US dominance are coming to an end. This move will not be lost on the poorer nations, as they too will wish to protect their young industries as they move to industrialise. This is a move of greatest importance in world politics, and the Guardian was right to emphasis this vital change. The world is changing in ways we could not have predicted 10 years ago.

            "content": "Bayern Munich are trying to reach an agreement with Thomas Tuchel that would keep him as their manager after encountering problems in their attempts to replace him. For now, plans for the 50-year-old to leave the Allianz Arena this summer remain in place. It was announced in February that he would leave at the end of a campaign where they have missed out on the Bundesliga title for the first time since 2012. They have been unable to keep up with Bayer Leverkusen at the top of the league and were knocked out of the Champions League by Real Madrid last week. However, finding someone to step in for Tuchel has not been easy. Xabi Alonso is staying at Leverkusen and Bayern failed in an attempt to hire the Austria coach, Ralf Rangnick. Bayern are also monitoring Roberto De Zerbi but luring the Italian away from Brighton would be a costly exercise. They are not the only big European club who are finding it difficult to hire a new manager. Manchester United, who are interested in Tuchel, could keep Erik ten Hag because of a lack of options, Mauricio Pochettino could stay at Chelsea for similar reasons and Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez has gone back on his decision to leave Barcelona. It is understood the former Chelsea manager, who replaced Julian Nagelsmann at Bayern in March 2023, is unsure about staying. The manager\u2019s agent, Olaf Meinking, was seen in a meeting with Bayern\u2019s chief executive, Jan-Christian Dreesen, the sporting director, Christoph Freund, and the club\u2019s board member for sport, Max Eberl, on Wednesday. There have been calls from fans for Tuchel to be given another chance and he also enjoys support from within the dressing room, with his case strengthened by Bayern\u2019s run to the last four of the Champions League. They were unfortunate to lose to Real. However, Tuchel has often cut a frustrated figure and come in for criticism after losing the title. Tuchel also hit back at negative comments by the club\u2019s honorary president, Uli Hoeness, this month. If Tuchel is available he would be a candidate to replace Ten Hag at United. Returning to the Premier League would suit the former Paris Saint-Germain manager, who enjoyed a successful spell at Chelsea, leading them to the 2021 Champions League before his abrupt dismissal by the club\u2019s new owners the following year. Recent suggestions that he could return to the Stamford Bridge club if they part company with Pochettino have been dismissed by insiders."

            "date": "2024-05-30T17:08:44Z",
            "content": "The two main political parties are in a bidding war over which can promise to increase taxes the least. Each accuses the other of harbouring a desire to push up taxes to support a growing list of spending pledges. The Conservatives say there is a \u00a338.5bn funding gap in Labour\u2019s spending promises over the next five years and that to cover it, \u201cLabour will increase your taxes by \u00a32,094\u201d. Labour claim unfunded Tory spending pledges add up to \u00a371bn, or 2% of GDP. Amid the claims and counterclaims, one thing is certain: in order to stay within self-imposed fiscal rules \u2013 adopted by the Conservatives, and matched by Labour \u2013 the next government will either have to cut spending on already creaking public services or raise more money through tax. Experts say economic growth won\u2019t be enough to increase government revenues, and that higher tax rates, or new taxes, will be needed. But the room for manoeuvre is narrowing. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has pledged not to increase income tax, national insurance or VAT rates, matching Jeremy Hunt\u2019s stance. Here we assess the remaining options open to the next government to raise more funds: Income Tax Fiscal drag is set to continue and it will raise large sums. The Tories imposed a freeze on income thresholds in 2021, to help pay for the pandemic and then the energy crisis, and on Thursday Hunt confirmed he would keep it in place until 2028-29. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has pencilled in a 20% rise in income tax receipts from \u00a3310bn in 2024-25 rising to \u00a3371bn in 2028-29, mainly driven by the freeze on tax thresholds. On its own, maintaining tax thresholds from 2021 is expected to benefit public finances by about \u00a350bn. Hunt has promised to raise the threshold for pensioners to make sure the state pension remains untaxed, but otherwise the freeze will remain in place for another three years. Reeves is expected to make a similar commitment, keeping in place the 20p rate on incomes between \u00a312,571 to \u00a350,270, the 40p higher rate from \u00a350,271 to \u00a3125,140 and additional 45p rate on incomes over \u00a3125,140. VAT Both parties have promised not to increase VAT, which would meanleave the standard 20% rate in place. But there are ways more could be raised from the sales tax. There is a long list of exemptions, which limit the impact of the tax on low- and middle-income families. Most food escapes VAT and so do children\u2019s clothes. More controversially, financial and property transactions and private schools are also exempt. In its latest assessment of the UK economy, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said the government should look to abolish the exemptions to widen the scope of the tax and bring in more revenue. Reeves has started that process. She expects to generate \u00a3900m a year from applying VAT to private school fees for the first time, while keeping the headline rate. Capital gains tax Neither Hunt nor Reeves have said they will freeze the overall rates of capital gains tax, so this option remains open, for now. The International Monetary Fund also said ministers should consider raising more money from the sale of assets such as shares and property by wealthy people via capital gains tax (CGT), which last year generated \u00a315bn. The rates are much lower than the tax on wages: 24% on gains from a residential property, 28% on gains made by partners in private equity firms and other investment funds, known as carried interest, and 20% on gains from the sale of other assets, such as shares and non-residential property. Reeves is sticking to her pledge to increase taxes on carried interest, which is likely to mean raising the rate to 45%, to match the additional rate of income tax. While the measure redresses inequalities in the tax system, it is expected to raise only between \u00a3400m and \u00a3500m a year. Dividend tax More could be raised if dividends on shares were taxed more heavily. As with capital gains, the rates are far lower than taxes on wages. Critics say this is unfair, as capital gains and dividends are forms of earnings usually only available to the wealthy. At the moment, standard rate taxpayers are charged 8.75%, higher rate taxpayers 33.75% and additional rate taxpayers 39.35%, up from 7.5%, 32.5%, and 38.1% respectively in 2022. The next government could equalise the rates with the income tax rates, generating several hundred million pounds in revenue. However, neither Hunt nor Reeves have had much to say on dividends. Council tax Several years of near 5% increases in council tax pushed up receipts to \u00a344.5bn last year \u2013 double the figure in 2006-07. It is on course to rise to \u00a357.5bn by 2028-29 if left unchecked, according to the OBR. A review is long overdue of thresholds and rates dating back more than 30 years, but Labour and the Conservatives have dodged the issue. Tax relief In a report earlier this year, the National Audit Office calculated that the government offered tax breaks and relief worth more than \u00a3400bn. The estimated \u00a340bn cost of subsidising pension savings mostly benefits higher-rate taxpayers. Reeves plans to review tax reliefs should she become chancellor. She has a plan to tackle tax evasion and avoidance that secures \u00a3700m in the first year, rising to 3.9bn in 2028-29 \u2013 more than \u00a310bn overall. Hunt estimates that he will secure \u00a36bn a year from tackling tax avoidance and evasion. He has yet to say whether he thinks a review is needed. Climate change levy The Climate Change Levy (CCL) is paid by businesses on the energy they use. It aims to reduce the overall emissions that businesses produce and, if successful, shouldin theorytheoretically spur change rather than higher tax receipts. But critics say the levy is set so low that it has little effect. They say it should be increased and its scope widened as a deterrent against fossil fuels. It raised \u00a31.9bn last year and this figure is expected to drop to \u00a31.8bn in 2028-29. Tax receipts from the UK\u2019s emissions trading scheme is likewise falling, from \u00a35.8bn a year to \u00a31.6bn over the same timescale, and will be only partially offset under Labour\u2019s plans by a new energy profits levy on the big energy firms that will add \u00a31.3bn a year to Treasury coffers."

            "date": "2024-05-25T09:02:35Z",
            "content": "The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has hinted he would cut taxes for higher earners if the Conservatives are re-elected, saying they disincentivised people from working harder. As both parties began to set out their economic plans on the first weekend of campaigning, Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves also said she wants taxes on working people to be lower, and promised never to \u201cplay fast and loose\u201d with public finances. She said she intended to lead the \u201cmost pro-business Treasury in our history\u201d. In an interview with the Telegraph, Hunt said \u201cdistortions in the tax system\u201d on earnings between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3125,000 \u201cdisincentivised people from doing what we need, which is to work, work harder\u201d. He also suggested the Tories would seek to end the effective 60% rate on incomes between \u00a3100,000 and \u00a3125,000 as the tax-free personal allowance tapers off. The Conservatives would seek to correct these distortions if the party was given another five years in government, he said. He also said he would go further in reducing employees\u2019 national insurance contributions after two cuts in the past six months. \u201cOur priority will be taxes that boost growth. So that can be business taxes that boost investment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also taxes on work, which is why our national insurance cuts will fill about one in five vacancies across the economy. And it\u2019s taxes that disincentivise saving, because if we want to have more investment in the economy, we need to be saving more.\u201d Hunt described inheritance tax as \u201cpernicious\u201d and \u201cprofoundly anti-Conservative\u201d, but he refused to say a pledge to cut it would be included in the Tories\u2019 election manifesto. \u201cI hope it\u2019s something that over time a Conservative government would be able to look at,\u201d he said. The chancellor was reported last year to be considering cutting the headline rate of inheritance tax from 40% to 20%, paid on estates valued above \u00a3325,000 a person. He also said another Conservative government would help people to get their \u201cfoot on the housing ladder\u201d. \u201cWe would love to offer more support to people buying a house for the first time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got record numbers of people doing that, but nonetheless, we recognise that finding the money for the deposit is challenging.\u201d An \u201cunsteady\u201d property market had made support difficult in the past 18 months because of the threat of negative equity, where falling house prices leave families living in a property worth less than their mortgage. It hadn\u2019t been possible \u201cto introduce schemes that help first-time buyers in the context where there\u2019s a possibility of property prices going down,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is changing now.\u201d In a direct appeal to Tory voters via an article for the Daily Mail \u2013 given front page treatment by the rightwing paper \u2013 Reeves attacked the Conservatives\u2019 economic record over the past 14 years. \u201cNo one is going to give a box of matches back to the arsonists whose burnt the house down,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI know it is not enough to tell you why the Conservatives have failed. You rightly want to know why you can trust us and the difference we will make for you and your family. \u201cLet me start with a very simple promise: I will never play fast and loose with your money. I worked as an economist at the Bank of England and in financial services before entering politics. \u201cI know what it takes to run a successful economy.\u201d Her first step would be \u201cto deliver economic stability with tough spending rules so we can grow our economy and keep taxes, inflation and mortgages as low as possible\u201d, she wrote. \u201cI do not believe you can tax and spend your way to growth, and I didn\u2019t come into politics to raise taxes on working people. Indeed, I want them to be lower.\u201d"

            "content": "The Elite London, described as the city\u2019s \u201cmost exclusive jet-set lifestyle event\u201d, filled Wycombe Air Park with row after row of gleaming private jets, seaplanes, hovercrafts (with one for kids), helicopters, and supercars either the size of tanks, or flat on the ground like giant skateboards. In hangar after hangar, the wares on sale last weekend were designed and priced for the super-rich, though possibly not quite for the cadres in this year\u2019s Sunday Times rich list, which bills itself as \u201ca celebration of aspiration\u201d. A \u201ctruly bespoke\u201d \u00a330,000 safe had six permanently revolving wheels that keep your watches synchronised; they recently sold one to protect a household\u2019s \u00a31.3m collection of watches. A writing service offered an illustrated memoir of your life\u2019s successes for \u00a328,000. A monster Land Rover Defender, with its boot open to display champagne and a magnificent picnic basket, promoted educational advice: \u201cOpening the door to the best boarding schools and universities.\u201d A man who had been discussing a plane with a salesman might have been seriously rich or just a plane-spotter in a panama hat, but I asked him if this flamboyant parade of wealth might be at all embarrassing in a cost of living crisis, when so many hardworking people (always use that phrase) struggle to put food on the table for their children. Did he, perhaps, agree that people who can afford all this should pay a bit more tax? \u201cWhy would I?\u201d Well, look at the state of the country, a collapsing NHS, crumbling schools \u2013 or potholes that might damage your Bentley? \u201cLook, take any more in tax and the wealthy would be off! [Flying] away out of here in one of these!\u201d He waved at the array of lustrous aircraft. But would they, really? A telling study of HMRC records showed what happened in 2017, when reform to taxes on super-rich non-doms lost some of them significant sums: just 6% fled. Researchers have also found that abolishing non-dom status could raise \u00a33.8bn. Those who left were the ones paying the least tax in the first place, so the tax loss from this was tiny. If hardly any non-doms with foreign connections leave, the rest of the rich are even less likely to flee tax rises. Remember Guy Hands, the founder of Terra Firma private equity, who bolted to Guernsey and its 20% flat tax rate in 2009 to avoid Labour\u2019s top tax rise: \u201cFor me it was a disaster,\u201d he wrote last year. \u201cI lost the flow of the market.\u201d The rich got a lot richer recently, with average pre-tax company profit margins up 30% from pre-Covid figures, according to Unite\u2019s research into nearly 17,000 companies. Real wages, meanwhile, have flatlined since 2008, despite a slight recent blip upwards. Every little helps, no doubt, with the recent news that the pay and perks of Tesco\u2019s CEO rose to \u00a39.9m last year. With food prices up 24% since 2022, that particular greediness rang out with real political resonance. The rich list laments that Britain\u2019s \u201cbillionaire boom has come to an end\u201d, but there are only six fewer than last year. Robert Palmer of Tax Justice UK points out that, pre-Covid, there were 147 in 2020, which rose to 177 in 2022\u2019s rich list. The public have noticed: before the pandemic, they considered national governments as having the most power in our society, but in 2023 King\u2019s College London\u2019s Policy Institute found they think the super-rich 1% have more power than government. That cynicism about who controls the country shows how inequality undermines democracy itself, reports the LSE\u2019s Why Wealth Inequality Matters. Last week, polling for Tax Justice UK found that about two-thirds of voters were more likely to vote for a party willing to raise taxes on the rich. Covid marked a social-democratic turning point in British attitudes, as it pumped up the wealth of the rich while pounding the rest. It reminded people that only the state, collecting taxes, can protect us in emergencies, staving off economic disaster by supporting families and companies. Only the state could cushion us against shock energy bills, still about 59% higher than in the winter of 2021 and 2022. Britain is the worst for homelessness in the developed world, according to the FT\u2019s number-cruncher John Burn Murdoch, partly because it is building fewer homes than most other developed countries. That is just one state failure among many. People want more state action, not less. There were only 29 rich-list billionaires in 2010 when Labour left office. Labour\u2019s task to create and distribute wealth will be much harder now than it was in the 90s, but every Labour government has left the poor better off and public services improved. Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves can see as well as everyone else the vast riches swashing around in Britain, while a third of children go poor and hungry. The archbishop of Canterbury joins Gordon Brown in calling to end the two-child benefit cap, the great motor for child poverty \u2013 spending \u00a32.5bn to abolish it would lift half a million children out of poverty. My guess is Labour will announce this before the election \u2013 something that was hinted at this weekend, when the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, said he didn\u2019t like the cap and Labour would return to its target of eradicating child poverty. Reeves should be able to find that \u00a32.5bn easily now she has created a tax avoidance advisory committee with James Murray, the shadow financial secretary, Edward Troup, the ex-head of HMRC, and Margaret Hodge, scourge of avoiders \u2013 they are tasked with closing the \u00a336bn gap between taxes owed and taxes paid. Once into the territory of avoidance, off-shoring and tax reliefs, Hodge has told parliament she could recoup \u00a3100bn in missing tax. The rich list is always morbidly fascinating, a yearly reminder of Britain\u2019s grotesque inequalities. To have a prime minister in the list whose fortune, with his wife, rose by \u00a3120m in a hardship year is another hole in the Tories\u2019 sinking ship. This might not matter if he decided to champion the have-nots. Instead, Sunak pledged yet more cuts to benefits, claiming they had become a \u201clifestyle choice\u201d for some. Expect Labour\u2019s lifestyle choice to be clipping benefits for the rich and raising those of the poor. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"

            "content": "A London-based billionaire non-dom left the UK for good on the day that the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, announced the scrapping of the 225-year-old tax scheme in the spring budget, his tax adviser has revealed. \u201cWe did have one billionaire client who literally on the day of the budget, 6 March, got on his private jet with his wife, with his children, with the private tutor, and flew to one of his other 17 houses in the world \u2013 and said \u2018I\u2019m not coming back\u2019,\u201d said John Barnett, a partner at the law firm Burges Salmon, which specialises in advising the super-rich on how to legally reduce their tax bills. Barnett and other tax advisers to the very wealthy, say dozens of their non-domicile clients have already left the country to avoid being subjected to UK taxes on their overseas income, after Hunt announced the abolition of the regime from April 2025. They expect hundreds more to leave for other countries such as Italy, Spain, France and Malta that have special tax incentives designed to attract the very rich and very mobile. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the billionaire class, you\u2019ve already got the houses elsewhere, you\u2019ve got the private tutor for your children, you\u2019ve got the private jet \u2013 you can leave straight away,\u201d Barnett told a conference celebrating the super-rich at the Savoy hotel in central London. \u201cI think for most other groups below that, it\u2019s not an immediate decision. You\u2019ve got children in school \u2026 spouse issues to contend with, you\u2019ve got a business to sell, you\u2019ve got a house to buy \u2013 it\u2019s a two to three-year decision to move.\u201d Barnett said he expected that a lot of the non-doms would go abroad to avoid the increased tax burden, but would still spend a lot of time in the UK, particularly for the popular social and sporting events over the summer. \u201cA lot of these people will make themselves non-resident \u2026 but will probably still be able to spend three to four months here in the summer [before the Treasury would consider someone a permanent resident]. So you can still go to Wimbledon, go to the Chelsea flower show, all those sorts of usual things.\u201d There were 68,800 non-doms in the UK in 2021-22, according to the latest available HM Revenue and Customs data. Camilla Wallace, a senior partner and tax adviser at the London law firm Wedlake Bell, said many of her non-dom clients were also looking to leave the UK as quickly as possible. She said a \u201cvery lovely Brazilian client, who has bought a very expensive house in central London and is now spending millions doing it up\u201d had asked her this week where he should go. \u201cI said to him that it really depends on what you like. So some people like mountains and skiing and some people like glitzy stuff, so Monaco and Dubai are great for that. Others like islands and sailing,\u201d she said, speaking last week at the Spear\u2019s 500 wealth management conference. \u201cSo you look at the human element of the move and then you check out what tax breaks they [other countries] are offering, and some places in Europe have been doing exceptionally well.\u201d Barnett said many of his clients were keen to move to Italy, which introduced a scheme through which rich people could pay a \u201cflat tax\u201d of just \u20ac100,000 (\u00a385,000), no matter how much money they earned. France, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Portugal and Spain have similar schemes designed to attract the wealthy and internationally mobile elite. Spain\u2019s expatriates tax regime is nicknamed the Beckham law after David Beckham, who became one of the first people to use it when he was playing for Real Madrid in the mid-noughties. \u201cThere\u2019s a new one [expatriate tax deal] every week \u2013 just keeping on top of it is difficult,\u201d Barnett said. To which Wallace added: \u201cWe\u2019re shutting down, and everyone else is opening up.\u201d Julia Hope, the chief executive of Innovate LSO Solutions, a company that encourages people to relocate to Barbados, said: \u201cI\u2019m sure we may well have a billionaire or two who can jump on their plane and just come across and spend some time at [the luxury resort] Sandy Lane or somewhere [else] exclusive.\u201d The multi-millionaire non-dom entrepreneur Bassim Haidar told the Guardian earlier this month that he was leaving the UK as soon as possible because the scrapping of the regime \u201cis going to cost me millions and millions of dollars and pounds every year in taxes on money that I\u2019ve actually made abroad and businesses that I\u2019ve built abroad\u201d."

Speaking in the south-east, where Labour is targeting swing voters in Conservative-held seats, Starmer will say: \u201cWhatever the polls say, I know there are countless people who haven\u2019t decided how they\u2019ll vote in this election. \u201cThey\u2019re fed up with the failure, chaos and division of the Tories, but they still have questions about us. Has Labour changed enough? Do I trust them with my money, our borders, and our security? \u201cMy answer is yes, you can \u2013 because I have changed this party. Permanently. This has been my driving mission since day one. I was determined to change Labour so that it could serve the British people.\u201d Rachel Reeves has vowed that Labour would not raise income tax or national insurance in the next parliament. She said there would be no \u201creturn to austerity\u201d under Labour and that the party had committed to an \u201cimmediate injection of cash into public services\u201d. But the shadow chancellor stressed there would be no \u201cunfunded proposals\u201d in the Labour manifesto. \u201cMoney for our NHS, the additional police \u2013 13,000 additional police and community officers \u2013 and the 6,500 additional teachers in our schools, they are all fully costed and fully funded promises, because unless things are fully costed and fully funded, frankly, you can\u2019t believe they\u2019re going to happen,\u201d Reeves told the BBC\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg. She added: \u201cWhat I want and Keir wants is taxes on working people to be lower, and we certainly won\u2019t be increasing income tax or national insurance if we win at the election.\u201d Speaking in the south-east, Starmer will say Labour has been \u201cruthless in making sure these policies are deliverable, fully funded and ready to go\u201d. A Labour campaign source said: \u201cThe Tories have spent 14 years burning down the country. Now they want you to hand them another box of matches and a jerry can of petrol. This election is the chance to remove the arsonists and rebuild Britain.\u201d The party will reportedly carry out a 100-day review of threats facing Britain, in a pledge that would underline the party\u2019s commitment to national security. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, told the Times the policy would involve MI5, the police and Whitehall conducting a \u201csecurity sprint\u201d to identify threats from hostile states, including Russia and Iran, from extremism and artificial intelligence. This will be Starmer\u2019s third visit to the south-east in as many weeks, as he targets Tory-held seats in Kent and Essex which haven\u2019t returned Labour MPs since the New Labour years. In his speech the Labour leader will make a personal pledge to wavering voters who are considering backing him, saying: \u201cI know those people are looking at this election, looking at me personally. So, I make this promise: I will fight for you. \u201cI took this Labour party four years ago, and I changed it into the party you see today. I was criticised for some of the changes I\u2019ve made, change is always like that. \u201cThere are always people who say, don\u2019t do that, don\u2019t go so fast. But whenever I face a fork in the road, it always comes back to this: the golden thread: country first, party second.\u201d Reeves defended Labour\u2019s plans to end fire and rehire practices after Unite criticised the party for excluding an outright ban from the final version of its workers\u2019 rights package. The union\u2019s secretary general, Sharon Graham, said the proposal now had \u201cmore holes than Swiss cheese\u201d. Reeves insisted that Labour retained the support of trade unions for \u201cthe biggest ever extension of workplace rights that\u2019s ever been introduced\u201d. Labour insiders said the party had gone further in its attempt to outlaw fire and rehire practices by changing the language used in its final workers\u2019 rights package from \u201cbanning\u201d to \u201cending\u201d. But they said they would not allow situations where employers and workers were not able to negotiate contractual terms to save jobs if they were genuinely facing insolvency. Reeves told the BBC: \u201cWhen a company\u2019s facing bankruptcy and there is no alternative, they will have to consult with their workers and their trade unions. Those are very, very limited circumstances.\u201d Labour published its workers\u2019 rights package on Friday under the new branding \u201cLabour\u2019s plan to make work pay: delivering a new deal for working people\u201d."

            "content": "The carved face of a cateran stares out of the waymarker before me. Deriving from the Gaelic word ceatharnach, meaning a lightly armed warrior, \u201ccateran\u201d later came to denote the cattle raiders particularly active here in Strathardle, Glenshee and Glen Isla up to the 18th century. The signpost directs me through plantation forest to an undulating moor, darkened by heather and lightened by grassland. The bushy auburn of a fleet-footed fox stands out like a light tumbling down the glen. There is a rough grandeur to Perthshire landscapes such as this, ringed off from the world by mountains \u2013 in this case the snow-sprinkled bulk of Ben Earb and ridgelines of Creag an Dubh Shluic and Meall Uaine. I follow a gravel and trampled-grass path through this silent scene, climbing slowly to An Lairig gate. This is the lowest point of the surrounding mountain saddle, at 648 metres, but the high point of the Cateran Trail, a 64-mile circular walking route starting and finishing in Blairgowrie. The trail is 25 years old this year. I\u2019m on day two of the five-stage trail, whose sections range from 8\u00bd to 16.3 miles in length, with stops at the village of Kirkmichael, the Spittal of Glenshee, the Kirkton of Glenisla and the town of Alyth en route. The trail meanders through forests and farmland, across bogs and burns and over mountains and moorland, partly on drove roads once used by those fierce cattle raiders. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought that east Perthshire is the outdoor capital of Scotland,\u201d says Bob Ellis, a councillor and hillwalker who co-founded the trail in 1999 with local businessman Alan Dick. \u201cWe worked out a route and then it was a case of Alan dropping me off at various places and me jogging with a Dictaphone, describing the state of the trail and what we would need to do in the way of signposts. A lot of the trail was already there on forestry roads, but there were bits where we had to cut swathes through the heather.\u201d This was before the 2003 Land Reform Act introduced Scotland\u2019s famed right to roam, so the approval of local landowners (all 43 of them) was crucial to getting the project off the ground. The gnarled cateran carvings on the waymarkers were made by Robbie Gordon, then an officer in the Perth and Kinross Countryside Trust. More common to see, though, are the symbols guiding walkers along the way \u2013 a red heart encircled in green. \u201cThe route looked a bit like a heart,\u201d laughs Bob. \u201cEspecially after two or three beers \u2013 and we\u2019re in the heart of Scotland here.\u201d My hike began the day before on the River Ericht in Blairgowrie, and took me past the huge, abandoned mills that brought prosperity to the town during the Industrial Revolution. The first section (15\u00bd miles to Kirkmichael) then crosses agricultural valleys to an expansive moorland, where the mountains of the north become visible \u2013 the peaks of Ben Vrackie and Mount Blair beckoning you up to the Highlands. The trail crisscrosses the Highland Boundary Fault whose beauty lies in the dramatic juxtaposition landscapes on either side of it \u2013 soaring mountains and gentle valley. Formed more than 400 million years ago when continents collided, the rock to the north is hard to cultivate while the soft sandstone to the south created some of Scotland\u2019s most fertile valleys. Cultures evolve around landscapes and while the clan system took hold north of the line, the feudal system thrived to the south. Surrounding the route is the Cateran Ecomuseum, a \u201cmuseum without walls\u201d, which opened in 2018 and highlights sites of historical interest (there are suggested walking, cycling and car itineraries on the website). On day two I stop for a breather at one such spot, a hidden shelter open to walkers, on my hike up to An Lairig gate. The history goes that Queen Victoria had tea on the grass near here in 1865 while riding from Dunkeld to Balmoral. Her party had forgotten a kettle, which had to be sent for from the Spittal. \u201cThis caused some delay,\u201d she wrote. From An Lairig I continue on to the Spittal of Glenshee and my overnight stop on the Dalmunzie Castle Estate, in the valley beneath Ben Gulabin, where four glens meet and Allt a\u2019 Ghlinne Bhig drains into the Shee Water. There\u2019s still spring snow underfoot, and more on the mountains ahead: C\u00e0rn an Daimh and C\u00e0rn Ait bridging into the Munros of Creag Leacach and Glas Maol. I bundle myself out of Dalmunzie for stage three the next day, rejoining the trail by an old stone bridge at the southern foot of the Cairnwell Pass. The morning is crisp but the sun turns the glen golden as it rises on a clear blue sky. I detour to Diarmuid\u2019s Tomb, a four-poster rock circle said to be the resting place of Fingal\u2019s great warrior nephew, and heat up breakfast by a stream while a parcel of oystercatchers flutter and squeak above. I enter Angus on back roads and climb past the 16th-century Forter Castle to a splendid vista of Glen Isla. Auchintaple Loch, just beyond, is Bob\u2019s favourite view on the trail. I see why. Forests lie in layers above and below the loch, backdropped by mountains reflected in the water. I spot a mountain hare as it sprints through a field and stroll my final few miles for the day to reach Glenisla Hotel. Tractors and rugby are the barstool talk in the lively pub, which has a floor-to-ceiling map of the Cateran Trail on one wall. Stage four is an 11-mile jaunt through farmland, with the mountains fading behind as I reach the town of Alyth. The trail has spawned multiple spin-offs in the past 25 years. Not just the Ecomuseum, but the Cateran Yomp \u2013 where endurance athletes run the full route in under 24 hours \u2013 and the Cateran Dirt Dash, a two-day bikepacking event on the trail. The final stage runs for 17 miles from Alyth back to Blairgowrie. I split it into two shorter days to give me an excuse to stay in a cabin on the water\u2019s edge at Bamff Wildland, the site of a rewilding project where beavers have turned an agricultural ditch dug in the 1700s into a thriving, messy wetland. Paul and Lousie Ramsay first brought beavers on to their estate in 2002. \u201cThere are 60 or 70 dams here on Bamff today,\u201d says Paul. \u201cWetlands store huge amounts of carbon and they\u2019re disproportionately important for biodiversity too.\u201d One of their less-heralded benefits is amplifying sunsets: a kaleidoscope of orange and pinks bouncing back off the water. In the morning, I watch three beavers casually nibbling on branches. This wildland is yet another facet of Scotland \u2013 conservation and changing land use. I turn my back to the mountains to complete stage five and finish this tremendous trail from the Lowlands to the Highlands and back again. It\u2019s a route of wild garlic and wilder glens, faultlines and folklore; and of ancient and modern Scotland. \u201cI love this place,\u201d Bob says. \u201cWhen I do have to leave, my ashes will be spread here. In another 25 years, I\u2019ll no\u2019 be here, but the trail will.\u201d How to do it Blairgowrie to Kirkmichael 15.5 miles (stay at the Kirkmichael Hotel, from \u00a370 a night).

            "date": "2024-05-30T17:48:24Z",
            "content": "The decision by the Evening Standard to stop producing a daily edition, from Monday to Friday, leaves Londoners without their own general newspaper. Under its current owners, the Standard, which is 197 years old, has faded to a shadow of its former, showy self. But this is a dismaying move all the same. A city of London\u2019s size and importance, with a mayoralty and 32 borough councils, ought to have a dedicated print news outlet aside from the business-focused City AM. This is not just a matter of holding politicians, local services and businesses to account. It is about the city as a place with its own civic identity, its own arts and food scenes and sporting events, as well as serious problems including a housing affordability crisis. The title has faced the same pressures as other print media, above all falling sales and advertising due to intense competition from digital rivals. It was given an injection of life when it went free in 2009 and pivoted to an advertising-led model. But the combination of higher newsprint costs, wifi on the London Underground and increased home working have finished it off. While a weekly version is promised, along with a boost to its online presence, the 15 years of Lord Lebedev\u2019s majority-ownership do not inspire confidence. He spent tens of millions on the loss-making TV project London Live while slashing editorial budgets. His decision to make former chancellor George Osborne editor was not popular with staff, but in line with his apparent desire to use the title to boost his social standing. According to its accounts, the business has lost \u00a384.5m in six years. Nevertheless, it must be hoped either that an improved Standard website will attract a bigger audience, or that another publication will fill the gap. Outside London things are even more grim. At least 300 local papers closed in the UK between 2009 and 2019. The negative consequences for civic life, and for local democracy, have been widely noted. Last year the digital, culture, media and sport committee recommended an expansion of the BBC-funded Local Democracy Reporter Service, and government support for a fund to promote innovation in news provision. Initiatives such as the cooperatively owned Bristol Cable, and newsletters pioneered by the Manchester Mill and Sheffield Tribune, give some grounds for optimism. But other places, particularly poorer ones, have become local news deserts. The press is not a cure-all. Local reporters do not necessarily shrink the gap between people and their elected representatives. However, the devolution of significant powers to mayors across England makes scrutiny essential. London has a population of 9 million. Its mayor, Sadiq Khan, controls a budget of more than \u00a320bn. Its councils struggle to fulfil their statutory obligations, notably in social care and housing. Beyond that, in a world of filter bubbles, Facebook gossip and closed WhatsApp groups, a shared sense of place remains important. London has not been well served by Lord Lebedev, who is also a friend of Boris Johnson. Since buying the Evening Standard and Independent, he has sold significant stakes in them to a Saudi businessman. The decline of print is not his fault. Nor is the overwhelming dominance in online advertising of Google and Meta. But with more imagination and a real commitment to its audience, it should have been possible to reimagine the Standard for a digital age."

            "date": "2024-05-12T11:29:57Z",
            "content": "A leading US investor has started pouring cash into NatWest shares after a notable cut in the government\u2019s shareholding helped to allay fears of state intervention in the bailed-out banking group. Los Angeles-headquartered Capital Group, which is one of the world\u2019s oldest and largest investment firms, with more than \u00a32.5tn under management, has bought more than \u00a3110m worth of NatWest shares, days after the government cut its position, pushing the group into the bank\u2019s top 30 shareholder list. Capital had been considering buying a stake for months, after strong profits and a meeting with the newly appointed chief executive, Paul Thwaite, in February, it is understood. NatWest last year made its biggest annual profit since the start of the financial crisis in 2007, helped by high interest rates. However, a City source said investors like Capital had been put off by the government\u2019s 30% stake, which meant it was still classed as a controlling shareholder. The government holding is a hangover from its \u00a346bn bailout of NatWest, formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland Group, which resulted in the state taking an 83% stake in the lender in the 2008 financial crisis. The government\u2019s stake fell below 30% for the first time in late March, opening the door to a fresh wave of investment from the US firm. Benjamin Toms, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: \u201cPolitics and banking have been fairly entwined from a European and UK perspective over the years, and that has always a bit of worry in the back of investors\u2019 minds. If the government owns a sizeable stake, they can have a bit more leverage \u2026 around whether banks are adequately passing on higher rates to deposit holders, or lending to SMEs. \u201cThere\u2019s a worry that if the government has a stake in your firm, they could wield power, even if in realistic terms it shouldn\u2019t make huge difference as a minority holder.\u201d Capital Group vehicles bought up 33m shares at the end of March, days after the government\u2019s stake dropped, amounting to a nearly 0.4% stake, according to the last available public data. It is understood that Capital has since continued its buying spree. Behind the UK government, the bank\u2019s largest shareholders include MFS Investment Management, with a 5.1% stake, Norges Bank Investment Management, with a 3.7% stake, and the Vanguard Group, with a 2.3% stake. Aside from financial crisis-era interventions on executive pay and conversations around the departure of the former chief executive Stephen Hester in 2013, ministers have taken a largely hands-off approach to the management of NatWest. However, concerns over government influence were raised last summer after ministers pushed for the resignation of Alison Rose as chief executive after a row with the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage over the closure of his accounts at the private bank Coutts. In 2018 the Labour party signalled plans to halt further stake sales and use RBS to boost funding to small businesses. Labour\u2019s current leadership under Keir Starmer has not voiced any similar plans. Speaking at the AGM last month, NatWest\u2019s new chair, Rick Haythornthwaite, said: \u201cI think there\u2019s undoubtedly a perception of more intervention from His Majesty\u2019s Treasury than there really is. Removing that overhang is a value \u2026 and I think that can only be good as we think about the future.\u201d Capital Group\u2019s investment will be welcomed by the Conservative-led UK government, which is rushing to return NatWest to private ownership by 2025-26, and is teeing up a campaign that could lead to a chunk of its stake being sold directly to retail customers as early as this summer. A Capital Group spokesperson said the firm would not comment on individual companies or holdings. NatWest declined to comment."

            "content": "Lizzie Carboni knew that life in New Caledonia had changed forever when the school she had attended as a child went up in flames on Wednesday night. \u201cI could hear people yelling, screaming and grenades being fired,\u201d she says, adding that it was \u201cthe worst night of my life\u201d and likening the scenes unfolding in the capital, Noum\u00e9a, to \u201ccivil war\u201d. Carboni lives in the residential neighbourhood of Portes de Fer and has watched as waves of violence have gripped the country this week, and protests over changes to a voting law grew into riots. Now, armoured vehicles patrol the streets of the city, and locals describe being afraid to leave their homes. Burnt detritus amassed over four days of unrest is scattered on Noum\u00e9a\u2019s palm-lined major thoroughfares, which are usually thronged with tourists. Fist-size chunks of rock and cement that appeared to have been flung during riots lie on the ground. In the wake of the violence, Paris has deployed troops to the French territory\u2019s ports and international airport, banned TikTok and imposed a state of emergency. Four people, including a police officer, have died in the clashes and hundreds have been wounded. Carboni, a freelance journalist, is horrified. \u201cWe have bags ready if we need to leave our home for whatever reason,\u201d she says, adding that local supermarkets had been looted and that she and her family were relying on the food they had remaining in their pantry. \u201cWe were, and are still, terrified by what\u2019s happening. \u201cLife will never be the same from now on. It will take months and months to rebuild everything, if it can be done at all,\u201d she says. Speaking to broadcaster France Info on Wednesday, Anne Cl\u00e9ment, another Noum\u00e9a resident, hailed security forces reinforcements, saying the unrest had morphed into \u201ca real urban guerrilla war\u201d. People have been confined to their homes, terrified by \u201cshooting from all sides\u201d, Cl\u00e9ment, a nursery director, told the broadcaster. \u201cWe\u2019ve stopped eating, we\u2019ve stopped living, we\u2019ve stopped sleeping,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t see how we could get out of the situation without the state of emergency.\u201d Another resident, Yoan Fleurot, told Reuters in a Zoom interview that he was staying at home out of respect for the nightly curfew and was very scared for his family. \u201cI don\u2019t see how my country can recover after this\u201d, Fleurot said. Residents in some neighbourhoods strung up improvised white flags, a symbol of their intention to keep peaceful watch over the streets. French broadcaster La Premi\u00e8re posted footage on Twitter showing a supermarket in the town of Dumb\u00e9a, next to the capital, which it said had been looted on Wednesday night. Elsewhere, residents formed queues outside petrol stations and supermarkets in a bid to find supplies. One woman said she felt she had been forced to take food from shops. \u201cWe just grabbed what there was in the shops to eat. Soon there will be no more shops,\u201d she said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cWe need milk for the children. I don\u2019t see it as looting,\u201d she told AFP. The pro-independence, largely Indigenous protests were sparked by planned changes to voting laws that will allow more long-term French residents of the islands to vote in local elections. The move has sparked fears among the indigenous Kanak population that their influence will be further diluted. The protests turned violent this week as the bill was voted on in the French parliament. The reforms must still be approved by a joint sitting of both houses of the French parliament. \u201cA few days ago, we were going out, sitting at cafes, laughing together but in just a few hours, everything changed,\u201d Carboni says. \u201cThe future is uncertain for everybody. What will tomorrow be like?\u201d"

            "content": "Twenty-seven years ago today, the British people went to the polls and turned the page on a disastrous period of Tory government. It was a decisive choice, not just in favour of a new party, but in favour of a new politics. In that moment, Britain voted for a minimum wage, peace in Northern Ireland, a million children to be lifted from poverty, the shortest NHS waiting times in history and crime to be reduced by a third. Like most people in our country, I wanted a general election tomorrow and the opportunity for Britain to look forward with hope once again. Rishi Sunak refused to let the nation have a say for fear of the message the people would send. Yet the many council and mayoral elections still offer millions of voters up and down England the chance to reject chaos, division and decline with the Tories and embrace stability, unity and renewal with Labour. One of the most important decisions taken tomorrow will be who leads our nation\u2019s capital. Labour\u2019s candidate for London mayor, Sadiq Khan, knows what it is like to inherit a Tory shambles. His predecessor spent eight years wasting \u00a353m, \u00a343m of it taxpayers\u2019 money, on a garden bridge to nowhere, burying a report about the appalling state of London\u2019s air and squandering taxpayers\u2019 money on unusable water cannon. I have known Sadiq for many years, and I am proud to call him a friend and a colleague. He is someone driven by the principle of giving people the same opportunities he had, which allowed him to go from a council estate in Tooting to leading our capital. During his tenure, Sadiq has transformed the mayoralty from a laughing stock to showing leadership. Every pupil in every London state primary school now receives a free school meal. The capital\u2019s air is cleaner to breathe. The Hopper bus fare, allowing unlimited journeys within one hour for one price, the Superloop express bus routes and the Elizabeth Line have all been delivered. Overall housing completions recently hit their highest level in London since the 1930s and more new council homes are being built now than at any time since the 1970s. And 330,000 good jobs have been created through City Hall initiatives. This is the power of Labour in government. And let us not forget that Sadiq has managed all of this in the teeth of a Tory government; just imagine what could be achieved working with a Labour one. It is worth remembering that since the return of London\u2019s government at the turn of the century, we have only had four years of a Labour mayor working with a Labour prime minister. But in that time, Crossrail was agreed, the Olympics were secured and massive numbers of social homes were built. Now, a new era of renewal is within reach. And if Labour succeeds in winning elections in our capital and our country, a Labour government will support Sadiq to put up to 1,300 more police officers on London\u2019s streets, build at least 40,000 new council homes, create 150,000 well-paid, high-skilled jobs for Londoners and end rough sleeping for good. This future hangs in the balance because the result of the London mayoral election will be close, and the choice could not be starker. We simply cannot allow the Tories to harm London in the same way that they have harmed Britain. A Tory mayor would mean fewer police on the streets, hikes to transport costs and fewer affordable homes. For some, the Tory candidate is a figure of ridicule, but the truth is that there is nothing remotely funny about her. Susan Hall has a grim history of reportedly promoting extremist views, from climate change denial to the abuse of journalists and the legacy of Enoch Powell. Rishi Sunak knew this \u2013 but rather than getting rid of someone so desperately unsuited to lead our nation\u2019s capital, he backed her. The Tories\u2019 divisive candidate and campaign in London is yet another example of how disconnected they have become with the aspirations of working people. They have no plan, no policies, no promise of a better tomorrow. In contrast, Labour has a vision and the determination to deliver it. One of the many great privileges of being on the campaign trail is having the chance to get out and hear from people in the places they work, live and raise their families. Every community is different, but whether from Deptford, Dudley or Durham, our people are bound by the same immense pride they have in their home. They know their communities best and what best works for them. This is why Labour is the party of devolution. We believe Britain succeeds when everyone has a say and a stake. And the next Labour government will stay true to that philosophy with a Take Back Control Act, that will give mayors access to new powers over transport, skills, enterprise, energy, planning and our high streets. Our ambition for more devolution is integral to a plan for higher growth, safer streets, more opportunities in every community, cheaper energy bills and an NHS back on its feet. With the opportunity to serve, we can change the lives of working people for good and for better in London and across Britain \u2013 and it begins tomorrow. Vote Sadiq, and you\u2019ll be voting for our mission to give Britain its future back.

            "date": "2024-05-15T14:35:15Z",
            "content": "Raspberry Pi, whose popular minicomputers are sold around the world, has come a long way since its co-founder Jack Lang had to store some of the first batch of single-board devices in his garage more than a decade ago. What started out as a project to reverse the decline in computer science applications at Cambridge University went on to inspire a generation of child programmers by offering them an affordable $35 (\u00a328) minicomputer. Now the company is preparing to list on the London Stock Exchange. Designed by Cambridge engineers and computer scientists, the Pi was conceived as a durable, ultra-low-cost piece of hardware that would withstand being tossed into a backpack hundreds of times. Since its launch in 2012, about 60m of the credit card-sized devices, which run the Linux operating system, have been sold and they are now used in commercial applications across a variety of industries, including for electric vehicle charging. Behind the British tech firm is an eponymous educational charity that was established in 2008 with the goal of getting children interested in computer science. The foundation provides education resources, coding clubs, programmes and competitions that have reached more than 100 countries. One of the six founders of the Raspberry Pi Foundation is Eben Upton, who is now the chief executive of Raspberry Pi. Upton, who studied physics, engineering and computer science at Cambridge before working for the US tech companies Broadcom, Intel and IBM, started developing the first single-board computer prototypes in the evenings and at weekends while working at Broadcom, inspired by the BBC Micro he had used to do his schoolwork. Broadcom provided the chip for the Pi, and some of its employees were among the volunteers working on the project in the evenings, along with some students from the computer laboratory at Cambridge University. Lang, a serial entrepreneur and business angel in Cambridge, who chaired the foundation, died last month aged 76. Upton described him as \u201ca central part of the Cambridge tech entrepreneurship scene\u201d. Lang had designed software for the BBC Micro, a computer released in 1981 by Acorn Computers in Cambridge with a simple programming language which young children could follow. It started a computing revolution, and later influenced the Raspberry Pi. Peter Lomas, another foundation founder, did the hardware design for the final version of the Raspberry Pi. He is now the engineering director at Norcott Technologies and chairs the Royal Academy of Engineering. The other founders were Alan Mycroft and Robert Mullins, both computer science professors at Cambridge University, and David Braben, who co-created the Elite series of space trading video games and went on to set up the video games company Frontier Developments. Upton has said the foundation chose to name itself after a fruit in homage to other computer manufacturers such as Apple, while Pi is a reference to the fact that the founders were originally going to produce a computer that could only run the Python programming language. The foundation is part of a group that runs the National Centre for Computing Education in England, a government-funded initiative providing support for schools and colleges in England to offer a computing education, from key stage 1 through to A-level. At first, the Pi was manufactured in China but production moved to a Sony factory in south Wales in 2012. Almost all of the manufacturing is automated, with the 300 people who work in the factory mostly monitoring and maintaining the machines. \u201cGiven how far we\u2019ve come, it\u2019s sort of funny to remember how parochial our ambitions were at the start,\u201d Upton has said. \u201cThere was a massive decline in the number of people applying to study computer science, which was sort of heartbreaking in a place like Cambridge, with its incredibly rich computing heritage. There was a feeling that if we could get a program or a piece of hardware into the hands of young people at the right point in their lives, we might be able to do something to reverse that decline.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 16 May 2024. An earlier version said that Raspberry Pi had created Scratch, the first programming language for children. In fact it was conceived at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab."

            "date": "2024-05-16T09:00:03Z",
            "content": "Profiteering is nothing new. Stanley Baldwin had a pithy description for the new intake of Conservative MPs at the 1918 general election, noting that they were \u201ca lot of hard-faced men who look as if they had done very well out of the war\u201d. The future Tory prime minister was right. Many companies had found a war economy greatly to their liking, securing lucrative government contracts and making a mint in the process. Profiteering was rampant. Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the Unite union, says something similar has been happening since the war on Covid began in 2020. A study of the reports and accounts of almost 17,000 firms \u2013 big and small \u2013 showed that pre-tax profit margins were, on average, 30% higher in 2022 than they were in the years immediately before the pandemic began. The UK\u2019s inflation rate peaked at just over 11% in 2022 and, judging by the Unite research, many companies took the opportunity to increase their prices by more than was necessary to cover rising costs, on the basis that consumers wouldn\u2019t notice that they were being gouged. Workers have fared less well. For the past few months, as the annual inflation rate has come down, real incomes have been going up because wages have been rising faster than prices. But this welcome improvement in living standards cannot make up for the deep real wage cuts earlier in the cost of living crisis and, in any event, is likely to be a brief interlude unless there are changes to the way the economy operates. As Graham notes, companies can get away with fattening their profit margins because they have the power to do so. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened in the last three years is, underneath it all, a major redistribution of wealth away from workers\u2019 wages to corporate profits.\u201d Unions think companies have too much power while they have too little, and that\u2019s one reason they took such a hard line this week with Keir Starmer over Labour\u2019s new deal for workers. The planned expansion of workers\u2019 rights promises to shift the balance of power between labour and capital modestly in favour of the former, but no more than that. After unions made clear this was a totemic issue for them, Starmer said Labour was sticking with the planned reforms. There are three counter-arguments to the points made by Unite in its profiteering report, and by the unions more generally. The first is that different profit numbers can be arrived at using different methodology, so there is nothing really to see here. The second is that corporate profits are vital, because they are the source of investment that creates the jobs of the future. The third is that handing more power to unions threatens to wreck Britain\u2019s flexible labour market and will cost jobs. The first argument would be more convincing if Unite\u2019s report was a one-off, but the same picture emerges from elsewhere in the world. In 2021, US profit margins for non-financial companies reached their highest level since the second world war. The European Central Bank\u2019s president, Christine Lagarde, said last year that companies in the eurozone were taking advantage of high inflation to plump up their profit margins. At the very least, there is a case for UK plc to answer. Nor is there any real evidence of a link between profits and investment. Rather, as a paper by the left-of-centre thinktank Common Wealth points out, the bulk of the profits are finding their way to shareholders through dividends, rather than into new capital spending. Back in the 1970s, when unions had considerably more power than they enjoy today, private non-financial corporations paid out 20p in dividend payments for every \u00a31 of gross fixed-capital formation. In the second half of the 2010s, this figure was 95p. Payouts to shareholders rose two and a half times faster than total employee compensation between 1988 and 2019. Meanwhile, business investment over that period has been consistently lower than the average for leading industrial nations. The original justification for putting restrictions on unions and boosting corporate power was that it would boost growth by stimulating entrepreneurship and create more, better-paid jobs. In practice, a lack of union protection left workers wide open for exploitation. Companies were always able to find people to work for low wages, particularly once they found they could tap into global pools of migrant workers. Real wages \u2013 even after the recent small increase \u2013 have flatlined since the time of the global financial crisis in 2008. So the idea that Britain\u2019s flexible labour market represents some sort of gold standard for international best practice is a nonsense. The fact that labour is so cheap discourages firms from investing in new kit and in developing the skills of their workers so that they are truly flexible rather than \u2013 as they all too often are \u2013 easily dispensable. Graham\u2019s assessment is that life is sweet for those at the top but tough for workers, and it is hard to disagree with her. The UK has a poor record for investment, a poor record for productivity, a poor record for real wage growth and, since the pandemic, a poor record for employment. Britain\u2019s workforce is 900,000 smaller than it was before the pandemic, in part due to inactivity caused by long-term sickness and ill health. The \u201cflexibility\u201d model is based on fear, insecurity and poverty pay, and it has failed. After 40 years, it is time to try something different.

But this time round, as the eastern Indian state of Odisha goes to the polls in simultaneous general and assembly elections, the former migrant worker will make a crucial shift in the way she votes. In patriarchal rural India, who the family vote for is usually decided by the men. On 13 May, however, Sabar and other women in Padampur village will for the first time vote for a candidate of their choice \u2013 a shift that is influencing the way state and national politicians speak to women in their manifestos. Padampur, in the drought-stricken Kalahandi district of western Odisha, is one of India\u2019s most impoverished villages, whose people have for decades been compelled to migrate to make a living. Today, the men still leave, but the women, who have discovered financial independence in Odisha\u2019s successful self-help group (SHG) movement, which offers them loans and benefits from state schemes, now stay put. This newfound independence is changing what men and women want from politicians. Padampur\u2019s men have their hopes pinned on broad-based changes such as more jobs and better incomes, which they believe only a national party can deliver. However the women, bolstered by the income available to them through loans and self-help schemes, support the state government, run by a regional party. The government\u2019s Economic Survey 2022-23 mentions that India\u2019s female-led SHGs were emerging as the world\u2019s biggest microfinance project. According to the survey, the SHG-Bank Linkage Programme, which helps poorer Indians access microfinance through self-help groups and banks, covers 142 million families with saving deposits of Rs 470bn (\u00a34.5bn). SHGs were introduced nationally in 1984, but the establishment of a department for the scheme in Odisha in 2020 has resulted in more womenaccessing benefits. The money has emboldened women. \u201cEarlier, voting was a family decision but now I want to decide for myself. I am not just tending to my family but also contributing financially,\u201d says Sabar, as she moulds bricks in the small kiln in her back yard. The bricks will go into building the family a new home to replace their present thatch-and-bamboo one. \u201cFor how long are we expected to wait for a pucca (\u2018solid\u2019) house?\u201d demands Sabar, referring to a project of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) to build brick-and-concrete houses for poor rural households. \u201cWe waited for a long time but no more. Now we will start constructing our own homes with the interest-free loan of Rs 10,000 that I took through the state government\u2019s SHG scheme.\u201d Padampur has a long history of migration, with whole families leaving to work at brick kilns and becoming entrapped as bonded labourers. Sabar and her husband were rescued from bondage in 2017 from a brick kiln in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Back home, the couple were unsure of their future. \u201cWe have a small plot of land where we grow paddy [rice],\u201d says Sabar. \u201cMost of it is consumed at home, with little left to sell.\u201d While her husband continued to travel in search of work, Sabar joined a women\u2019s SHG in 2020, a turning point in her life. \u201cThrough the group, I could take small loans for emergencies,\u201d she says. \u201cDuring my pregnancy, I availed of benefits under the state government\u2019s Mamata scheme. I had no such security while working elsewhere.\u201d Sabar says she will vote for a party that has already delivered such benefits, not one that merely promises them. Hemandri Gahir, who lives with her four children and parents-in-law in Kalahandi\u2019s Funda village, echoes Sabar\u2019s sentiments. While her husband\u2019s job at a solar plant in Gujarat is their main income, Gahir, a farm worker, secured a loan last year through an SHG and has invested in goats and ducks. \u201cIn the face of our hardship, I will only vote for a party that ensures something for me,\u201d she says. \u201cThe state party has made sure that I can do something on my own, independently.\u201d Experts say this gender split in voting is becoming apparent across the state\u2019s remote villages and is shaping political agendas. Tara Krishnaswamy, coordinator of the non-partisan collective Political Shakti, says: \u201cMany regional parties, including those in Odisha, have progressed from thinking about women\u2019s needs only in terms of cooking gas and maternity to focusing on their higher education, entrepreneurship and microloans through SHGs. \u201cWomen tend to vote based on what is already delivered, not just the promises in the manifesto.\u201d Migrant workers are a large part of the electoral base in the state; Odisha has at least 850,000 workers who leave for jobs from 10 districts. Traditional migration from Ganjam and other southern Odisha districts is considered aspirational, but in western Odisha, including Kalahandi, people migrate because of poverty or a degraded environment. Most of these migrants work at brick kilns for 10 months of the year. Despite government initiatives to regulate migration and ensure workers\u2019 welfare, there continues to be a big discrepancy between registered and non registered migrants. But while the manifestos of the three parties in Odisha \u2013 the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), the BJP and the Congress \u2013 address female voters, promising to strengthen SHGs, boost social security for widows and destitute women, and create female squads to improve rural women\u2019s safety, they are silent on the subject of migration. Migrant workers also say that politicians have made little effort to encourage them to vote. Across the villages in the migration-prone areas of Kalahandi and Balangir, people who were back for the annual Chaitra Parva, or harvest festival in April asserted that no political party had asked them to remain or return to vote. Many are unlikely to stay home to cast their vote. \u201cI am a second-generation migrant from my family,\u201d says Sashi Gamang from Kalahandi\u2019s Sindhipadar village. \u201cWill whichever party I vote for ensure that I get a job here? I cannot put a month\u2019s pay at stake. I haven\u2019t decided yet, but I will most probably return to work.\u201d Dilip Das, chairman of Antodaya, a Kalahandi organisation working on labour issues, says it is unlikely that workers from western Odisha, often in debt bondage, would come back to vote. \u201cAlthough migration has only increased over the years, politically, it is not an issue,\u201d he says. \u201cHad it been one, there would have been policies in place to help these families.\u201d Meanwhile, Parakhit Sabar, Basanti\u2019s husband, says he will continue to travel to find work. \u201cNo one likes leaving their family behind and travelling to distant places for work but what option do I have?\u201d he asks. \u201cThis is the second election since we were rescued [from debt bondage]. Repeated promises have been made but nothing happens. I want to vote for a bigger national party in the hope that it will do something for us.\u201d His wife is voting for a regional party, he says: \u201cI would never want to influence her. It is entirely her choice.\u201d \u2022 This article was first published by the Migration Story, India\u2019s first newsroom to focus on the country\u2019s vast internal migrant population"

            "title": "\u2018Happiest I\u2019ve ever seen her\u2019: the sports teams giving trans kids a safe place to play",
            "date": "2024-05-29T16:09:15Z",
            "content": "Like many seven-year-olds, Gregory\u2019s daughter discovered her love for soccer on the playground at recess. She started coming home talking about the sport and asked to join her friends\u2019 recreational team. Gregory, an attorney in Portland, Oregon, whose name we\u2019ve changed to protect his family\u2019s safety and privacy, signed her up. But his daughter ended up getting assigned to a different team than the one her friends were on. Gregory was concerned about his daughter not being on a team with a coach and players she knew \u2013 she\u2019s transgender and he wanted her to be in a supportive environment. Gregory\u2019s wife called the league\u2019s coordinator to see if they could get their daughter on the original team and to explain the reasoning for their request, but he said she shouldn\u2019t be playing on a girls\u2019 team if she\u2019s trans. \u201cWe were told that she would have to play on a boys\u2019 team if she wanted to play in games,\u201d Gregory said. He immediately withdrew his daughter from the league. Later, they found out that the league\u2019s official policy for transgender athletes was to allow them to register for a team that matches their gender identity, but it was too late. Gregory had already been nervous about signing up his daughter for soccer and didn\u2019t plan on continuing with a league that might be unsupportive in practice. \u201cSports has become such a flashpoint for bias,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost every new environment is scary and nervous for us as parents and sports was definitely one of those.\u201d Within days, however, Gregory and his family discovered Portland Community Football Club (PCFC), an organization where his daughter could play on a mixed-gender team, and even wear a Pride flag on her official jersey. \u201cDuring her first soccer game she couldn\u2019t even really run normally because she was squealing and skipping with joy down the field. It\u2019s the happiest I\u2019ve ever seen her.\u201d Currently, 23 states have laws barring transgender student athletes from participating in some sports in the name of competitive fairness. In response, advocates for sports equity often point to research that shows that there are no sex advantages in prepubescent children when it comes to sport, and that there\u2019s a need for far more data on possible advantages or disadvantages after a person undergoes hormone therapy and other gender-affirming care. These discriminatory laws have often led to lower sports participation rates among young transgender athletes. And in states where laws don\u2019t exist, harassment and intimidation of trans kids, or those suspected of being transgender, have become more commonplace. The combination of legal and rhetorical antagonism against young transgender athletes has made it more difficult for them to take part in sports, even while they make up a minority of youth athletes \u2013 only 1.4% of youth aged 13 to 17 in the United States identify as transgender. But across the country, parents of transgender and non-binary children are relying on small, inclusive sports clubs to give their children access to the games that many parents consider an important and fun part of childhood. These groups provide a supportive and low-stakes environment for LGBTQ+ children and families to explore sports amid growing antagonism toward transgender inclusion in athletics. \u2018A public health imperative\u2019 Kaig Lightner had been professionally coaching youth soccer for more than a decade when he decided to develop a soccer club that was truly accessible. He sought to include players from the city\u2019s most racially diverse and under-resourced neighborhoods, kids who were often excluded from the pay-to-play clubs that catered to the wealthy. In 2013, he founded PCFC as a league that charged minimal enrollment fees, provided free uniforms, and encouraged low-income, immigrant and refugee youths to join their teams. PCFC\u2019s teams, which serve players from ages six to 18, are also all gender-inclusive. Lightner, a 44-year-old transgender man, noticed that organizing teams based on skill level instead of by sex or gender was a way to attract gender diverse young people. As a child, he found sports to be both a comfort and a reminder of the binary world he didn\u2019t feel a part of, so he said it was incredibly important for PCFC to have an open acceptance policy for all players in the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cWhen looking at this particular way of structuring sports, the kids themselves let go of the binary ideas of how girls play and how boys play,\u201d Lightner said. \u201cI\u2019ve had boys say to me, \u2018I thought girls couldn\u2019t play soccer, until I started playing here.\u201d Though he\u2019s not against having all-girls teams, or all-boys teams in the future, Lightner said the club will never get rid of gender-inclusive teams for those who prefer it. The gender-inclusive structure and the level of acceptance that Gregory has seen from PCFC in one season has allowed his daughter space to be herself and explore a sport she\u2019s interested in like any kid would. \u201cWhen we signed her up, nobody batted an eye. It felt normal. And on the field, she\u2019s just a kid who gets to be on a soccer team, who gets to play soccer with other kids.\u201d While this might not sound revolutionary, sports can be life-saving \u2013 especially for marginalized young people \u2013 because it can actually change your brain, said Megan Bartlett, the founder of the Center for Healing and Justice Through Sport. Her program offers diversity, equity and inclusion training for coaches and sports administrators. \u201cWhen sports puts together these positive relationships that help make us feel safe and practice being stressed but being able to deal with that stress, you\u2019re truly building resilience in the biological definition of resilience,\u201d Bartlett said. \u201cIn this country \u2026 making sports more accessible to these groups is a public health imperative.\u201d Boosted confidence, new friends, encouraging mentors As political attacks on transgender youth playing sports across the country increased in recent years, Xavi Valdez, a soccer coach in San Diego, California, started to feel a responsibility to create a new kind of sports space. \u201cThat started weighing heavily on me,\u201d Valdez said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine someone telling me I wasn\u2019t allowed to play because of who I was.\u201d The soccer field had always been where Valdez felt she could be her full self, especially growing up as a closeted queer woman of color in El Paso, Texas, during the 1990s. \u201cI was a teenager when Ellen [DeGeneres] came out, and at the time of Matthew Shepard[\u2019s murder],\u201d she said. \u201cIt was scary.\u201d But on the soccer field, Valdez said, life was different. \u201cI got to be as big and loud as I wanted to be. I couldn\u2019t come out, but I got to be free.\u201d As a coach, she has always been passionate about giving more kids the opportunity to see the soccer field as she experienced it: a place that boosted confidence, skills and brought her friendships and mentors. For years that meant focusing on coaching girls\u2019 soccer, a vastly under-resourced side of the game. Valdez\u2019s soccer program, Lambda Rising, launched in March 2021. There were about 40 kids participating, mostly the children of the queer parents she knew and their friends\u2019 kids. Like Lightner in Portland, she didn\u2019t separate the kids by gender in order to play. She also hired coaches who were part of the LGBTQ+ community, and instead of asking for kids\u2019 sex or gender when signing up, Valdez asked simply for pronouns. That level of openness helped convince Cloe, a queer therapist and former competitive soccer player, to sign up her child, Taylor, for Lambda Rising. (We\u2019ve changed their names to protect the family\u2019s safety and privacy.) Shortly after starting to play with Lambda Rising in 2021, Taylor, who is nine, felt more confident in their own identity as non-binary. \u201cI just want my kid to be able to be a kid,\u201d Cloe said. \u201cA lot of it is just about them being able to just be themselves. I\u2019ve never thought twice when going on to that field on a Sunday about our safety or whether or not somebody\u2019s going to say something. I think the sports world would be a lot better off if we just figured out how to let people just play and just be athletes.\u201d Since its founding, Lambda Rising has served about 200 young athletes. Valdez estimates that about 20 of them have identified as transgender or non-binary. As of now she organizes training camps and scrimmages, and some after school programs, but she\u2019d like to grow an entire league of more competitive teams, so these mixed-gender teams can compete against one another instead of trying to fit into the gender-divided leagues that exist. \u2018We\u2019re here for kids to have fun\u2019 Traditional, binary sports leagues can feel especially fraught for young people in the midst of exploring their own identities. So when Jacob Toups and Luis Vasquez founded Rainbow Labs, an after-school program for high-school aged LGBTQ+ youth in Los Angeles, California, they wanted to make sure they offered relaxed opportunities to hang out and participate in different \u201clabs\u201d, from sports to arts and entrepreneurship. \u201cI always tell our partners, maybe we\u2019ll find another LeBron James, but the truth is we\u2019re not here for that. We\u2019re here for kids to have fun,\u201d said Vasquez. And they\u2019ve seen the difference their programs make, whether it\u2019s just kids trying out sports and not being made fun of, or making other LGBTQ+ friends. In a survey of the youth participating in their programs, 85% of whom are kids of color, six out of 10 self-identified as trans or non-binary. Anyone who has experienced the intensity of youth sports will recognize that overhauling the system entirely is unlikely to happen anytime soon. And while co-ed or gender-neutral programs are one way to be more inclusive, this doesn\u2019t mean that all sports need to go that direction to provide access to LGBTQ+ youth. Some are simply adapting. For instance, when Ana Avilez, a community development specialist in San Francisco, went to find a soccer program last year for her then second grader, who had just come out to her as transgender, she worried it would be difficult. But she was surprised that she ended up doing more advocating with her son\u2019s school for acceptance than with the soccer leagues she contacted. In fact, the league her son ended up joining said they had worked with other trans youth and were happy to put him on a boys\u2019 team. Last summer, her son got the chance to participate in a game over Pride Weekend that was made up entirely of transgender young people. \u201cHe was a little nervous at first, but seeing the acceptance of everyone there made him feel comfortable,\u201d Avilez said. Avilez just wants her son to grow up without being ashamed of who he is, and she knows that\u2019s something that playing soccer, on a team that supports him, can give him in the long run."

            "date": "2024-05-14T09:26:59Z",
            "content": "Vodafone has said its turnaround plan is starting to show results as Germany, its largest business, returned to growth last year after the sale of its Italian and Spanish operations. The telecoms company has been undergoing a transformation programme under its chief executive, Margherita Della Valle, who has sought to simplify the group and taken action in three underperforming markets where Vodafone\u2019s returns were below the cost of capital. Vodafone sold off its Spanish division for \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.3bn) as well as announcing an \u20ac8bn sale of its operations in Italy and a proposed merger with CK Hutchison\u2019s Three in the UK which is being considered by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the anti-trust regulator. The telecoms company reported a 74% fall in operating profits for the year ended 31 March 2024 to \u20ac3.7bn against \u20ac14.4bn because results in the previous year were bolstered by exceptional gains including an \u20ac8.6bn gain on the sale of its Vantage Towers business as well as sales of Vodafone Hungary and Vodafone Ghana. Vodafone is pressing ahead with cost-cutting measures. It has shed 5,000 roles and is cutting a further 2,000 as part of a \u20ac1bn cost reduction target; its aim is to axe up to 11,000 jobs by 2026. Della Valle said that underlying performance in Germany was expected to improve so that by 2026 the country \u201cwill come back to being an important growth engine for the group\u201d. She added that Vodafone was holding \u201cdeep conversations\u201d with the CMA in the UK as the regulators examine the Three deal. The CMA has warned mobile customers could face higher prices and reduced quality as a result of the potential merger. Della Valle said: \u201cMuch more still needs to be done in the year ahead. We will step up investment in our customer experience, improve our underlying performance in Germany and accelerate our momentum in business, while also continuing to simplify our operations.\u201d Vodafone has already said it will rebase its dividend and plans share buy-backs over two years, with \u20ac2bn from the proceeds of the Spanish business in 2025 and a further \u20ac2bn proceeds from the Italian arm in 2026. The telecoms group faces questions about the 14.6 % stake held by its largest investor Emirates Telecommunications, which the UK government has identified as a national security risk. Ministers have ordered a national security committee to be set up at Vodafone to help oversee sensitive work. However a recent report authored by three barristers including Sir Robert Buckland KC, a former lord chancellor, concluded that the UAE\u2019s stake in Vodafone raised serious concerns given UAE\u2019s intelligence gathering apparatus and poor human rights record. The barrister Ben Keith, who co-authored the report, has urged that the planned national security committee should be independent of Vodafone and include national security experts. There should also be enhanced data security and audits and also Vodafone should collaborate with human rights organisations and conduct regular assessments, the barristers suggested. Vodafone said of the report: \u201cVodafone has extensive data security and privacy measures in place. Sensitive customer data is not visible to anyone \u2013 including the group CEO \u2013 outside our specific, security-vetted customer teams. Vodafone has a long-established human rights policy, which is developed in line with international standards as well as industry-specific principles.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-26T23:01:06Z",
            "content": "Rural areas have trumped towns and cities in house price growth over the past five years, with a semi in the countryside the top-performing property type, according to data for Great Britain. The figures, issued by the mortgage lender Nationwide, showed that average house prices in predominantly rural areas rose by 22% over the period, compared with 17% in predominantly urban areas. Urban flats had typically been the weakest performers over the past five years, it said. The data captures some of the impact of the \u201crace for space\u201d sparked by the pandemic, which led to a surge in the numbers of people looking to move out of cities to rural areas, smaller towns or the coast \u2013 typically somewhere with a bigger garden, closer to open spaces, or offering more room for working from home. However, research has suggested that some of those movers subsequently sold up and moved back to the suburbs or city. Some of the top-performing rural areas include tourist hotspots such as parts of Devon and the Lake District, which suggests some of the demand may be being driven by those buying holiday and second homes, said Nationwide. Andrew Harvey, the building society\u2019s senior economist, said its analysis suggested that average house price growth in local authority areas classified as predominantly rural \u201chas continued to outpace those of other areas\u201d. Of the 349 local authorities in Great Britain, the majority (61%) are classified as predominantly urban, and just over a quarter (26%) as predominantly rural. The researchers found that rural semi-detached homes had seen the strongest price growth over the five-year period, with average values increasing by 24%. Rural terraced homes typically increased by 23% over the same period, as did urban semis, while rural detached properties were close behind at 22%. Nationwide said flats had seen \u201cconsiderably weaker\u201d growth, and this applied particularly in predominantly urban areas, where prices typically increased by 5%. The figures were based on an analysis of official UK house price data produced by HM Land Registry and others, and covers the period from December 2018 to December 2023. Earlier this year, the government unveiled new rules for short-term holiday lets in England that aimed to rein in a sector that has been described by some as \u201cout of control\u201d. \u2022 The caption to the picture was amended on 27 May 2024 because an earlier version placed Burford in Gloucestershire. It is in the neighbouring county of Oxfordshire, about two miles from the boundary."

            "date": "2024-05-22T11:48:28Z",
            "content": "The boss of Marks &amp; Spencer says he is hopeful of a \u201cgrowth story for years to come\u201d after the revitalised retailer won over 1 million more shoppers to boost profits by 41%. Stuart Machin, the chief executive, said it was \u201cthe beginnings of a new M&amp;S\u201d and there was \u201cwind in our sails and confidence that our plan is working\u201d as pre-tax profits rose to \u00a3672.5m in the year to 30 March. Sales rose 9.4% to \u00a313bn on the back of an 11.3% rise in grocery sales at established stores. The increase was not just a result of inflation, with the volume of goods sold up 5% after the group invested \u00a360m in keeping prices down. Machin said the retailer, which has 240 full-line stores and 325 food outlets, was winning over a \u201cbroad church\u201d of new customers. More under-30s are buying its lingerie than ever before, taking its market share in that product category to a new high of 38%. Shares in the group rose nearly 6% on Wednesday morning as it announced its first dividend payment to shareholders since 2019, and Machin said M&amp;S was in \u201cthe best financial health it\u2019s been in decades\u201d with debts reduced. He said the company was now aiming for \u00a3100m in extra cost cuts by 2028 as it improves efficiency by, for example, working with fewer clothing suppliers and sharpening up the way goods are delivered so that less work is required behind the scenes. The leap in profits came after \u00a3180m of cost cuts, including keeping the number of staff steady in food stores despite higher sales and lowering the cost of delivering food to stores after buying its distribution partner Gist. It has also ditched selling furniture that requires two-person delivery. M&amp;S said it was bolstering its five-year plan for cost cuts to \u00a3500m by 2028 with increases in staff pay offset by \u201cstructural cost reductions and other efficiencies\u201d \u2013 which the company says relates to more efficient deliveries to free up staff to work with customers, rather than job cuts. Other cost inflation is largely expected be offset by reduced energy costs. Machin said M&amp;S had increased its market share in clothing and homewares and was \u201cconfident we will make further progress\u201d, in a bullish prediction for the year ahead. The upmarket grocer said it had benefited from a shift towards eating at home rather than at restaurants, with sales of its \u201cdine in\u201d offer up by more than 40%, while shoppers also spent 34% more on its lowest price Remarksable Value range. Clothing and home sales increased 5.3%, helped by a 15% rise in sales of holiday wear such as swimsuits, while sales of its more expensive Autograph range for men rose 15%. Machin said M&amp;S had tried to keep clothing prices steady and would do so again in the year ahead after sales of basics including denim and knitwear rose by more than 10%. He said the group did not plan to introduce special discounts for its Sparks loyalty card holders, as done by major chains including Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s, as the group \u201cdidn\u2019t want to get into tricksy prices\u201d. He said short-term price cuts were \u201cforcing you to buy something you don\u2019t really want\u201d. M&amp;S\u2019s share of losses at Ocado Retail, its online grocery shopping joint venture, widened to \u00a337.3m, from \u00a329.5m, and M&amp;S reiterated that it did not expect to have to pay a final instalment for its share in the business, which was once expected to be \u00a3191m. Sales at M&amp;S\u2019s international stores slid by 1% at constant currency rates to \u00a3719m and Machin said it was now \u201cresetting priorities\u201d to step up progress. Clive Black, a retail analyst at M&amp;S\u2019s broker Shore Capital, said the retailer had \u201cmaterially beaten market expectations\u201d and he had upgraded his expectations for the year ahead by about 12%. The group plans to open nine new food stores in the year ahead, up from eight last year, and up to four full-line clothing and home stores, down from six last year, when it also closed seven and relocated five stores."

            "date": "2024-05-19T11:19:44Z",
            "content": "The global economy is fragmenting and a new era of protectionism has dawned. Dreams by free marketeers of a frictionless world in which goods and services moved seamlessly from country to country are dead. That was the clear message from Joe Biden\u2019s decision last week to target China with a range of new, much higher tariffs on electric vehicles and a range of other products crucial to sectors seen by the White House as vital to the future health of the US economy and to national security. It was also the message from Vladimir Putin\u2019s visit to Beijing, where he received a show of support from Xi Jinping for Russia\u2019s military action against Ukraine, which has intensified in recent weeks. There is a new cold war and it is hotting up. In themselves, Biden\u2019s new tariffs won\u2019t have much economic impact, because China exports very little steel and aluminium, and few EVs, silicon chips and solar panels to the US anyway. But as the consultancy Capital Economics has pointed out, that\u2019s because of previously announced measures introduced by Donald Trump and the fear that protectionism will be ratcheted up in the future. Republicans and Democrats both support a hawkish approach to China. The trade tension is unlikely to ease soon. Biden has made support for the green technology sector central to his plan to rebuild the US manufacturing base. The president is not prepared to see his industrial strategy undermined by a flood of cheap, and heavily subsidised, Chinese imports. Tougher protectionist measures from the US come amid signs that Beijing has abandoned, at least for now,attempts to rebalance its growth model away from exports and towards domestic consumption. China remains a high-saving, high-investment, low-consumption economy and that inevitably means that the surplus goods churned out by its factories find their way into global markets. As China\u2019s trade surplus grows ever bigger, protectionist sentiment in the US will become more pronounced. This is not quite what the US and its developed-country allies envisaged when China was admitted into the World Trade Organization in 2001. Back then the feeling was that if China could make manufactured goods more cheaply than domestic producers, then that meant higher profits for western multinationals and lower prices for western consumers. There are far fewer advocates for this pure free-trade approach in Washington and Brussels today, even though the availability of cheap Chinese EVs in the US and Europe would help meet net zero goals. In the short term, the focus will be on whether China will retaliate to Biden\u2019s tariffs with protectionist measures of its own. Beijing has thus far seemed unwilling to get involved in a tit-for-tat trade war, but will be forced to do so if Trump wins the presidency in November and makes good on his pledge to slap a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods. For now, a full-blown trade war looks unlikely but it can\u2019t be ruled out. Seen from one perspective, Washington\u2019s attempts to protect its green technology sector can be seen as evidence that the US is fighting an economic war with China that it is doomed to lose. China is growing at double the rate of the US, runs a thumping trade surplus and has cornered the market in solar panels and other green-tech products. This, though, ignores some deep structural weaknesses in the Chinese economy, not least a worrying demographic trend that will see its working-age population shrink from one billion to 400 million by the end of the century. Erik Britton, the managing director of the Fathom Consultancy, says it has been apparent for at least a decade that China\u2019s growth rate is slowing and the period of rapid catch-up with the US is over, at least for now. There is, as Britton points out, a strong correlation between economic freedom and living standards as measured by gross domestic product per head of population. Most of the countries with per-capita incomes of more than 50% of US levels are democracies, with oil producers being the exception. China is seeking to become a high per-capita income country while remaining a totalitarian state. That\u2019s not all. If there is further fracturing of the global economy into rival blocs then China is in a weaker position than the US. A US-led bloc is likely to be composed of many more \u2013 and richer \u2013 countries than a China-led bloc, despite attempts by Beijing to extend its influence overseas through the belt and road initiative. The thinking behind the tough stance being adopted by the US goes as follows. First, it was a mistake to assume that China would become more liberal once it was plugged into the global economy. Second, allowing China\u2019s rapid industrial growth has hollowed out manufacturing in the US. Third, China\u2019s model does not lend itself to free thinking and innovation, but instead relies on intellectual property being imported, often through unfair means, from the west. Fourth, it makes sense to make it as hard as possible for China to acquire this knowhow. Fifth, China\u2019s aggressive use of industrial policy needs to be matched by the US. If that all means the US becoming more interventionist and more protectionist, then so be it. In these circumstances, interventionism is justified and protectionism is good. Biden thinks parts of the US economy are too strategically important to allow them to fall into Chinese hands and he is right about that. He also thinks the US needs to build up its own industrial strength and he is right about that too. Other countries are watching closely, as well they might. There are clear lessons here for other western countries, including \u2013 and most especially \u2013 the UK."

            "date": "2024-05-31T11:46:44Z",
            "content": "UK house prices returned to growth in May amid signs of market \u201cresilience\u201d after two months of falls, according to a building society. The average property price in Britain rose 0.4% month on month to \u00a3264,249, after a similar-sized fall of 0.4% in April, Nationwide said. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cThe market appears to be showing signs of resilience in the face of ongoing affordability pressures following the rise in longer-term interest rates in recent months.\u201d The annual rate of growth more than doubled to 1.3% in May, from 0.6% in April. It comes after slight increases in mortgage rates since the start of the year slowed the housing market through March and April. According to Moneyfacts, at the end of January the average two-year fixed-rate mortgage cost 5.56%, rising to 5.92% by the end of May. Monthly data released on Friday by the Bank of England showed that activity in the housing market held steady in April, with 61,100 new mortgages approved by lenders, a figure little changed from the March tally. However, the number of people who remortgaged decreased from 33,500 to 29,900 over the same period, it said. The Bank data showed that mortgage borrowing rose in April by a net \u00a32.4bn, compared with a net increase of \u00a3500m in March. The April figure was 0.2% higher than a year before, in the first positive reading since October 2022. The \u201ceffective\u201d interest rate \u2013 the rate actually paid on newly drawn mortgages \u2013 was only marginally higher in April than it had been in March, at 4.74%, according to the data. Experts think the Bank is likely to cut interest rates in August or September on the back of cooling inflation. The headline rate eased to 2.3% in the 12 months to April 2024, down from 3.2% in the 12 months to March. Gardner added: \u201cConsumer confidence has improved noticeably over the last few months, supported by solid wage gains and lower inflation.\u201d This week a separate index, by the property website Zoopla, showed that Britain\u2019s supply of homes for sale was at its highest point in eight years, in a trend that experts said would limit house price rises for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, Nationwide research suggested the general election was unlikely to have a significant impact on house prices. Previous polls have not affected underlying market trends, the research showed, as buyers sought to continue with sales regardless of events in Westminster. Andrew Wishart, an analyst at the consultancy Capital Economics, said that despite the small headline increase recorded by the Nationwide index, the \u201cbig picture\u201d was that mortgage rates creeping higher in recent months had caused house prices to \u201cstagnate\u201d. \u201cTaking a step back, house prices have been flat for a year and a half, with the slight increase in May leaving them in line with their January 2023 level,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2024-05-16T01:45:47Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s jobless rate rose more than expected last month as more people looked for work, easing risks of another Reserve Bank rate hike. The unemployment rate in April was 4.1%, seasonally adjusted, compared with a revised 3.9% for March, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. Economists had predicted the jobless rate would edge higher for a third consecutive month to 3.9%. The economy added a net 38,500 positions with full-time roles down 6,100 while part-time positions rose 44,600. Economists had forecast employers would add 23,700 jobs in April. The participation rate \u2013 a measure of those looking for work \u2013 ticked higher to 66.7% last month. Economists had expected it would hold steady at 66.6%. Hours worked, meanwhile, were little changed for the month. The labour market can be volatile, such as February\u2019s shock 116,500 jobs increase. The federal government\u2019s budget this week predicted the unemployment rate would be 4.25% by June and 4.5% a year later. The RBA, which sets its cash rate according to its own forecasts for employment and inflation, earlier this month predicted the jobless rate would be 4% by June, then 4.2% by year\u2019s end and 4.3% in June 2025. The government has forecast inflation would be back to the RBA\u2019s target 2-3% band by December, a result that would increase the chances of a cut in interest rates and eliminate the risk of a 14th rate increase in this cycle. The jobless rate was also 4.1% in January. Before then the last time the unemployment figure was this high was in January 2022. Investors said the labour data suggested another rate rise was less likely \u2013 with the dollar easing a tenth of a US cent to about 66.9 US cents. The stock market, where lower interest rates boost many firms\u2019 profits, had a more notable uptick. Already up about 1.4% for the day, the benchmark ASX200 share index increased its advance to about 1.7%. Bjorn Jarvis, ABS\u2019s head of labour statistics, said the economy needed to add about 30,000 jobs a month to keep the jobless rate steady given population increases. \u201cThe employment-to-population ratio remained steady at 64% in April, indicating that recent employment growth is broadly keeping pace with population growth,\u201d Jarvis said. \u201cThis suggests that the labour market remains tight, though less tight than late 2022 and early 2023.\u201d The timing of Easter \u2013 falling entirely within April \u2013 could also factor in the results. \u201cIn contrast to what we saw last year, when fewer people than usual took time off around the Easter holidays in April 2023, the proportion of people working reduced hours in April 2024 was more similar to what we saw before the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d Jarvis said. All states and territories posted a rise in the unemployment rate except Queensland, which remained steady at 4.1%. NSW\u2019s rate was up to 4% from 3.8%, Victoria rose to 4.2% from 4.1% and Western Australia jumped to 3.9% from 3.4%. The ACT, which had the lowest jobless rate at 2.9% in March, saw its figure pick up to 3.8%, still the lowest in the nation."

            "date": "2024-05-20T13:20:42Z",
            "content": "UK interest rates could be cut this summer, the Bank of England\u2019s outgoing deputy governor said on Monday, adding to the expectation that a first reduction in borrowing costs could come as soon as next month. Ben Broadbent, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor for monetary policy, said that if the economy evolves as expected, borrowing costs could possibly be lowered \u201csome time over the summer\u201d in response to a steep fall in inflation. Broadbent said the main drivers of inflation over the past two years \u2013 the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war \u2013 had faded and the Bank was watching to check whether the longer-term domestic effects on prices would also decline before making a first cut in interest rates. He said the monetary policy committee\u2019s (MPC) nine members must assess how those \u201csecond-round effects\u201d in domestic prices and wages change the course of inflation over the next two years. Analysts have diverged over the likelihood of a rebound in inflation later in the year, possibly forcing the Bank to pause its plans for rate cuts. The consultancy Capital Economics has forecast that inflation will fall below the central bank\u2019s 2% target when figures for April are published on Wednesday and tumble to less than 1% before the end of the year. \u201cThis underpins our forecast that the Bank will cut interest rates from 5.25% now to 3% next year, rather than to 3.75% as investors expect,\u201d the consultancy said. Other analysts expect inflation to bounce back above 3% before the end of the year as persistently high services inflation and wage increases in the financial and business services industry remain high, feeding into higher prices. Broadbent said: \u201cThere is a range of views across the committee on this point. In view of the rarity of events like this over the past, and the associated uncertainty about the future, that\u2019s entirely understandable. \u201cWhatever the priors of its individual members the MPC will continue to learn from the incoming data and, if things continue to evolve with its forecasts \u2013 forecasts that suggest policy will have to become less restrictive at some point \u2013 then it\u2019s possible Bank rate could be cut sometime over the summer.\u201d Earlier this month the MPC voted 7-2 to leave interest rates unchanged at their current 16-year high of 5.25%, with Broadbent one of seven members who opted for no change. The money markets currently indicate that there is a 57% chance that rates will be lowered to 5% at the Bank\u2019s next meeting in June, while a cut by August is almost fully priced in. Michael Saunders, a former member of the MPC who left in 2022, said the Bank was likely to start cutting rates in the summer, and sooner than the US Federal Reserve. Saunders, who is now a senior economic adviser at Oxford Economics, said: \u201cWe expect the BoE\u2019s monetary policy committee will cut rates soon, with a narrowly balanced choice between June and August for the first cut and rates falling by 75bps (basis points) by year end. This is a little earlier than our forecast for US easing, with a first cut expected in September and rates coming down by 50bps by year end.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-07T06:41:16Z",
            "content": "Borrowers have been spared a 14th interest rate rise and further increases are not certain as the Reserve Bank of Australia avoids a \u201ctightening bias\u201d even as inflation retreated slower than previously expected. The RBA left its cash rate on hold at 4.35% for a fourth consecutive meeting on Tuesday in a result that was widely expected. Only one economist, Capital Economics, predicted the central bank would lift the cash rate. Governor Michele Bullock later told a press conference in Sydney that the RBA had maintained its neutral status although it did consider the case for a rate rise at this week\u2019s meeting. \u201cBack in the last meeting, we thought that things were reasonably balanced,\u201d Bullock said. \u201cI think we still think they\u2019re reasonably balanced with perhaps a little bit of a signal that we need to be very watchful on the upside.\u201d The RBA statement left its key words basically unchanged, while the bank remained \u201cvigilant to upside risks\u201d to inflation. \u201cRecent information indicates that inflation continues to moderate, but is declining more slowly than expected,\u201d it said. The absence of more hawkish wording sent the Australian dollar down to 66.1 US cents from about 66.3 US cents prior to the statement. It extended the falls as Bullock spoke to drop below 65.9 US cents. Stocks added to their gains, ending the day more than 1.4% higher compared with 0.8% just before the rates verdict. Prior to last month\u2019s release of higher than expected inflation figures for the March quarter, most economists and investors had been forecasting the RBA to cut rates from as soon as September. That surprise, including core inflation running at an annual pace of 4%, prompted some to predict the RBA would resort to at least one more rate rise to ensure inflation returned to the bank\u2019s 2%-3% target range by the end of 2025. Australia was relatively slow to start hiking interest rates and they remain lower than most comparable economies even though inflation is higher. In the US, for instance, the key interest rate is 5.25%-5.5% and inflation is 3.5%; in the UK the interest rate is 5.25% and inflation is at 3.2%. But the RBA can arguably afford to be more patient because Australians are relatively exposed to variable interest rates and are being squeezed by the fastest ramping of borrowing costs in three decades. Australia\u2019s central bank also has a dual mandate to try to maintain full employment as well as battling inflation. The RBA also released its quarterly statement on monetary policy, providing its updated forecasts underpinning its assessment of the economy. The RBA lowered its GDP growth target for Australia, a move that would help nullify some near-term uptick in inflation, according to its statement on monetary policy, a report accompanying today\u2019s rates verdict. The central bank noted that market expectations anticipate no cut in interest rates soon \u2013 a lag seen in many similar economies. The central bank estimates the cash rate will be 4.4% by December, up from 3.9% in its forecast three months ago. That assessment assumes the cash rate moves \u201cbroadly in line\u201d with market expectations and would suggest that at this point the RBA does not envisage any rate cut in 2024 \u2013 and there may even be a rate increase. It increased its near-term inflation outlook for both consumer prices but also the core \u2013 or trimmed mean \u2013 measure that strips out more volatile movements. It now expects the headline consumer price index to tick up to 3.8% from the actual March result of 3.6%. In its February forecasts, the RBA had been tipping CPI would be down to 3.3% by mid-year. The delay in reining in inflation extends to the end of 2024, with CPI now forecast to be 3.8% and core inflation 3.4% at that time. In February the RBA had expected the two gauges to be 3.2% and 3.1% respectively. Significantly, the RBA still expects the two inflation measures to be back within its 2%-3% target range by the end of 2025. They should both be at 2.8% by then. Disappointing for households will be a weakening in the pace of real wage increases, which shows how salaries are keeping up with inflation. The real wage price index ended 2023 at just 0.1%, quickening to 0.4% by June and ending this year in line with inflation. Just three months ago, the index was tipped to rise to 0.8% by June \u2013 a pace now halved \u2013 and still be at 0.4% by December this year. If growth in the economy is anaemic, government spending at state and federal levels is expected to come in higher than expected, potentially making it harder for inflation to sink. The two key risks to the outlook are that inflation takes longer than anticipated to decline to the RBA\u2019s target, an outcome that \u201chistory suggests\u201d would require a higher interest rate to address. Reassuring somewhat is the RBA\u2019s assessment that inflation expectations \u201cremain consistent with achieving the inflation target over time\u201d. Bullock has stressed that the bank was paying particular heed to those expectations of what is to come remained anchored, as they still seem to be. Higher petrol prices will continue to lift headline inflation in the near term. \u201cThe timing of the anticipated return to [the inflation] target remains the same as previously forecast, as weaker activity is expected to dampen inflationary pressure in the second half of the forecast period,\u201d the RBA said. \u201cOn balance, the risks to the domestic outlook are broadly balanced\u201d."

            "content": "Time to recap\u2026 Hiring in the US slowed in April with the workforce adding another 175,000 jobs and wage growth slowing. The news cheered investors hoping that a cooling labor market will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates \u2013 which have been driven to a 20-year high as the US fights stubbornly high inflation. All the major US markets rose in early trading. Last month, the labor department reported the US added a revised 315,000 jobs in March, far higher than the 192,000 jobs economists had forecast. April\u2019s figure was lower than forecast and the unemployment rate ticked up from 3.8% to 3.9% over the month but the figures underlined the continuing strength of the jobs market. It was the 40th straight month of job gains in the US and the 27th consecutive month with the unemployment rate below 4% \u2013 the longest such streak since 1953. But the slowdown in job creation is fuelling expectations that US interest rates could be cut sooner than expected, with a September cut looking more likely. Here\u2019s the full story: With stock markets rallying across Europe and in the US, the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 share index is on track for a new closing high tonight. With less than an hour\u2019s trading to go, the Footsie is up 41 poinst at 8212, having surged over 8,200 points for the first time today. Here\u2019s the rest of today\u2019s stories so far: Back in London, HSBC shareholders have rejected the resolution to scrap the pension clawback which has cost its retired workers thousands of pounds per year. As we covered earlier, the Midland Clawback Campaign argues that HSBC is acting unfairly by cutting their company pension on the grounds that they also receive the state pension. Resolution 17 said: This Special Resolution seeks shareholders to instruct the board to align pension inequality with their commitment to reduce the gender pay gap, by removing the impact of State Deduction from the members of the post 1974 Midland Section of the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme. HSBC had advised investors to vote against this resolution, and they heeded this advice, with just 4% of votes cast in favour. A motion to allow HSBC to remove its cap on bankers bonuses was passed with 99% support\u2026 Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman has slightly dampened the mood in the markets, by predicting that US inflation will likely remain elevated for \u201csome time\u201d. In remarks prepared for the Massachusetts Bankers Association Annual Convention in Key Biscayne, Florida, Bowman says: \u201cI expect inflation to remain elevated for some time. \u201cMy baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook.\u201d The latest US jobs data has further fueled expectations of impending interest rate cuts and paints a picture of a soft landing on the economic horizon, says Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. But if today\u2019s report is revised lower in a month\u2019s time, there be more concerns over the health of the US conomy. Innes says: According to the BLS release on Friday, the US economy added 175,000 jobs in April, a figure that could be deemed within the \u201cGoldilocks zone.\u201d Leading up to the release, there was a subtle and odd uptick in the \u201cwhisper\u201d number, consequently, the 175,000 figure was perceived as a wider miss compared to the \u201cofficial\u201d consensus set at 240,000. Of particular encouragement for the Federal Reserve was the subdued reading of Average Hourly Earnings (AHE). AHE increased by only 0.2% from March (0.2019% when unrounded), falling below consensus expectations. Similarly, the year-over-year (YoY) growth rate of 3.9% was cooler than anticipated. This data should help alleviate concerns about \u201cstagflation\u201d prompted by the headline nonfarm payrolls (NFP) miss, as well as ease worries exacerbated by the Employment Cost Index (ECI) and Unit Labor Costs (ULC) overshooting in the first quarter. While the extent of the headline miss might fuel concerns about a recession, for the time being, 175,000 represents a fundamentally robust pace of hiring. Any significant downward revisions next month alongside another substantial miss may warrant cause for concern. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, agrees that today\u2019s weaker US jobs numbers boost expectations of a September rate cut. Knightley explains: Job creation was weaker, unemployment higher and wage growth more subdued than expected in the April employment report. With Fed Chair Powell leaning dovish at Wednesday\u2019s press conference this has breathed new life into Federal Reserve interest rate cut calls Stocks have surged at the start of trading in New York, after traders learned that hiring across America slowed last month. News that the US non-farm payroll only rose by 175,000 in April, weaker than the average monthly gain of 242,000 over the last year, has driven investors into a frenzy of of stock buying. They are excited by the prospect that US interest rates may fall quicker than expected \u2013 and putting aside concerns that slowing job creation may show the economy is weakening. The Dow Jones industrial average, of 30 large US companies, has rallied by 1.4%, gaining 543 points at the open to 38,769 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has gained 1.2%. And the tech-focused Nasdaq has surged by 1.9% (interest rate cuts being good for the share price of technology companies). City traders are also more confident that the Bank of England will cut interest rates this year. The money markets are now pricing in two quarter-point cuts by Christmas \u2013 previously, the second cut was not fully priced in. A cut in August is pretty-much priced in (although it could slip to September), with a second expected in November or December. Today\u2019s jobs report has opened to door to a cut to US interest rates in September, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at brokerage XTB. She report that there has been \u201ca huge movement in US interest rate expectations\u201d, helped by the slowdown in job creation in April. There is now a 50% chance of a rate hike in September, up from 31% in April. Earlier this week there was only 1 rate cut priced in from the Fed for 2024, as we end the week, there are now nearly two cuts priced in. Overall, risk sentiment has been given a boost this week from a less hawkish Fed and payrolls data that is moving in the direction needed for interest rate cuts in the US. The combination of payrolls and the Fed have helped to increase rate cut expectations for 2024, with no chance of a rate hike for this year expected. What a difference a week makes. Today\u2019s US employment report shows a \u2018historic jobs market\u2019, says Heather Long of the Washington Post, who cites the low unemployment rate (which rose to 3.9% in April, from 3.8%). America\u2019s health care system was responsible for almost one in three of the new jobs created in April. Health care added 56,000 jobs in April, today\u2019s repost shows, out of 175,000 new additions to the Non-Farm Payroll. Employment in social assistance increased by 31,000 in April, while transportation and warehousing added 22,000 jobs, and retailers made 20,000 new hires. While weakening jobs growth may mean lower interest rates soon, it may also signal that the US economy is weakening. Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, says: \u201cThis is the jobs report the Fed would have scripted. The first downside payrolls surprise in several months, as well as the dip in average hourly earnings growth, will bring the rate cutting dialogue back into the market and perhaps explains why Powell was able to be dovish on Wednesday. Of course, today\u2019s weaker numbers need to mark the start of a new slower trend for multiple rate cuts to seriously be back on the agenda - but, by then, the new fear could be a slowing economy.\u201d Reaction to the slowdown in US job creation is flooding in. Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, says: \u201cInvestors will interpret today\u2019s weak jobs report as a sign that demand is slowing in the labour market. Both markets and central bankers have been looking for evidence that disinflation may be ahead, and today\u2019s figures could indicate that the economy is slowing down. In recent months, it has become clear that the Fed is happy to move slowly in the cutting part of the rate cycle, but unwanted and unexpected weakness in the economy, as we are seeing today, may cause a shift in this approach. A dive in the labour market may be what it takes to push the Fed from a stroll to a sprint.\u201d Mahmoud Alkudsi, senior market analyst at ADSS, says: \u201cThis is a rare miss for the US jobs market which could potentially spell the end of the \u2018higher for longer\u2019 rhetoric we have become accustomed to. This will have surprised the Fed following Wednesday\u2019s decision to hold interest rates further.\u201d \u201cThough the Fed will see this as a step towards getting comfortable with a cut in interest rates, the relative strength of the jobs market remains too high for them to consider a cut before late Q2.\u201d And here\u2019s Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors: \u201cWhat will the Fed make of this? At last there is evidence of some weakness in the US jobs market. Rate cuts will move back up the agenda as a result and there is little doubt that markets will take this as good news. While we shouldn\u2019t make too much of single data prints, this could be the start of a positive trend for the Fed.\u201d Wage growth across America has slowed \u2013 a blow to workers, but just what central bankers want to see. Average hourly earnings growth slowed to +0.2% in April, down from 0.3% in March. On an annual basis, earnings rose by 3.9%, down from 4%. That means real wages (adjusted for inflation) are still rising (as US inflation was 3.5% in March). In London, the FTSE 100 share index has jumped to a new alltime high. The blue-chip share index has rocketed to 8248 points, a new intraday high, mirroring the jump in Wall Street futures. Ocado, the grocery technology business, is up 7%. Takeover speculation continues to push up Anglo American by over 3% too. The dollar has tumbled by a cent against the pound, as April\u2019s weak jobs report fuels hopes of an early cut to US interest rates. Sterling has jumped to $1.2624, the highest in over three weeks, up from $1.2531 last night. Newsflash: job creation across the US economy has slowed, news that has weakened the US dollar and driven up share prices. April\u2019s non-farm payroll shows that US employment increased by 175,000 in April, less than the 243,000 expected. That\u2019s a sharp slowdown on March, when an upwardly revised 315,000 jobs were created, while February\u2019s NFP was revised down from +270,000 to +236,000. The report says that job gains occurred in health care, in social assistance, and in transportation and warehousing. The US unemployment rate has risen to 3.9%, from 3.8%. The report has knocked the dollar, while shares are higher in pre-market trading in New York. Here\u2019s Simon French, chief economist at City bank Panmure Gordon, on today\u2019s disappointing public sector productivity stats (see 10.20am): Here\u2019s more details of the shareholder criticism at HSBC\u2019s AGM: Another HSBC shareholder qustions how the bank can claim staff were fully aware of the pensions clawback issue. Q: If that was true, why are there 10,000 people in a Facebook campaign group? And was CEO Noel Quinn fully informed when he was a Midland Bank staff member? Quinn says he was \u201cwell aware\u201d of clawback \u2013 a reply that is greeted by hoots of derision from the floor of the AGM. HSBC are hearing the anger of former employees who argue the bank is simply wrong to have clawed back part of their pensions. The Midland Clawback Campaign group have proposed a resolution at today\u2019s AGM to end the practice, and are unhappy that chair Mark Tucker is advising shareholders to oppose it. The clawback was introduced in the 1940s and allows workers to pay lower contributions into their occupational pension plans, and for employers to deduct some - or all - of the basic state pension amount from their pension payments. One campaigner, Nancy Ball, tells the AGM of examples of HSBC pensioners who have lost over 20% of their pensions due to the clawback. In contrast, she points out, CEO Noel Quinn\u2019s pay almost doubled last year. Quinn, who announced his retirement this week, should reflect on whether he could, and should, have supported his Midland Bank colleagues in their retirement [Midland was taken over by HSBC in 1992]. Ball also points to the irony that HSBC is refusing to end the clawback, while also asking shareholders to remove the cap on its bankers\u2019 bonuses. Ball insists that it is \u201cbalderdash\u201d to say that the clawback was clearly explained to staff, calling the situation \u201ca shambles\u201d. Chairman Mark Tucker tells the AGM that the clawback was lawful, not discriminationary, and was properly communicated. Midland Clawback Campaigners don\u2019t agree, and shout back at Tucker from the floor. The Clawback campaign explain here that the policy is unfair because pensioners lose the same monetary amount, regardless on whether they\u2019re on a large or small pension. The chair of HSBC has predicted that the Bank of England will cut interest rates in June, for the first time since early in the pandemic in 2020. Speaking at HSBC\u2019s annual general meeting in London today, Mark Tucker explains that inflation data is \u201ckey\u201d to the global interest rate outlook. He predicts that the BoE will lower interest rates by one and a half percentage points by the end of next year. That would lower Bank Rate to 3.75%, from 5.25% today. Tucker says: Central banks are closely and carefully watching the data and need to be confident that inflation will continue to head down to target on a sustainable basis before lowering rates. Our economists continue to anticipate a gradual reduction in inflation with our global inflation forecasts at 5.8% in 2024 and 3.8% in 2025. We expect the ECB and Bank of England to cut rates in June, cutting by 150bps by year-end 2025. We expect the Fed to cut in September, cutting by 100bps by year-end 2025. The City money markets do not expect the BoE to cut as early as June, though \u2013 today, the first cut is only fully priced in for September, although there\u2019s a 66% chance it could come in August. Tucker adds that it is hard to achieve \u201crelative certainty in the central banks\u2019 decision-making process\u201d, given that both growth and employment numbers are holding up and inflationary pressures are lingering. As he puts it: It may not be a steady path. New experimental statistics show that UK public sector productivity dropped in the final quarter of last year, and is almost 7% below its pre-pandemic levels. The Offiec for National Statistics has reported that public service productivity fell by 1% in October-December 2023 compared with July-September, the third quarterly decline in a row. This left public sector productivity 2.3% lower than in the fourth quarter of 2022. Annual estimates suggest that public service productivity showed no growth (0.0%) in 2023, following a partial \u201cbounce-back\u201d of 6.5% in 2021 and 3.0% in 2022 following the pandemic in 2020, the ONS reports. Productivity rises if output increases faster than inputs, and vice versa. The ONS reports that inputs (such as wages) rose by 1.2% in the quarter, while output only rise by 0.1% Inputs increased on the quarter for all service areas, however, output fell for healthcare and education, the two largest areas by expenditure share, the ONS adds. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, says the \u201chuge drop\u201d in productivity since the pandemic is \u201cpretty worrying\u201d, and shows public services are struggling. Over in Oslo, Norway\u2019s central bank has left interest rates unchanged. The Norges Bank decided to maintain its policy rate at 4.5%, and predicted that rates will \u201clikely be kept at that level for some time ahead\u201d. Newsflash: The UK\u2019s services sector has posted the fastest business activity growth in almost a year, reinforcing hopes that the recession is over. Data firm S&amp;P Global has reported that its UK Services PMI, which tracks activity in the sector, has jumped to 55.0 in April, up from 53.1 in March. That\u2019s the highest reading since May 2023, and shows growth accelerated in a sector that makes up around three-quarters of the UK economy. Services firms reported that activity and new work rose at the fastest rates for 11 months, with reports that optimism about the economic recovery boosted companies. However, staff hiring remained subdued, with some companies reporting difficulties finding suitable candidates to fill vacancies. Others cited wage pressures, given last month\u2019s near 10% annual rise in the National Living Wage. Input cost inflation was the highest since August 2023 Tim Moore, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, explains: \u201cService providers benefited from improving business and consumer spending in April as more favourable demand conditions underpinned the greatest improvement in activity since May 2023. The latest survey results are consistent with the UK economy growing at a quarterly rate of 0.4% and therefore pulling further out of last year\u2019s shallow recession. \u201cRelief at a turnaround in the economic outlook was commonly cited as a factor supporting sales pipelines in April. However, there were also reports that clients remained somewhat risk averse and under pressure from elevated inflation. Next Friday we will learn if the UK recession is over, when GDP data for the first three months of this year is released. Economists predict a return to growth in January-March, of around 0.4%. Today\u2019s Services PMI suggests that the second quarter of the year got off to a good start too. Moore adds that business activity expectations for the year ahead were upbeat: Election uncertainty and fading prospects for interest rate cuts were cited as headwinds on the horizon, but survey respondents still mostly reported positive sentiment towards their business investment plans and longer-term growth opportunities.\u201d Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 share index has hit a new alltime high in early trading, as its rally continues. The Footsie has risen over 8,200 points for the first time, touching 8205 points, above Tuesday\u2019s intraday high of 8199.95 points. This extends the FTSE 100\u2019s recent rally, which has seen it gain 6% so far this year. And as covered earlier, analysts believe it has further to rise. Mining company Anglo American remains the top riser in London, up over 3% on bidding war hopes \u2013 after Reuters reported that Glencore was considering a takeover approach. The FTSE 100 has benefited this year from traders switching out of tech stocks and into commodities. Hopes of easing tensions in the Middle East also lifted stocks last month, as have signs that the UK economy is pulling out of recession. Global food prices inched up in April, due to rising meat prices and small increases in the cost of vegetable oils and cereals. The United Nations food agency\u2019s world price index rose in April, for the second month in a row, to 119.1 points, up from 118.8 points in March. That still leaves prices 9.6% lower than a year ago, though. Cereal prices rose by 0.3%, amid concerns about unfavorable crop conditions in parts of the European Union, the Russian Federation and the United States of America. Vegetable oil prices rose by 0.3%, driven by costlier sunflower and rapeseed oil. Meat prices increased by 1.6% last month, with international poultry, bovine and ovine meat prices all rising. But there were some price falls too \u2013 among sugar and dairy products. Sugar prices fell by 4.4%, due to larger-than-previously-anticipated outputs in India and Thailand and improved weather conditions in Brazil. Dairy prices dipped by 0.3%, ending six consecutive months of increases. This was due to \u201csluggish spot import demand for skim milk powder\u201d, and lower world cheese prices. Butter prices rose, though. UK supermarket chain Asda has successfully refinanced over \u00a33bn of debt. Asda reports that it saw \u201cstrong demand from investors\u201d for new debt sold yesterday, which has pushed out the majority of its maturities into the next decade. The sals, it says, included the biggest sterling high-yield bond this year and the second-largest sterling bond in the European leveraged finance market. Michael Gleeson, Asda\u2019s chief financial officer, says: \u201cThe positive reaction followed Asda\u2019s strong FY23 results \u2013 and Moody\u2019s upgrade of its corporate rating to B1 from B2 last week citing a material reduction in leverage and growth in underlying free cashflow. The takeover of Asda by private equity firm TDR Capital and billionaire brothers Moshin and Zuber Issa added billions of pounds of debt to Asda \u2013 with refinancing costs jumping as interest rates have risen. The Evening Standard reports that Asda is now paying higher interest rates on its new debts, saying: The firm said it successfully raised \u00a31.75 billion of senior secured notes and refinanced its \u00a3900 million Term Loan B. The Term Loan B was secured at a EURIBOR+4.25% interest rate, an increase on the previous loan of EURIBOR+2.75% Rail ticket platform Trainline are the top riser on the FTSE 250 after doubling its operating profits in the last year. Trainline reported that its operating profits rose by 101% in the year to 29th February, from \u00a328m to \u00a356m. Trainline, which says it is now Europe\u2019s most downloaded rail app, grew its net ticket sales by 22% in the last year. And interestingly, the company tells shareholders that the Labour party have told Trainline that they have \u201cno plans to revive the current Government\u2019s previous proposal for a national retailing website and app\u201d. Last December, Trainline\u2019s share surged when the Department for Transport scrapped plans to create a Great British Railways ticketing website and app. With Labour pledging to fully nationalise the train network within five years of coming to power, there had been thoughts that the app plan could be revived. Trainline\u2019s shares are up almost 7% this morning, as those fears are shunted aside. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, suggests the London stock market has further to climb: US markets may have lost some of their mojo but the same cannot be said for a flourishing FTSE100, where opening strength lifted gains in the year so far to 6%. The mixture of technical factors, such as rising commodity prices and higher interest rates underpinning the likes of the mining, oil and banking sectors has been combined with improving sentiment towards the premier index. Even at these elevated levels at or around record highs, the valuation of the index remains undemanding in comparison to many of its peers which could suggest that the recent rally still has some way to go. In the City, the blue-chip share index has nearly hit a new alltime high at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 index has jumped by 24 points, or 0.3%, to 8197 points \u2013 only slightly below the intraday high of 8199.95 points set on Tuesday. Anglo American is the top riser riser, up 3.3%, after Reuters reported last night that commodities group Glencore was studying an approach for Anglo. Such an approach could spark a bidding war for Anglo American, which rebuffed an approach from fellow miner BHP Group last month. Glencore is the top FTSE 100 faller, down 1.7%. The main highlight today will be the US jobs report for April, predicts Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank. He explains: This will be an important release for the Fed as well, since the resilience in the labour market has enabled them to keep the focus on inflation. Indeed, the March report showed nonfarm payrolls rise by a 10-month high of +303k, whilst the 3-month average growth was at a 12-month high of +276k. However, even as the nonfarm payrolls numbers have been strong, other indicators have pointed to growing weakness in the labour market, and this week\u2019s JOLTS report for March showed that both job openings and the quits rate were down to their lowest in over three years. In terms of what to expect today, our US economists expect nonfarm payrolls growth to moderate to +240k in April, with the unemployment rate unchanged at 3.8% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The oil price is on track for its biggest weekly losses in three months, bringing relief to consumers and central bankers alike. Crude oil prices have fallen by over 6% so far this week, helped by easing tensions in the Middle East and uncertainty about demand for energy. That would be its worst week since the start of February. After hefty losses early this week, Brent crude is trading around its weakest level since mid-March, at below $84 per barrel, having ended last week near $90 per barrel. Hopes for a deal to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza, and free the remaining hostages held there since the October 7 attacks, have risen this week. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told Israel and Hamas that \u201cthe time is now\u201d for a deal, during his seventh visit to the Middle East since last October. A ceasefire, if agreed, would cut risks to oil supplies from the region. The oil price also weakened after US stocks of crude oil climbed unexpectedly this week. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that energy firms added a surprise 7.3 million barrels of crude into stockpiles during the week to April 26. The EIA also reported a surprise 0.3-million barrel build in gasoline inventories; analysts had expected gasoline stocks would decline by 1.1 million barrels. David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, says: Added together, the data show that the US market has plenty of supply, and crude prices fell to reflect this. Oil has also been hit by fading hopes for early cuts in US interest rates. Lower borrowing costs should boost oil demand, but that seems less likely given the stickiness of US inflation. Also coming up today Financial markets are bracing for the latest US Non-Farm Payroll \u2013 the monthly healthcheck on America\u2019s jobs market, due at 1.30pm UK time. Economists expect a slowdown in job creation; the NFP is expected to rise by 238,000, down on the 303,000 gain in March. The jobless rate is tipped to remain at 3.8%. Attention will also focus on wage growth, which is expected to slow slightly to 4%, from 4.1% in March.

            "content": "Time to wrap up\u2026 here are today\u2019s main stories: It\u2019s been a fairly lacklustre day\u2019s trading in London, where the FTSE 100 index is up just 6 points or 0.08% today. Precious metals producer Fresnillo is the top FTSE 100 riser, up 4%, even though the gold price has slipped back from this morning\u2019s record high. Budget airline easyJet are the top faller, following rival Ryanair\u2019s prediction that its fares may not rise this summer. The International Monetary Fund is urging Italy to tackle its debts and boost productivity. Following a regular assessment of the Italian economy, the IMF says it has \u201crecovered well\u201d from the shock of high energy prices and the pandemic, due to substantial support and a rebound in tourism. That expansionary fiscal policy which supported Italy\u2019s economy has also kept Italy\u2019s deficit and public debt levels very high, the Fund warns, which is \u201celevating Italy\u2019s risk premium and acting as a drag on private sector investment.\u201d Urging Rome to take action, the IMF says: Faster than planned fiscal adjustment to reduce debt with high confidence can be achieved with limited cost to growth by withdrawing inefficient and temporary crisis measures. Beyond the near-term, while maintaining a sizable primary surplus, additional fiscal effort will be needed to accommodate growth-enhancing investments and latent spending pressures and help restore fiscal space in the event of severe shocks. Italy ran a budget deficit of 7.2% of GDP last year, more than double the 3% maximum permitted under the EU\u2019s Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), while its debt pile fell to 137.3% of GDP in 2023. The IMF adds that Italy \u201curgently\u201d needs to reinvigorate productivity, adding: Full and timely execution of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, followed by a successor medium-term structural fiscal plan that focuses on critical public infrastructure, research and innovation, education system reform, and improving the business climate, would support this goal. Over in Chile, growth has been slightly below forecasts in the first quarter of this year. New economic data shows Chile\u2019s GDP rose by 1.9% in the January-March quarter, missing foreccsts for 2%. Morrisons today announced that it has started a process to reduce its debt load. The supermarket chain is setting aside up to \u00a31,000,000,000 to buy back debt, which has piled up since it was taken over in a private equity buyout. Emma Carr, retail partner at the law firm Gowling WLG, says: \u201cThis is a sensible and prudent approach that should allow Morrisons to start rebuilding its prominent space in the competitive and fast-changing dynamics of the supermarket sector at the earliest stage possible. Ensuring that it remains as competitive as possible where customer needs are concerned is key \u2013 especially if it wants to attract further investment and return to its rightful place as a prominent player in the sector on the back of being in in touch with these fast-changing needs.\u201d Analysts at HSBC have raised their view on UK stocks to \u201coverweight\u201d, saying shares are undervalued. HSBC give four reasons for their new optimism: First, the FTSE 350 index is cheap relative to its own history and to other markets. Meanwhile, M&amp;A could become a stronger catalyst with total transaction values this year likely to be higher than last. Second, higher commodity prices and bond yields along with US dollar strength are tailwinds for performance. Third, the combined dividend and buyback yield significantly outstrips that of other markets. Fourth, the long-term structural overhang of UK pension fund selling is at an end; they simply have no more UK equities left to sell. HSBC also reckon that a Labour victory in the upcoming general election is unlikely to surprise the market, adding: In the near term, with public sentiment so depressed, it would not take much for optimism to return in our view. Arguably, this note would have been more timely a month ago, before the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares began rallying to record highs\u2026. UK consumer confidence has improved, according to data provider YouGov, as people grow more optimistic about their economic prospects. YouGov\u2019s consumer confidence index, just released, has risen to 108.9 this month, up from 107 in April. Here\u2019s the details: Increases in short-term financial confidence (+2.9) as well as in outlook (+4.4) Perceptions of job security among workers improves for retrospective (+0.6) and forward-looking metrics (+4.1) Mixed bag for business activity, with improvements in outlook (+2.8) but declines over past 30 days (-1.1) Demand for business travel to and from the UK has dropped by nearly a third compared to pre-pandemic levels, as companies have embraced home working and cut back on environmentally damaging measures. Analysis from the New Economics Foundation (NEF) released today shows that flights for business purposes fell by 29 per cent last year compared with 2019, meaning 3.9m fewer trips were made. The NEF also examined data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and found that businesses spent \u00a32.9bn less on air travel in 2023 compared with 2019 (in 2023 prices), a drop of 22%. That, they argue, undermines the aviation industry\u2019s claims that increasing the number of flights will drive economic growth. Alex Chapman, senior economist at the New Economics Foundation, said: Business use of air travel peaked in 2007 and has fallen further since the pandemic. Today, growth causes major damage to our climate while benefiting only a tiny group of airport owners and wealthy frequent flyers. The next UK government should take a fresh look at its approach to travel and tourism, and focus on re-invigorating the UK\u2019s neglected domestic tourism economy and coastal areas and the zero-carbon public transport network which will support them.\u201d The chairman of insurance market Lloyd\u2019s of London has warned that unless clients become more climate resilient, insurance against natural catastrophes is going to become unaffordable. On a panel at the City Week conference this morning, Bruce Carnegie Brown said Lloyd\u2019s of London were happy to continue to provide cover for customers but said insurance was there to deal with unexpected - not predictable - risks. Carnegie Brown said:: \u201cWhat needs to happen is that customers build more resilience\u2026if insurance is to play a valuable role. Because, simplistically, insurance is there to support unexpected risks and if the risks become expected, then at some point the premium and the claim become the same number, and that\u2019s not particularly helpful for customers. \u201cAnother way of looking at it is insurance either becomes unaffordable or unobtainable, so the mitigation on that is to build resilience so that the expectation bar is raised and insurance can keep doing what it does best, which is protecting customers against unexpected risk.\u201d However, he said he recognised that insurance was based on historical data, and if something \u201cexponential\u201d was happening, as it most certainly was with climate, there was a risk that the insurance industry was \u201cpermanently behind the curve.\u201d He added: \u201cThat is one of the challenges that we are concerned about.\u201d Ben Broadbent told the central banking conference at the Bank of England today that \u201cthe experience of the last two or three years\u201d has made policymakers wary of cutting interest rates too early. But Broadbent also points out that the recent behaviour of the UK economy \u2013 more in line with the Bank\u2019s forecasts \u2013 was \u201creassuring\u201d. He also produced a chart, which showed that the Bank\u2019s inflation forecasts in 2022 were \u201cwide of the mark\u201d, while recent forecasts have been much more accurate. Broadbent adds: It\u2019s unlikely this is because the MPC has suddenly become brilliant at forecasting (or that it was useless before). It\u2019s simply because there have been fewer large shocks over the past year. One former Bank of England policymaker, Michael Saunders, agrees that the BoE is likely to cut interest rate this summer. In a new research note just released, Saunders says the choice on whether the first cut comes at Bank\u2019s June or August meetings is \u201cnarrowly balanced\u201d. Saunders, who left the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee in 2022 and now works for Oxford Economics, argues that the MPC can move ahead of the US Federal Reserve, for a change, as the UK economy has weaker recent growth and rising spare capacity. He adds: As a result, and in a departure from practice in recent decades, we think the MPC is likely to ease ahead of the Fed in the summer. Here\u2019s the key points from Saunders\u2019 note: Historically, the UK has tended to cut rates slightly after the US central bank. It\u2019s often been tempting \u2013 and usually wrong \u2013 to argue that \u201cthis time is different\u201d. However, we think this time really is different and expect the UK will cut a little before the Fed in coming months, and cut a bit faster over the year ahead. Unlike the US, UK inflation in recent quarters has undershot the central bank\u2019s expectations and is likely to return to target in the next month or two. What\u2019s more, recent economic growth has been much weaker in the UK than the US, and as a result, labour market tightness has faded faster in the UK. For example, unlike the US, the UK vacancy/unemployment ratio is back to pre-pandemic levels. To be sure, the UK is sensitive to external monetary policy decisions and prospects. But the Bank of England would not be alone if it eased before the Federal Reserve. The Swiss National Bank and Sweden\u2019s Riksbank have already done so, and the European Central Bank is likely to cut in early June. We expect the BoE\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee will cut rates soon, with a narrowly-balanced choice between June and August for the first cut and rates falling by 75bps by year end. This is a little earlier than our forecast for US easing, with a first cut expected in September and rates coming down by 50bps by year end. The latest UK inflation data, due on Wednesday, will help determine when the Bank starts to cutting interest rates. Economists predict a big fall in the annual inflation rate, down to 2.1% for April from March\u2019s 3.2%. That would mean it had nearly dropped to the BoE\u2019s 2% target. Energy prices will have a downward impact on the inflation rate, after Britain\u2019s energy price cap was lowered last month, while food price inflation is also slowing rapidly. James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, says the measure of services inflation will determine whether the first rate cut comes in June or August. Smith explains: We think services inflation could come in hotter than expected, and if we\u2019re right, that would favour another \u2018on hold\u2019 decision next month. City economists predict annual services inflation will slow to 5.5% for April, down from 6% in March. Speaking of not giving China the cold shoulder\u2026.. Sky News are reporting that Sajid Javid, the former chancellor of the exchequer, has been approached about taking a role at Shein, the online fashion giant which is progressing plans for London\u2019s biggest stock market float for years. They say that Javid is among a number of senior City figures who have held talks with Donald Tang, Shein\u2019s executive chairman, in recent weeks. Sky News\u2019s Mark Kleinman adds: City sources said that if the appointment of Mr Javid proceeded, it could see him either join Shein\u2019s board or become an adviser to the Chinese-founded company. They added that Baroness Fairhead, the former BBC Trust chair, was also on a list of candidates drawn up by headhunters advising Shein. One person close to the company said the identities of those being approached reflected both the seriousness with which Shein was taking the issue of corporate governance and the extent of its focus on a London listing. Back at the CityWeek conference in London, the FCA has tried to assure City bosses that the regulator will take time and care in deciding whether to charge ahead with so-called \u2018naming and shaming\u2019 proposals, where the regulator would announce who it is investigating, earlier on in the process. While public notification is common in some other industries, it has caused a stir in the City and backlash from the Treasury. However, Sarah Pritchard, an FCA executive director in charge of markets and international matters, told the CityWeek conference: \u201cI know that there have been some concerns around our proposals to announce the fact of some enforcement investigations earlier on in the process where it\u2019s in the public interest to do so. Now we recognise that this is a sensitive and emotive issue, so we will take time to consider the feedback to engage further with industry and explore thoroughly the concerns and evidence shared with us with the aim of reaching a broad consensus. Be assured that we do listen. We are evidence led and so will only act when a failure to do so would cause harm to consumers and undermine the integrity of our markets.\u201d Whether that will do anything to assuage concerns in the City, though, remains to be seen. Ben Broadbent\u2019s speech makes several interesting points about the UK economy. He shows how the openness of the UK economy means its more sensitive to global shocks, with a chart outlining how at least 90% of variations in UK growth over the past fifteen years have been caused by \u201cforeign (or at least common) shocks\u201d. He also outlines how the surge in global trade and openness came to an end well over a decade ago: And this chart shows how most of the rise and fall in UK inflation can be accounted for by swings in prices of tradeable goods (such as energy products, manufactured goods, and food). That may mean that there is less inflationary pressure to come. Broadbent says: Clearly, the tighter labour market also mattered. But the vast majority of the inflation seems to reflect the direct impact first of higher core tradeable goods prices following the pandemic, then those of energy and food after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In particular, it\u2019s really only in the past year, as those direct effects have fallen back, that any material \u201csecond-round effects\u201d on domestic inflation have begun to emerge. Ben Broadbent\u2019s speech is his thirty-eighth, and last one, since he joined the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee in 2011 He tells his audience at the Bank today that the UK economy was hit by several large, global shocks during those 13 years, which affected supply and costs more than demand. As Broadbent puts it: It\u2019s certainly been an eventful time. I joined the Committee in 2011, when the economy was still feeling the effects of the global financial crisis (GFC) three years earlier. That was then followed by the Euro area debt crisis, which perpetuated the credit squeeze in this country. After a period of relative calm we then went through the EU referendum and the negotiations that ensued, followed at the start of the current decade by the enormous effects of the pandemic and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. He then reminds us that former governor Mervyn King once described the years preceding the GFC as the \u201cNICE\u201d decade (standing for \u201cNon-Inflationary and Consistently Expansionary\u201d). Broadbent suggests he has lived through a NASTY time, saying: I\u2019m not sure how one would characterise the period since (\u201cNot-AS-Tranquil Years\u201d?). But, if his description was designed as a warning that we couldn\u2019t expect such stability to last indefinitely, he\u2019s certainly been proved right. Newsflash: The Bank of England\u2019s outgoing deputy governor has suggested that UK interest rates could be cut this summer. Ben Broadbent, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor for Monetary Policy, said in a speech this morning that if the economy evolves as expected, borrowing costs could possibly be lowered this summer. Broadbent explained that the direct effect on inflation of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war have now faded \u2013 what matters now is how long the effects of that earlier surge on domestic inflation linger. Broadbent explains that the nine members of the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee must assess how those \u201csecond-round effects\u201d in domestic prices and wages change. One argument is that these second-round effects will take longer to unwind than they did to emerge. The alternative view is that firms are less able to pass on higher wages to their customers through increased prices. He says: There is a range of views across the Committee on this point. In view of the rarity of events like this over the past, and the associated uncertainty about the future, that\u2019s entirely understandable. Whatever the priors of its individual members the MPC will continue to learn from the incoming data and, if things continue to evolve with its forecasts \u2013 forecasts that suggest policy will have to become less restrictive at some point \u2013 then it\u2019s possible Bank Rate could be cut some time over the summer. This month, the MPC voted 7-2 to leave interest rates at their current 16-year high of 5.25%, with Broadbent one of seven members who opted for \u2018no change\u2019. The money markets currently indicate that there\u2019s a 57% chance that rates are lowered to 5% at the Bank\u2019s next meeting in June, while a cut by August is almost fully priced in. Broadbent himself will only get one more chance to vote for a cut, at the June meeting, as he is leaving next month and will be replaced by Clare Lombardelli, the chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), on 1 July. The London Stock Exchange CEO Julia Hoggett has continued the bourse\u2019s campaign for UK companies to offer higher - and what they claim is more globally competitive - executive pay. Speaking to attendees of the CityWeek conference today, Hoggett praised company board members for sticking their necks out and offering bigger payouts to bosses this year, even if it proved unpopular with some shareholders. \u201cWe\u2019ve also seen a far greater willingness of remuneration committees to sit on what I call \u2018the naughty step\u2019 by accepting that some resolutions will gather more than 20% of votes cast against them, thus requiring an explanation from the company under the corporate governance code and inclusion in the IA\u2019s [Investment Association] public register. This creates an arbitrarily high 80% threshold for resolutions, which is something that CMIT [Capital Markets Industry Taskforce] has called to be removed. Although we\u2019ve started to see a change in mindset from some very significant asset managers, such that the number of companies with significantly enhanced remuneration packages have, nevertheless, this season received 80% support.\u201d She also suggested that more companies should be hiking pay - since the consequences of doing so would be less problematic if every boardroom was moving in the same direction: \u201cIt remains my belief, however, that this remains more in our hands than we think. As parents we all know that the naughty step is not a naughty step if everybody\u2019s sitting on it.\u201d The UK and its financial services sector cannot afford to give the \u201ccold shoulder\u201d to China, the City minister has warned. Speaking at the CityWeek conference in London this morning, Bim Afolami told attendees that it was \u201ccrucial\u201d to engage with strategic competitors like China. \u201cLike with any bilateral relationship, we don\u2019t agree on everything. We are very clear that you simply cannot give the cold shoulder to an economy that is home to a fifth of the world\u2019s globally systemically important banks, four of the world\u2019s largest banks, and almost a third of the world\u2019s leading global financial centres. Therefore, it is in our interest to engage where we can \u2026[and it is ] profoundly in our interest to do so.\u201d He said of course the UK was taking a \u201clong view\u201d and should only engage where it is \u201cconsistent with our interests\u2019. But, he echoed a warning that he said was made by foreign secretary David Cameron, saying that if UK and business hesitated too much, \u201cour competitors will write our future for us.\u201d He also said that the UK\u2019s success needed to be reflected in regulation, and repeating punchy comments made earlier this year: \u201cThere is no point in us having the safest graveyard.\u201d Afolami\u2019s comments come two weeks after it emerged that 270,000 payroll records belonging to nearly all members of Britain\u2019s armed forces have been exposed to Chinese hackers. The Labour party has said it would launch a \u201cfull audit\u201d of the UK\u2019s relations with China, if it wins the next election. AstraZeneca has announced plans to build a $1.5bn facility in Singapore where it will manufacture anti-cancer products. The factory, which Astrazeneca hopes to open by 2029, will make antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) \u2013 molecules which deliver cancer-killing agents directly to cancer cells through a targeted antibody. Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca, says Singapore is one of the world\u2019s most attractive countries for investment given \u201c\u201cits reputation for excellence in complex manufacturing\u201d. Png Cheong Boon, chairman of the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), says he\u2019s looking forward to a successful partnership with AstraZeneca. \u201cWe welcome AstraZeneca\u2019s decision to establish a manufacturing presence in Singapore for the first time. It will also be a first for AstraZeneca - an end-to-end manufacturing facility for novel antibody drug conjugates that enables precision therapy for cancer. This greenfield investment is a strong show of confidence in Singapore\u2019s biopharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities and talent, strengthens our ecosystem in supporting the development and manufacturing of precision medicines, and creates meaningful jobs and economic opportunities for Singapore. The price of both copper and gold have hit record levels today. Three-month copper traded on the London Metal Exchange rose by 4% at one stage to a new alltime high of $11,104.50. Fears of supply shortages have pushed up the price of copper \u2013 an essential component in renewable energy systems \u2013 in recent weeks. Better-than-expected factory data from China, and Beijing\u2019s efforts to prop up its property sector, have also helped push copper up. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says: Fresh Chinese stimulus measures aiming to address the country\u2019s heavily bleeding property market, and the latest \u2013 and better-than-expected \u2013 rebound in Chinese industrial production also support the rally in commodity prices. Spot gold has climbed to a new peak of $2,499.89 per ounce, meaning it has gained around 25% since February. Gold has been rallying amid speculation that the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, will cut interest rates once or twice this year. Demand for gold has also been pushed up by some central banks, such as the People\u2019s Bank of China, which has been adding to its bullion reserves for months. Nickel prices are also rising today, up over 4% in China. Last week Nickel hit a near nine-month high after political violence broke out in New Caledonia, which holds some of the world\u2019s biggest nickel deposits. In the City, shares in video game services company Keywords Studios have surged by nearly two-thirds this morning after confirming it is in takeover talks. Keywords told shareholders this morning that it is in advanced discussions with European private equity group EQT over a possible cash offer of 2,550p per share. Dublin-headquartered Keywords also reveals it has turned down four previous offers, which it viewed as too low. But this new proposal is \u201cat a value that the Board would be minded to recommend\u201d to shareholders, if a firm offer was made, it says. Shares in Keywords, which provides services to help develop computer games, have jumped by 62% to 2374p, from 1470p on Friday night, close to EQT\u2019s offer. EQT now has until 5pm on 15 June to make a formal offer for Keywords, or must walk away for six months. Happily for holidaymakers, flight prices may not rise much this summer. Budget airline Ryanair says it is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that peak summer fares this year will be \u201cflat to modestly ahead of last summer\u201d. Ryanair reports that recent pricing has been \u201csofter than we expected\u201d, requiring it to make more cuts to pricing in the last quarter than a year ago to fill its seats. CEO Michael O\u2019Leary told an investor presentation: \u201cIt is a bit surprising that pricing hasn\u2019t been stronger and we\u2019re not quite sure whether that\u2019s just consumer sentiment or recessionary feel around Europe but we still see peak travel demand certainly through July and August being strong. \u201cAnd if we have to discount or cut fares to fill to 94% load factor in April, May and June then so be it.\u201d The airline has also reported a 34% rise in profits after tax to \u20ac1.92bn (\u00a31.64bn) for the year to the end of March, with passenger numbers up 9% despite disruption to Boeing aircraft deliveries (which had been expected to push up flight costs this year). Ryanair has also added former MP Amber Rudd, the ex-Home Secretary, to its board. UK rents are also climbing, particularly for tenants who are renewing their rental agreements. Hamptons has reported that tenants renewing an existing contract in Great Britain saw their rent rise by an average of 8.3% over the last 12 months, outpacing rental growth on a newly let property (6.4%). But despite that squeeze,tenants who stay put and renew their contract are still paying 13.4% or \u00a3178 pcm less on average than someone who moved into a new home. Aneisha Beveridge, Head of Research at Hamptons, says: \u201cMany tenants had enjoyed years of no or below-inflation rent increases, particularly when rents weren\u2019t rising much on the open market and mortgage costs were falling. Landlords were often content with a small gap between the market rate for their home and what their tenant was paying. However, over the last two years, strong rental growth on the open market has meant that the gap between market rates and what some tenants were paying rose significantly. \u201cTenants fortunate enough to be protected from higher rents by their landlord or longer contracts are increasingly seeing their rents rise. These increases for renewing tenants tend to be lower and stretched over a longer period than for newly let homes, often meaning tenants still pay below market rate. But even so, these hikes can still add up to hundreds of pounds a month. \u201cThe large gap between market rates and what many tenants are paying is a big disincentive for them to move unless they have to. Moving increasingly means getting less home for more money. While time will eventually close the gap between what sitting and new tenants are paying, it may take longer if rental growth on the open market starts picking up again.\u201d These charts highlight how average asking prices have picked up this spring, after a lull at the end of 2023: Remarkably, Rightmove also reckon that people hoping to sell their home and move before Christmas (!) should start taking action now. They report that it is taking 62 days on average to find a buyer before the legal process of selling the house even begins. And with the average time between agreeing a sale and legal completion currently \u201ca painful five months\u201d, or 154 days, it is taking over seven months on average from a seller coming to market to completing their move. Rightmove\u2019s Tim Bannister says the \u201cextremely lengthy legal completion process\u201d is a frustrating barrier for home movers to get over. Bannister explains: It may seem surreal to be thinking about Christmas in May, but we know that many would-be sellers picture celebrating the festivities in a new home, and to achieve that, now is the time to be coming to market. One strategy that is still giving some sellers the edge in this price-sensitive market, is working closely with an estate agent to price attractively right at the start of marketing, to give themselves the best chance of finding a buyer quickly. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The spring selling season is picking up speed in the UK housing market, where asking prices for homes has risen to a record level. Online property portal Rightmove reports this morning that the average price of property coming to the market for sale hit a new record of \u00a3375,131 in the last month, up 0.8% on April. However, that only leaves average asking prices 0.6% higher than a year ago. Today\u2019s data shows that activity has picked up this year, with 17% more sales in the first four months of 2024 than in 2023 despite the Bank of England maintaining base rate at 5.25% since last August. Rightmove reckons that \u201cpent-up demand from would-be buyers\u201d who dropped out of the market last year is now driving the market, even though mortgage rates have remained high for longer than expected. Asking prices are not the same as selling prices, of course \u2013 recent data has shown a drop in sales prices. Last month, several leading UK lenders raised their fixed-rate mortgage deals, but this has started to reverse with some lenders cutting rates last week. Rightmove reports that price growth is being driven by the top-of-the-ladder properties, where asking prices are 1.3% higher than last year. These properties tend to be less sensitive to high mortgage rates.

            "date": "2024-05-27T13:33:45Z",
            "content": "When OpenAI\u2019s new voice assistant said it was \u201cdoing fantastic\u201d in a launch demo this month, Scarlett Johansson was not. The Hollywood star said she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the updated version of ChatGPT, which can listen to spoken prompts and respond verbally, had a voice \u201ceerily similar\u201d to hers. One of Johansson\u2019s signature roles was as the voice of a futuristic version of Siri in the 2013 film Her and, for the actor, the similarity was stark. The OpenAI chief executive, Sam Altman, appeared to acknowledge the film\u2019s influence with a one-word post on X on the day of the launch: \u201cher\u201d. In a statement, Johansson said Altman had approached her last year to be a voice of ChatGPT and that she had declined for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d. OpenAI confirmed this in a blogpost but said she had been approached to be an extra voice for ChatGPT, after five had already been chosen, including the voice that had alarmed Johansson. She was approached again days before the 13 May launch, OpenAI added, about becoming a \u201cfuture additional voice\u201d. OpenAI wrote that AI voices should not \u201cdeliberately mimic a celebrity\u2019s distinctive voice\u201d and that the voice in question used by the new GPT-4o model, Sky, was not an imitation of Scarlett Johansson but \u201cbelongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice\u201d. The relationship between AI and the creative industries is already strained, with authors, artists and music publishers bringing lawsuits over copyright infringement, but for some campaigners the furore is emblematic of tensions between wider society and a technology whose advances could leave politicians, regulators and industries trailing in its wake. Christian Nunes, the president of the National Organization for Women, which has spoken out on the issue of deepfakes, said \u201cpeople feel like their choice and autonomy is being taken from them\u201d by the technology, while Sneha Revanur, the founder of Encode Justice, a youth-led group that campaigns for AI regulation, said the Johansson row highlighted a \u201ccollapse of trust\u201d in AI. OpenAI, which has dropped Sky, wrote in another blogpost this month that it wanted to contribute to the \u201cdevelopment of a broadly beneficial social contract for content in the AI age\u201d. It also revealed it was developing a tool called Media Manager that would allow creators and content owners to flag their work and whether they wanted it included in training of AI models, which \u201clearn\u201d from a mass of material taken from the internet. When OpenAI talks of a social contract, however, the entertainment industry is seeking something more concrete. Sag-Aftra, the US actors\u2019 union, feels this is a teachable moment for the tech industry. Jeffrey Bennett, the Sag-Aftra general counsel, says: \u201cI am willing to bet there are quite a few companies out there that don\u2019t even understand that there are rights in voice. So there is going to be a lot of education that has to happen. And we are now prepared to do that, aggressively.\u201d Sag-Aftra, whose members went on strike last year over a range of issues that included use of AI, wants a person\u2019s image, voice and likeness enshrined as an intellectual property right at federal \u2013 or countrywide \u2013 level. \u201cWe feel like the time is urgent to establish a federal intellectual property right in image, voice and likeness. If you have an intellectual property right at the federal level you can demand online platforms take down unauthorised uses of digital replicas,\u201d Bennett says. To that end, Sag-Aftra is backing the No Fakes Act, a bipartisan bill in the US Senate that seeks to protect performers from unauthorised digital replicas. Chris Mammen, a partner and specialist in IP at the US law firm Womble Bond Dickinson, sees an evolving relationship between Hollywood and the tech industry. \u201cI think the technology is developing so rapidly, and potential new uses of the technology also being invented almost daily, there are bound to be tensions and disputes but also new opportunities and new deals to be made,\u201d he said. When Johansson made her comments on 20 May, she said she had hired legal counsel. It is unclear if Johansson is considering legal action, now that OpenAI has withdrawn Sky. Johansson\u2019s representatives have been contacted for comment. However, legal experts contacted by the Guardian believe she could have a basis for a case and point to \u201cright of publicity\u201d claims that can be brought under state law, including in California. The right of publicity protects someone\u2019s name, image, likeness and other distinguishing features of their identity from unauthorised use. \u201cGenerally, a person\u2019s right of publicity can be deemed violated when a party uses the person\u2019s name, image, or likeness, including voice, without his or her permission, to promote a business or product,\u201d said Purvi Patel Albers, a partner at the US-based firm Haynes Boone. Even if Johansson\u2019s voice was not used directly, there is precedent for a lawsuit from a case brought by the singer Bette Midler against the Ford Motor Company in the 1980s, which had used a Midler impersonator to replicate her singing voice in a commercial. Midler won in the US court of appeals. \u201cThe Midler case confirms that it does not have to be an exact replica to be actionable,\u201d Albers said. Mark Humphrey, a partner at the law firm Mitchell Silberberg &amp; Knupp, said Johansson had \u201csome favourable facts\u201d such as the \u201cher\u201d post and the fact OpenAI approached her again shortly before the launch. \u201cIf everything OpenAI has claimed is true, and there was no intent for Sky to sound like Ms Johansson, why was OpenAI still trying to negotiate with her at the 11th hour?\u201d However, Humphrey added that he had spoken to people who thought Sky did not sound like Johansson. The Washington Post reported a statement from the actor behind Sky, who said she had \u201cnever been compared\u201d to Johansson by \u201cthe people who do know me closely\u201d. Daniel Gervais, a law professor and intellectual property expert at Vanderbilt University, said Johansson would face an \u201cuphill battle\u201d even if states like Tennessee had recently expanded their right of publicity law to protect an individual\u2019s voice. \u201cThere are a few state laws that protect voice in addition to name, image and likeness, but they have been tested. They are being challenged on a variety of grounds, including the first amendment,\u201d he said. As the use and competence of generative AI grows, so will the legal battles around it."

            "content": "Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company xAI has closed a $6bn (\u00a34.7bn) investment round that will make it among the best-funded challengers to OpenAI. The startup is only a year old, but it has rapidly built its own large language model (LLM), the technology underpinning many of the recent advances in generative artificial intelligence capable of creating human-like text, pictures, video, and voices. The funding round, one of the biggest yet in the burgeoning AI field, values the company at $18bn before taking into account the $6bn investment, Musk said on X, the social network he owns. Generative AI has so far proven very expensive to develop, in part because of the need for huge amounts of computing power and energy to train LLMs. In a blogpost, xAI said: \u201cThe funds from the round will be used to take xAI\u2019s first products to market, build advanced infrastructure, and accelerate the research and development of future technologies.\u201d Musk relied upon several of the investors who have backed his other ventures, including the electric car company Tesla, and the takeover of the social network Twitter, which he renamed X. They included the venture capital investors Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, and Kingdom Holding, a Saudi investor run by Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family. The rise in investor interest in AI was kicked off by OpenAI, which used an LLM to create the chatbot ChatGPT. Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI, but in March he filed a suit against OpenAI, alleging that Sam Altman and other executives had \u201cbreached the founding agreement\u201d of the company by pursuing private commercial success instead of working to benefit humanity. OpenAI, which is working closely with the US tech company Microsoft, is facing competition from Google\u2019s Gemini, Meta\u2019s Llama and other startups such as the Amazon-backed Anthropic and France\u2019s Mistral. On Monday Musk reposted xAI\u2019s announcement on X, and wrote that the company has a \u201cmission of understanding the universe, which requires maximally rigorous pursuit of the truth, without regard to popularity or political correctness\u201d."

            "content": "The UK self-driving car technology startup Wayve has secured more than $1bn (\u00a3800m) of investment to develop the next generation of artificial intelligence-powered vehicles, with the funding round led by Japan\u2019s SoftBank. The $1.05bn investment is backed by the Japanese conglomerate along with the California chipmaker Nvidia and Microsoft, and is the biggest investment to date in a European AI startup. Wayve, which was founded in London in 2017, will use the funds to develop and launch the first \u201cembodied AI\u201d technology for self-driving vehicles in the UK. Embodied AI will enable automated vehicles to learn from and interact with a real-world environment, including the ability to learn from situations that do not follow strict patterns or rules, such as unexpected actions by drivers or pedestrians. Alex Kendall, a co-founder and the chief executive of Wayve, said: \u201cThis investment will help us launch our embodied AI products and expand our operations globally. It sends a crucial signal to the market of the strength of the UK\u2019s AI ecosystem, and we look forward to watching more AI companies here thrive and scale.\u201d Kentaro Matsui, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, has taken a seat on Wayve\u2019s board as part of the investment, and said Masayoshi Son, SoftBank\u2019s founder, was personally involved. Matsui said: \u201cWe have a vision of a peaceful world, free from traffic accidents. Once we learned that we shared a common vision, our team members and Masa were excited and felt we needed to help. We are very proud that we are taking part in this effort.\u201d Wayve\u2019s current technology is integrated into six vehicle platforms including electric cars such as the Jaguar I-Pace and the Ford Mustang MachE, as part of advanced driver assistance systems. All big carmakers are investing in autonomous cars, and a number of startups have sprung up in recent years, including the Alphabet-owned Waymo and the General Motors-owned Cruise in the US. In the UK, Wayve has carried out autonomous car trials, along with the Oxfordshire startup Oxa, formerly called Oxbotica, and the Academy of Robotics. The transport secretary, Mark Harper, has predicted that self-driving cars could be on Britain\u2019s roads by 2026. The automated vehicle bill is expected to become law in the coming weeks and is designed to unlock a \u201ctransport revolution\u201d by enabling the safe deployment of self-driving cars, according to the government. The self-driving vehicle industry in the UK is still in its infancy, but the government expects it to be worth \u00a342bn and to create 38,000 skilled jobs by 2035. Between 2018 and 2022, the sector generated \u00a3475m of investment and created 1,500 new jobs. Rishi Sunak said the deal \u201canchors the UK\u2019s position as an AI superpower,\u201d adding: \u201cThe fact that a homegrown, British business has secured the biggest investment yet in a UK AI company is a testament to our leadership in this industry.\u201d"

Downey Jr is coming off the back of his first Oscar win, picking up the award for best supporting actor for his role in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer. He\u2019s also currently starring in Park Chan-Wook\u2019s small-screen adaptation of Viet Thanh Nguyen\u2019s The Sympathizer. The actor was last on stage in 1983 for off-Broadway production American Passion alongside Jane Krakowski. \u201cIt\u2019s been 40 years since I was last on \u2018the boards\u2019, but hopefully I\u2019ll knock the dust off quick,\u201d he said in a statement. Downey Jr, known for playing Tony Stark in the Marvel universe, is also set to play a small role in Jamie Foxx\u2019s comedy All Star Weekend. Akhtar\u2019s previous stage credits include 2012\u2019s Disgraced, which won him the Pulitzer prize for drama, and 2016\u2019s Junk, which was nominated for the best play Tony. He is also currently working on a Broadway adaptation of Oscar-winning musical La La Land. The most recent Broadway season saw debuts from other Hollywood actors including Carell as well as Rachel McAdams, who received a Tony nomination for her performance in Mary Jane."

            "content": "In a TikTok world it\u2019s rare that three big foreign policy speeches come along all at once, all trying to chart a new course for the UK in a more perilous world, and all written by someone christened David. But it says something for how foreign affairs dominates so much political thinking currently that speeches this week by David Cameron, the foreign secretary, David Lammy, his shadow, and David Miliband, Labour\u2019s non-resident foreign policy guru, all required attention. Security, Cameron even predicted, will be on the ballot paper this election. Each speech may have had a personal, self-serving purpose. Cameron is halfway through his redemptive one-year community service as foreign secretary and is trying to show how to make the best of the mess he bequeathed Britain through his Brexit referendum. Lammy, at the rightwing Hudson Institute in the US and buttressed by an article in the prestigious Foreign Affairs journal, was taking out an insurance policy, seeking to reassure Republicans of his Atlantacist credentials and that the special relationship would survive a Trump-Starmer partnership. Miliband was seeking to inject some urgency into Labour\u2019s somewhat fuzzy plan for post-Brexit cooperation on foreign and security policy. The speech may also have served as a reminder to Keir Starmer of the virtue of a big foreign policy player operating out of the House of Lords. As a triad, the speeches cohered in at last throwing off the past bluster of Global Britain in favour of a more modest assessment of where UK influence lies. \u201cRealism is not defeatism \u2013 having less influence than the global superpower does not mean having no influence at all,\u201d Cameron said. Miliband argued that Brexit\u2019s illusion \u201cwas that there is a world where are our destiny depends only on our own decisions\u201d. They accepted that isolationism and populism were on the rise and had domestic causes that needed addressing if foreign policy was to function. Failing to control borders properly and leaving too many people in too many places behind, cut off from the uneven benefits of globalisation, lay at the roots of isolationism, Cameron argued. Lammy said he got America First and the disaffection of the working class. Miliband warned that \u201cdivisions about international engagement that have marked US history are to the fore again\u201d. They all saw a darkening world. Miliband described a flammable, runaway world in which a lot more players compete transactionally for wealth, power and influence. Cameron said: \u201cThis is a world more dangerous, more volatile, more confrontational, than most of us have ever known.\u201d All three identified the risks of this multi-aligned world being confronted by a hard-edged axis of authoritarianism, even if they might disagree whether China is already irredeemably a member of that axis, something Cameron claimed was so. Miliband warned of a \u201cbrewing confrontation of a fundamental kind between China and America\u201d. Lammy was more cautious, saying only that there was a risk that China might be joining an anti-hegemonic coalition \u201cwith Russia and perhaps Iran\u201d. But he acknowledged that China was where America\u2019s resources and energies would be devoted, and that this was a legitimate demand of any Donald Trump presidency. All three gave a version of a wake-up call about Britain responding to this unforgiving age, with Cameron from back inside the machine the most exasperated. Cameron, already suffering the frustrations of office, bemoaned the west\u2019s collective \u201cdefensive crouch\u201d. \u201cReturning to frontline politics, what stands out to me is how many reasons are found for us not to act,\u201d he said. \u201cIt too often feels as if the fundamental change in the world has not yet been met with a fundamental change in how many in the free world are thinking and acting. Pursuing our interests effectively means revisiting approaches to foreign policy born of good intentions and ask if they are truly fitting for the world of today. Prizing consensus over action. Not speaking out if it might upset others. Avoiding risks.\u201d But the consensus fell away on two points: where to find allies and how to treat allies. Cameron offered a smorgasbord of alliances, old and new, saying the UK needed to lead in the competition to cooperate. As for the EU, he offered only \u201cthe best possible relationship, not as members but as friends, neighbours and partners\u201d. In the modern Conservative party, this is about as far as any politician can go. Miliband, by contrast, suggested that \u201cthe shared future of the people of Europe, in and out of the EU is being written now\u201d, and proposed a full-on security partnership with Europe, one that is expansively defined, covering defence, climate, terrorism, pandemics and even clean technology. The immediate step would be a high-level non-binding political declaration between EU leaders and a UK PM, setting objectives for a fully fledged set of mutual commitments. Anton Spisak, a former UK government official credited with helping Miliband draft his speech, says there are genuine forces driving such a relationship, \u201cmost evidently the need to maintain/step up support to Ukraine in the face of uncertainty in the US, and the associated need to achieve scale in defence with constrained fiscal resources.\u201d Some ask if Miliband is acting as a licensed outrider for Lammy or a semi-detached agitator frustrated by Labour caution. Speaking to a US Republican audience, Lammy unsurprisingly advertised his love of America, and not Europe, though he also said Europe\u2019s security would be Labour\u2019s number one foreign policy priority. But his Foreign Affairs piece is crystal clear that he is broadly on the same page as Miliband, saying he backs a security pact with the EU \u201cthat drives closer coordination across a wide variety of military, economic, climate, health, cyber and energy security issues \u2013 and that complements both parties\u2019 unshakable commitment to Nato, which will remain the foremost vehicle for European security.\u201d Miliband out of office has the liberty to sketch in detail. And finally there is the issue of wayward allies. For all Cameron\u2019s talk of boldness, when asked if the UK would follow Joe Biden\u2019s example and withhold arms licences from Israel the foreign secretary largely excused himself. He argued that the UK, unlike the US, does not provide large-scale state-to-state weaponry to Israel. He also said the humanitarian aid position was improving, something aid agencies contest. Lammy equally refuses to say if weapon supplies should be halted. Although both men insisted human rights and the national interest could be happy bedfellows, this example suggests otherwise. It took Miliband to make the point that the world is in a battle between accountability and impunity, and that those who advocate the upholding of rules should abide by them. Put more simply, he said: \u201cThere is no need for more 1,000lb American bombs in Gaza.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-20T13:51:20Z",
            "content": "In the immediate aftermath of the death of the Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, and foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, in a helicopter crash on Sunday, Iran\u2019s regional proxies lined up to offer their condolences. Hamas mourned Raisi as an \u201chonourable supporter\u201d of the Gaza-based group. Hezbollah praised him as \u201ca strong supporter, and a staunch defender of our causes \u2026 and a protector of the resistance movements\u201d. Mohammed Abdulsalam, a spokesperson for Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, said on X that Raisi\u2019s death was a loss \u201cfor the entire Islamic world and Palestine and Gaza\u201d. Foreign policy in Iran \u2013 including on the key nuclear issue \u2013 is set by the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and the supreme national security council. Raisi and Abdollahian represented, in different ways, the enactment of the hardline policies that have come to the fore since Raisi was manoeuvred into the president\u2019s office in 2021 with substantial assistance from Khamenei and the council of guardians, a powerful decision-making body. Over that period, Iran \u2013 while maintaining its stance of ambiguity on the purpose of its nuclear programme \u2013 has edged closer to the west\u2019s red lines with higher levels of nuclear enrichment and a more public discussion over whether a decades-long religious edict (or fatwa) against nuclear weapons is still appropriate. On the regional front, too, Iran has become a far more overt actor via the \u201caxis of resistance\u201d, its network of regional proxies, bringing direct conflict, not least with Israel, far closer. Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s proxy in Lebanon, has been engaged in a low-level border conflict with Israel since the Gaza war began in October. Last month Iran directly attacked Israel with missiles for the first time. Beyond the immediate region, there is the question of Tehran\u2019s support for Russia in the war in Ukraine, not least its shipments of cheap and deadly drones to Moscow. \u201cI personally don\u2019t anticipate a change or shift in direction of Iran\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d Dr Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and north Africa programme at Chatham House, told the Guardian. \u201cForeign policy is made in the supreme national security council, where Raisi had some degree of influence. I expect the same approach to continue: maintaining bilateral ties across the region; continuing to support and build the capacity of the axis of resistance, and developing economic opportunities with Russia and China while playing divisive politics with Europe and the US.\u201d Vakil also sees Tehran maintaining a similar approach to the nuclear portfolio, maintaining ambiguity while working to build \u201ccapacity and capability\u201d, which can be then deployed as part of the international negotiating process. On the regional front the loss of Abdollahian, however, has practical significance in terms of Iranian diplomacy and influence. Abdollahian, regarded as close to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, whose own interest in an aggressive foreign policy has shaped Khamenei, was a key outreach figure among Gulf states and helped manage relationships with key figures such as Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah\u2019s chief. One indication of the likely trajectory is that the figures appointed to replace Raisi and Abdollahian in the interim as elections are prepared have similar backgrounds: Mohammad Mokhber, a Khamenei loyalist from the conservative camp, will become interim president, and Ali Bagheri Kani will step up from acting foreign minister and is already acting in back-channel talks with the US on nuclear issues. A statement from the Iran\u2019s strategic council on foreign relations on Monday, in the immediate aftermath of the deaths, also indicated a desire for continuity in the current policies. \u201cWithout a doubt, the path of Iran\u2019s foreign policy will continue with strength and power, under the guidance of the supreme leader,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWith their active presence in foreign policy arenas, [Raisi and Abdollahian] did what they could to realise the national interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u201d All of which makes any question of a new direction in Tehran\u2019s foreign policy a longer-term issue, and one that is ultimately tied to who succeeds Khamenei as supreme leader \u2013 not least after the death of Raisi, who, along with Khamenei\u2019s son Mojtaba, was seen as a potential leader. Afshon Ostovar, the author of the forthcoming Wars of Ambition: The United States, Iran, and the Struggle for the Middle East, wrote in an essay earlier this month that the key determinants were likely to be a combination of Khamenei\u2019s succession and the \u201coutsized influence\u201d of the IRGC, which together \u201chave come to define the Islamic Republic and its place in the world\u201d. \u201cAlthough Khamenei has been the IRGC\u2019s foremost benefactor, he has at times acted to constrain its ambitions,\u201d wrote Ostovar. \u201cThis is especially so regarding foreign policy, where Khamenei has generally favoured a gradualist approach, one that has sought to balance Iran\u2019s assertiveness with a desire to limit escalation. \u201cThe IRGC\u2019s top brass regularly praise Khamenei for his wisdom in strategic matters, but are also decidedly less patient, and would likely adopt a more aggressive posture \u2013 and employ military force more readily \u2013 were the leader amenable.\u201d"

            "content": "Georgia\u2019s president has vetoed a \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill that has split the country and appealed to the government not to overrule her over a law she said was \u201cRussian in sprit and essence\u201d. Salome Zourabichvili followed through on her stated intention to use her veto on Saturday although the governing Georgian Dream party has the votes to disregard her intervention. \u201cToday I vetoed a Russian law,\u201d she said. \u201cThis law is Russian in its essence and spirit. \u201cIt contradicts our constitution and all European standards, therefore it represents an obstacle to our European path.\u201d Under the law on transparency of foreign influence, which passed its third and final reading last Tuesday, civil society organisations and media receiving more than 20% of their revenues from abroad will be obliged to register \u201corganisations serving the interests of a foreign power\u201d. The legislation has brought hundreds of thousands of people out on to the streets of the capital Tbilisi who accuse the government of trying to smear dissenting voices as traitors. The legislation is regarded as a copy of a law introduced in Russia in 2012 and which was used as a tool for repressing those with sympathies to the west. The EU has said that the law will be an obstacle to the country\u2019s accession to the bloc while the US has warned that the legislation and the government\u2019s anti-western rhetoric is turning Georgia into an \u201cadversary\u201d and that it could pull billions in economic and military aid. Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, said in a statement that the veto offered Georgia\u2019s government a way out of the crisis. He said: \u201cPresident Salome Zourabichvil\u2019s veto of the transparency law offers a moment for further reflection. In its current form the law is not in line with EU values and path. \u201cI call on all politicians and leaders in Georgia to make good use of this window of opportunity and ensure Georgia stays on the European course the population supports. I continue [to] closely monitor developments in Georgia.\u201d Under the Georgian constitution, a president has two weeks to either sign and promulgate the law or send an argued alternative back to the parliament in the form of \u201cjustified remarks.\u201d The prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, has suggested he would open the law to amendments but opposition groups see that as a trap designed to take the energy out of the protests that have swelled Tbilisi\u2019s streets in the last month. Zourabichvili called a press conference on Saturday to tell reporters that she had effectively vetoed the bill through her proposed changes. \u201cThis law must be repealed,\u201d she said. A failure by parliament to vote on the president\u2019s proposals could effectively kill the bill. The constitution does not stipulate how long MPs can wait to hold a vote. Parliament can reject the president\u2019s changes and pass the initial bill if it can find 76 out of 150 possible votes, sending it back to the president within three days for signature and promulgation within five days. The governing Georgian Dream party has 90 seats. If the president does not sign it, the bill passes to the speaker of parliament for their signature. Georgia will hold a general election in October. Tina Bokuchava, leader of the parliamentary party of the main opposition, the United National Movement, said: \u201cYoung people, who have flooded the streets of our cities to protest in recent weeks, will applaud this decision, while also knowing the battle is not yet won. \u201cA severe contest now lies ahead between those who want Georgia\u2019s future to be at the heart of Europe, and those who would take us back to the darkest days of Russian rule.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-16T14:28:44Z",
            "content": "A group of activists are fighting for the right to scrutinise Russia\u2019s climate policies, and in particular its enormous methane emissions, in court. Russia\u2019s constitutional court is considering a claim brought by 18 individuals and the NGO Ecodefense that insufficient action by the Russian state to cut national greenhouse gas emissions is violating their rights to life, health and a healthy environment. Another organisation that had planned to join the case, Moscow Helsinki, was closed down last year by a different Russian court. It was the country\u2019s oldest human rights group. The claimants previously asked Russia\u2019s supreme court to examine national climate policy, but it refused to take on the case. They then took a fresh claim to the constitutional court, which is responsible for upholding the country\u2019s constitution. The court has decided some environmental cases in the past, including state liability for the Chornobyl nuclear disaster, but it has not yet dealt with climate breakdown. \u201cWe are insisting in this case that the current climate policy of Russia is too weak and can\u2019t protect us against the most catastrophic consequences of climate change,\u201d said Vladimir Slivyak from Ecodefense. One of those bringing the case is Arshak Makichyan, who has previously been jailed in Russia after taking part in climate protests and who now lives in Germany. He said the lawsuit was about the contradiction between Russia\u2019s climate policy and its constitution. Russia is one of the world\u2019s biggest greenhouse gas emitters. The government has set a target to achieve net zero by 2060 but has done little to achieve this, leading Climate Action Tracker (CAT) to call its efforts \u201ccritically insufficient\u201d. Russia\u2019s energy strategy focuses almost exclusively on extracting, consuming and exporting fossil fuels, and its climate plans rely heavily on national forests taking up twice as much carbon as they do today. \u201cNo information substantiates such an enormous increase of carbon take-up,\u201d says CAT. \u201cIt also doesn\u2019t appear to address the impact of enormous wildfires in its Siberian forests in recent years.\u201d Russia is close to the host of the next climate talks, Azerbaijan, which has defended investment in oil and gas. The claimants say Russia\u2019s climate plans are scientifically unsubstantiated and ineffective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and they argue the plans should be significantly tightened to be in line with the Paris agreement. Part of the claim focuses on Russia\u2019s role as the world\u2019s biggest source of methane from fossil fuel extraction. Russian gas infrastructure is notoriously leaky and is responsible for a significant proportion of super-emitting leaks. Makichyan noted that Russia had no targets at all for reducing methane emissions. There have been few lawsuits to date that focus on short-lived but hugely potent climate pollutants such as methane, but academics expect more litigation on this topic in the future. Russia is particularly vulnerable to climate breakdown and its average temperatures having risen twice as fast as the global average. The lawsuit outlines how some of the claimants who live in large Russian cities have been affected by heatwaves and severe air pollution due to forest fires. As the climate crisis intensifies, Russia can expect more frequent and intense heatwaves, drought and extreme rainfall. This spring there were unusually severe floods in the Ural mountains and Siberia, forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate their homes. According to the lawsuit, young and Indigenous people in particular are being discriminated against. It says Indigenous communities such as the S\u00e1mi could lose traditional food sources such as venison, fish and berries, putting their health and wellbeing at risk. Melting permafrost, floods and other extreme weather events will increase their exposure to disease and water contamination from toxic waste. Andrei Danilov, the director of the S\u00e1mi Heritage and Development Foundation, who is another claimant in the case, said hunting and fishing times were already changing. \u201cWith the disappearance of deer, fish and game, our lives change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a way of life. Our language, our culture directly depends on it.\u201d Danilov previously won a case in the constitutional court upholding the rights of Indigenous people to hunt to maintain a traditional lifestyle. But he has since left Russia, where he said the authorities \u201cdid not like my insistence on protecting constitutional rights\u201d, and is seeking political asylum in Norway. Makichyan said he did not have much hope that the case would succeed but it was \u201ca helpful instrument to raise awareness about Russian climate policies\u201d. The claimants would have to exhaust all domestic legal options to have a case considered at the European court of human rights, which recently ruled that states were breaching the rights of their citizens by failing to do enough to cut national emissions. Although Russia no longer recognises the European court\u2019s jurisdiction, the court does have power to scrutinise its actions before September 2022. The Russian government did not respond to a request for comment."

            "date": "2024-05-08T17:30:26Z",
            "content": "David Miliband will on Wednesday urge British ministers to forge closer links with the EU and condemn the \u201cabsurd\u201d lack of cooperation between London and Brussels on foreign and defence issues. The former foreign secretary will give a speech at the Irish embassy in London in which he will criticise the Conservatives for their attitude towards the EU and call on the next government to seek much closer ties. The speech marks a rare intervention in domestic politics for Miliband, who left parliament in 2013 to take up his role as head of the International Rescue Committee in New York. He has repeatedly refused to comment on rumours he could seek a return to British politics before the next election. Miliband will say: \u201cIt is no secret that I always thought that Brexit was a folly. But the self-harm is still shocking. \u201cThe British government rejected the idea of a foreign and defence policy partnership with the EU when it was proposed in 2019. We are therefore left in the absurd position where the EU has strategic partnership agreements with Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Japan, but not the UK. \u201cIt has framework agreements to facilitate the EU\u2019s common security and defence policy with 21 partners, including Colombia and Vietnam, but not with the UK. It has trade and technology councils with the US, and with India \u2013 albeit that it faces serious challenges \u2013 but not the UK.\u201d He will call for an agreement between the UK and EU covering defence procurement, cybersecurity, illegal migration, international development and green technology. Such an agreement could even be a legally binding treaty between the two, he suggested, a move which could trigger significant domestic political controversy. Miliband\u2019s comments are markedly different in tone from most recent remarks on the EU by Labour frontbenchers. The party leader, Keir Starmer, has ruled out rejoining the single market or the customs union, and quickly shot down an idea by the European Commission last month to make it easier for people aged between 18 and 30 to travel between Britain and the EU. Party strategists say they are unwilling to seek much closer ties in part because of the need to win back leave-supporting voters who voted for the Conservatives in 2019. Labour has talked about signing agreements with the EU in a limited number of areas however, including defence and exports of livestock and food. The Guardian revealed last month that David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, wants to frequently attend meetings of the monthly foreign affairs council, an idea which Miliband will back in his speech. Miliband\u2019s speech marks the most in-depth examination of what could go into a UK-EU defence and security pact. In it he will call for the two to collaborate and coordinate on a wide range of issues, including launching joint defence research and procurement programmes. He will also criticise the Tories for making such discussions politically unpalatable. \u201cIt is not healthy to have the EU seen as beyond the pale by the Conservative party,\u201d he will say."

            "date": "2024-05-21T04:00:31Z",
            "content": "The most spectacular of a trio of trials of a sprawling group of far-right conspiracists who plotted to violently overthrow the German state is taking place in Frankfurt amid high security and huge media interest. On trial are the group\u2019s alleged ringleader, a self-styled aristocrat estate agent known as Prince Heinrich XIII, his Russian girlfriend, and seven other founding members including a former policeman and a former judge who is now an MP for the far-right AfD party. According to federal prosecutors, the group planned to storm the Reichstag in Berlin with armed support via its paramilitary wing, to arrest members of the Bundestag, and to parade a shackled Olaf Scholz on German television in the hope and expectation of winning ordinary Germans around to their coup. In the event of the group\u2019s success, Heinrich, 72, was expecting to become the new chancellor of Germany. The group are part of a growing movement known as Reichsb\u00fcrger, or citizens of the Reich \u2013 currently estimated by authorities to number 23,000 \u2013 who refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of the modern German state and would like German borders to be redrawn to pre-1918 lines. The Frankfurt trial, which opened on Tuesday in a purpose-built metal container building on the outskirts of Germany\u2019s financial capital, is the second involving the plotters. A trial involving the group\u2019s alleged military wing, of former special service soldiers, police, a metalworker and a plumber, started in Stuttgart at the end of April. A third trial, in which the group\u2019s so-called esoteric wing, including a doctor and a celebrity chef \u2013 all of whom were viewed as the group\u2019s cabinet in waiting \u2013 is due to take place in Munich in June. A total of 26 people are on trial \u2013 a 27th, a man in his 70s, died recently in hospital in Frankfurt \u2013 and the three cases are expected to go on for a year or more. Gundula Fehns-B\u00f6er, a spokesperson for Frankfurt\u2019s regional court, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge for us all, but we\u2019ll sit here for as long as we have to sit.\u201d The alleged plotters were arrested in December 2022, when heavily armed forces stormed houses, flats, offices and a remote hunting lodge. Investigators had surveilled the group in the previous few months. Among the arrests made were a leading member of the QAnon conspiracy theory organisation, a clairvoyant, a dentist and an amateur pilot. There has been plenty of scoffing both at home and abroad over the group\u2019s apparent harebrained ideas, with evidence allegedly showing that some plotters acting according to the position of the stars. Questions have been asked about whether the group truly had the ability to carry out its plans, with some accusing German authorities of exaggerating the claims of the danger the group posed. But in their 621-page indictment, investigators have repeatedly stressed how well-organised the group was as well as how dangerous. Police say the group had amassed more than half a million euros in gold and cash, as well as hundreds of firearms, tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition and explosives. They had acquired satellite phones to stay in touch after the paramilitary wing had carried out plans to cut off the national communications networks and electricity. The group had waited for \u201cday X\u201d to start the coup, with one believing the signal was the death of Queen Elizabeth II. When police stormed the house of one member, he shot at them, injuring two police officers. Sophie Sch\u00f6nberger, an expert in constitutional law at Heinrich Heine University in D\u00fcsseldorf, and co-author of the book Reichsb\u00fcrger, said: \u201cThe chances of such a putsch actually succeeding were not all that high, but it could have unleashed a considerable level of violence and was capable of sending shock waves through the system.\u201d"

Asic documented the case of one mortgage customer who was experiencing family violence and wanted to defer loan repayments so that she could move into an apartment with her daughter. The woman, in distress, was put on hold by her lender for one hour, before the call dropped out. She tried a second time but had a similar experience, and an online application for hardship failed to lodge due to issues with the lender\u2019s portal. It took five weeks for her to receive a loan deferral. In a different case, one long-term customer needed assistance with his home loan because he was in casual employment, but was unwell and had missed work. Rather than being assisted via hardship arrangements, he was repeatedly transferred to the lender\u2019s collections team. On one occasion, the customer was told to visit a branch, but when he got there, he was told he needed to call. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Asic chair, Joe Longo, said some home loan customers were being abandoned. \u201cFor people who reach out to their lender to signal they need support, this can be devastating,\u201d Longo said. \u201cToo many Australians in financial hardship are finding it hard to get help from their lenders and it\u2019s time for meaningful improvement.\u201d Asic reviewed the practices of 10 large home lenders, including all of the major banks, for its report after reminding them that they needed to meet their obligations to customers experiencing hardship. The number of households in hardship has increased significantly due to the interest rate hiking cycle that started in mid-2022, coupled with fast-rising living costs. In the last quarter of 2023, the number of home loan hardship notices increased more than 50% compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the regulator. There has also been a sharp spike in financial abuse, which can lead to severe hardship, including homelessness, according to frontline services grappling with a surge in cases. Under the national credit code, lenders must consider varying a contract if a customer tells them they are unable to meet their repayment obligations. The regulator said the \u201croot cause\u201d of many of the problems was that lenders focused more on financial risk and operational efficiency than customer experience and circumstance. \u201cMany lenders aren\u2019t taking their customers\u2019 unique situations into account, instead providing a standardised \u2018one-size-fits-all approach\u2019, which is not meeting customers\u2019 needs,\u201d the Asic commissioner, Alan Kirkland, said. \u201cThe lack of support, and in some cases failure to respond when customers flagged they were struggling, is unacceptable and greatly adds to the distress of customers already struggling with heightened levels of stress and anxiety.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-07T19:21:54Z",
            "content": "Ukraine says it has foiled a Russian plot to assassinate its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and other senior officials, using a network of agents who were recruited by Vladimir Putin\u2019s domestic spy agency. The SBU state security service in Kyiv said the alleged agents had been instructed to find someone close to the presidential guard. The person would take Zelenskiy prisoner \u2013 in his office or when he left the building \u2013 and then kill him, the SBU said. Zelenskiy\u2019s murder was intended as a \u201cgift\u201d for Putin, the Russian president, who was inaugurated at the Kremlin on Tuesday for a fifth time, it added. The FSB also hatched a plan to eliminate Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, who is a hated figure in Moscow, and the SBU\u2019s head, Vasyl Maliuk, the SBU said. The agency said three FSB intelligence officers were behind the operation. It named them as Maxim Mishustin, Dmytro Perlin, and Aleksii Kornev, from the ninth department of the FSB\u2019s fifth service. Perlin handled a network of Ukrainian \u201cmoles\u201d, recruited before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, it added. One of the alleged Ukrainian agents was a colonel serving in Ukraine\u2019s state guard service. The colonel held several secret meetings with Kornev before 2022, which took place in a neighbouring European country, it said. It was unclear when the plot to kill Zelenskiy was discovered, but the SBU suggested preparations were well under way. One of the Ukrainian agents received a call from his FSB handler in February 2022 and the next month was instructed to find someone working in Zelenskiy\u2019s immediate entourage who might kidnap and kill him. The FSB also instructed its network to gather information on prominent Ukrainian politicians, the SBU said. The agency released what it said was an intercepted telephone call between Perlin and one of his alleged Ukrainian contacts. The Russian spy sketched out a complicated plot to assassinate Budanov. The operation was supposed to take place before Orthodox Easter. A spotter was to keep watch on a house used by Budanov which the Russians intended to hit with a missile strike. An agent nearby would then attack other people at the site using kamikaze drones. A second missile strike would cover up evidence of a drone attack, Perlin said, according to details published by the SBU on Telegram. The FSB officer reassured his contact in Kyiv that he would have \u201c20 or 30 minutes\u201d to get away from the scene once \u201cvisuals\u201d had been confirmed. Perlin referred to the planned missile as a \u201cbig bird\u201d and the drone as a \u201csmall bird\u201d. He emphasised: \u201cThe order is rocket, drone, rocket.\u201d The SBU said it recovered drones, warheads and mines from one of the arrested Ukrainian accomplices. He and other members of the alleged network face charges of treason and terrorism. The FSB promised to pay $50,000 if the \u201cbusiness\u201d was successfully carried out, it was said. The SBU chief, Vasyl Maliuk, was quoted as saying by his agency on Telegram: \u201cThe terrorist attack, which was supposed to be a gift to Putin for the inauguration, was indeed a failure of the Russian special services.\u201d Maliuk added: \u201cWe must not forget that the enemy is strong and experienced. He cannot be underestimated.\u201d Moscow had no immediate comment. The Kremlin declined to say anything last month when asked about the arrest in Poland of a man accused of working with Russian intelligence to prepare another possible attempt to assassinate Zelenskiy. The president said last autumn that there have been at least five Russian plots to kill him. One intelligence source in Kyiv said it was unclear whether top officials in Moscow had authorised the plot. They suggested it may have been the result of an operation by mid-level officers, seeking to impress their bosses. \u201cPossibly they were acting on their own initiative,\u201d the source said."

            "date": "2024-05-28T11:25:38Z",
            "content": "Hong Kong police have arrested six people, marking the first time that the city\u2019s new national security law, known as Article 23, has been used against suspects since it was implemented in March. The six people, aged between 37 and 65, are accused of publishing messages with seditious intent ahead of an \u201cupcoming sensitive date\u201d, according to a police statement. One of the women arrested is now in prison. Local media identified her as Chow Hang-tung, a prominent barrister and human rights activist who has been jailed on other charges. The police said the homes of the five other people arrested were searched, and that electronic devices were seized. \u201cThose who intend to endanger national security should not imagine that they can avoid police pursuit anonymously online,\u201d the police said. Chow is the former vice-chair of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, a pro-democracy organisation that was disbanded in 2021 during the crackdown on pro-democracy voices in the city. Next Tuesday, 4 June, is the 35th anniversary of the massacre of protesters by the People\u2019s Liberation Army around Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989. Estimates of the number of people killed range from several hundred to several thousand. Discussion of the incident is tightly censored in China, with public commemorations banned and online platforms scrubbed of any mention of the killings. People in China sometimes refer to the event as \u201cMay 35th\u201d, a coded reference to \u201cJune 4th\u201d, because the date is considered so sensitive. For decades, Hong Kong was the only place on Chinese territory where the Tiananmen Square massacre was publicly mourned on a mass scale. An annual vigil in Victoria Park attracted tens of thousands of people. But since 2020 the vigil has been banned by the authorities, who initially cited Covid restrictions on mass gatherings. In 2021, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, the group which organised the 4 June memorials, disbanded, after several of its committee members, including Chow, were arrested and imprisoned. Hong Kong\u2019s security secretary, Chris Tang, said on Tuesday that the arrests were made in connection with a Facebook group that called for support for Chow, according to Hong Kong Free Press. \u201cConcerning the sensitive date, actually I think the date itself was not important,\u201d Tang said. \u201cThe most important thing is that these people who intend to endanger national security made use of this subject to incite hatred.\u201d The charges announced on Tuesday carry a maximum sentence of seven years. Benedict Rogers, the co-founder of Hong Kong Watch, said: \u201cHong Kong Watch condemns the first round of arrests under the dangerous Article 23 legislation. We should take seriously the plan of the Hong Kong authorities to criminalise perfectly acceptable and peaceful activities that are in line with international human rights law, and respond accordingly.\u201d The formal name of the new national security law is the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance. It derives from Article 23 of Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law, the mini-constitution that governs the special administration region of China. It was implemented in March, after being passed unanimously by the city\u2019s opposition-free parliament. The Hong Kong police and security department have been approached for comment."

            "content": "Wembley will implement its biggest security operation for the Champions League final on Saturday in an effort to avoid any repeat of the chaos that has surrounded recent showpiece events at home and abroad. More than 2,500 stewards will oversee crowds attending the match between Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund, while a \u00a35m investment in beefed-up infrastructure is intended to ensure the scenes that marred the Euro 2020 final at the national stadium remain consigned to the past. A review into the disorder that unfolded three years ago found that more than 2,000 people gained access to the national stadium without tickets, with a further 6,000 outside waiting to charge the gates in the event that England defeated Italy. With the 2022 Champions League final in Paris having been brought to the brink of disaster by organisational failures, and the event in Istanbul last year also being heavily criticised, there is pressure on Uefa and local authorities to hold a trouble-free event this time. \u201cIt\u2019s vital we deliver and do everything we can control in the best possible way,\u201d said the FA\u2019s tournaments, events and interim stadium director, Chris Bryant. \u201cWe want this event to be as successful as possible for every reason, not least for the fans and the event in itself, but we know a lot of people will think about the [Euro 2020] final as well. We are in a really good place, we\u2019ve been planning in detail for 18 months.\u201d Those measures have included a strengthening of all Wembley\u2019s doors, with a further lock system added. Some supporters attempted to rip emergency exit doors open during the dangerous scenes in July 2021, which were detailed recently in a Netflix documentary. New gates and perimeter fencing have also been erected while a \u201cZone X\u201d control room will monitor movement in areas outside the stadium. Stewards will be fitted with extra body cameras and there is an expectation the digital ticketing implemented by Uefa will deter touts. Fans will face two checks, the first at the stadium\u2019s outer secure perimeter, before presenting their tickets for entry. Organisers have received intelligence that a number of ticketless Dortmund supporters may arrive in London for the occasion, although not in a quantity that currently poses concern; confidence is high that the plan to ensure only ticketed visitors approach the stadium is robust. Dortmund fans will have access to a 20,000\u2011capacity fan park in Hyde Park before the game, while those from Real may use a facility on Victoria Embankment housing 13,600. Should the demand materialise, screens in those locations may be used to broadcast the final to supporters without tickets. Each team was given an allocation of 25,000 tickets for the 86,600\u2011capacity stadium. Asked about Uefa\u2019s involvement in light of the mayhem over which it has previously presided, Bryant said the parties have a \u201cvery good working relationship\u201d, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with them a lot in the past in terms of the Euro finals and the women\u2019s Euros as well. \u201cBetween ourselves and Uefa, we absolutely have embraced the learnings and lessons from Paris in the delivery of this event. That is clear. We embedded that into our planning and our thought process.\u201d Bryant described the events at Euro 2020 as \u201cincredibly sad\u201d and emphasised that Saturday should leave a positive legacy. \u201cIt was a difficult and disappointing day,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the way we deserved to end the tournament. \u201cA massive amount of work has gone into this, an event of national significance and a chance to show London is fantastic at delivering big events.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-21T23:01:46Z",
            "content": "Ministers have earmarked north Wales as the site of a large-scale nuclear power plant, which is part of plans to resuscitate Britain\u2019s nuclear power ambitions. Wylfa on Anglesey (Ynys M\u00f4n) has been named as the preferred site for the UK\u2019s third major nuclear power plant in a generation, coming after EDF\u2019s Hinkley Point C nuclear plant, which is under construction in Somerset, and its Sizewell C nuclear project planned for Suffolk. The government added that it is already in discussion with major energy companies interested in building a nuclear power plant at Wylfa, which could help the UK reach its goal of sourcing a quarter of its electricity from nuclear power by 2050. South Korea\u2019s state-owned nuclear developer has reportedly held early-stage discussions with Westminster officials about building a multibillion-pound power plant using its APR1400 reactor technology at Wylfa alongside the UK government. Meanwhile, the American nuclear developer Westinghouse and the construction group Bechtel have also proposed building the plant, using Westinghouse\u2019s AP1000 reactor technology. EDF said it was for the government to determine which nuclear reactor type is used at Wylfa but two more of its own reactor units would \u201cbe the surest choice\u201d by \u201cbuilding on the skills and experience being developed at Hinkley Point and Sizewell\u201d. Claire Coutinho, the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, said the government was \u201cpowering ahead with the biggest expansion of nuclear energy in 70 years\u201d. The UK set out a plan to increase Britain\u2019s nuclear power capacity fourfold to reach 24 gigawatts (GW) by 2050. So far the Hinkley Point project has faced delays and rising costs, and the Sizewell project has yet to make a final investment decision. Coutinho said: \u201cAnglesey has a proud nuclear history and it is only right that, once again, it can play a central role in boosting the UK\u2019s energy security. Wylfa would not only bring clean, reliable power to millions of homes \u2013 it could create thousands of well-paid jobs and bring investment to the whole of north Wales.\u201d A deal would revive Wylfa\u2019s nuclear hopes after Japanese developer Hitachi dropped plans to build two reactors on the site in early 2019 because of rising costs, throwing the site\u2019s future into doubt. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: \u201cA large-scale project at Wylfa would be the single biggest inward investment in Welsh history, and a huge step towards both energy security and net zero for the whole country.\u201d Sue Ferns, the senior deputy general secretary of Prospect union, said: \u201cGigawatt scale new nuclear power stations are vital to hitting net zero and for our energy security. But they also maintain well-paid and highly skilled jobs, meaning this project would be a major boost to the Welsh economy.\u201d \u201cNow we need a laser-like focus on delivery of new nuclear to make sure skills and experience are not lost, and costs are reduced as we progress,\u201d Ferns said. The decision on the nuclear developer, and what type of technology should be used at Wylfa, will be made by Great British Nuclear, which was launched with the aim of providing new power stations, including a fleet of small modular reactors."

Natalia Komarova, the governor of Siberia\u2019s oil-rich Khanty-Mansiisk region who was last year criticised for remarks she made about the war in Ukraine, announced on Thursday that she was resigning from her post. Russia is building up forces near the northern part of Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region where it launched an offensive this month, but it still lacks the troop numbers to stage a major push in the area, Ukraine\u2019s top commander said on Thursday. Russia may take steps in the area of nuclear deterrence if the US deploys intermediate and short-range missiles in Europe and Asia, the RIA news agency reported on Thursday, citing Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. Italy will never send any troops to Ukraine and any weapons it has supplied to Kyiv should not be used on Russian territory, the Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said on Thursday. Thank you for following. You can read more of our coverage of the war here. Russia\u2019s ambassador to Sri Lanka, Levan S. Dzhagaryan, told the press conference on Thursday his embassy would cooperate with the efforts to stop Sri Lankans travelling illegally to Russia. He said his government was not involved in the recruitment offers. Under the new controls, men will have to produce a \u201cno-objection\u201d document from the Sri Lankan defence ministry when they apply for a tourist visa to Russia, state minister for foreign affairs, Tharaka Balasuriya, told reporters. He said: I get about ten calls a day from people about this issue. We have reports of people being promised pay but it\u2019s not credited to their accounts. Some people have taken loans to go and aren\u2019t able to pay them back. They are facing many hardships and we want to find a way to bring them back. Campaigns on social media platform WhatsApp have targeted former members of Sri Lanka\u2019s military, according to the Sri Lanka\u2019s defence ministry. Families of Sri Lankans who have travelled to Russia have lodged 455 complaints with the Colombo government, and the actual number of people involved could be higher, Balasuriya said. At least 37 Sri Lankans have been wounded in Ukraine and 16 others are missing, according to foreign ministry data. Sri Lanka will tighten controls to try to stop its men being lured to Russia to fight in Ukraine with often false promises of salaries and benefits, a minister said on Thursday. Colombo will also send a delegation to Moscow in June to bring back dozens of Sri Lankans already fighting in the frontline who want to come home, some of them wounded, state minister for foreign affairs Tharaka Balasuriya told reporters. Countries across the region, including India and Nepal, have raised the alarm about their men being persuaded to travel to fight for Russia in Ukraine with offers of salaries, visas and sometimes university places. Meanwhile, Finland\u2019s parliament should reject a proposed laws that would prevent migrants arriving across the long, forested border with Russia from seeking asylum, the Nordic country\u2019s non-discrimination ombudsman said on Thursday. The government last week proposed emergency legislation allowing border guards to push back migrants trying to cross the 1,340-km (830-mile) frontier. According to Reuters, Finland believes Moscow is promoting the crossings in retaliation for Helsinki joining Nato, which backs Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion. The Kremlin denies the allegation. Finland\u2019s government has itself said the proposed legislation would be in breach of the country\u2019s asylum commitments, but that the situation requires tough measures. It remains uncertain whether the law will obtain the required five-sixths majority in a plenary vote of parliament, a high bar reflecting the fundamental principles at stake. In a note to parliament, the non-discrimination ombudsman wrote: There are alternatives to the unconstitutional border security law \u2026 The commissioner does not support the adoption of the bill. In practice, the proposed law would make it possible for people to be forced out of Finland in uncertain and dangerous situations, the ombudsman said. The Finnish prime minister\u2019s office and the interior ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Speaking in Prague, the Nato secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said: When leaders meet in July, we will take further steps to invest in our security, strengthen ties with partners, and bolster our support to Ukraine. Ukraine continues to fight bravely, but the challenges they face are greater and growing. Ukraine can still prevail \u2013 but only with continued, robust support from Nato Allies. So at the Nato summit in July, we plan to put our support on a firmer footing. Including with a greater Nato role in coordinating security assistance and training, as well as a multi-year financial commitment. We also plan to work even more closely with our Indo-Pacific partners: Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea. Including on technology, cyber, and countering hybrid threats. At our ministerial, the Foreign Ministerial Meeting tomorrow, we will also discuss how to address instability in our southern neighbourhood, including the continuing threat of terrorism. Jan Lipavsk\u00fd, the Czech foreign minister, has called for a strategic approach to Russia\u2019s meddling. \u201cConstant hybrid warfare. Cyber attacks. Lie-poisoned propaganda. Espionage under diplomatic cover. Russia is sowing seeds of chaos globally,\u201d he said. \u201c I propose we come up with a credible strategic approach towards Russia. Because only a strong NATO can be the antidote to this chaos,\u201d he added. Ukraine\u2019s first lady, Olena Zelenska, said she welcomes \u201cthe important decision of the 77th World Health Assembly to adopt a resolution on mental health in times of war and disasters, initiated by Ukraine and the Netherlands.\u201d \u201cMental consequences of war are felt even thousands of kilometers away from the frontline. Grateful to member states of the Assembly and WHO for increasing attention to mental health,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cthis is a step towards our goal of ensuring that everyone has proper support anywhere, anytime.\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said on Thursday it was finalising a proposal for \u201cretaliatory measures\u201d against the EU over the bloc\u2019s ban on the broadcast of four Russian media outlets on its territory. The EU said earlier this month it was suspending the distribution of the Voice of Europe, the RIA Novosti news agency and the Izvestia and Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspapers. The European Council said in a statement it was acting because the outlets \u201chave been essential and instrumental in bringing forward and supporting Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine.\u201d Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova had earlier warned of an extremely painful response to the ban. On Thursday, she told a news briefing that response was in its final stages of preparation and would be submitted for approval in the coming days, Reuters reports. France could soon send military trainers to Ukraine despite the concerns of some allies and criticism by Russia, and may announce its decision next week during a visit by the Ukrainian president, three diplomatic sources said. The diplomats said Paris hoped to forge and lead a coalition of countries offering such assistance to Kyiv\u2019s war effort even though some of its EU partners fear it could make a direct conflict with Russia more likely. According to Reuters, France would initially send a limited number of personnel to assess the modalities of a mission before dispatching several hundred trainers, two of the diplomats said. Training would centre around de-mining, keeping equipment operational and technical expertise for warplanes to be provided by the west, they said. Paris would also finance, arm, and train a Ukrainian motorised brigade. \u201cThe arrangements are very advanced and we could expect something next week,\u201d said one of the sources. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is due in France on 6 June, the 80th anniversary of D-day, when Allied soldiers landed in Normandy to drive out Nazi German forces during the second world war. He will hold talks with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris the next day. Ukraine\u2019s top commander said on Monday he had signed paperwork allowing French military instructors to visit Ukrainian training centres soon. Ukraine\u2019s Defence Ministry, in a \u201cclarification\u201d, said Kyiv had been expressing interest in a project involving receiving foreign instructors since February. Russian president Vladimir Putin portrayed the presence of regular French military in Ukraine as a step towards global conflict. The Kremlin said on Thursday that the US, Nato and some European countries were encouraging Ukraine to continue what it called Kyiv\u2019s \u201csenseless war\u201d with Russia and accused them of escalating tensions in recent weeks. Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022 in what it called a special military operation, and Kyiv says it is defending itself \u2013 with western help \u2013 in an effort to expel all Russian forces from its territory. It says Russia is working hard to try to undermine its morale and will to fight. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, on Thursday accused some western countries of raising tensions in recent weeks by allowing Ukraine to use weapons they had supplied against targets inside Russia, something the US has not publicly agreed to do yet. Peskov told reporters: The member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance \u2013 the United States in particular, other European capitals \u2013 have in recent days and weeks embarked on a new round of escalation. They are doing this deliberately. We hear a lot of bellicose statements. \u2026 They are encouraging Ukraine in every possible way to continue this senseless war. This will all, of course, inevitably have consequences and will ultimately be very damaging to the interests of those countries that have taken the path of escalation. Ukraine\u2019s grain exports are forecast to fall to around 38-40 million metric tons in the 2024/25 season compared with about 50 million tons in 2023/24, the acting farm minister said on Thursday. Taras Vysotskiy told Reuters lower exports were expected due to a smaller harvest. Natalia Komarova, the governor of Siberia\u2019s oil-rich Khanty-Mansiisk region who was last year criticised for remarks she made about the war in Ukraine, announced on Thursday that she was resigning from her post. In a video posted on her official Telegram channel, Komarova, who oversaw a region which accounts for more than 40% of Russia\u2019s total oil output, said she was moving to another undisclosed job even though her term in office does not expire until next year, Reuters reports. Komarova, who did not explain what had prompted her decision, was criticised by an anti-war activist last year who called for her to be prosecuted for discrediting the Russian army after she appeared to suggest that Moscow had not needed or been ready for what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Aides said her remarks had been taken out of context and that Komarova supported the military. In her resignation video, she thanked President Vladimir Putin for his trust and spoke of the efforts being made by Russian forces on the frontline. Komarova, 68, was the only serving female governor and had been at the helm of the regional administration since 2010. Before that, she had headed the committee on natural resources at Russia\u2019s State Duma lower house of parliament. Local press has tipped the mayor of the city of Tyumen, Ruslan Kukharuk, as her successor as governor. Russia is building up forces near the northern part of Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region where it launched an offensive this month, but it still lacks the troop numbers to stage a major push in the area, Ukraine\u2019s top commander said on Thursday. According to Reuters, Ukraine says it has stabilised the front in the north-eastern Kharkiv region where Russian forces launched a cross-border assault on 10 May that opened a new front in the 27-month-old war and stretched Kyiv\u2019s outnumbered troops. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was continuing to send additional regiments and brigades from other areas and from training grounds to bulk up its troops on two main lines of attack in Kharkiv region\u2019s north. That includes the Strilecha-Lyptsi area between two small villages and the vicinity of the border town of Vovchansk where there has been street fighting. In a statement on Telegram, Syrskyi said: These forces are currently insufficient for a large-scale offensive and breakthrough of our defence. He said Ukraine\u2019s \u201ccreation of an ammunition reserve\u201d had also reduced the offensive capabilities of Russian forces. The remark suggested Kyiv\u2019s acute shortages of artillery ammunition had eased since the United States finally approved a major aid package in April after months of delay. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Wednesday that American weapons being delivered were helping to stabilise the Ukrainian frontlines. Russia has concentrated most of its offensive pressure in Ukraine\u2019s east where its troops have been able to make slow incremental advances since capturing the town of Avdiivka in Donetsk region in February. Russia may take steps in the area of nuclear deterrence if the US deploys intermediate and short-range missiles in Europe and Asia, the RIA news agency reported on Thursday, citing Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. Anton Gerashchenko, a popular blogger and adviser to the internal affairs ministry, posted this update from Ukrainian Defence Intelligence: Italy will never send any troops to Ukraine and any weapons it has supplied to Kyiv should not be used on Russian territory, the Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said on Thursday. \u201cAll the weapons leaving from Italy [to Ukraine] should be used within Ukraine,\u201d Tajani said in a TV interview with public broadcaster RAI. Under prime minister Giorgia Meloni, Italy has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine, but Rome has never disclosed any details about its military aid, Reuters reports. Tajani also dismissed the possibility that former Italian prime minister and European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi could become the next EU Commission President. \u201cDraghi is not an [official] candidate and does not belong to any [European] political family \u2026 I see it as a complicated matter,\u201d he said. Nato foreign ministers will meet in Prague on Thursday in the face of growing calls for leading allies to lift restrictions stopping Kyiv from using western weapons to strike inside Russia. The two-day gathering in the Czech capital is meant to focus on efforts to hammer out a package of support for Ukraine at Nato\u2019s summit in Washington in July. But the swirling debate over whether to let Kyiv use arms sent by western backers to strike inside Russia risks overshadowing the meeting. Ukraine has been pressing its supporters \u2013 chiefly the United States \u2013 to allow it to use the longer-range weaponry they supply to hit targets inside Russia. The US and Germany have so far refused to permit Kyiv to strike over the border out of fear that it could drag them closer to direct conflict with Moscow. Ahead of the Nato meeting \u2013 which starts with a dinner on Thursday \u2013 alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg said repeatedly it was time for members to reconsider those limits as they hamper Kyiv\u2019s ability to defend itself. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, appeared to shift the dial on Tuesday when he said Ukraine should be allowed to \u201cneutralise\u201d bases in Russia used to launch strikes. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has previously warned there would be \u201cserious consequences\u201d if western countries give approval to Ukraine. Overnight, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, criticised the US for aiding Ukraine, saying Washington has become \u201can accomplice in the crimes of the Kyiv regime\u201d. He said, in particular, that Russia regarded the planned supplies of nuclear-capable F-16 fighters to Ukraine as a \u201csignal action\u201d by Nato. In other news: Lavrov also reportedly told Russia\u2019s RIA news agency that China could arrange a peace conference in which Russia and Ukraine would participate. Russia has repeatedly called for talks with a precondition that Kyiv and the West recognise its territorial gains in Ukraine. Kyiv has rejected those proposals. Security services around Europe are on alert to a potential new weapon of Russia\u2019s war \u2013 arson and sabotage \u2013 after a spate of mystery fires and attacks on infrastructure in the Baltics, Germany and the UK. Security services believe several incidents could be part of a systemic attempt by Moscow to destabilise the west, which has backed Ukraine. Russia\u2019s defence ministry on Thursday said it neutralised 13 Ukrainian aerial drones in the southern Krasnodar region and close to the annexed Crimean peninsula. On Thursday morning, \u201cfive Ukrainian aerial drones were shot down by anti-aircraft defence systems in the Krasnodar region,\u201d the ministry said. Another eight drones were intercepted during the night \u201cover the Black Sea, close to the Crimean coast\u201d, the statement added. Ukraine\u2019s air defence systems destroyed seven Russia-launched missiles and 32 drones overnight, its air force commander said on Thursday. On the Telegram messaging app the air force official said Russia had launched a total of 51 missiles and drones. The commander said Russian forces attacked \u201cmilitary facilities and critical infrastructure in Ukraine\u201d but did not provide additional details."

            "title": "CSIRO says nuclear plant would cost at least $8.6bn as Coalition stalls on policy details ",
            "date": "2024-05-21T15:00:36Z",
            "content": "Electricity from nuclear power in Australia would be at least 50% more expensive than solar and wind, according to a report from the CSIRO that has for the first time calculated costs for large-scale reactors. The federal Coalition, which has claimed nuclear would provide cheap electricity, is still to reveal any details on its nuclear policy after initially promising it would make an announcement in time for last week\u2019s federal budget. This week the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said more plans would be released \u201cin due course\u201d and he has yet to say where plants might be built or how large they would be. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Coalition would first have to overturn a federal ban on nuclear power. Several state government bans also exist. According to CSIRO\u2019s GenCost report, a theoretical 1,000MW nuclear plant built today would cost at least $8.6bn. The report said nuclear costs in that range \u201ccan only be achieved if Australia commits to a continuous building program and only after an initial higher cost unit is constructed\u201d. The capital costs of a large nuclear plant could double in a country that has never built a large reactor before, the report said. Such a \u201cfirst-of-a-kind\u201d premium could also apply to other technologies not yet used in Australia, including offshore wind, fossil fuel plants with carbon capture and storage, and solar thermal. The report also advised that a \u201c15+ year development time\u201d should be expected for nuclear in Australia, meaning if a decision to pursue the technology was made next year then a plant would be deployed \u201cno sooner than 2040\u201d. A combination of solar and wind power remained the cheapest source of electricity, the GenCost report said, even allowing for the extra costs of integrating them into the grid. Those costs included building extra transmission lines and adding storage, such as batteries and pumped hydro, so that power from solar and wind can be released on demand. By 2030, the report said, electricity from a combination of solar and wind would cost between $73 and $128 a megawatt hour, depending on how much renewable energy was already in the system. This compared with large-scale nuclear at $141 to $233/MWh and $230 to $382/MWh for small modular reactors. Also cheaper than nuclear power, according to the report, was gas-fired electricity with carbon capture and storage and solar thermal electricity \u2013 a technology where mirrors concentrate the sun\u2019s energy to create intense heat that can be stored. The CSIRO report said to achieve the lower end of cost estimates for coal, gas and nuclear technologies, plants would have to run at 89% of their capacity \u201cwhen historically coal, which has been the main baseload energy source in Australia\u2019s largest states, has only achieved an average of around 60%\u201d. On Tuesday, the renewable industry\u2019s Clean Energy Council released a report claiming nuclear energy was up to six times more expensive than solar and wind. The GenCost report has come under intense scrutiny, in particular from nuclear advocates. In March CSIRO\u2019s chief executive, Douglas Hilton, staunchly defended the report from \u201cunfounded criticism\u201d after Dutton claimed it had been discredited. CSIRO received 45 submissions in response to a draft of the report \u2013 more than four times the usual amount \u2013 with the majority coming from private individuals. Most of those private submissions had requested CSIRO include the costs for nuclear. \u2022 The headline on this article was amended on 24 May 2024 to take account of the report\u2019s finding that the cost of a nuclear plant might be much higher than $8.6bn."

            "content": "Young people are using sites such as Telegram and TikTok to buy large knives for use in attacks and intimidation, with some linked to Britain\u2019s drug wars, police said. Stephen Clayman, national lead for knife crime for the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, made it clear on Tuesday that police want tougher action after a 7% year-on-year rise in knife offences, with a 20% rise in knife-point robberies. Clayman, who is a commander in the Metropolitan police, said there were new trends in the supply of knives, with government and police scrambling to keep up. He urged social media companies and retailers to help stop young people getting weapons. \u201cSocial media companies need to take some responsibility \u2026 in limiting access,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got algorithms: if I\u2019m searching for knives and retailers, the algorithm will probably show me more.\u201d He named Meta, Snapchat, TikTok and Telegram as sites used. Clayman said: \u201cThese knives are accessible to young people, there\u2019s no age restriction or verification, they will send to young people. \u201cWe are uncovering more, because whether it\u2019s Snapchat, TikTok or Telegram, they are using these channels and young people are flicking between them very quickly \u2026 it\u2019s like any criminal market.\u201d Of special concern are large Zombie-style knives and machetes. Clayman said a new trend is people buying hundreds of knives and then reselling them, with little or no checks. \u201cThey are taking advantage of a mechanism to resell \u2026 They think they are being entrepreneurial, actually they are committing an offence and they are causing more harm,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cKnife crime is moving with the digital age.\u201d The mother of Ronan Kanda, 16, has called for a ban after her son died after being stabbed through the heart with a sword in 2022 that had been bought online. He was chased through the streets of Wolverhampton by two 17-year-olds armed with a machete and sword, who had mistook him for someone else. Those involved in the drug trade carry knives to protect themselves from attack or robbery, with large knives preferred to intensify the terrorising effect. Clayman said: \u201cInvariably, whenever we undertake any warrants, and we get into addresses, we will find the drugs but we will also find the stash of weapons \u2026 machetes and other weapons.\u201d Young people are also obtaining knives to protect territory and because they are \u201cscared\u201d and believe it will protect them from attack, he said. Further crackdowns are being considered, Clayman said, such as a ban on large knives for sale online. \u201cWe are always looking at how far we can push this,\u201d he added. Police have developed a \u201cknife hunter\u201d database, recording the types of knife recovered. It is hoped that with the use of AI it will tell analysts what type of weapons are in circulation."

            "content": "After a deadly storm in Houston over the weekend in which eight people died, 25 million Americans are bracing for more severe weather across the country. A National Weather Service notice said that an outbreak of severe thunderstorms was predicted on Tuesday over large swaths of the midwest and western Great Lakes, with the greatest threat expected over Iowa and certain parts of nearby states. \u201cSevere thunderstorms will continue this morning across Iowa with a risk for mainly damaging winds,\u201d the NWS said. In several posts on X, the NWS\u2019s office in Des Moines warned of severe thunderstorms with wind gusts up to 70mph as well as flash flooding. It urged residents to move immediately to high ground and avoid walking or driving through flood waters. The service\u2019s posts said: \u201cLine of severe thunderstorms currently moving through the Des Moines metro. Wind speeds of 60-70mph &amp; hail of up to 1 inch in diameter have been reported. Severe thunderstorm warning and multiple flash flood warnings in effect. Seek shelter until these pass!\u201d Furthermore, the NWS said that severe storms were expected to redevelop on Tuesday afternoon across eastern Nebraska and northern Missouri before moving rapidly north-east to the Great Lakes region. It went on to warn, \u201cDiscrete storms are possible initially, evolving into an organized line of severe storms by evening. More isolated severe storms will be possible farther south into portions of eastern Oklahoma, northwest Arkansas and central Texas.\u201d All forms of severe weather, including tornadoes and severe wind gusts of about 75mph \u2013 as well as 2in hail \u2013 were possible Tuesday through Wednesday throughout the affected regions. Additionally, heavy rain may lead to scattered instances of flash flooding through Tuesday night across the upper midwest, the NWS warned. From the Ozarks to south Texas, isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected to form from mid-afternoon into evening on Tuesday near the front and dry line, according to the NWS, which added that there was a possibility of large to very large hail up to 3in in diameter and locally severe gusts. By Wednesday morning, the center of the system is expected to move towards southern Canada with the heavy rain threat expected to quickly decrease across the Great Lakes. A trailing cold front is expected to become \u201cnearly stationary across the southern Plains where the next phase of severe weather and excessive rainfall is forecast to emerge\u201d, the NWS said. The threats are then expected to expand on Wednesday night towards the mid-Mississippi valley, where the thunderstorms tend to become slow-moving. The NWS\u2019s latest warnings come after eight storm-related deaths occurred in Houston in recent days amid fast-moving thunderstorms that hit Texas for the second time in a month. According to Houston\u2019s mayor, John Witmire, at least two of the deaths were caused by falling trees. Another occurred when heavy winds toppled a crane on to a cement truck, officials said. On Monday, the Houston fire department announced that an eighth person had died during the storm as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning."

            "date": "2024-05-14T09:26:59Z",
            "content": "Vodafone has said its turnaround plan is starting to show results as Germany, its largest business, returned to growth last year after the sale of its Italian and Spanish operations. The telecoms company has been undergoing a transformation programme under its chief executive, Margherita Della Valle, who has sought to simplify the group and taken action in three underperforming markets where Vodafone\u2019s returns were below the cost of capital. Vodafone sold off its Spanish division for \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.3bn) as well as announcing an \u20ac8bn sale of its operations in Italy and a proposed merger with CK Hutchison\u2019s Three in the UK which is being considered by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the anti-trust regulator. The telecoms company reported a 74% fall in operating profits for the year ended 31 March 2024 to \u20ac3.7bn against \u20ac14.4bn because results in the previous year were bolstered by exceptional gains including an \u20ac8.6bn gain on the sale of its Vantage Towers business as well as sales of Vodafone Hungary and Vodafone Ghana. Vodafone is pressing ahead with cost-cutting measures. It has shed 5,000 roles and is cutting a further 2,000 as part of a \u20ac1bn cost reduction target; its aim is to axe up to 11,000 jobs by 2026. Della Valle said that underlying performance in Germany was expected to improve so that by 2026 the country \u201cwill come back to being an important growth engine for the group\u201d. She added that Vodafone was holding \u201cdeep conversations\u201d with the CMA in the UK as the regulators examine the Three deal. The CMA has warned mobile customers could face higher prices and reduced quality as a result of the potential merger. Della Valle said: \u201cMuch more still needs to be done in the year ahead. We will step up investment in our customer experience, improve our underlying performance in Germany and accelerate our momentum in business, while also continuing to simplify our operations.\u201d Vodafone has already said it will rebase its dividend and plans share buy-backs over two years, with \u20ac2bn from the proceeds of the Spanish business in 2025 and a further \u20ac2bn proceeds from the Italian arm in 2026. The telecoms group faces questions about the 14.6 % stake held by its largest investor Emirates Telecommunications, which the UK government has identified as a national security risk. Ministers have ordered a national security committee to be set up at Vodafone to help oversee sensitive work. However a recent report authored by three barristers including Sir Robert Buckland KC, a former lord chancellor, concluded that the UAE\u2019s stake in Vodafone raised serious concerns given UAE\u2019s intelligence gathering apparatus and poor human rights record. The barrister Ben Keith, who co-authored the report, has urged that the planned national security committee should be independent of Vodafone and include national security experts. There should also be enhanced data security and audits and also Vodafone should collaborate with human rights organisations and conduct regular assessments, the barristers suggested. Vodafone said of the report: \u201cVodafone has extensive data security and privacy measures in place. Sensitive customer data is not visible to anyone \u2013 including the group CEO \u2013 outside our specific, security-vetted customer teams. Vodafone has a long-established human rights policy, which is developed in line with international standards as well as industry-specific principles.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-26T23:01:06Z",
            "content": "Rural areas have trumped towns and cities in house price growth over the past five years, with a semi in the countryside the top-performing property type, according to data for Great Britain. The figures, issued by the mortgage lender Nationwide, showed that average house prices in predominantly rural areas rose by 22% over the period, compared with 17% in predominantly urban areas. Urban flats had typically been the weakest performers over the past five years, it said. The data captures some of the impact of the \u201crace for space\u201d sparked by the pandemic, which led to a surge in the numbers of people looking to move out of cities to rural areas, smaller towns or the coast \u2013 typically somewhere with a bigger garden, closer to open spaces, or offering more room for working from home. However, research has suggested that some of those movers subsequently sold up and moved back to the suburbs or city. Some of the top-performing rural areas include tourist hotspots such as parts of Devon and the Lake District, which suggests some of the demand may be being driven by those buying holiday and second homes, said Nationwide. Andrew Harvey, the building society\u2019s senior economist, said its analysis suggested that average house price growth in local authority areas classified as predominantly rural \u201chas continued to outpace those of other areas\u201d. Of the 349 local authorities in Great Britain, the majority (61%) are classified as predominantly urban, and just over a quarter (26%) as predominantly rural. The researchers found that rural semi-detached homes had seen the strongest price growth over the five-year period, with average values increasing by 24%. Rural terraced homes typically increased by 23% over the same period, as did urban semis, while rural detached properties were close behind at 22%. Nationwide said flats had seen \u201cconsiderably weaker\u201d growth, and this applied particularly in predominantly urban areas, where prices typically increased by 5%. The figures were based on an analysis of official UK house price data produced by HM Land Registry and others, and covers the period from December 2018 to December 2023. Earlier this year, the government unveiled new rules for short-term holiday lets in England that aimed to rein in a sector that has been described by some as \u201cout of control\u201d. \u2022 The caption to the picture was amended on 27 May 2024 because an earlier version placed Burford in Gloucestershire. It is in the neighbouring county of Oxfordshire, about two miles from the boundary."

            "date": "2024-05-22T11:48:28Z",
            "content": "The boss of Marks &amp; Spencer says he is hopeful of a \u201cgrowth story for years to come\u201d after the revitalised retailer won over 1 million more shoppers to boost profits by 41%. Stuart Machin, the chief executive, said it was \u201cthe beginnings of a new M&amp;S\u201d and there was \u201cwind in our sails and confidence that our plan is working\u201d as pre-tax profits rose to \u00a3672.5m in the year to 30 March. Sales rose 9.4% to \u00a313bn on the back of an 11.3% rise in grocery sales at established stores. The increase was not just a result of inflation, with the volume of goods sold up 5% after the group invested \u00a360m in keeping prices down. Machin said the retailer, which has 240 full-line stores and 325 food outlets, was winning over a \u201cbroad church\u201d of new customers. More under-30s are buying its lingerie than ever before, taking its market share in that product category to a new high of 38%. Shares in the group rose nearly 6% on Wednesday morning as it announced its first dividend payment to shareholders since 2019, and Machin said M&amp;S was in \u201cthe best financial health it\u2019s been in decades\u201d with debts reduced. He said the company was now aiming for \u00a3100m in extra cost cuts by 2028 as it improves efficiency by, for example, working with fewer clothing suppliers and sharpening up the way goods are delivered so that less work is required behind the scenes. The leap in profits came after \u00a3180m of cost cuts, including keeping the number of staff steady in food stores despite higher sales and lowering the cost of delivering food to stores after buying its distribution partner Gist. It has also ditched selling furniture that requires two-person delivery. M&amp;S said it was bolstering its five-year plan for cost cuts to \u00a3500m by 2028 with increases in staff pay offset by \u201cstructural cost reductions and other efficiencies\u201d \u2013 which the company says relates to more efficient deliveries to free up staff to work with customers, rather than job cuts. Other cost inflation is largely expected be offset by reduced energy costs. Machin said M&amp;S had increased its market share in clothing and homewares and was \u201cconfident we will make further progress\u201d, in a bullish prediction for the year ahead. The upmarket grocer said it had benefited from a shift towards eating at home rather than at restaurants, with sales of its \u201cdine in\u201d offer up by more than 40%, while shoppers also spent 34% more on its lowest price Remarksable Value range. Clothing and home sales increased 5.3%, helped by a 15% rise in sales of holiday wear such as swimsuits, while sales of its more expensive Autograph range for men rose 15%. Machin said M&amp;S had tried to keep clothing prices steady and would do so again in the year ahead after sales of basics including denim and knitwear rose by more than 10%. He said the group did not plan to introduce special discounts for its Sparks loyalty card holders, as done by major chains including Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s, as the group \u201cdidn\u2019t want to get into tricksy prices\u201d. He said short-term price cuts were \u201cforcing you to buy something you don\u2019t really want\u201d. M&amp;S\u2019s share of losses at Ocado Retail, its online grocery shopping joint venture, widened to \u00a337.3m, from \u00a329.5m, and M&amp;S reiterated that it did not expect to have to pay a final instalment for its share in the business, which was once expected to be \u00a3191m. Sales at M&amp;S\u2019s international stores slid by 1% at constant currency rates to \u00a3719m and Machin said it was now \u201cresetting priorities\u201d to step up progress. Clive Black, a retail analyst at M&amp;S\u2019s broker Shore Capital, said the retailer had \u201cmaterially beaten market expectations\u201d and he had upgraded his expectations for the year ahead by about 12%. The group plans to open nine new food stores in the year ahead, up from eight last year, and up to four full-line clothing and home stores, down from six last year, when it also closed seven and relocated five stores."

            "date": "2024-05-19T11:19:44Z",
            "content": "The global economy is fragmenting and a new era of protectionism has dawned. Dreams by free marketeers of a frictionless world in which goods and services moved seamlessly from country to country are dead. That was the clear message from Joe Biden\u2019s decision last week to target China with a range of new, much higher tariffs on electric vehicles and a range of other products crucial to sectors seen by the White House as vital to the future health of the US economy and to national security. It was also the message from Vladimir Putin\u2019s visit to Beijing, where he received a show of support from Xi Jinping for Russia\u2019s military action against Ukraine, which has intensified in recent weeks. There is a new cold war and it is hotting up. In themselves, Biden\u2019s new tariffs won\u2019t have much economic impact, because China exports very little steel and aluminium, and few EVs, silicon chips and solar panels to the US anyway. But as the consultancy Capital Economics has pointed out, that\u2019s because of previously announced measures introduced by Donald Trump and the fear that protectionism will be ratcheted up in the future. Republicans and Democrats both support a hawkish approach to China. The trade tension is unlikely to ease soon. Biden has made support for the green technology sector central to his plan to rebuild the US manufacturing base. The president is not prepared to see his industrial strategy undermined by a flood of cheap, and heavily subsidised, Chinese imports. Tougher protectionist measures from the US come amid signs that Beijing has abandoned, at least for now,attempts to rebalance its growth model away from exports and towards domestic consumption. China remains a high-saving, high-investment, low-consumption economy and that inevitably means that the surplus goods churned out by its factories find their way into global markets. As China\u2019s trade surplus grows ever bigger, protectionist sentiment in the US will become more pronounced. This is not quite what the US and its developed-country allies envisaged when China was admitted into the World Trade Organization in 2001. Back then the feeling was that if China could make manufactured goods more cheaply than domestic producers, then that meant higher profits for western multinationals and lower prices for western consumers. There are far fewer advocates for this pure free-trade approach in Washington and Brussels today, even though the availability of cheap Chinese EVs in the US and Europe would help meet net zero goals. In the short term, the focus will be on whether China will retaliate to Biden\u2019s tariffs with protectionist measures of its own. Beijing has thus far seemed unwilling to get involved in a tit-for-tat trade war, but will be forced to do so if Trump wins the presidency in November and makes good on his pledge to slap a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods. For now, a full-blown trade war looks unlikely but it can\u2019t be ruled out. Seen from one perspective, Washington\u2019s attempts to protect its green technology sector can be seen as evidence that the US is fighting an economic war with China that it is doomed to lose. China is growing at double the rate of the US, runs a thumping trade surplus and has cornered the market in solar panels and other green-tech products. This, though, ignores some deep structural weaknesses in the Chinese economy, not least a worrying demographic trend that will see its working-age population shrink from one billion to 400 million by the end of the century. Erik Britton, the managing director of the Fathom Consultancy, says it has been apparent for at least a decade that China\u2019s growth rate is slowing and the period of rapid catch-up with the US is over, at least for now. There is, as Britton points out, a strong correlation between economic freedom and living standards as measured by gross domestic product per head of population. Most of the countries with per-capita incomes of more than 50% of US levels are democracies, with oil producers being the exception. China is seeking to become a high per-capita income country while remaining a totalitarian state. That\u2019s not all. If there is further fracturing of the global economy into rival blocs then China is in a weaker position than the US. A US-led bloc is likely to be composed of many more \u2013 and richer \u2013 countries than a China-led bloc, despite attempts by Beijing to extend its influence overseas through the belt and road initiative. The thinking behind the tough stance being adopted by the US goes as follows. First, it was a mistake to assume that China would become more liberal once it was plugged into the global economy. Second, allowing China\u2019s rapid industrial growth has hollowed out manufacturing in the US. Third, China\u2019s model does not lend itself to free thinking and innovation, but instead relies on intellectual property being imported, often through unfair means, from the west. Fourth, it makes sense to make it as hard as possible for China to acquire this knowhow. Fifth, China\u2019s aggressive use of industrial policy needs to be matched by the US. If that all means the US becoming more interventionist and more protectionist, then so be it. In these circumstances, interventionism is justified and protectionism is good. Biden thinks parts of the US economy are too strategically important to allow them to fall into Chinese hands and he is right about that. He also thinks the US needs to build up its own industrial strength and he is right about that too. Other countries are watching closely, as well they might. There are clear lessons here for other western countries, including \u2013 and most especially \u2013 the UK."

            "date": "2024-05-31T11:46:44Z",
            "content": "UK house prices returned to growth in May amid signs of market \u201cresilience\u201d after two months of falls, according to a building society. The average property price in Britain rose 0.4% month on month to \u00a3264,249, after a similar-sized fall of 0.4% in April, Nationwide said. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cThe market appears to be showing signs of resilience in the face of ongoing affordability pressures following the rise in longer-term interest rates in recent months.\u201d The annual rate of growth more than doubled to 1.3% in May, from 0.6% in April. It comes after slight increases in mortgage rates since the start of the year slowed the housing market through March and April. According to Moneyfacts, at the end of January the average two-year fixed-rate mortgage cost 5.56%, rising to 5.92% by the end of May. Monthly data released on Friday by the Bank of England showed that activity in the housing market held steady in April, with 61,100 new mortgages approved by lenders, a figure little changed from the March tally. However, the number of people who remortgaged decreased from 33,500 to 29,900 over the same period, it said. The Bank data showed that mortgage borrowing rose in April by a net \u00a32.4bn, compared with a net increase of \u00a3500m in March. The April figure was 0.2% higher than a year before, in the first positive reading since October 2022. The \u201ceffective\u201d interest rate \u2013 the rate actually paid on newly drawn mortgages \u2013 was only marginally higher in April than it had been in March, at 4.74%, according to the data. Experts think the Bank is likely to cut interest rates in August or September on the back of cooling inflation. The headline rate eased to 2.3% in the 12 months to April 2024, down from 3.2% in the 12 months to March. Gardner added: \u201cConsumer confidence has improved noticeably over the last few months, supported by solid wage gains and lower inflation.\u201d This week a separate index, by the property website Zoopla, showed that Britain\u2019s supply of homes for sale was at its highest point in eight years, in a trend that experts said would limit house price rises for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, Nationwide research suggested the general election was unlikely to have a significant impact on house prices. Previous polls have not affected underlying market trends, the research showed, as buyers sought to continue with sales regardless of events in Westminster. Andrew Wishart, an analyst at the consultancy Capital Economics, said that despite the small headline increase recorded by the Nationwide index, the \u201cbig picture\u201d was that mortgage rates creeping higher in recent months had caused house prices to \u201cstagnate\u201d. \u201cTaking a step back, house prices have been flat for a year and a half, with the slight increase in May leaving them in line with their January 2023 level,\u201d he said."

            "content": "The UK self-driving car technology startup Wayve has secured more than $1bn (\u00a3800m) of investment to develop the next generation of artificial intelligence-powered vehicles, with the funding round led by Japan\u2019s SoftBank. The $1.05bn investment is backed by the Japanese conglomerate along with the California chipmaker Nvidia and Microsoft, and is the biggest investment to date in a European AI startup. Wayve, which was founded in London in 2017, will use the funds to develop and launch the first \u201cembodied AI\u201d technology for self-driving vehicles in the UK. Embodied AI will enable automated vehicles to learn from and interact with a real-world environment, including the ability to learn from situations that do not follow strict patterns or rules, such as unexpected actions by drivers or pedestrians. Alex Kendall, a co-founder and the chief executive of Wayve, said: \u201cThis investment will help us launch our embodied AI products and expand our operations globally. It sends a crucial signal to the market of the strength of the UK\u2019s AI ecosystem, and we look forward to watching more AI companies here thrive and scale.\u201d Kentaro Matsui, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, has taken a seat on Wayve\u2019s board as part of the investment, and said Masayoshi Son, SoftBank\u2019s founder, was personally involved. Matsui said: \u201cWe have a vision of a peaceful world, free from traffic accidents. Once we learned that we shared a common vision, our team members and Masa were excited and felt we needed to help. We are very proud that we are taking part in this effort.\u201d Wayve\u2019s current technology is integrated into six vehicle platforms including electric cars such as the Jaguar I-Pace and the Ford Mustang MachE, as part of advanced driver assistance systems. All big carmakers are investing in autonomous cars, and a number of startups have sprung up in recent years, including the Alphabet-owned Waymo and the General Motors-owned Cruise in the US. In the UK, Wayve has carried out autonomous car trials, along with the Oxfordshire startup Oxa, formerly called Oxbotica, and the Academy of Robotics. The transport secretary, Mark Harper, has predicted that self-driving cars could be on Britain\u2019s roads by 2026. The automated vehicle bill is expected to become law in the coming weeks and is designed to unlock a \u201ctransport revolution\u201d by enabling the safe deployment of self-driving cars, according to the government. The self-driving vehicle industry in the UK is still in its infancy, but the government expects it to be worth \u00a342bn and to create 38,000 skilled jobs by 2035. Between 2018 and 2022, the sector generated \u00a3475m of investment and created 1,500 new jobs. Rishi Sunak said the deal \u201canchors the UK\u2019s position as an AI superpower,\u201d adding: \u201cThe fact that a homegrown, British business has secured the biggest investment yet in a UK AI company is a testament to our leadership in this industry.\u201d"

            "content": "Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company xAI has closed a $6bn (\u00a34.7bn) investment round that will make it among the best-funded challengers to OpenAI. The startup is only a year old, but it has rapidly built its own large language model (LLM), the technology underpinning many of the recent advances in generative artificial intelligence capable of creating human-like text, pictures, video, and voices. The funding round, one of the biggest yet in the burgeoning AI field, values the company at $18bn before taking into account the $6bn investment, Musk said on X, the social network he owns. Generative AI has so far proven very expensive to develop, in part because of the need for huge amounts of computing power and energy to train LLMs. In a blogpost, xAI said: \u201cThe funds from the round will be used to take xAI\u2019s first products to market, build advanced infrastructure, and accelerate the research and development of future technologies.\u201d Musk relied upon several of the investors who have backed his other ventures, including the electric car company Tesla, and the takeover of the social network Twitter, which he renamed X. They included the venture capital investors Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, and Kingdom Holding, a Saudi investor run by Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family. The rise in investor interest in AI was kicked off by OpenAI, which used an LLM to create the chatbot ChatGPT. Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI, but in March he filed a suit against OpenAI, alleging that Sam Altman and other executives had \u201cbreached the founding agreement\u201d of the company by pursuing private commercial success instead of working to benefit humanity. OpenAI, which is working closely with the US tech company Microsoft, is facing competition from Google\u2019s Gemini, Meta\u2019s Llama and other startups such as the Amazon-backed Anthropic and France\u2019s Mistral. On Monday Musk reposted xAI\u2019s announcement on X, and wrote that the company has a \u201cmission of understanding the universe, which requires maximally rigorous pursuit of the truth, without regard to popularity or political correctness\u201d."

            "date": "2024-05-19T20:05:15Z",
            "content": "Why are universities in such financial dire straits? According to one sector leader, it\u2019s because they are losing money on two of their three income streams, while their third source is under attack by the government. \u201cWe are already in a state where teaching home students operates at a loss, doing research operates at a loss, and the international student market has been diminished by the government\u2019s rhetoric and policy. And those are the three areas where universities get their income,\u201d said Rachel Hewitt, chief executive of the MillionPlus association of modern universities that includes Bath Spa, Wolverhampton and Sunderland. \u201cSo we are in a volatile place for funding at the moment. We\u2019re seeing, across the sector, different types of universities being hard hit in terms of having to make difficult decisions to secure their future.\u201d That situation was laid bare in a report by the higher education regulator, the Office for Students, which forecast that 40% of England\u2019s universities would run budget deficits this year and that closures and mergers were on the cards. Some university leaders are warning that the position is even worse than the OfS\u2019s forecasts. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to imagine that beyond the very short horizon \u2013 maybe one or two years maximum \u2013 that the sector will be sustainable or thriving if the unit of resource stays as it is,\u201d said Prof George Holmes, vice-chancellor of the University of Bolton. \u201cAt the moment it\u2019s probably costing north of \u00a311,000 [a year] to teach a student for any university, and in the Russell Group they are quoting \u00a312-12,500 a year to teach a student. \u201cIf the unit of resource for teaching doesn\u2019t rise to that sort of level within a reasonable time horizon of one to two years, then the sector could face multiple universities in serious trouble.\u201d But so far, the sector\u2019s turmoil \u2013 which has seen more than 50 universities already announcing course closures and redundancies \u2013 has attracted little political attention. \u201cI think Labour will not want a focus on their funding policy this side of an election, because there\u2019s nothing to be gained in making it an election issue right now,\u201d said Hewitt. Holmes said he has told Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, and Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, that bailing out universities by raising tuition fees for domestic students would be politically toxic. Instead, Holmes says central government needs to fill the gap by making grants of \u00a32,000 and upwards for teaching each student in the short term. \u201cBut the next thing they would have to put in place is student number controls, or some form of arrangement to control the numbers. Because otherwise what you\u2019d get is some vying for numbers, and some universities left without students and others overflowing with students. \u201cIf I were secretary of state or a minister, in whichever government, I\u2019d say we need to stabilise the sector, and we also need to put in place student number controls so we don\u2019t destabilise it by creating a feeding frenzy for those who want to get more students to generate surpluses,\u201d Holmes said. Holmes also thinks a grant could be subsidised by a levy on international tuition, effectively redistributing some of the fees gained by more prestigious universities, which are able to charge far higher tuition fees to students from abroad. But figures are showing a steep decline in international students applying to study in the UK next year as a result of the government\u2019s earlier moves to restrict student visas. Should the government make further moves, perhaps by restricting access to the graduate visa route that allows international students to stay on for two to three years after graduations, that decline may become a collapse. Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, said universities had come to depend on international fee income, which is uncapped, as opposed to domestic tuition fees, which have hardly budged since they were set at \u00a39,000 back in 2012. \u201cOne of the big problems we\u2019ve got right now is that the tuition fee in England has basically been frozen for 10 years, and everyone understands that inflation has had a big impact and universities are not immune. Whatever happens, an incoming government \u2013 whoever forms the next government \u2013 will need to reinstate the link between the tuition fee and inflation,\u201d Stern said."

            "date": "2024-05-30T16:07:55Z",
            "content": "Political parties across Europe, including the UK, should be forced to publish the names of their private funders before elections, not after, the president of the Council of Europe\u2019s anti-corruption body has said. Unveiling the annual report of the Group of States Against Corruption (Greco), Marin Mr\u010dela, who is the justice of the supreme court of Croatia, also called on the European Union to stop using \u201cexcuses\u201d not to join the body. Joining would allow the body to monitor low- and high-level corruption in the European Commission and the European parliament, which is embroiled in several scandals, including allegations of Russian and Chinese interference. Parliamentary oversight bodies are struggling to get to grips with the scandals because most of the regulatory power lies with the member states, not the EU institution. The Belgian president, Alexander De Croo, has questioned whether the powers of the European Commission\u2019s anti-fraud unit, Olaf, need to be broadened to include foreign interference via disinformation or payments to MEPs. Mr\u010dela said that by joining Greco, the EU would \u201cshow that their opinions and actions about fighting corruption are serious\u201d and enable it to receive expert help from evaluators and rapporteurs. The EU has observer status in Greco, but refuses to become a full member. \u201cWe see their arguments,\u201d Mr\u010dela said. \u201cThey are not reasons, but excuses not to join.\u201d Asked if there should be centralised rules across the EU over transparency of party funding, he said: \u201cWe have this rule about transparency of party funding: everything should be published before the election.\u201d Greco said it was \u201cconcerned that in some countries progress is still limited concerning the application of codes of conduct for MPs, the transparency of systems for declaring assets, and the regulation of lobbying\u201d. A Guardian and Follow the Money investigation into the financing of political parties across the EU has revealed how some of the oldest democracies in Europe are the least transparent in relation to fundraising, while newer members from eastern Europe have some of the highest standards of accountability. France, which overthrew its monarchy and became a republic in 1792, does not require parties to publish the names of any donors, on the grounds of privacy, while Latvia, considered the gold standard of transparency in the EU, requires parties to publish names 15 days after funds have been received. On the general issue of corruption, Mr\u010dela said research showed that overall \u201cjudges and the prosecutors have a better understanding of the ethical issues in politics, particularly parliamentarians\u201d. He said progress in anti-corruption in some countries was \u201cvery slow\u201d and it would take years to implement Greco\u2019s recommendations on changes to laws or constitutions. He singled out Finland for \u201cvery good practice\u201d. \u201cWithout any law about financing of political parties, in 11 months they managed to implement all of the recommendations they received,\u201d he said. Hungary, he said, had come out of the non-compliance category in relation to prevention of corruption of members of parliament, judges and prosecutors, but still had a long way to go. The annual report showed Ukraine, which has applied for EU membership, had completed just over 51% of the Greco anti-corruption recommendations and partly completed a further 32%, leaving just 17% of a total of 41 recommendations yet to be incorporated into law or practice. \u201cThat is something Ukraine should be commended for, because when you are in a war it is very hard to fight [corruption] because you are fighting for your life. We are commending Ukraine on that,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2024-05-14T05:00:26Z",
            "content": "Spending on the NHS in England has risen less quickly than the Conservatives promised at the last election despite the extra demand created by the pandemic and record waiting lists, a leading thinktank has said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said increases in funding from the government had been eaten up by higher than expected inflation and, as a result, NHS day-to-day spending had grown by 2.7% a year during the current parliament \u2013 below the 3.3% pledged by Boris Johnson in 2019. The IFS said that \u201cdespite a pandemic, record waiting lists and growing rates of ill health, real-terms health spending has risen less quickly than was planned five years ago. \u201cThis breaks the habit of a lifetime: over the past 40 years, the NHS budget has almost always grown more quickly than originally planned. This parliament is the exception.\u201d At the 2019 election, the Conservatives pledged to increase spending by \u00a334bn a year by the end of the parliament. The IFS said this amounted to a 29% cash increase between 2019 and 2020 and 2024-25, which given the expected levels of inflation at the time amounted to a 3.3% annual increase in real terms day-to-day spending. The latest plans involve a bigger cash increase of 37% but much higher inflation means a real terms increase of 2.7% a year. Inflation as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) rose sharply as economies emerged from lockdowns imposed during the pandemic, peaking at 11.1% in October 2022. Last year, the government and unions thrashed out a two-year NHS pay deal after strike action. The thinktank also said the NHS was in a poor state of repair due to a lack of investment over the past decade and a half. After being cut back sharply in the 2010s, capital spending has increased in recent years \u2013 though in 2023\u201324, the capital budget in England was raided to fund day-to-day pressures, returning to the bad practice of the late 2010s. \u201cOne consequence of low capital spending is the deterioration of the NHS estate in England, where the maintenance backlog has more than doubled over the past decade,\u201d the IFS said. Although day-to-day NHS spending has undershot the plans made in 2019, the IFS said Britain\u2019s weak growth during this parliament meant health spending had grown as a share of GDP and now accounted for more than 40% of total public spending. The latest plans implied no real-terms growth for the NHS England budget from 2023\u201324 and 2024\u201325, and there are no published plans for health spending after that. The IFS said the next government would come under pressure to increase the health budget, adding that both main parties had endorsed the NHS England workforce plan, which will require real-terms funding growth of about 3.6% a year if it is to be achieved. Max Warner, an IFS economist, said: \u201cThe sheer size of the health budget means that delivering funding increases at anything like the historical average would require cuts elsewhere, even before accounting for recent promises on defence spending. \u201cNeither the Conservative party nor Labour party have been keen to set out spending plans. But the next government will have to confront this reality \u2013 and fast.\u201d Spending per person on the NHS is higher in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland than in England, although the gap has narrowed in recent decades. In 1999\u20132000, Scotland spent 22% more per person than England, Wales spent 12% more and Northern Ireland spent 15% more. But in 2019\u201320, on the eve of the pandemic, Scotland spent 3% more, while Wales and Northern Ireland each spent 7% more. A department of health and social care spokesperson said: \u201cWe are providing the NHS with record funding of nearly \u00a3165bn a year by the end of this parliament, an increase of 13% in real terms compared to 2019-20, which is making a real difference in cutting waiting lists. \u201cThe chancellor also announced at the budget that the NHS in England will receive a \u00a32.5bn day-to-day funding boost this year and a further \u00a33.4bn investment in the latest technology from 2025, helping to unlock \u00a335bn in savings.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-15T23:23:54Z",
            "content": "A long-festering split at the heart of Israel\u2019s war cabinet has burst into the open with the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, challenging the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to come up with plans for the \u201cday after\u201d the war in Gaza, and saying he would not permit any solution where Israeli military or civil governance were in the territory. Gallant\u2019s comments, immediately backed by his fellow minister Benny Gantz, plunged Israel\u2019s leadership into a highly public row, in the midst of the Gaza conflict, calling into question Gallant\u2019s future in the Israeli government and Netanyahu\u2019s fractious coalition. In uncompromising remarks, Gallant \u2013 whose firing last year by Netanyahu triggered mass protests, a political crisis and an eventual reversal by the PM \u2013 publicly demanded that Netanyahu describe plans for a \u201cday-after plan\u201d for Gaza. Gallant\u2019s comments provoked an immediate political row, with Netanyahu pushing back rapidly with a videotaped statement and a call from the far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, for Gallant to be replaced. Gallant was backed, however, by his fellow senior minister Benny Gantz, a former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, who said Gallant had spoken the \u201ctruth\u201d. At a press conference on Wednesday evening in Tel Aviv, Gallant said he had asked for an alternative governing body to Hamas to be found, and did not receive a response. In his remarks, Gallant criticised the lack of any political planning for the \u201cday after\u201d. Gallant\u2019s comments come after months of tension between the two men and recent reports in the Hebrew media that senior IDF officers had become concerned that the lack of an alternative to Hamas was forcing the IDF to return and fight in areas where they claimed Hamas had already been defeated, including northern Gaza, which has seen heavy fighting this week. \u201cAs early as October 7, the military establishment said that it was necessary to work towards finding an alternative to Hamas,\u201d Gallant said, adding, \u201cthe end of the military campaign is a political decision. The day after Hamas will only be achieved by actors who replace Hamas. This is first and foremost an Israeli interest.\u201d Gallant said that military planning \u201cwas not raised for a discussion, and worse, no alternative was brought in its place. A military-civilian regime in Gaza is a bad and dangerous alternative for the state of Israel. \u201cI will not agree to the establishment of a military government in Gaza,\u201d he said, adding a \u201ccivilian-military regime in Gaza will become the main effort in there and come at the expense of other arenas. We will pay for it in blood and victims \u2013 and it will come at a heavy economic cost.\u201d The comments by Gallant appeared to be the culmination of growing frustration with Netanyahu among Israel\u2019s military leadership. Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh insisted on Wednesday that the militant group will be involved in deciding postwar rule in Gaza along with other Palestinian factions. \u201cWe say that the Hamas movement is here to stay \u2026 and it will be the movement and all national [Palestinian] factions who will decide the postwar rule in Gaza,\u201d he said in a televised address. Elsewhere, Gallant said he would not support a controversial plan for compulsory enlistment of ultra-Orthodox Jews, appearing to throw down a direct challenge to Netanyahu to fire him. Replying to Gallant, Netanyahu once again ruled out a Palestinian administration in Gaza while Hamas still exists, adding that Hamas\u2019s destruction must be pursued \u201cwithout excuses\u201d. Netanyahu said: \u201cAfter the terrible massacre, I ordered the destruction of Hamas. IDF fighters and the security forces are fighting for this. As long as Hamas remains, no other actor will run Gaza \u2013 certainly not the Palestinian Authority.\u201d Ben-Gvir and the communications minister, Shlomo Karhi, quickly called for Gallant to be fired from his position. \u201cSuch a defence minister must be replaced in order to achieve the war\u2019s goals,\u201d said Ben-Gvir, adding: \u201cFrom [Gallant\u2019s] point of view, there is no difference between whether Gaza will be controlled by Israeli soldiers or whether Hamas murderers control it. This is the essence of the defence minister\u2019s conception, which failed on October 7 and continues to fail even now.\u201d Netanyahu will be acutely aware of the huge political risks of firing Gallant for a second time after his previous forced climbdown."

There is no one in the people of Israel who has not felt, since October 7th, that a part of them is missing. The hostages are an integral part of us, and all of us, the entire people of Israel, want them home. To you, the government of Israel and the war cabinet: do not rest, turn every stone, and exhaust every possibility so that we can reach the Shavuot holiday truly whole, with one heart, with all our brothers and sisters, the captives and hostages, at home! The living to their families and the murdered to burial. Here are some images coming through the newswires from Israel, where fresh protests have broken out as Israelis take to the streets in chants for the war to end and for hostages to be released: Thousands of Israelis are out protesting in Tel Aviv and more widely in other parts of Israel, demanding an end to the war as well as urgent government action to bring home the remaining hostages held in Gaza. The fresh demonstrations were stretching into the evening. At one gathering, protesters observed a minute\u2019s silence in Tel Aviv\u2019s Hostages Square in honour of the captives whose bodies had been recovered by Israeli troops this month, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. The Israeli army said on Friday that troops had retrieved the bodies of three hostages in an overnight operation in Jabalia in northern Gaza. Another protest, calling for the resignation of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and an early election, was held nearby. The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead. Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,903 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory\u2019s health ministry. It\u2019s just after 11pm in Gaza City and Jerusalem and just after 4pm on the east coast of the United States, from where we are currently helming this blog. Here\u2019s where things stand: Although Joe Biden boasted about US aid efforts in Gaza during his West Point military academy commencement speech, saying that the US army and navy have built a temporary pier in the Mediterranean \u201cin record time\u201d to deliver aid to Palestinians, efforts on the ground tell a different story. On Saturday, US Centcom announced that four US army vessels were affected by \u201cheavy sea states\u201d. \u201cThe vessels broke free from their moorings and two vessels are now anchored on the beach near the pier. The third and fourth vessels are beached on the coast of Israel near Ashkelon,\u201d US Centcom said. PalTel, or Palestine Telecommunications, announced internet blackouts across Gaza City and the northern Gaza Strip due to Israeli bombardment. In a post on X on Saturday evening, PalTel said that its crew was working on restoring services as quickly as possible. A Hamas official denied on Saturday Israeli media reports that Gaza ceasefire talks would resume in Cairo on Tuesday, according to Reuters. \u201cThere is no date,\u201d the Hamas official said, Reuters reports. The International Court of Justice\u2019s order to Israel does not rule out the entire offensive, Israel says. Following the ICJ\u2019s ruling on Friday ordering Israel to halt its invasion on Rafah, an Israeli official told Reuters anonymously: \u201cThe order in regard to the Rafah operation is not a general order.\u201d Tzachi Hanegbi, Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s national security adviser, denied that Israel, which has killed nearly 36,000 Palestinians since October, is committing genocide in Gaza. Hanegbi\u2019s comments come as Israel becomes increasingly isolated on the world stage as several European countries including Spain, Norway and Ireland moved to back Palestinian statehood this week amid Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) has once again reiterated its calls for all land routes to be opened in order for humanitarian aid to be delivered into Gaza. In a video posted on X, Ocha employee Olga Cherevko said: \u201cWe continue to face immense challenges amid extreme insecurity and running out of supplies. Imagine how much more effective we could be if all land routes were to open and this war finally ended?\u201d The Spanish defence minister said on Saturday that the conflict in Gaza is a \u201creal genocide\u201d, as relations between Israel and Spain worsen after Madrid\u2019s decision to recognise a Palestinian state, reports Reuters. Reuters said it could not immediately reach Israeli officials for comment on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. Israel has strongly rejected accusations made against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that it is committing a genocide against Palestinians, saying it is waging war on the Hamas militant group that attacked Israel on 7 October. The Spanish government demanded on Saturday that Israel comply with an order by the top UN court to immediately stop its bombardment and ground assault on Rafah. \u201cThe precautionary measures set out by the ICJ, including that Israel should cease its military offensive in Rafah, are compulsory. Israel must comply with them,\u201d Spanish foreign minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares wrote on X. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, spoke with Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz over the phone about new efforts to achieve a ceasefire and reopen the Rafah border crossing, Washington said. The brief statement from Blinken\u2019s office made no mention of the international court of justice\u2019s (ICJ) ruling, while a White House spokesperson said that \u201cwe\u2019ve been clear and consistent on our position on Rafah\u201d. French president Emmanuel Macron received the prime minister of Qatar and the Saudi, Egyptian and Jordanian foreign ministers on Friday \u201cto press for a ceasefire\u201d, according to Cairo. The French presidency said they held talks on the Gaza war and ways to set up a Palestinian state alongside Israel. The UK government has criticised the ICJ for ordering Israel to immediately halt its military assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, saying the ruling would strengthen Hamas. \u201cThe reason there isn\u2019t a pause in the fighting is because Hamas turned down a very generous hostage deal from Israel. The intervention of these courts \u2013 including the ICJ today \u2013 will strengthen the view of Hamas that they can hold on to hostages and stay in Gaza,\u201d a UK foreign ministry spokesperson said late on Friday. The spokesperson added: \u201cAnd if that happens there won\u2019t be either peace, or a two-state solution.\u201d Italian foreign minister Antonio Tajani announced on Saturday that Rome would resume funding for the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), at a meeting with Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa. Tajani said he had informed Mustafa that Rome had \u201carranged new funding for the Palestinian population, of a total of \u20ac35m ($38m)\u201d. He said: \u201cOf this, \u20ac5m will be allocated to Unrwa.\u201d The remaining \u20ac30m will be allocated to Italy\u2019s \u201cFood for Gaza\u201d initiative in coordination with UN aid agencies. In spite of the ICJ ruling, Israel carried out strikes on the Gaza Strip on Saturday morning as fighting raged between the army and Hamas\u2019s armed wing. Palestinian witnesses and AFP teams reported Israeli strikes in Rafah and the central city of Deir al-Balah. Residents and civil emergency services said Israeli tanks entered deep into the area of Jabalia, destroying dozens of houses, shops and roads. The Israeli military said its troops in Jabalia \u201celiminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat and aerial strikes\u201d. Palestinian medical teams were unable to reach the area, where they believed more people had been killed. Ten Palestinians, including children and women, were killed and several others injured on Saturday in an Israeli airstrike on a house in the city of Beit Hanoun, north of the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. The news agency reported that medical sources had confirmed the death toll and said that 17 others had sustained injuries in the attack. G7 finance leaders will call on Israel to maintain correspondent banking links between Israeli and Palestinian banks to allow vital transactions, trade and services to continue, according to a draft joint statement seen by Reuters on Saturday. The statement, which Reuters says is to be released at the end of a G7 finance ministers and central bank governors\u2019 meeting in northern Italy, also calls for Israel \u201cto release withheld clearance revenues to the Palestinian Authority, in view of its urgent fiscal needs\u201d. Israel\u2019s invasion of Rafah appears to continue as hostage bodies are recovered. The Guardian\u2019s Bethan McKernan reports: Israel appears to be forging ahead with its offensive on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, despite a new ruling from the UN\u2019s top court to halt the assault, which it said is worsening an already \u201cdisastrous\u201d humanitarian crisis. About 900,000 people have fled Rafah, previously the shelter of last resort for 85% of the Gaza Strip\u2019s 2.3 million people, since the Israeli ground operation in the area began on 6 May. At the same time, deliveries of humanitarian supplies and fuel to the Palestinian territory have slowed to a trickle, with the two main aid crossings \u2013 Rafah, on the border with Egypt, and nearby Kerem Shalom, a goods crossing linking Gaza with Israel \u2013 effectively blocked by the fighting. On Friday, the International Court of Justice in the Hague (ICJ), which arbitrates disputes between nations, made its third intervention in the conflict so far, ordering Israel to immediately stop its Rafah operation. The court president, Nawaf Salam, said when announcing the 13-2 majority ruling that Israel is obliged under the UN\u2019s genocide convention not to inflict \u201cconditions of life that would bring about [the Palestinian people\u2019s] physical destruction in whole or in part\u201d. But Israeli airstrikes on the south and eastern edges of Rafah appeared to escalate even as the ICJ delivered its decision, residents and medics said, as Israeli ground troops edge closer to the overcrowded city centre. Another 30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire in the last 24 hours, Palestinian medics reported on Saturday; battles are also ongoing in northern and central parts of the Strip such as Jabalia and Zeitoun, where forces belonging to the Palestinian militant group Hamas have regrouped.

The Guardian\u2019s Rafqa Touma reports: \u201cMy core worry is dying, being killed,\u201d Surya McEwen says. The Australian care worker is calling from a hotel room in Istanbul, where he is waiting with doctors, nurses, lawyers and activists to set sail on the Gaza \u201cfreedom flotilla\u201d, which hopes to deliver aid to Palestinians under Israeli bombardment. Two other Australians, Daniel Coward and Helen O\u2019Sullivan, are also waiting to sail with the flotilla. The mission \u2013 challenging Israel\u2019s control over the entry of humanitarian assistance into Gaza \u2013 involves a hierarchy of worry. After the fear of death comes the fear of being arrested, McEwen says. \u201cThe way that happens, when it happens, is not a happy picture,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that is personal worry in the context of millions of people in unimaginably devastating situations. Our worry is more for the people in Gaza and the West Bank than it is for ourselves.\u201d The plan is for one large cargo ship and two passenger ships to sail from Istanbul, explains James Godfrey, a spokesperson for Free Gaza Australia, which is a branch of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition. For the full story, click here: PalTel, or Palestine Telecommunications, announced internet blackouts across Gaza City and the northern Gaza Strip due to Israeli bombardment. In a post on X on Saturday evening, PalTel said that its crew was working on restoring services as quickly as possible. Since Israel launched its war on Gaza last October, communication blackouts have been frequent across the strip, leaving thousands of surviving Palestinians trapped in the dark and unable to communicate with their families amid Israel\u2019s aerial bombardment. A Hamas official denied on Saturday Israeli media reports that Gaza ceasefire talks would resume in Cairo on Tuesday, according to Reuters. \u201cThere is no date,\u201d the Hamas official said, Reuters reports. The International Court of Justice\u2019s order to Israel does not rule out the entire offensive, Israel says. Following the ICJ\u2019s ruling on Friday ordering Israel to halt its invasion on Rafah, an Israeli official told Reuters anonymously: \u201cThe order in regard to the Rafah operation is not a general order.\u201d Also, speaking to Israel\u2019s N12 TV on Saturday, Tzachi Hanegbi, Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s national security adviser, denied that Israel, which has killed nearly 36,000 Palestinians since October, is committing genocide in Gaza, saying: What they are asking us, is not to commit genocide in Rafah. We did not commit genocide and we will not commit genocide \u2026 According to international law, we have the right to defend ourselves and the evidence is that the court is not preventing us from continuing to defend ourselves,. Hanegbi\u2019s comments come as Israel becomes increasingly isolated on the world stage as several European countries including Spain, Norway and Ireland moved to back Palestinian statehood this week amid Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. Earlier this year, South Africa launched a case against Israel in the ICJ, accusing it of carrying out genocide in Gaza where more than 2 million Palestinian survivors have been forcibly displaced to \u201csafe zones\u201d that Israel has repeatedly attacked. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) has once again reiterated its calls for all land routes to be opened in order for humanitarian aid to be delivered into Gaza. In a video posted on X, Ocha employee Olga Cherevko said: When a crisis is as severe as it is in Gaza, what does the response look like? With resources scant and supply network unreliable, humanitarian partners have to be quick and creative \u2026 We continue to face immense challenges amid extreme insecurity and running out of supplies. Imagine how much more effective we could be if all land routes were to open and this war finally ended? During his West Point military academy speech, Joe Biden briefly mentioned the aid drops carried out by the US air force across Gaza. \u201cThe US air force has conducted food drops bringing tens of thousands of meals to people in Gaza,\u201d Biden said. The aid drops come as more than 2 million surviving Palestinians face dire humanitarian conditions across Gaza as a result of Israel\u2019s strikes across the strip that have killed nearly 36,000 Palestinians since October. Israeli restrictions on aid entering Gaza have made life across the narrow strip extremely difficult, with the UN announcing earlier this month that there is a \u201cfull-blown famine\u201d now in northern Gaza. In addition to severe shortages in fuel that have left the few remaining hospitals to operate in the dark, Palestinians are facing restricted access to medical supplies, water and food. As Joe Biden boasted about US aid efforts in Gaza during his West Point military academy commencement speech, saying that the US army and navy has built a temporary pier in the Mediterranean \u201cin record time\u201d to deliver aid to Palestinians, efforts on the ground tell a different story. On Saturday, US Centcom announced that four US army vessels were affected by \u201cheavy sea states\u201d: The vessels broke free from their moorings and two vessels are now anchored on the beach near the pier. The third and fourth vessels are beached on the coast of Israel near Ashkelon. Efforts to recover the vessels are under way with assistance from the Israeli navy. No US personnel will enter Gaza and no injuries have been reported. The pier remains fully functional, US Centcom added, saying that it will release additional updates as they come. The Spanish defence minister said on Saturday that the conflict in Gaza is a \u201creal genocide\u201d, as relations between Israel and Spain worsen after Madrid\u2019s decision to recognise a Palestinian state, reports Reuters. Reuters said it could not immediately reach Israeli officials for comment on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. Israel has strongly rejected accusations made against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that it is committing a genocide against Palestinians, saying it is waging war on the Hamas militant group that attacked Israel on 7 October. According to Reuters, the remark by Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles in an interview with TVE state television echoed a comment by Spanish deputy prime minister Yolanda D\u00edaz, who earlier this week also described the Gaza conflict as a genocide. \u201cWe cannot ignore what is happening in Gaza, which is a real genocide,\u201d Robles said in the interview, during which she also discussed the Russian invasion of Ukraine and conflicts in Africa. Reuters reports that Robles also said Madrid\u2019s recognition of Palestine was not a move against Israel, adding that it was designed to help \u201cend violence in Gaza\u201d. \u201cThis is not against anyone, this is not against the Israeli state, this is not against the Israelis, who are people we respect,\u201d she said. Spain, along with Ireland and Norway, said this week it would recognise a Palestinian state on 28 May, prompting an angry response from Israel, which said it amounted to a \u201creward for terrorism\u201d and recalled its ambassadors from the three capitals. Judges at the ICJ, the top UN court, on Friday ordered Israel to immediately halt its military assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, in a landmark emergency ruling in the case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of genocide. Joe Biden spoke at the 2024 West Point military academy commencement ceremony, where he briefly mentioned the three US servicemembers killed in a Jordan drone attack in January, saying: I have always been willing to use force when required to protect our nation, our allies, our core interest. When anyone targets American troops, we will deliver justice to them. That happened earlier this year, when three heroic members of the US army reserve were killed in an unmanned drone attack in north-east Jordan. In response, we launched dozens of successful airstrikes against Iran-backed militants. And we\u2019ll never forget, honor the memory of those warriors who gave their lives in the fight against terrorism. Biden did not mention the ICJ\u2019s latest ruling in which the UN\u2019s top court ordered an immediate halt to Israel\u2019s ground invasion of Rafah, nor the growing humanitarian crisis faced by 2 million Palestinians as a result of Israel\u2019s deadly attacks across the strip, which have killed nearly 36,000 Palestinians in the last six months. It is 5.45pm in Gaza and Tel Aviv. I will shortly be handing the Israel-Gaza war live blog over to the US team. But first, here are the key developments from today: The Spanish government demanded on Saturday that Israel comply with an order by the top UN court to immediately stop its bombardment and ground assault on Rafah. \u201cThe precautionary measures set out by the ICJ, including that Israel should cease its military offensive in Rafah, are compulsory. Israel must comply with them,\u201d Spanish foreign minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares wrote on X. \u201cThe same goes for a ceasefire, the release of the hostages and access for humanitarian aid [to Gaza],\u201d he wrote, adding that \u201cthe suffering of the people of Gaza and the violence must end\u201d. Mediated negotiations between Israel and Hamas to reach a deal to free Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip are due to restart next week, an official with knowledge of the matter said on Saturday. According to Reuters, the decision to restart the talks came after the head of Israel\u2019s the Mossad intelligence agency met the head of the CIA and the prime minister of Qatar, which has been a mediator, said the source, who declined to be identified by name or nationality given the sensitivity of the issue. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, spoke with Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz over the phone about new efforts to achieve a ceasefire and reopen the Rafah border crossing, Washington said. The brief statement from Blinken\u2019s office made no mention of the international court of justice\u2019s (ICJ) ruling, while a White House spokesperson said that \u201cwe\u2019ve been clear and consistent on our position on Rafah.\u201d French president Emmanuel Macron received the prime minister of Qatar and the Saudi, Egyptian and Jordanian foreign ministers on Friday \u201cto press for a ceasefire\u201d, according to Cairo. The French presidency said they held talks on the Gaza war and ways to set up a Palestinian state alongside Israel. The UK government has criticised the ICJ for ordering Israel to immediately halt its military assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, saying the ruling would strengthen Hamas. \u201cThe reason there isn\u2019t a pause in the fighting is because Hamas turned down a very generous hostage deal from Israel.

In spite of the ICJ ruling, Israel carried out strikes on the Gaza Strip on Saturday morning as fighting raged between the army and Hamas\u2019s armed wing. Palestinian witnesses and AFP teams reported Israeli strikes in Rafah and the central city of Deir al-Balah. The Kuwait Speciality hospital in Rafah pleaded for fuel deliveries on Saturday \u201cto ensure its continued operation\u201d, saying it was the only one in Rafah governorate still receiving patients. Israeli forces killed more than 30 people in new attacks in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian medical officals said on Saturday. They do not distinguish between civilian and militant casualties. The Israeli military said it had carried out \u201coperational activity in specific areas of Rafah\u201d on Friday, including killing militants, dismantling part of Hamas\u2019s tunnel system, and locating stashes of weapons. Residents and civil emergency services said Israeli tanks entered deep into the area of Jabalia, destroying dozens of houses, shops, and roads. The Israeli military said its troops in Jabalia \u201celiminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat and aerial strikes\u201d. Palestinian medical teams were unable to reach the area, where they believed more people were killed. Hamas and Islamic Jihad said their fighters had fired anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs at Israeli troops in the north. At least 35,903 Palestinians have been killed and 80,420 injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, according to the Gaza health ministry\u2019s latest statement on Saturday. The Hamas-run health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Ten Palestinians, including children and women, were killed and several others injured on Saturday in an Israeli airstrike on a house in the city of Beit Hanoun, north of the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. The news agency reported that medical sources had confirmed the death toll and said that 17 others had sustained injuries in the attack. The Guardian has been unable to independently verify the report. G7 finance leaders will call on Israel to maintain correspondent banking links between Israeli and Palestinian banks to allow vital transactions, trade and services to continue, according to a draft joint statement seen by Reuters on Saturday. The statement, which Reuters say is to be released at the end of a G7 finance ministers and central bank governors\u2019 meeting in northern Italy, also calls for Israel \u201cto release withheld clearance revenues to the Palestinian Authority, in view of its urgent fiscal needs\u201d. An Israeli military strike targeted a family home in Gaza City\u2019s Sabra neighbourhood, killing a woman and injuring other people, reported Al Jazeera on Saturday. It attributed the information to \u201ccolleagues on the ground\u201d. The publication, citing the Palestinian news agency Wafa, reported that \u201cnumerous other neighbourhoods of Gaza City have come under heavy artillery shelling \u2026 including Sheikh Ajlin, Tal al-Hawa and Zeitoun\u201d. UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths described Friday\u2019s ICJ ruling as \u201ca moment of clarity\u201d, in a post on social media site X. \u201cAt a time when the people of Gaza are staring down famine \u2026 it is more critical than ever to heed the calls made over the last seven months: Release the hostages. Agree a ceasefire. End this nightmare,\u201d he wrote. An Israeli drone strike in central Syria killed two fighters from Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah movement on Saturday, a war monitor said. \u201cAn Israeli drone fired two missiles at a Hezbollah car and truck near the town of Qusayr in Homs province, as they were on their way to al-Dabaa military airport, killing at least two Hezbollah fighters and wounding others,\u201d said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. A French court has found three Syrian officials of the regime of Bashar al-Assad guilty of crimes against humanity and war crimes, sentencing them in absentia to life imprisonment on Friday after a landmark trial in Paris. A car explosion killed one person in Damascus on Saturday, the official Syrian news agency Sana reported, without identifying the victim. Sana quoted a police official as saying \u201cone person was killed when an explosive device exploded in their car in the Mazzeh district\u201d. It did not provide any other details. Yemen\u2019s Houthis postponed the release of about 100 prisoners belonging to government forces that had previously been announced to take place on Saturday. The head of the Houthi Prisoner Affairs Committee, Abdul Qader al-Murtada, said on X that the delay was caused by \u201ctechnical reasons\u201d. Further to the earlier report that the Houthis had postponed the release of about 100 prisoners belonging to government forces that had previously been announced to take place on Saturday (see 14.07 BST), Reuters has published some additional information. The head of the Houthi Prisoner Affairs Committee, Abdul Qader al-Murtada, said on X that the delay was caused by \u201ctechnical reasons\u201d. Al-Murtada said on Friday that the group would release more than 100 prisoners in what he called \u201ca unilateral humanitarian initiative\u201d. According to Reuters, the Houthis, an Iran-aligned movement that controls part of Yemen, last released prisoners in April 2023 in an exchange of 250 Houthis for 70 government forces. Israeli forces killed more than 30 people in new attacks in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian medics said on Saturday, reports Reuters. The Israeli military said it had carried out \u201coperational activity in specific areas of Rafah\u201d on Friday, including killing militants, dismantling part of Hamas\u2019s tunnel system, and locating stashes of weapons. So far, fighting has taken place on Rafah\u2019s southern edge and eastern districts, away from the most populated areas, reports Reuters. The US, has called on Israel not to enter more central neighbourhoods, saying Israel has yet to show a credible plan for how this can be done without causing mass casualties. One Rafah resident, who asked not to be named, told Reuters: \u201cThe occupation forces keep the city under bombing, not only east where they invaded but at the center and the western sides, they want to scare people to leave the whole city.\u201d Reuters also reports that farther north in the coastal territory, where the Israeli military says it is trying to prevent Hamas from reestablishing its hold, Palestinian medical workers reported Israeli airstrikes that they said killed at least 17 people. A total of 31 Palestinians were killed in the past day in the Gaza Strip, according to local medical officials. They do not distinguish between civilian and militant casualties. Hamas, which governs Gaza, and the smaller armed group Islamic Jihad said their fighters had fired anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs at Israeli troops in the north. According to Reuters, residents and civil emergency services said Israeli tanks entered deep into the area of Jabalia, destroying dozens of houses, shops, and roads. The Israeli military said its troops in Jabalia \u201celiminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat and aerial strikes.\u201d Reuters reports that Palestinian medical teams were unable to reach the area, where they believed more people were killed. Yemen\u2019s Houthis postponed the release of about 100 prisoners belonging to government forces that had previously been announced to take place on Saturday, according to a Reuters eyewitness. At least 35,903 Palestinians have been killed and 80,420 injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, according to the Gaza health ministry\u2019s latest statement on Saturday. The Hamas-run health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Mediated negotiations between Israel and Hamas to reach a deal to free Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip are due to restart next week, an official with knowledge of the matter said on Saturday. According to Reuters, the decision to restart the talks came after the head of Israel\u2019s the Mossad intelligence agency met with the head of the CIA and the prime minister of Qatar, which has been a mediator, said the source, who declined to be identified by name or nationality given the sensitivity of the issue. \u201cAt the end of the meeting, it was decided that in the coming week negotiations will open based on new proposals led by the mediators, Egypt and Qatar and with active US involvement,\u201d the source said. The Spanish government demanded on Saturday that Israel comply with an order by the top UN court to immediately stop its bombardment and ground assault on Rafah, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). According to AFP, Spain stressed that the ruling on Friday by the international court of justice (ICJ) was legally binding. \u201cThe precautionary measures set out by the ICJ, including that Israel should cease its military offensive in Rafah, are compulsory. Israel must comply with them,\u201d Spanish foreign minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares wrote on X. \u201cThe same goes for a ceasefire, the release of the hostages and access for humanitarian aid [to Gaza],\u201d he wrote, adding that \u201cthe suffering of the people of Gaza and the violence must end\u201d. Spain is one of the European countries to have been most critical of Israel over the war in Gaza. On Wednesday, Spain, Ireland and Norway said their governments would recognise a Palestinian state from next week. Israel summoned their envoys to \u201creprimand\u201d them for the decision and on Friday said it would ban Spain\u2019s consulate in Jerusalem from helping Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. The UK government has criticised the international court of justice (ICJ) for ordering Israel to immediately halt its military assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, saying the ruling would strengthen Hamas, reports Reuters. The ICJ, which is the highest UN body for hearing disputes between states, made the emergency ruling on Friday in South Africa\u2019s case accusing Israel of genocide. \u201cThe reason there isn\u2019t a pause in the fighting is because Hamas turned down a very generous hostage deal from Israel. The intervention of these courts \u2013 including the ICJ today \u2013 will strengthen the view of Hamas that they can hold on to hostages and stay in Gaza,\u201d a UK foreign ministry spokesperson said late on Friday, according to Reuters. The spokesperson added: \u201cAnd if that happens there won\u2019t be either peace, or a two-state solution.\u201d The ICJ, or world court, has no means to enforce its orders, but the ruling highlighted Israel\u2019s global isolation over its military campaign in Gaza. An Israeli drone strike in central Syria killed two fighters from Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah movement on Saturday, a war monitor said, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cAn Israeli drone fired two missiles at a Hezbollah car and truck near the town of Qusayr in Homs province, as they were on their way to al-Dabaa military airport, killing at least two Hezbollah fighters and wounding others,\u201d said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. AFP report that it was the third strike against Hezbollah targets in Syria in about a week. On Monday, Israeli strikes in the Qusayr area, which is close to the Lebanese border, killed eight pro-Iranian fighters, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitor with a network of sources in Syria. At least one Hezbollah fighter was among those killed, a source from Hezbollah told AFP at the time. Another strike, on 18 May, targeted \u201ca Hezbollah commander and his companion\u201d, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. It did not report any casualties. Israel rarely comments on individual strikes in Syria but has repeatedly said it will not allow Iran to expand its presence there. Ten Palestinians, including children and women, were killed and several others injured on Saturday in an Israeli airstrike on a house in the city of Beit Hanoun, north of the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. Wafa report that medical sources had confirmed the death toll and said that 17 others had sustained injuries in the attack. The Guardian has been unable to independently verify the report. The Kuwait Speciality hospital in Rafah pleaded for fuel deliveries on Saturday \u201cto ensure its continued operation\u201d, saying it was the only one in Rafah governorate still receiving patients, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said on social media site X on Friday that the situation had reached \u201ca moment of clarity\u201d. \u201cAt a time when the people of Gaza are staring down famine \u2026 it is more critical than ever to heed the calls made over the last seven months: Release the hostages. Agree a ceasefire. End this nightmare,\u201d he wrote. Kim Willsher is a foreign correspondent based in Paris. A French court has found three Syrian officials of the regime of Bashar al-Assad guilty of crimes against humanity and war crimes, sentencing them in absentia to life imprisonment on Friday after a landmark trial in Paris. The verdicts against Ali Mamlouk, head of the Syrian secret services and security adviser to Assad, Jamil Hassan, who was head of the Syrian air force intelligence unit until 2019 and a member of Assad\u2019s entourage, and Abdel Salam Mahmoud, intelligence director at the notorious Mezzeh detention centre, send a strong message about the long arm of international justice. The judges ordered that international arrest warrants against the three officials should remain in force. The verdict gives some hope of justice for the families of thousands of Syrians believed to have been tortured to death by intelligence officials working for the Damascus regime. Mamlouk, 78, Hassan, 72, and Mahmoud, who is in his early 60s, were charged with complicity in the arrest, torture and death of student Patrick Dabbagh, 20, and his father, Mazzen, 48, both Franco-Syrians.

It attributes the information to \u201ccolleagues on the ground\u201d. The publication, citing the Palestinian news agency Wafa, reports that \u201cnumerous other neighbourhoods of Gaza City have come under heavy artillery shelling \u2026 including Sheikh Ajlin, Tal al-Hawa and Zeitoun\u201d. My colleague, Rafqa Touma, who is a reporter for Guardian Australia has written about the Australians hoping to set sail and deliver aid to the people of Gaza on the \u201cfreedom flotilla\u201d. You can read the full news feature here: G7 finance leaders will call on Israel to maintain correspondent banking links between Israeli and Palestinian banks to allow vital transactions, trade and services to continue, according to a draft joint statement seen by Reuters on Saturday. The statement, which Reuters say is to be released at the end of a G7 finance ministers and central bank governors\u2019 meeting in northern Italy, also calls for Israel \u201cto release withheld clearance revenues to the Palestinian Authority, in view of its urgent fiscal needs\u201d. Reuters report that the statement echoes a warning on Thursday from US treasury secretary Janet Yellen, who said the failure to renew a soon-to-expire banking waiver would cut off a critical lifeline for the Palestinian territories amid a devastating conflict in Gaza. \u201cWe call on Israel to take the necessary measures to ensure that correspondent banking services between Israeli and Palestinian banks remain in place, so that vital financial transactions and critical trade and services continue,\u201d the draft statement said, according to Reuters. Reuters report that the G7 finance leaders also called for the removal or relaxation of other measures \u201cthat have negatively impacted commerce to avoid further exacerbating the economic situation in the West Bank\u201d. Italian foreign minister Antonio Tajani announced on Saturday that Rome would resume funding for the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), at a meeting with Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa. \u201cItaly has decided to resume financing specific projects intended for assistance to Palestinian refugees but only after rigorous controls that guarantee that not even a penny risks ending up supporting terrorism,\u201d he said, according to Agence France- Presse (AFP). According to AFP, Mustafa was also scheduled to meet Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni on what was his first trip to Europe since being appointed by Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas in March. Tajani, whose country holds the G7 presidency this year, offered his government\u2019s \u201cfull support\u201d to the Palestinian Authority. \u201cWe are also committed as a G7 presidency to working towards a period of peace. We strongly ask for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza,\u201d he said. AFP reports that Tajani said he had informed Mustafa that Rome had \u201carranged new funding for the Palestinian population, of a total of \u20ac35m ($38m)\u201d. \u201cOf this, \u20ac5m will be allocated to Unrwa,\u201d he said. The remaining \u20ac30m will be allocated to Italy\u2019s \u201cFood for Gaza\u201d initiative in coordination with UN aid agencies. Unrwa, which coordinates nearly all aid to Gaza, has been in crisis since January, when Israel accused about a dozen of its 13,000 Gaza employees of being involved in the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas. That led many nations, including top donor the US, to abruptly suspend funding to the agency, threatening its efforts to deliver aid in Gaza, although several have since resumed payments. An independent review of Unrwa, led by French former foreign minister Catherine Colonna, found some \u201cneutrality-related issues\u201d but said Israel had \u201cyet to provide supporting evidence\u201d for its leading allegations. It also said Unrwa was \u201cirreplaceable and indispensable to Palestinians\u2019 human and economic development\u201d and was, for many, \u201ca humanitarian lifeline\u201d. Here are some of the latest images on the newswires: A car explosion killed one person in Damascus on Saturday, the official Syrian news agency Sana reported, without identifying the victim. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), Sana quoted a police official as saying \u201cone person was killed when an explosive device exploded in their car in the Mazzeh district\u201d. It did not provide any other details. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor with a network of sources on the ground, said three vehicles caught fire in the area. Efforts have resumed to seek the first ceasefire in Gaza since a week-long truce in November that saw more than 100 hostages released in exchange for 240 Palestinian hostages held in Israeli jails, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). CIA chief Bill Burns was expected to meet Israeli representatives in Paris in a bid to relaunch negotiations, a western source close to the issue said, according to AFP. Separately, French president Emmanuel Macron received the prime minister of Qatar and the Saudi, Egyptian and Jordanian foreign ministers on Friday \u201cto press for a ceasefire\u201d, according to Cairo. The French presidency said they held talks on the Gaza war and ways to set up a Palestinian state alongside Israel. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, also spoke with Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz about new efforts to achieve a ceasefire and reopen the Rafah border crossing, Washington said. Ceasefire talks involving US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators ended shortly after Israel launched the Rafah operation, though Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office this week said the war cabinet had asked the Israeli delegation \u201cto continue negotiations for the return of the hostages\u201d, reports AFP. My colleague, Patrick Wintour, who is diplomatic editor for the Guardian, has written an analysis piece on how the US and the UK will reject the international court of justice order directing Israel to end its offensive on Rafah after slowly blurring their red lines that once stated that they could not support a military offensive in the southern Gaza city. You can read the full piece here: Israel bombed the Gaza Strip, including Rafah, on Saturday, despite an order from the UN\u2019s top court for it to \u201cimmediately halt\u201d its military offensive in the southern city, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The Hague-based ICJ, whose orders are legally binding but lack direct enforcement mechanisms, also instructed Israel to keep open the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza, which Israel closed before sending troops and tanks into the besieged city and crossing earlier this month. Israel gave no indication it was preparing to change course in Rafah, insisting the court had got it wrong. In spite of the ICJ ruling, Israel carried out strikes on the Gaza Strip on Saturday morning as fighting raged between the army and Hamas\u2019s armed wing, reports AFP. Palestinian witnesses and AFP teams reported Israeli strikes in Rafah and the central city of Deir al-Balah. \u201cWe hope that the court\u2019s decision will put pressure on Israel to end this war of extermination because there is nothing left here,\u201d Oum Mohammad al-Ashqa, a Palestinian woman from Gaza City displaced to Deir al-Balah by the war, told AFP. Mohammed Saleh, also interviewed by AFP in the central Gazan city, said, \u201cIsrael is a state that considers itself above the law. Therefore, I do not believe that the shooting or the war will stop other than by force.\u201d In its ruling, the ICJ said Israel must \u201cimmediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part\u201d. It ordered Israel to allow UN-mandated investigators \u201cunimpeded access\u201d to Gaza to look into the genocide allegations. It has just gone 10am in Gaza and Tel Aviv. This is our latest blog covering the Israel-Gaza war and wider Middle East crisis. US secretary of state Antony Blinken has reiterated US opposition to a major Israeli offensive on Rafah, the southern Gaza city where 1.4 million Palestinians had until recently sought refuge, in a phone call with war cabinet minister Benny Gantz. The brief statement from Blinken\u2019s office came after the UN\u2019s top court ordered Israel to halt its assault on Rafah in a ruling that is expected to further ratchet up pressure on the increasingly isolated country. But the statement made no mention of the international court of justice\u2019s ruling, while a White House spokesperson merely said that \u201cwe\u2019ve been clear and consistent on our position on Rafah.\u201d The US had previously said any assault on Rafah without \u201ccredible\u201d humanitarian provisions for civilians would be a red line. However, after Israel launched an offensive on the city earlier this month it watered down its position. More on that soon. In other developments: The UN\u2019s top court voted by a majority of 13 votes to two that Israel must \u201cimmediately halt its military offensive and any other action in the Rafah governorate which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that would bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part\u201d. The ruling came days after the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court, a separate court also based in The Hague, said he was seeking arrest warrants for senior Hamas and Israeli officials for war crimes, including the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant. Netanyahu\u2019s office on Friday rejected the ruling in the ICJ case, which was brought by South Africa, calling the country\u2019s allegations of genocide by Israel, \u201cfalse and outrageous\u201d. In a statement, Netanyahu\u2019s office said the Israeli campaign in Rafah has not and will not \u201clead to the destruction of the Palestinian civilian population\u201d. Residents and Palestinian media reported a series of strikes hitting roads and houses in the Shaboura neighbourhood in central Rafah shortly after the ICJ ruling was read out in The Hague. Heavy fighting was also reported in the Jabalia refugee camp in the north. Medics said at least five Palestinians had been killed when houses were hit in Jabalia and more were believed to be trapped under rubble, but that the area could not be reached due to the intensity of the bombardment. In Rafah, residents reported explosions and smoke rising in the distance as tanks advanced further into the eastern district of Jenina. South Africa described the ICJ ruling was \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d. The South Africa international relations department said: \u201cThis order is binding and Israel has to adhere to it.\u201d South Africa added that it would be approaching the UN security council with Friday\u2019s ICJ order. The Palestinian Authority welcomed the ICJ ruling, saying it represented an international consensus to end the war on the Gaza Strip. Hamas also welcomed the decision but said it was not enough and urged an end to Israel\u2019s offensive on all of Gaza. Hamas called on the UN security council to implement the ICJ decision. The EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said that the EU had to choose between respecting the EU\u2019s support for international institutions or its support for Israel. \u201cWhat is going to be the answer to the ruling of the international court of justice that has been issued today, what is going to be our position? We will have to choose between our support to international institutions of the rule of law or our support to Israel,\u201d he said. Egypt and the US have agreed to temporarily send humanitarian aid to the UN in Gaza via Israel\u2019s Kerem Shalom crossing, the Egyptian presidency said. Only 906 truckloads of humanitarian aid have entered the Gaza Strip since 7 May, after Israel began its military operation in Rafah, according to figures from the UN\u2019s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (Ocha). More than 200 staff members of EU institutions and agencies have signed a letter expressing \u201cgrowing concern\u201d over the union\u2019s response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, arguing that it runs contrary to its core values and aim of promoting peace. The letter, signed by 211 people in their personal capacity as citizens and addressed to the EU\u2019s top three officials, begins by condemning the 7 October attacks \u201cin the strongest terms\u201d."

            "date": "2024-05-02T00:24:30Z",
            "content": "China has been hit with sanctions by the US for supplying \u201ccritical inputs to Russia\u2019s military-industrial base\u201d for use in the war against Ukraine. US officials on Wednesday announced a sweeping package targeting nearly 300 entities in Russia, China and other countries. \u201cToday\u2019s actions will further disrupt and degrade Russia\u2019s war efforts by going after its military industrial base and the evasion networks that help supply it,\u201d said the US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen. The almost 300 targets include dozens of actors accused of enabling Russia to acquire technology and equipment from abroad. Other than China, targeted non-Russian entities were located in Azerbaijan, Belgium, Slovakia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These companies \u201cenable Russia to acquire desperately needed technology and equipment from abroad\u201d, a treasury statement said. As part of the measures, the state department blacklisted additional individuals and companies involved in Moscow\u2019s energy, mining and metals sectors; and individuals connected to the death of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in a Siberian prison in February. Long queues formed in Moscow on Wednesday as the Russian army displayed western tanks and military hardware captured in Ukraine. It included US, German and French tanks along with British and Australian armoured vehicles, and military hardware made in Turkey, Sweden, Austria, Finland, South Africa and the Czech Republic. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, held a similar exhibition in Kyiv in 2023 of captured Russian tanks and equipment. Russia has itself lost more than 3,000 tanks in Ukraine, says the International Institute for Strategic Studies, amounting to its entire pre-war active inventory, but has enough lower-quality armoured vehicles in storage for years of replacements and says it is ramping up production of new tanks. The US has accused Russia of violating the international chemical weapons ban by deploying the choking agent chloropicrin against Ukrainian troops and using riot control chemicals \u201cas a method of warfare\u201d in Ukraine. Russia\u2019s use of the gas \u201ccomes from the same playbook as its operations to poison\u201d Alexei Navalny in 2020, and Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in 2018, with the novichok nerve agent, the state department said, adding that it was delivering its findings to Congress. \u201cThe use of such chemicals is not an isolated incident and is probably driven by Russian forces\u2019 desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield,\u201d the state department said. In addition to chloropicrin, Russian forces have also illegally used grenades loaded with CS and CN gases, the Ukrainian military alleged. The US government said it was sanctioning Russian state entities and companies linked to Moscow\u2019s chemical and biological weapons programmes, including a specialised military unit that \u201cfacilitated the use\u201d of chloropicrin against Ukrainian troops. The state department is expected to convey its findings to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), whose rules Russia and other members are required to obey. Five civilians were killed on Wednesday as Russia struck Ukraine\u2019s eastern Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, local officials said. In the north-eastern Kharkiv region bordering Russia, a guided bomb attack killed a 38-year-old woman and her father inside a car, the region\u2019s governor said. Farther east in the Kharkiv region close to the city of Kupiansk, Russian shelling killed a 67-year-old woman in the village of Lelyukivka. In the eastern Donetsk region, a 57-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man were killed and six injured in the small town of Girnyk, about 15km from the frontline, said Vadym Filashkin, the head of the region\u2019s military administration. Vadym Filashkin, a regional governor, has said 682 residents are holding on in \u201cvery difficult conditions\u201d with no running water or power in the besieged city of Chasiv Yar, prewar population 12,500. Months of relentless Russian artillery pounding have devastated the strategic city which has emerged as the invaders\u2019 next major target, sitting on elevated ground that could serve as a gateway to the cities of Kostiantynivka, Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Ukrainian forces defending Chasiv Yar have said they are still awaiting fresh ammunition. Ukraine\u2019s Nova Poshta postal and courier company said late on Wednesday that a missile had struck its sorting depot in Odesa, but there were no casualties among its employees. The Odesa regional governor, Oleh Kiper, said at least 13 people were injured in the missile strike, which triggered a large fire. A Russian national pleaded guilty on Wednesday to lying to the FBI about his participation in an organisation that wants to restore the \u201cRussian empire\u201d including Ukraine. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Tomas Ianchauskas, a US green card holder who mainly lives in Russia, served as the regional leader of the Tsargrad Society, formerly known as the Double Headed Eagle Society. US prosecutors say the group is controlled by sanctioned Russian businessman Konstantin Malofeyev. Ianchauskas, 39, pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements to FBI agents. He faces up to six months in prison when sentenced on 11 July."

            "title": "The Falklands war in the GNM Archive",
            "date": "2024-05-16T14:52:54Z",
            "content": "This is an edited version of a paper that originally appeared in Autour de la guerre. Les archives, de pr\u00e9cieuses alli\u00e9es. \u00bb La Gazette des archives. Paris: Association des archivistes fran\u00e7ais, 2024. On 2 April 1982, a force from Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, a British overseas territory in the South Atlantic. Three days later, the UK government sent a naval taskforce \u2013 comprising 127 warships, submarines and merchant ships carrying troops and equipment \u2013 to take back the islands. The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with an Argentine surrender on 14 June, returning the islands to British control. Over 900 people lost their lives. The Guardian was only one of two British national newspapers to take an anti-war stance. The story of how the paper covered the conflict is preserved in the Guardian News &amp; Media archive. Islas Malvinas The first indication that Buenos Aires was showing signs of readiness to take military action to press Argentina\u2019s claim to the Falklands was reported in the Guardian just over a month before the conflict began. But the paper had been interesting itself in the islands for many years before that. An editorial (giving the paper\u2019s \u2018official\u2019 opinion) on 15 July 1976 had stated \u201cWithin a few years, if Argentina plays its cards right, the British Falkland Islands will have become the Argentine Islas Malvinas.\u201d This leader was written by Richard Gott who in 1968 had accompanied British government minister Lord Chalfont on a fact-finding visit to the islands. In one of a number of pieces, Gott reported that the British government was thinking of severing the Falklands colonial ties to London. Traditionally, newspaper editorials remain unsigned, but \u2018leader books\u2019 held by the archive indicate who the writer is (although the editorial line taken is usually a collective decision). These are closed to external researchers for 20 years after creation. On the morning of the Argentinian invasion, an editorial written by Hugh Stephenson set the tone for Guardian coverage, noting that from the start the affair \u201chas had heavy comic opera overtones.\u201d Its headline, \u2018Far away, forgotten and now filched\u2019 was written by Guardian editor Peter Preston, who was to write most of the Falklands related leaders during the conflict. \u2018Pens or bayonets?\u2019 The naval taskforce began to be assembled as soon as the Argentinian invasion began. The one objective of the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) was to regain the islands and as such arrangements for the press and television were given low priority. Admiral Sir Henry Leach, First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, and who was instrumental in convincing British prime minister Margaret Thatcher that retaking the Falkland Islands was feasible, reportedly asked whether he was expected to load his ships with \u201cpens or bayonets?\u201d This meant that initially only 10 places to travel with the taskforce were offered; five to television and the remaining five to newspaper journalists, to be allocated by the director of the Newspapers\u2019 Publishers Association (NPA). He in turn asked his wife to draw the names out of a hat. Those not selected in this lottery \u2013 including the Guardian \u2013 immediately complained and the decision was reversed, leading to almost every national newspaper being given a place on one of the Royal Navy ships sailing to the South Atlantic. This was welcome news but it left very little time for the Guardian reporter selected to travel south to prepare. Gareth Parry, an experienced foreign correspondent, was telephoned at 9.30pm on the Sunday evening and told to make it to Portsmouth, the port where the taskforce was leaving, by midnight to board HMS Invincible. As such he had less than an hour to grab a few items of clothing such as a jumper and lightweight raincoat, a thin sleeping bag, and a paperback to read on the train. This was hardly the equipment required for several weeks in the winter of the South Atlantic and among the many hardships Parry was to suffer covering the conflict, hunting decent clothing and a warm sleeping bag were to dog his time there. He later wrote: \u201cTo be ill equipped both against the killing cold of the Antarctic nights and the enemy bombs was an unexpected challenge.\u201d Parry and the other members of the press were given an MoD minder who was the first of three links in the chain of censorship, the others being the censor on board ship and the duty office at the MoD in London. The Guardian accepted this, but Parry was \u2018devastated\u2019 when he eventually returned to the UK to discover that much of his filed copy either didn\u2019t arrive, was blue-pencilled (censored) or altered. For example, on the journey south to the islands, references to mist and heavy seas were removed, ostensibly because it might betray a position \u2013 even though a satellite phone could easily reveal this. Throughout the entire campaign, Parry only managed to make contact with the London office three times and the office with him not all. One attempt was disconnected. Detailed background to these problems, including the sometimes strained relations between the press and the MoD can be found in a number of records and collections in the archive. Oral history collection A first-hand account of life in the newsroom during the conflict is given by David Fairhall, Guardian defence correspondent in 1982, in a series of interviews carried out as part of the archive\u2019s oral history collection. Started with the creation of the archive, it comprises of about 180 interviews conducted with former members of staff including journalists, photographers, editors, the first professional librarian, as well as production staff and compositors who set the text for printing. Track listing for most of the interviews helps identify key passages. More recently, new tranches of interviews were carried out to capture the experiences of journalists reporting the Iraq war and to mark the paper\u2019s 2021 bicentenary year. Many are open to external researchers. In Fairhall\u2019s conversations, he describes the communication problems, lack of satellite phones and MoD censorship. Other members of staff also mention military and communication difficulties in their interviews. Peter Preston\u2019s papers A more granular picture of how editors navigated their way around censorship and communication difficulties, as well as discussions about the paper\u2019s editorial decisions, can be found in the archived papers and memos held, and in particular those of Preston who was editor from 1975-1995. This includes correspondence with members of staff as well external individuals. Some files and parts of files contain confidential and personal information and thus are restricted in line with the UK Data Protection Act and business confidentiality. Those relating to the Falklands conflict are open and they include documents concerning the editor\u2019s evidence submitted to the House of Commons\u2019 Defence Committee on the handling of press and public information during the Falklands conflict, October 1982, and also the Falkland Islands Review Committee, September - October 1982, an internal government inquiry into its relationship with the press during the conflict. Records in the files include memos, information and the thoughts of key journalists sent to Preston. For example, Peter Cole, Guardian news editor, wrote in a memo to the editor in July 1982: \u201cThe relationship between the MoD and the press got off to a bad start with the decision to allow the NPA to ballot for just four newspaper journalists to sail with the taskforce \u2026 it \u2018smelt\u2019 as though only the over jingoistic popular prints were being allowed to go. Much time was wasted at the outset in rectifying this\u201d. He also talks about a misunderstanding in the MoD that papers like the Guardian were happy to report on the taskforce but not the actual fighting: \u201cWe sent a reporter to cover a war, and yet saw him kept aboard various ships when many other reporters were on East Falkland with the troops. This caused us continuous frustration and we found the excuse that the commanders in the field had so many important things to worry about than the press unconvincing when so many press, some from local papers, were ashore and seeing the action at first-hand.\u201d Richard Norton-Taylor, a senior reporter specialising in security matters, talks in his memo about the British system of \u201cgrey censorship,\u201d operating at different layers and different levels of the MoD, leading to inconsistencies in approach. He gives an example of this where. \u201cThe MoD seemed perfectly happy to include refs to what the British forces were doing in certain kinds of weather conditions, for instance, while deleting info about the Guards\u2019 grumbling about their food.\u201d Fairhall, as well as talking about the problems surrounding Parry, also notes the \u201clack of real information\u201d from the government, particularly off-the-record briefings for defence correspondents. This lack of communication sometimes led to speculation about tactics. As he put it, \u201cThe British were instinctively more secretive than other military authorities I have dealt with\u201d Preston, concluding his submission to the MoD says, \u201cI think the Falklands episode, perhaps understandably, revealed extreme difficulties and unpreparedness in the organisation\u201d. Gemini The archive also holds a selection of newspaper cuttings relating to the Falklands which are part of the Gemini News Service collection. Gemini was an independent news agency specialising in the field of international and development journalism, owned by the Guardian from 1973 to 1982. After the service ceased operation in 2002 its records were donated to GNM. The records are open for researchers to view. Comment and opinion The Guardian\u2019s chief commentator during the conflict was Hugo Young, who wrote a twice-weekly column for 18 years until his death in 2003. He was one of the country\u2019s most respected and trusted journalists and throughout his career made meticulous typed and handwritten notes to record conversations and informal (off the record) interviews with experts, politicians and civil servants. The archive holds these and while a number are closed for privacy reasons, there are enough available to give an insight into how he formulated his columns during the conflict. For example, on 23 April 1982, notes after a meeting with a senior government minister record \u201che is not in the War Cabinet, but is senior and sensible\u201d and that the governing Conservative party is much more divided over the war than the opposition Labour party. There are notes from a conversation with John Nott, the defence secretary, as well as Neil Kinnock (22 April), leader of the Labour party, who is noted as saying there are \u201cmajor questions to ask after it\u2019s all over about the cock-up that began it\u201d. A collection of Young\u2019s notes was published as The Hugo Young Papers in 2009. Cartoons The Guardian\u2019s cartoonists offered a critical take on the conflict and the archive holds many original pieces of work by a variety of illustrators and cartoonists. Les Gibbard was the Guardian\u2019s political cartoonist from 1969 to 1993 and most of his collection is held at Kings Place. Eighteen are related to the Falklands, with depictions of politicians on both sides of the conflict. In a cartoon called The Falkland Fiasco from early on in the conflict (6 April 1982), UK defence secretary John Nott is seen standing atop The Falkland Fiasco while the rest of the ship is submerged under water \u2013 the sunken vessel suggesting the country\u2019s attempt to take back was looking like it was going to end in failure. However, the captain of the ship, foreign secretary Lord Carrington, remains on board, underwater and saluting. The archive also holds many of Gibbards \u2018ideas books\u2019 \u2013 sketches derived from that day\u2019s headlines. These give a fascinating glimpse into the creative process. His work was not popular with all though, and in particular the more pro-government press, with the Sun newspaper alluding to Gibbard in a leader about \u2018traitors in our midst\u2019 on 7 May 1982. Another Guardian cartoonist was Steve Bell, known for his grotesque parodies of politicians. For the Falklands, he developed his own naval vessel with its own offensive caricatures of a commander and padre. The only sane people on board were the insubordinate AB Kipling and his adopted penguin. The archive holds eight pages of Bell\u2019s If cartoon strips as well as books that include his Falklands output. Pictures In the pre-digital era the Guardian and Observer both maintained hard-copy picture libraries. This collection, comprising of the papers\u2019 copyright photographs and negatives plus others, was transferred to the archive in the 2000s. Some pictures have been digitised, but the Falklands files of prints are arranged as follows: Islands: Falklands: Argentinian Troops Islands: Falklands: British Task Force: Return Home Islands: Falklands: General Islands: Falklands: Port Stanley Islands: Falklands: Royal Naval Task Force: Casualties Islands: Falklands: Royal Naval Task Force: Embarkation Islands: Falklands: Royal Naval Task Force: General Islands: Falklands: Royal Naval Task Force: In Action Islands: Falklands: Royal Naval Task Force: Protests and Demonstrations While the Guardian did not have one of its own photographers covering the conflict, staff took plenty of images of the taskforce fleet leaving for the Falklands, the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible and also returning wounded soldiers. The Observer When Argentine forces landed on the Falklands on 2 April 1982, Ian Mather, the Observer\u2019s defence correspondent, was in the US and from there was dispatched to Buenos Aires. The war had not yet started, and the prevailing view was that there would be a diplomatic solution before the British taskforce arrived in the South Atlantic. Thus, Mather decided to try to be the first journalist to reach the Argentine occupied Falklands. Along with Observer photographer Tony Prime, and Simon Winchester of the Sunday Times, he headed to Ushuaia in Tierra del Fuego, the most southerly town in the world, to try to find a pilot willing to fly to the Falklands. They had little success and so decided to return to Bueos Aires, but at the airport, as Mather was to later write, \u201can Argentinian naval officer accompanied by armed marines marched up and arrested us. \u2018For you the war is over,\u2019 he said sneeringly in English.\u201d The three were charged with espionage and held for 11 weeks before being released on 30 June 1982. The archive holds a number of records about the incident and the \u2018The Ushuaia Three\u2019 as they were nicknamed. These include: a letter Mather wrote while in prison, including extracts from his prison diary to Donald Trelford (Observer editor), about life in jail, descriptions of the different prisoners and prison officials, and trying to contact friends and family; memos from Times Newspaper Limited relating to activities to try to release the men; copies of court papers relating to the bail applications for the journalists (in Spanish); transcripts of the grounds put forward by the prosecutor opposing bail of the journalists, and the grounds of the defence; transcripts of the interrogations of Tony Prime and Simon Winchester; press releases from Free the Journalists Committee or Committee for the Release of the British Journalists held in Argentina, which was specifically set up to campaign for their release; booklets from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). There are also numerous letters both from Mather and correspondence relating to his release. There are also telex (a text-based message service over public switched telephone network reports) and typescript and carbon copy drafts of articles written by Ian Mather on a wide range of issues. The correspondence of Trelford is also held which contains information about the incarceration. Ian Mather recounted his experiences in Argentina for War Stories, a series of two documentaries made by the Observer Film Company Ltd (1988-1995) for the BBC in 1992. Copies of the programme are held by the archive, as well as transcripts."

            "title": "Israeli airstrikes on Rafah begin despite mounting ceasefire pressure ",
            "date": "2024-05-06T21:16:41Z",
            "content": "Rafah\u2019s fate hung in the balance on Monday after Hamas said it had accepted a ceasefire-for-hostage deal but Israel responded sceptically and said it would press on with its campaign on Gaza\u2019s southernmost city, carrying out night airstrikes. The more than 1 million Palestinians taking refuge in Rafah were thrown into confusion by the day\u2019s events. Israel issued orders for the evacuation of part of the city earlier on Monday, triggering an exodus of thousands of people. There were celebrations in the streets in the evening after Hamas announced it had accepted a ceasefire, but then disappointment and bewilderment when Israel gave a tepid response and began bombing. The Israeli military said late on Monday it was conducting targeted strikes against Hamas in Rafah. There were reports of Israeli tanks being seen on the eastern outskirts of Rafah and the Axios news site cited unnamed sources saying Israeli forces planned to take over the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, the sole gateway between Egypt and Gaza for humanitarian supplies and people. There was no independent confirmation of those reports, but the Associated Press quoted an Palestinian security official and an Egyptian official as say Israeli tanks had advanced as close as 200 meters from the crossing. The Rafah gate is a vital aid lifeline and particularly sensitive for Egypt, which is anxious to avoid a mass migration of Palestinians into its Sinai desert. A US official on Monday voiced concern about the strikes on Rafah but said they did not believe they represented a major military operation. The US was focused on heading off just such an operation in densely populated areas of Rafah, they said. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the terms that Hamas had agreed to fell far from meeting his government\u2019s demands but he would dispatch a delegation for further negotiations in Cairo through Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The Qatari government also announced it would be sending a team to Cairo, where the CIA director, William Burns will also take part. The war cabinet said it would pursue the operation in Rafah to \u201cexert military pressure on Hamas in order to advance the release of the hostages and other goals of the war\u201d. One Israeli official said it was unclear exactly which proposal Hamas was accepting, as some of the terms appeared to differ substantially from those shown by mediators to Israel and agreed by the Israeli government last week. \u201c[We] don\u2019t recognise some,\u201d the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said. Despite the late hour, hundreds of Israelis converged on the main military headquarters in Tel Aviv calling for a deal now. Smaller gatherings were reported in Jerusalem and other cities across Israel. \u201cHamas\u2019s announcement must pave the way for the return of the 132 hostages held captive by Hamas for the past seven months. Now is the time for all that are involved to fulfil their commitment and turn this opportunity into a deal for the return of all the hostages,\u201d a statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said. \u201cWe continue to believe that a hostage deal is in the best interests of the Israeli people; it\u2019s in the best interest of the Palestinian people,\u201d the US state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said. \u201cIt would bring an immediate ceasefire, it would allow increased movement of humanitarian assistance and so we\u2019re going to continue to work to try to reach one.\u201d The main difference dividing the two sides at the talks in Cairo was over the permanence of a ceasefire. Israel wants to reserve the right to resume military action, particularly against the remnants of Hamas\u2019s military wing in Rafah, after the ceasefire has run its course. Talks in Cairo had appeared to stall on the weekend over Hamas\u2019s insistence that Israel should commit to making the ceasefire permanent at the outset of the agreement, rather than to negotiate its duration after the truce had taken hold. An account in Haaretz suggested that the Hamas version does not include an immediate demand for a permanent ceasefire, but also changes other elements of the Egyptian deal proposal, such as the requirement that it free 33 hostages in the first phase. It also reportedly takes away Israel\u2019s right of veto on which Palestinian detainees are released in exchange. Hamas officials were quoted as saying the plan they had accepted involved a ceasefire, reconstruction of Gaza, return of displaced people to their homes and a prisoner swap deal, and that the deal would involve three phases, each of 42 days. That description left it unclear whether there were substantial differences to the proposal put on the table by Egyptian mediators last week. With a ceasefire far from certain, witnesses described frightened families leaving Rafah on foot, riding donkeys, pushing trolleys or packing their belongings into overloaded trucks hours after reading leaflets dropped by the Israeli military that told residents and displaced people in eastern neighbourhoods to flee. \u201cAn Israeli military offensive will lead to an additional layer of an already unbearable tragedy for the people in Gaza,\u201d said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of Unrwa, the UN relief agency in the region. \u201cIt will make it even more difficult to reverse the expansion of the already man-made famine.\u201d Joe Biden, the US president, spoke to Netanyahu on Monday afternoon and \u201creiterated his clear position\u201d on Rafah, the White House said. US officials have repeatedly said Israel has to present an adequate humanitarian plan for the more than 1 million Palestinians who have sought shelter in Rafah, and that the US would change its policy on the region if Israel went ahead with an offensive in the absence of such a plan. Officials made clear on Monday that no such plan was possible in the current circumstances, so the US opposition to a Rafah attack was not likely to soften. It will be up to Biden to decide whether a US policy change would involve restrictions on arms supplies. US officials refused to comment on a report on the Axios news site that a delivery of US-made ammunition due to ship last week had been put on temporary hold. The evacuation order led to a furious reaction from Saudi Arabia, describing Israel\u2019s war in Gaza as a \u201cgenocide\u201d. Riyadh had been working towards a deal before the war to normalise relations with Israel and has yet to renounce normalisation as a goal. A Saudi foreign ministry statement warned of the \u201cdangers of the Israeli occupation forces targeting the city of Rafah as part of its systematic bloody campaign to storm all areas of the Gaza Strip and displace its residents towards the unknown\u201d. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had broadcast instructions through \u201cannouncements, text messages, phone calls and media broadcasts in Arabic\u201d telling an estimated 100,000 residents of an eastern section of Rafah to head to an \u201cexpanded humanitarian zone\u201d on the coast and around the badly damaged city of Khan Younis. \u201cThis is an evacuation plan to get people out of harm\u2019s way,\u201d an Israeli military spokesperson said. \u201cThis is limited in scope and not a wide-scale evacuation of Rafah.\u201d The Biden administration agrees with the UN and aid agencies that there is no safe area for the people in Rafah to escape to, given the wholesale destruction of Gaza after seven months of Israeli bombardment. While the Israelis say the section of Rafah under evacuation orders is limited, with an estimated population of 100,000, US officials think any military operation in that district would have a knock-on effect, terrifying many others across Rafah and leading them to flee. Rafah has been sheltering more than 1 million people displaced from elsewhere in Gaza during the war and is a key logistics base for humanitarian operations across the territory. Dense tent encampments surround the city and have also already crowded al-Mawasi, the coastal zone about 3 miles north-east to which Israel has told people to evacuate. Khan Younis is considered \u201ccompletely uninhabitable\u201d by aid workers. Humanitarian officials and displaced people already living in al-Mawasi describe acute overcrowding, inadequate food, limited fresh water and an almost total absence of sanitation. Israeli forces have bombarded targets in al-Mawasi at least twice in recent months. Aid officials have long warned of massive disruption to the effort to stave off famine in Gaza in the event of a major Israeli offensive in the south. Any attack on Rafah would lead to \u201cthe collapse of the aid response\u201d, the Norwegian Refugee Council said on Monday. Netanyahu has been under domestic pressure to make concessions to obtain the release of the hostages in Gaza but appears so far to have prioritised the demands of far-right parties, which have threatened to withdraw crucial support for his coalition if a ceasefire deal is signed now. Israel\u2019s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, wrote on X: \u201cHamas\u2019 exercises and games have only one answer: an immediate order to occupy Rafah! Increasing military pressure, and continuing the complete defeat of Hamas, until its complete defeat.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-04T13:27:37Z",
            "content": "Hopes of a ceasefire in Gaza rose on Saturday as a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo to continue indirect talks, with what is believed to be a response to a new proposal, reportedly agreed by Israel, to halt fighting for an initial 40 days and exchange hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Egyptian and US mediators have reported signs of compromise in recent days and Egyptian state news channel Al-Qahera said on Saturday that a consensus had been reached in the indirect talks over many of the disputed points but gave no further details. However, many analysts remain pessimistic after five months of stop-start talks that have frequently broken down. Negotiators have consistently struggled to reconcile Hamas\u2019s demand for a lasting ceasefire which would allow the organisation to claim a victory with the apparent determination of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, to force Hamas from power, kill or capture its leadership and destroy all its military capabilities. A senior Israeli official, speaking on Saturday on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations, played down the prospects for a full end to the war. The official said Israel was committed to an offensive on Rafah, Gaza\u2019s southernmost city, and that it would not agree in any circumstance to end the war as part of a hostage-release deal. Egyptian sources told the Wall Street Journal that Israel would give the truce talks another week, after which it would launch its long-threatened offensive. Thousands of Israelis protested on Saturday, demanding the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, accept a ceasefire agreement with Hamas that would see the remaining Israeli hostages brought home from Gaza. At a rally in Tel Aviv, relatives and supporters of the more than 130 hostages still in captivity said anything possible had to be done to bring them home. The US has sought to pressure Hamas to accept the latest proposals, which are widely seen as a last chance to avert intense new fighting. Any Israeli offensive in Rafah is likely to bring many new civilian casualties and exacerbate the acute humanitarian crisis in Gaza. \u201cThe only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas,\u201d the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Friday. Blinken also reiterated Washington\u2019s objections to a Rafah offensive, saying Israel had not presented a credible plan to protect the 1.2 million or more civilians displaced from elsewhere in Gaza who have sought refuge in sprawling, tented refugee camps and UN shelters there. \u201cAbsent such a plan, we can\u2019t support a major military operation going into Rafah because the damage it would do is beyond what\u2019s acceptable,\u201d he said. Humanitarian groups and the United Nations have also repeatedly called on Israel to call off a Rafah attack. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, warned on Friday that a full-scale military operation in Rafah \u201ccould lead to a bloodbath, and further weaken an already broken health system\u201d. Israeli officials say a Rafah ground offensive is essential to achieve Israel\u2019s stated war aims because thousands of Hamas fighters and the militant Islamist organisation\u2019s leaders are based there. Hamas seized about 250 hostages during the surprise attack into southern Israel in October last year that triggered the war. About half are still held in Gaza, with many thought to be in or under Rafah. About 1,200 died in the October Hamas attack, mostly civilians. More than 34,600 have died in Gaza, mostly women and children, in the ensuing Israeli military offensive. Israel says Hamas is using civilians as human shields, a charge the organisation denies. Israeli strikes early on Saturday on Gaza killed at least six people. Three bodies were recovered from the rubble of a building in Rafah and taken to Yousef al-Najjar hospital. A strike in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza also killed three people, according to hospital officials. In the last 24 hours, the bodies of 32 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to local hospitals, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said on Saturday. The ministry does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its tallies. Hamas, which has been in power in the Gaza Strip since 2007, says it is considering the latest truce proposal with a \u201cpositive spirit\u201d. But the group is deeply divided, and statements made by its political wing, now mainly based in Istanbul, often do not reflect the views of Yahya Sinwar, the organiser of the October attacks and most senior Hamas leader in Gaza. Observers say that it is significant that the Hamas delegation now in Cairo is led by Khalil al-Hayya, deputy head of the group\u2019s political arm in Gaza, rather than a more senior figure who might lack credibility with Sinwar, who has ultimate authority over any deal. The Israeli government is also deeply divided. Senior members of its war cabinet are keen to secure a ceasefire and free surviving prisoners but far-right ministers have threatened to bring down Netanyahu\u2019s ruling coalition if the war is not continued with greater force. The United States, along with Egypt and Qatar, has been trying to seal a ceasefire deal in the nearly seven-month-old war. During the last truce, over one week in November, 80 Israeli hostages were exchanged for 240 Palestinian prisoners. Up to a third of those remaining in Hamas captivity are now thought to be dead. Israel\u2019s siege has pushed many of Gaza\u2019s 2.4 million people to the brink of famine and US pressure has prompted Israel to facilitate more aid deliveries to Gaza, including through the reopened Erez crossing that leads directly into the hardest-hit north. Last week, Israeli settlers blocked a convoy using a new route from Jordan before it crossed into Gaza. Once inside the territory, the convoy was commandeered by Hamas militants before UN officials reclaimed it. Food availability has improved \u201ca little bit\u201d, according to the UN and residents in Rafah interviewed by the Guardian, with prices for some basics dropping to near prewar levels in southern areas where there is most aid. The US-based charity World Central Kitchen resumed operations this week, after suspending them in the aftermath of Israeli drone strikes that killed seven of its staff as they unloaded aid in Gaza on 1 April. World Central Kitchen was involved in an effort earlier this year to establish a new maritime aid corridor to Gaza from Cyprus to help compensate for dwindling deliveries by land from Israel. The project suffered a further setback on Friday when the US military announced high winds had forced troops working to assemble a temporary aid pier off the Gaza coast to relocate to the Israeli port of Ashdod. But the chief of the UN\u2019s food programme still warned of a \u201cfull-blown famine\u201d in northern Gaza despite the improvements, and reiterated calls for a ceasefire. \u201cThere is famine, full-blown famine, in the north, and it\u2019s moving its way south,\u201d said Cindy McCain, executive director of the World Food Programme."

            "date": "2024-05-07T09:58:19Z",
            "content": "Thousands of Israelis around the country have joined rallies calling for the government of Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to the terms of a ceasefire deal that Hamas accepted on Monday. Protesters gathered near the defence headquarters in Tel Aviv, while in Jerusalem at least 100 protesters marched towards Netanyahu\u2019s residence with a banner saying: \u201cThe blood is on your hands.\u201d Demonstrations took place elsewhere, amid concerns that the Israeli military\u2019s new offensive targeting the southern Gaza city of Rafah and the so-called Philadelphi corridor, which runs along the border with Egypt, could jeopardise the lives of surviving hostages. There were smaller protests in the cities of Haifa, Beersheba and Raanana. The protests came as splits in Netanyahu\u2019s war cabinet appeared to be widening and the prime minister sought to hold his fractious governing coalition together. The largest demonstrations took place on the Ayalon highway in central Tel Aviv, a frequent focus of protest, where police twice cleared people who were banging drums, carrying signs and shouting slogans. \u201cBibi is abandoning the hostages,\u201d some of the demonstrators shouted.\u200e Among those who gathered outside Netanyahu\u2019s house in Jerusalem was Mai Albini Peri, the grandson of Haim Peri, a hostage in Gaza. Peri held a sign saying: \u201cRafah, not at the expense of my grandfather.\u201d The Hamas statement that it was prepared to accept a ceasefire, delivered by its senior politburo official Ismail Haniyeh hours after the Israel Defense Forces had ordered tens of thousands of Palestinians to leave eastern Rafah, appeared to catch Israeli officials \u2013 not least Netanyahu \u2013 by surprise. Hamas announced it had accepted an Egyptian-Qatari ceasefire proposal, but Israel said the deal did not meet its \u201ccore demands\u201d and that it was pushing ahead with an assault on Rafah. The high-stakes diplomatic moves and military brinkmanship left a glimmer of hope alive \u2013 if only barely \u2013 for an accord that could bring at least a pause in the seven-month war that has devastated the Gaza Strip. An Israeli incursion overnight appeared to be short of the fully-fledged offensive into Rafah that Israel has planned, and it was not immediately known if it would be expanded. Joe Biden on Monday urgently warned Netanyahu against launching a ground offensive, raising pressure for a ceasefire. Israel said it would continue negotiations, even as its military carried out strikes on Rafah. The news that Hamas had accepted a deal was greeted with enthusiasm by groups in Israel representing hostages held in Gaza. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an umbrella group that represents a number of relatives of captives, said in a statement that the announcement from Hamas must lead to \u201cthe return of the 132 hostages held captive by Hamas for the past seven months\u201d. It said: \u201cNow is the time for all that are involved to fulfil their commitment and turn this opportunity into a deal for the return of all the hostages.\u201d Israel estimates that 128 of the 250 hostages abducted by militants on 7 October remain in Gaza, including 35 who the military says are dead. In Tel Aviv, Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan Zangauker is still held in Gaza, told a crowd on Monday night that it was \u201ctime to accept the deal\u201d. With a megaphone, Zangauker stood on the roof of a car and spoke in front of a large crowd of protesters. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let you continue to abandon the children,\u201d she said. In a post on X, the Israeli opposition leader, Yair Lapid, said the government was not serious about freeing the hostages. \u201cA government that wants to return the abductees should be convening an urgent discussion and sending [negotiating] teams to Cairo, not hysterically issuing three different briefings from different parties and crushing the hearts of the families. A national disgrace. There is no limit,\u201d he wrote."

            "date": "2024-05-06T21:24:57Z",
            "content": "Israel is coming under huge diplomatic pressure to accept a three-stage ceasefire surprisingly agreed by Hamas, despite the apparent determination of its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to continue with a planned offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu\u2019s office said that the proposal Hamas accepted was \u201cfar from Israel\u2019s essential demands\u201d but that it would nonetheless send negotiators to continue talks on a deal. At the same time, the Israeli military said it was conducting \u201ctargeted strikes\u201d against Hamas in eastern Rafah. The already strong calls for Israel not to go ahead with a full-scale offensive on Rafah, in southern Gaza, are also likely to be redoubled with the US Department of State saying no credible plans for such military action had been shown to US officials as Israel ordered 100,000 people to evacuate the east of the city. Matthew Miller, the US state department spokesperson, said Washington would discuss the Hamas response with its allies in the coming hours, and a deal was \u201cabsolutely achievable\u201d. Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, was one of the first world leaders to call for Israel to accept the ceasefire. Speaking after a cabinet meeting on Monday evening, he urged western countries to increase pressure on Israel\u2019s leadership to accept. \u201cWe welcome the statement by Hamas that they accepted the ceasefire with our suggestion. Now, Israel must take the same step,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said. France has already said it would be a war crime for Israel to attempt forcibly to displace thousands of Palestinian civilians in living in camps in Rafah on the Egyptian-Gaza border. Israel had said it was starting an operation to evacuate 100,000 Palestinians from the city as the precursor for an offensive that it added would eradicate the remaining operational Hamas battalions. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, was \u201cdeeply concerned by the indications that a large-scale military operation in Rafah may be imminent\u201d, according to his spokesperson, who called on Israel and Hamas \u201cto go the extra mile needed to make an agreement come true and stop the present suffering\u201d. The diplomatic turnaround was dramatic given that on Sunday it appeared as if the indirect talks conducted in Egypt had collapsed largely due to a Hamas demand that the ceasefire would become permanent and not confined to three stages \u2013 each lasting 42 days that would end when all the Israeli hostages were released. Hamas was also seeking a guarantee, ideally from the US, Russia, China and Turkey, that Israel would end the attack on Gaza permanently, even if the Islamist group was not prepared to state as much. But by Monday morning Netanyahu had rejected anything but total victory and appeared about to launch the first stage of the Rafah offensive with the order for civilians to evacuate. Qatar strove on Monday to keep the talks alive, with the help of the CIA director, William Burns, who had flown from Cairo to Doha to speak to the Hamas delegation. Just as it appeared as if the talks had been suspended permanently, the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, suddenly informed Qatar\u2019s mediators it was prepared to accept a ceasefire, knocking the ball back into Netanyahu\u2019s court. The Hamas negotiators also said they would be travelling from Doha to Cairo on Tuesday to finalise the agreement. An Israeli official quoted by the Reuters news agency dismissed the move, describing the proposal that Hamas had accepted as a \u201csoftened\u201d version of an Egyptian proposal, which included \u201cfar-reaching\u201d conclusions that Israel could not accept. \u201cThis would appear to be a ruse intended to make Israel look like the side refusing a deal,\u201d said the Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But other officials who spoke later said while it was \u201cnot the framework Israel proposed\u201d it was being examined as it formulated a formal response. Israel\u2019s options may, however, be narrowing as the west led by the US insisted that an attack on Rafah was not achievable without unacceptable loss of life and long-term damage to Israel\u2019s relations with western and Gulf states. The most direct warning to Israel not to attempt to drive out 1 million displaced Palestinians came from the French foreign ministry, which told the Israeli government it would be committing a war crime under international law if it sought to forcibly displace Palestinian civilians from Rafah. The ministry\u2019s warning followed a call on Sunday evening between Netanyahu and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in which Macron restated his opposition to a full-scale offensive. The Jordanian foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said the international community would be left with an \u201cindelible stain\u201d if it allowed Israel\u2019s threatened attack on Rafah to go ahead. \u201cAnother massacre of the Palestinians is in the making,\u201d he said. \u201cIsrael is warning Palestinians to leave Rafah as it threatens an attack. All must act now to prevent it. Failure to prevent the massacre will be an indelible stain on the international community. Too many massacres have been allowed. Enough.\u201d Egypt, which like Jordan has a peace deal with Israel, called on Israel to \u201cexercise the utmost restraint and avoid further escalation at this extremely sensitive time in the process of ceasefire negotiations, and to spare the blood of Palestinian civilians who have been exposed to an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe since the start of the war on the Gaza Strip.\u201d Saudi Arabia also warned of the dangers of an attack on Rafah \u201cin the light of the lack of safe zones after the massive destruction caused by the Israeli war machine\u201d. European diplomats had seemed unwilling to accept claims that the evacuation order was simply a limited operation to move some displaced Palestinians and so force Hamas to accept the terms Israel was offering on a ceasefire and hostage deal. The EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said on Monday: \u201cIsrael\u2019s evacuation orders to civilians in Rafah portend the worst: more war and famine.\u201d US diplomats including the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, have reiterated that Washington could not support an Israeli attack on Rafah without seeing credible plans to protect the civilian population. It remains to be seen whether the US would be willing to ban arms exports to Israel as an ultimate deterrent. Netanyahu has said he is willing to see Israel isolated internationally in its attempt to secure a final victory against Hamas."

            "content": "Morning everyone. The Israel-Gaza war is at a crucial turning point this morning. Hamas appeared to avert the prospect of an Israeli assault on Rafah when it announced it would accept a ceasefire deal. Israel, however, greeted the announcement with scepticism, and launched targeted strikes in eastern Rafah. We have the latest reports and analysis, and how the crisis is being felt in Australia.

World Gaza \u2018bloodbath\u2019 warning | Hamas says it has accepted a ceasefire proposal in three phases, with the first stage featuring an Israeli-Palestinian prisoner swap. Israel is under huge pressure to accept a ceasefire from western governments led by the US, amid widespread fears that an attack on Rafah could be a \u201cbloodbath\u201d. As thousands of desperate Palestinians earlier streamed out of the city to seek shelter elsewhere, France said Israel would be committing a war crime under international law if it sought to forcibly displace Palestinian civilians.

            "date": "2024-05-24T19:44:35Z",
            "content": "The rising threats against US elections officials are a form of domestic terrorism, the secretary of state in the presidential campaign battleground state of Arizona has said. \u201cTerrorism is defined as a threat of violence for a political outcome,\u201d Adrian Fontes said in remarks recorded for an NBC Meet the Press episode airing on Sunday morning. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is, and \u2026 we do have to address it for what it is.\u201d Fontes\u2019s comments came as he formed part of a Meet the Press panel of top elections officials from states whose voters could decide in November whether Joe Biden serves a second term in the White House or Donald Trump returns to the presidency. The Guardian has reported how Arizona\u2019s most populous county, Maricopa, has taken extraordinary measures to protect its staff and the counting of ballots. Election workers there endure a daily torrent of hateful and menacing messages over email and social media as Trump and his Republican supporters continue to lie that Biden and his Democratic allies fraudulently stole the 2020 presidential race from him. Fontes, a Democrat and retired US marine, told Meet the Press that such abuse was not enough to get him \u201coff of his post\u201d personally. But, he added: \u201cI will say \u2026 it has [affected] not just us but our families as well. \u201cYou know, when you have to tell your neighbors, \u2018Hey, pay attention, if something happens, the kids might have to come over,\u2019 or to have go-bags ready, or to any number of these things so many people across the country have had to suffer through \u2013 that\u2019s a problem,\u201d Fontes said. \u201cOne of the ways that I have been looking at this and addressing this is telling the really hard truth. And that is this: threats against elections officials in the United States of America is domestic terrorism.\u201d The label of domestic terrorism is one that both the political left and right in the US constantly argue over. For instance, federal prosecutors have avoided seeking domestic terrorism sentences for Trump supporters convicted of carrying out the deadly attack on the US Capitol after his defeat to Biden. But agencies laid the groundwork to level domestic terrorism charges against mainly liberal activists protesting against a proposed police training center in Atlanta known as Cop City. Fontes said he was optimistic that the justice department was \u201creally ramping up and starting to prosecute\u201d threats aimed at election officials. Notably, in March, a Massachusetts man who had threatened to blow up Fontes\u2019s office in 2021 was handed three and a half years in prison, marking one of the most severe federal punishments yet handed down for the wave of violent threats against ballot workers driven by Trump\u2019s stolen election lies. Trump\u2019s attempts to subvert the legitimacy of Biden\u2019s victory in 2020 has been at the center of several of the more than 80 state and federal criminal charges pending against him across a total of four indictments in various jurisdictions. \u201cWe\u2019re working with law enforcement across the country to really start to address these things,\u201d Fontes said of election-worker security. \u201cIt\u2019s not too little, too late \u2013 but we do have to address it for what it is.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-22T08:00:07Z",
            "content": "Pakistan\u2019s patriarchal society is a too credible source of horror in this promising feature debut from Canadian-Pakistani writer/director Zarrar Khan, whose gallery of violent, predatory and swindling menfolk represent a living nightmare for its disempowered women. The story firmly grounds itself in everyday Karachi life before drifting into more supernatural realms, which makes it a revealing slice of social realism as much as a horror film. Things are oppressive from the outset for 25-year-old medical student Mariam (Ramesha Nawal); a male stranger throws a brick through her car window, apparently for the offence of being female while driving. But as a result she befriends a relatively decent man: Asad, a student from liberal Canada. Their early romance progresses quickly and chastely (an official admonishes them for sitting too close to each other on a park bench), but just as things are heating up, an unexpected incident sends Mariam into a tailspin of despair, guilt and resurfacing trauma. Her mother Fariha isn\u2019t doing much better; her abusive husband died when Mariam was a child, and now Mariam\u2019s grandfather, the patriarch of the family, has also died. As a woman, Fariha has no property rights of her own, which leaves her at the mercy of Mariam\u2019s oily Uncle Nasir, who suddenly turns up offering help. As Mariam\u2019s plight deepens, the story steadily untethers from reality. She starts hearing strange noises and seeing blank-eyed ghosts of men from her past, loitering ominously from a distance, then getting closer. The borders between fantasy and reality start to blur, and the estranged mother and daughter begin to sense they share a common predicament. That the story never strays into outright genre scares is both a strength and a weakness; the social critique shines through, but the climax of the story feels a little subdued. However Nawal centres the story and holds the screen admirably; conveying emotional subtleties and depths, often without words, and this feels like a glimpse of a world that\u2019s usually hidden. \u2022 In Flames is in UK cinemas from 24 May."

            "date": "2024-05-07T17:55:17Z",
            "content": "Aid agencies in Gaza have less than a day\u2019s fuel for trucks and tankers that deliver vital food, medicine, water and diesel to millions across the territory, threatening an almost complete shutdown of operations including bakeries and hospitals, officials have warned. All main entry points to the south of Gaza are closed and there has been widespread looting of existing stocks in Rafah after aid agencies were forced to leave warehouses unguarded following warnings to evacuate the area from Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) ahead of the military offensive launched on the city on Tuesday morning. \u201cWe are down to less fuel than in a single service station. It\u2019s enough to last a day, basically,\u201d said Georgios Petropoulos, head of the Gaza sub-office of UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian affairs. \u201cAfter that, nothing will be moving, and the hospitals won\u2019t be able to keep going for more than two or three days.\u201d Israeli tanks and special forces took control of the Palestinian side of the border crossing with Egypt in Rafah at dawn on Tuesday after a second night of intense air strikes targeting eastern neighbourhoods of the city. An Israeli government spokesperson said the long-threatened effort to destroy four battalions of Hamas fighters said to be based in Rafah had begun, as exhausted residents described widespread confusion and terror. \u201cWe had a very terrifying night, with intense shelling and heavy airstrikes. My kids were so scared and unable to sleep \u2026 As a believer I am never afraid of death \u2026 but I am more worried about the suffering and fear of my children,\u201d said Said Akram Abed Al Nasser Shaikh, 58, a resident of El Geneina neighbourhood in eastern Rafah. About 1 million people from elsewhere in Gaza are sheltering in Rafah after being forced to flee their homes earlier in the war. Many now living in sprawling tented encampments or overcrowded shelters in schools fear they will be forced to move again, sometimes for the fifth or sixth time, in search of safety if fighting spreads. \u201cWe are very tired as we have moved to eight places since leaving our house at the beginning of this war. Now we will go north to find safety,\u201d said Ghada Lubad, 46, originally from Jabaliya camp. There is no sign that the Rafah crossing will reopen soon. A second major nearby crossing at Kerem Shalom was shut on Sunday after four Israeli soldiers were killed by rockets fired by Hamas and targeted again with a further barrage on Monday. Aid officials said they were expecting prices to rise sharply. Though increased numbers of trucks have reached Gaza in recent weeks, this has not allowed any food to be stockpiled after months of acute shortage. Like many others, Lubad feared the halt in aid reaching Gaza would prompt a spike in prices and shortages of basics such as flour, salt, clean water and medicine. \u201cThis in itself will cause a disaster, as this will lead to high prices and lead to famine,\u201d she said. Witnesses described frightened families leaving Rafah on foot, riding donkeys, pushing trolleys or packed with their belongings into overloaded trucks hours after reading leaflets dropped by the IDF that told residents and displaced people in eastern neighbourhoods to leave. The IDF said they had broadcast instructions through \u201cannouncements, text messages, phone calls and media broadcasts in Arabic\u201d telling residents to head to an \u201cexpanded humanitarian zone\u201d on the coast and around the city of Khan Younis. Aid agencies said they believe around 200 families every hour had left eastern Rafah on Monday, with similar numbers moving on Tuesday. \u201cWe are monitoring displacement going northwards but a major concern is that we don\u2019t have tents. So we are tracking them but \u2026 we are running out of ways to help,\u201d Petropoulos said. Others said they had decided to stay, whatever the risks. Jihad Ahmed, 62, a retired police officer in Rafah, said nowhere in Gaza was safe for his family of nine. \u201cI am very worried as there is no safe place to escape to. I evacuated my family to the centre of Rafah but despite the warnings my son and I stayed at our home for fear that it would be looted.\u201d While some non-fuel supplies have entered Gaza via the northern Erez crossing in recent days, the UN agencies said this was insufficient and difficult to deliver to Rafah since it meant crossing active combat zones. Intense clashes around the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza and near Gaza City have prevented movement of aid convoys in recent days. \u201cErez will simply not be enough,\u201d said James Elder, a spokesperson for the UN children\u2019s agency. \u201cIf Rafah gate closes for an extended period, it\u2019s hard to see how famine in Gaza can be averted,\u201d he said. The UN has repeatedly accused Israel of restricting aid access despite famine warnings. Faced with international pressure, Israel had pledged to improve access but says UN agencies are to blame for not distributing aid more efficiently within the enclave. \u201cWhere there is hunger in Gaza [it] is orchestrated by Hamas \u2026 but we\u2019re getting as much food aid in as possible. If only Hamas would stop throwing mortars and rockets at the crossing points,\u201d an Israeli government spokesperson said on Tuesday. Mahmoud al-Louh, who had fled with is family of six from northern Gaza to western Rafah, was clinging to the hope of a ceasefire. \u201cI am very worried about having to start from scratch again as we have already been displaced five times but then I am also afraid of losing any of my family members if we stay. In the end I am a father and I have to protect my children and wife,\u201d he said. \u201cI just pray for a ceasefire soon so we can go home.\u201d"

            "content": "Two men have appeared in court accused of a machine gun terrorism plot to attack Jewish communities in north-west England, as well as police and military targets. Walid Saadaoui, 36, from Abram near Wigan, and Amar Hussein, 50, of no fixed address, are accused of planning the Islamic State-inspired plot and charged with preparing acts of terrorism. A third man, Bilel Saadaoui, 35, from Hindley near Wigan, brother of Walid, is accused of failing to disclose information about an act of terrorism. All three were arrested last Wednesday and appeared at Westminster magistrates court, which heard the plot involved attempts to obtain machine guns, a hand gun and ammunition, and identifying a safe house where these could be stored. Walid Saadaoui was detained as he went to collect what he believed were the weapons for the attack, the court heard. The prosecutor, Rebecca Waller, told the court: \u201cWalid Saadaoui and Amar Hussein planned to conduct an Isil- or Daesh-inspired terrorist attack in the UK during which they intended causing multiple fatalities using automatic weapons. \u201cThe main targets of their attack plans were the Jewish community in the north-west of England and members of both law enforcement and military. \u201cBoth defendants took significant steps to prepare, and by May 2024, had reached the point at which, they believed, they were in a position to launch their attack.\u201d In court Walid Saadaoui spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address and was remanded in custody. Amar Hussein was unrepresented by legal counsel and when asked if he wanted to apply for bail, refused to look at the judge and answered: \u201cDo whatever you want to.\u201d Bilal Saadaoui was also remanded in custody and sobbed as he was led from the dock. He pleaded not guilty to the charge facing him. The district judge, Louisa Cieci\u00f3ra, said all three men would appear at the Old Bailey on 24 May. A counter-terrorism operation led to the arrests after raids in the Bolton, Abram, Hindley and Great Lever areas of Greater Manchester at about 7.30pm on 8 May. The charges say the alleged plot started no earlier than 13 December 2023 and ran until this month. The UK\u2019s terrorism threat level remains at \u201csubstantial\u201d."

            "content": "Ukraine\u2019s security service (SBU) prevented a terrorist attack that Russia had planned to carry out in Kyiv on 9 May, according to Ukrainian media reports. \u201cThe Security Service of Ukraine was proactive, the perpetrators of the terrorist attack were caught red-handed and arrested,\u201d said Artem Dekhtiarenko, SBU spokesman, who was quoted by Ukrainska Pravda and the Kyiv Post, as well as the BBC Russian service. \u201cWe have also collected evidence that unequivocally confirms Russian involvement.\u201d The SBU said it would provide further details later. A drone attack from Ukraine set an oil refinery on fire in the Volgograd region of southern Russia, the regional governor said on Sunday. The Russian Telegram channel Baza, which is associated with Russia\u2019s security services, posted footage of an industrial building in flames. The reports could not be independently verified and there was no immediate comment from oil producer Lukoil, which owns the refinery, or from Ukraine. The Ukrainian defence force said its 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade shot down a Russian SU-25 warplane near Avdiivka. It is a jet that provides close air support to ground troops, similar to the American A10. Fierce fighting has continued on the fringes of the Kharkiv region in north-east Ukraine. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said its forces had taken the villages of Pletenivka, Ohirtseve, Borysivka, Pylna and Strilecha. Kharkiv\u2019s governor, Oleh Syniehubov, however, said on Saturday that active fighting continued in all five of the frontier villages located within 3km to 5km of the border. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, has visited the border with Belarus and stressed that Poland will do more to strengthen security along its entire eastern frontier. It is also the EU external border with the autocratic state. Tusk accused Belarus, Russia\u2019s ally, of intensifying a \u201chybrid war\u201d against the west by encouraging migrants to try to cross into the EU. \u201cI know that there are more and more illegal crossings every day,\u201d Tusk said, also citing \u201cthe growing threat resulting from the Russian-Ukrainian war, Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine and the uncertain geopolitical situation\u201d. Five people were killed and nine wounded in three separate Ukrainian drone and artillery strikes on the Russian border provinces of Belgorod and Kursk, and the Ukrainian city of Donetsk, which Russia claims to have annexed, local officials said on Saturday. Denis Pushilin, the convicted Ukrainian traitor installed by Russia as head of east Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region, said in a statement posted on the Telegram messaging app that three civilians had been killed and eight more injured when a Ukrainian missile struck a restaurant in Donetsk city. The governor in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said one man was killed and another injured after a Ukrainian drone hit a parked truck in the border village of Novostroyevka-Pervaya. His counterpart in neighbouring Kursk region, Roman Starovoit, said a civilian died in hospital after being wounded in a drone strike on the frontier town of Sudzha. A Moscow-installed official in Ukraine\u2019s Luhansk region said the death toll in a Ukrainian missile strike that caused a large fire with major damage at a fuel depot in the town of Rovenky had risen to four, with 11 injured. In Ukraine\u2019s Sumy oblast bordering Russia, officials said the Russians carried out 21 attacks with mortars, artillery, drones and missiles on communities including Sumy, Khotyn, Yunakiv, Myropil, Bilopol, Krasnopil, Velikopysariv, Esman, Shalygin and Seredino-Bud. In Sumy a woman was killed by a rocket attack. At least 93 explosions were recorded. Vladimir Putin on Saturday gave extra duties to two key government officials who oversee defence and energy. The Russian president proposed extra powers for Denis Manturov, 55, the only first deputy prime minister in the new government of prime minister Mikhail Mishustin. Putin\u2019s energy tsar, Alexander Novak, 52, will remain as a deputy prime minister overseeing energy but will get additional duties for running the economy, according to the government."

            "date": "2024-05-25T13:49:49Z",
            "content": "The former chief scientific adviser to the government Sir Patrick Vallance has said another pandemic is \u201cabsolutely inevitable\u201d and urged the incoming British government to focus on preparing for it, warning \u201cwe are not ready yet\u201d. Speaking at a panel event at the Hay festival in Powys, Vallance said it is \u201cgreat we are having an election\u201d as there are \u201cclearly issues that need to be sorted out\u201d. One of the things the next government must do is implement \u201cbetter surveillance to be able to pick these things up\u201d, he said. He also reiterated what he said to G7 leaders in 2021, that \u201cwe need to be much faster, much more aligned \u2013 and there are ways to do this \u2013 at getting rapid diagnostic tests, rapid vaccines, rapid treatments, so that you don\u2019t have to go into the extreme measures that took place\u201d during the Covid-19 pandemic. The measures he recommends are possible to implement, Vallance believes, but \u201crequire some coordination\u201d. He said that by 2023 the G7 had \u201csort of forgotten\u201d about the points he had made in 2021. \u201cYou can\u2019t forget about it,\u201d he urged, recommending that pandemic preparations are treated similarly to the armed forces. \u201cWe know we have to have an army, not because there\u2019s going to be a war this year, but we know it\u2019s an important part of what we need as a nation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to treat this preparedness in the same way and not to view it as an easy thing to keep cutting back when there\u2019s no sign of a pandemic \u2013 because there won\u2019t be a sign of a pandemic.\u201d He mentioned the World Health Organization\u2019s push for the pandemic accord, a proposed agreement for countries to work together to prepare for pandemics, as one of the \u201csteps in the right direction\u201d that are being taken. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough focus,\u201d he said. If this issue gets pushed off G7 and G20 agendas, \u201cwe\u2019ll be in exactly the same position, and I hope that\u2019s an important outcome of the inquiry\u201d. That said, he said there are issues with the speed and efficiency of how inquiries are conducted, and said we have \u201cgot to work out a better way\u201d of doing them. Though Vallance thinks it is about time there was an election, he did praise the outgoing government\u2019s anti-smoking bill, and said he is disappointed it won\u2019t go through before the election. \u201cI think that needs to be picked up rapidly afterwards.\u201d Asked whether protesters should have been allowed to play Things Can Only Get Better during Rishi Sunak\u2019s speech outside 10 Downing Street on Wednesday, he said he thinks such protests are \u201cpart of our democracy\u201d and that Sunak and his team\u2019s decision not to find a location for the speech where he could have been heard \u201cis a sign of incompetence\u201d. \u201cThe chaos of that event was emblematic,\u201d he said. However, he does believe certain acts of protest cross a line. Vallance is the chair of the Natural History Museum and said he thinks an incident when paint was thrown over an exhibition was \u201cwrong\u201d, and had the Just Stop Oil protesters managed to damage Magna Carta earlier this month, that would have been wrong too."

            "date": "2024-05-21T06:00:33Z",
            "content": "During the pandemic I did not reduce my monthly payments for childcare vouchers. As a result I have nearly \u00a32,800 in my tax-free childcare account. I now work remotely and don\u2019t need them but have been told I can\u2019t get a refund. I was paying the maximum \u00a3243 a month via salary sacrifice into my KiddiVouchers account. This worked until Covid hit but my employer has switched to permanent home working so I no longer need wraparound childcare. I explained my change in circumstances to [the scheme provider] and requested they refund my employer so it could be repaid (after tax and national insurance) to me. My employer is happy to do this. However, KiddiVouchers has refused because it \u201cdoes not meet the exceptional or unforeseen threshold for a refund\u201d. I can\u2019t believe that the pandemic is not considered \u201cexceptional or unforeseen\u201d. There are some holiday clubs and courses that accept vouchers, but given we could really do with the money, it doesn\u2019t make sense to be considering expensive residential holiday clubs to use them up. DO, East Lothian Childcare voucher schemes such as this \u2013 which closed to new entrants in 2018 making way for the tax-free childcare scheme \u2013 are a staff benefit offered by many companies, including the Guardian. The employer pays for the vouchers out of your gross wages so you don\u2019t pay tax and national insurance (NI) on the amount, saving a working parent roughly \u00a31,000 a year. Numerous companies run these schemes and, based on parenting forums, some are more willing than others to process a refund. However, the terms and conditions of KiddiVouchers, which is run by Wider Plan, state vouchers are non-refundable and requests are only granted in \u201cunforeseen and exceptional circumstances preventing the future use of the vouchers\u201d. After being refused a refund, NM, a company secretary and trained solicitor with \u00a34,200 in her account, pursued Wider Plan via the small claims process. The claim, which was heard in March, was dismissed, with the judge stating it was a \u201crisk\u201d to run up such a big balance but also that the company must exercise its discretion reasonably. It took a year to reach court and during mediation NM rejected a 50% refund. However, she believes the decision has provided a better base for other claims to be brought against Wider Plan and if you wish to consider this route you can request a transcript of the judgment to form your own conclusion. Wider Plan, which did not respond to a request for comment on your case, reminds you that the vouchers are valid until 1 September after your youngest child\u2019s 15th birthday (at present your daughters are 11 and 12) and can be spent on clubs and activities, with PGL adventure holidays a popular choice. They can also pay for tuition or online courses. You would be taxed on any refund so why not make the best of the help or experiences these vouchers could buy your children?

            "title": "WHO accuses Nigel Farage of spreading misinformation about pandemic treaty",
            "date": "2024-05-16T05:00:59Z",
            "content": "The World Health Organization has accused Nigel Farage of spreading misinformation after he launched a campaign to block an international treaty designed to improve global pandemic preparedness. WHO member states are negotiating a deal to shore up cooperation against new pathogens. If adopted, the legally binding treaty would commit countries to helping each other in the event of a pandemic, increase research and sharing of data, and promote fair access to vaccines. But populist figures including Farage and a number of Tory MPs are lobbying the UK government to block the deal, claiming that it will give the WHO power to enforce lockdowns on countries, dictate policy on mask wearing and control vaccine stocks. Farage is fronting the campaign group Action on World Health (AWH), which was registered on Companies House last week. The AWH\u2019s website lists supporters including the Tory MPs Henry Smith, Philip Davies and David Jones, as well as peers and others. Companies House filings show that it has three directors including the barrister Paul Diamond, whose work has included high-profile cases on behalf of socially conservative Christians and cases where the use of vaccines has been disputed. Visitors to the AWH\u2019s site are helped to locate and lobby their MP using template \u201csuggested text\u201d emails that claim the WHO treaty will \u201cstrip away\u201d the UK\u2019s decision-making powers. The potency of what some on the right view as a potential new \u201cwedge issue\u201d was underlined in contributions by Tory backbenchers such as Philip Hollobone, who echoed populist language by describing the WHO as being under the influence of \u201cthe global elite\u201d and urging against the UK backing the treaty. The UK health minister Andrew Stephenson urged MPs in parliament this week to dismiss what he described as myths being spread about the treaty, which the UK is considering whether or not to support. Lockdown mandates are not part of the deal and a claim by Farage that the treaty would require countries to give away 20% of their vaccines was \u201csimply not true\u201d, said Stephenson. His comments were echoed by the WHO directly. Responding to AWH\u2019s claims, a spokesperson said a draft of the treaty reaffirmed \u201cthe principle of sovereignty\u201d of member states. \u201cClaims that the draft agreement will cede sovereignty to WHO and will give the WHO secretariat power to impose lockdowns or vaccine mandates on countries are false and have never been requested nor proposed. This agreement will not, and cannot, grant sovereignty to WHO.\u201d Farage, who denies that the campaign is sharing misinformation, claimed the UK government was \u201crunning scared\u201d and that Conservative MPs had \u201csuddenly been shouting\u201d about the treaty on Wednesday. \u201cThe governing party are very scared of me and of anything that would look like a surrender of sovereignty after Brexit. I\u2019m trying to bring to the public\u2019s attention something that is not being debated \u2013 that\u2019s what I have done throughout my career \u2013 and I think we are getting traction already,\u201d he said. \u201cThis may not be a campaign with mass populist appeal but we can influence the government\u2019s position when they get to Geneva in a couple of weeks time. European ambassadors who met at the WHO headquarters in Geneva on Wednesday are understood to have voiced concern about misinformation of the type that the AWH has been accused of promoting. A leading WHO envoy who was the face of the body in the UK during the pandemic said that he feared public health workers and policymakers were having to work in an increasingly difficult environment. \u201cWe are being identified with particular behaviours as public health types and of doing things that we are not actually doing. It means that I fear that people who work in public health have become almost a despised community by certain groups and various organisations,\u201d said David Nabarro, co-director and chair of global health at Imperial College London\u2019s Institute of Global Health Innovation. Nabarro said: \u201cWhat we are trying to do above all is to help people to avoid death and to avoid misery. There\u2019s no effort by any of us to go for any kind of the political action we are being accused of and yet we do seem to have become seriously disliked.\u201d Other online campaigns targeting the WHO are already under way in the UK. Two of them \u2013 Say No To WHO and Save My Vape \u2013 are linked to an anti-EU pressure group run by Brian Monteith, a PR consultant and former Brexit party politician. Negotiators from the WHO\u2019s 194 member states had hoped to have a final draft agreement by Friday, with a view toward adopting the legally binding text at the World Health Assembly later this month."

            "title": "What is the pandemic accord and why have negotiations been so difficult? ",
            "date": "2024-05-23T16:01:45Z",
            "content": "Global health leaders will gather in Geneva on 27 May at the annual World Health Assembly, where a new agreement for countries to work together to prepare for, prevent, and respond to pandemics \u2013 known as the \u201cpandemic accord\u201d \u2013 will top the agenda. It was first proposed by world leaders in early 2021, with a promise to avoid the mistakes of the Covid-19 pandemic next time around. The negotiating process, involving almost 200 countries, has proved challenging, and the plan has been subject to what the World Health Organization\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called \u201ca torrent of fake news, lies and conspiracy theories\u201d. Talks are likely to go down to the wire, and a finished text may not be ready by the assembly deadline. But those involved say this is an opportunity to make the world safer \u2013 and fairer \u2013 that humanity cannot afford to miss. What is the idea behind the accord? The Covid-19 pandemic had a devastating impact globally. About 7 million deaths have been attributed directly to the virus, but indirect deaths are thought to be at least double that. The disruption caused by the virus saw poverty and hunger increase. Health systems were no longer able to reliably provide the regular care people needed, and people living in poorer countries were often the hardest hit. The promise of the accord was to make sure that the world was better prepared for, and protected from, future pandemics \u2013 with equitable access to the tools needed to stop potential pandemic outbreaks in their tracks, as well as vaccines and treatments. Announcing the plans, world leaders said a treaty would be \u201cour legacy that protects our children and grandchildren\u201d and promised to \u201cbe guided by solidarity, fairness, transparency, inclusiveness and equity\u201d. Has it worked out that way? Many campaigners have expressed disappointment as details of the negotiations have emerged. This month, Global Justice Now accused rich countries of \u201crefusing to learn the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d and of blocking moves to take on the vested interests of big pharma companies. Others have questioned the need for a treaty at all, suggesting that it will not necessarily solve the problems that appeared during the Covid pandemic, with countries likely to ignore any elements of a treaty they disagree with during an emergency. Dr Precious Matsoso from South Africa, the co-chair of the intergovernmental negotiating body overseeing the talks, said that progress was being made and promised \u201ca meaningful, lasting agreement\u201d. And there is a sense it needs to be seen through. Michel Kazatchkine, a former member of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, said: \u201cIt is worthwhile, because it is providing a foundation. It\u2019s highly unlikely that it will answer all of the challenges that are on the plate \u2013 but I think a failure would be really terrible for the multilateral system, for the world of solidarity that we all want to see in the future, for WHO, for the United Nations system. So we need to work very hard until the last minute to get something.\u201d What stage are negotiations at? This week, negotiators have been meeting nearly every day from 9am to 9pm in a bid to finish negotiations in time for the assembly. It follows multiple negotiating sessions that have seen draft texts put forward and pulled apart. The latest publicly available draft suggests there has been agreement in many areas, including around the need for countries to \u201cstrengthen science, public health and pandemic literacy in the population\u201d. It includes plans to establish a \u201cconference of the parties (Cop)\u201d to regularly review the agreement\u2019s implementation, and promises of additional financial resources for lower-income countries. But there are still areas with real sticking points, including the issue of \u201cpathogen access and benefit sharing\u201d. If poorer countries grant richer nations \u2013 and their big pharmaceutical companies \u2013 access to materials and information on pathogens that could become a pandemic, can those poorer countries be guaranteed access to any resulting vaccines and medicines? More recent drafts of the accord have suggested such a system could be agreed in principle, but details have been pushed back for later discussion. It is not yet clear whether the accord will be a treaty \u2013 giving it greater force in international law \u2013 or a regulation. Does the accord take away countries\u2019 sovereignty? The accord has been the subject of vast amounts of misinformation and disinformation, including false claims that the agreement would give the WHO the power to impose lockdowns, or require countries to give away a fifth of their vaccines. A WHO spokesperson responded to recent similar claims by the UK\u2019s Nigel Farage by saying such claims were \u201cfalse and have never been requested nor proposed. This agreement will not, and cannot, grant sovereignty to WHO.\u201d But in many countries, the discussion has become politicised and concerns about sovereignty have hit mainstream politics. This month, the UK health minister, Andrew Stephenson, told the Commons that the current text was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d to the UK government, stressing that \u201cprotecting our sovereignty is a British red line\u201d. In New Zealand, too, negotiators have been told to prioritise sovereignty. The draft text of the agreement reaffirms \u201cthe principle of the sovereignty of states in addressing public health matters\u201d and recognises \u201cthe sovereign right of states over their biological resources\u201d."

            "date": "2024-05-29T09:30:16Z",
            "content": "Global health leaders have said an international treaty governing how the world should deal with future pandemics may not be agreed for another year or more. After two years of negotiations, countries failed to agree on the text of an international pandemic accord by a deadline of 24 May. And at the World Health Assembly in Geneva on Tuesday delegates said extensive further negotiations would be needed. The accord contains a series of measures setting out how the world should prevent, prepare for and respond to pandemics. Setting out plans for a pandemic treaty in early 2021, world leaders described it as a legacy to protect their children and grandchildren. The former chief scientific adviser to the government Sir Patrick Vallance is among those who have warned of the threat of another pandemic, saying earlier this month that it was \u201cabsolutely inevitable\u201d. During a debate, some countries \u2013 including many African nations \u2013 urged efforts to conclude the treaty negotiation process before the end of 2024, in order not to lose momentum. Others, including the US, EU and Caribbean countries such as Jamaica, called for at least another year so that thorny issues could be properly addressed. While member states had reached agreement on many areas, serious disagreements remain, including on finance; how much product pharmaceutical companies should be required to set aside for those countries most in need; intellectual property rights and sanctions. One leading issue has been on what access to drugs and treatments developing countries can expect in return for their efforts monitoring and sharing information on pathogens found in their territories. The negotiations have also been the subject of widespread misinformation campaigns, with false claims that the treaty represents a power grab by the World Health Organization, giving them the ability to impose lockdowns on countries. A large blue bus was seen driving around Geneva urging people to \u201csay no to the pandemic treaty\u201d. Earlier on Tuesday, Roland Driece, who had been the co-chair of the intergovernmental negotiating body, told a panel discussion on the treaty that the issues still to be resolved were \u201creally politically sensitive and difficult\u201d, and suggested more than a few months of additional negotiation would be needed. Driece warned there was a risk of a sense of urgency slipping as time got further from the pandemic and other international issues came to the fore, but said: \u201cWe all have to realise we started with nothing. We started with a blank piece of paper.\u201d He said all the necessary elements were on the table \u201cif countries want to work with them\u201d. Parallel negotiations on how to amend International Health Regulations (IHR) from 2005 to strengthen health systems facing pandemics are thought to be closer to an agreement, and many countries are pushing for a final decision on amendments to be reached this week. In a statement on Tuesday night, the WHO said work would continue until the end of the assembly on 1 June to complete the package of amendments to the IHR, and agree the timing, format and process to conclude the pandemic agreement. Michel Kazatchkine, a former member of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, said: \u201cThe good news is that all countries want to continue. But we cannot wait for the accord to be agreed to accelerate pandemic preparedness at country and regional levels. Hopefully, important amendments to the IHR will be adopted at the end of the week.\u201d"
